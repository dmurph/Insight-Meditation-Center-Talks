1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,879
so good morning everyone good day

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,920
and uh welcome to this meditation and your meditation

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,400
where you have the opportunity to meditate

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:28,800
both to both with yourself and with a large community

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:38,399
and the large community is meant to support us so that we are more inspired more content

6
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,200
to really sit here in our own direct experience knowing that there's a wide field of

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,480
support of mutuality of companionship

8
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,680
on this path and that you're not alone

9
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:04,158
but and no and knowing you're not alone the willingness

10
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:11,840
to put everything else aside the best you can to be right here not so much with

11
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,520
yourself but with the experience that's immediate

12
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,600
and current and i love the word current because it

13
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:31,200
means both in the present moment and the current of a stream a river and so here we are in the

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,320
current of time in that little window of it that's always moving

15
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:43,119
always changing always flowing that we call the present moment

16
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,399
so to

17
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,520
assume a meditation posture

18
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,479
and close your eyes and to give some

19
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:14,879
nice attention to the body to adjust the posture

20
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,400
it could be large adjustments small adjustments

21
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:28,560
just kind of get everything as best you can lined up in harmony enough to what's available to

22
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,920
you and your body to support being here

23
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,720
in the current of the present moment through the experience of the body

24
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:50,080
your body is always in the present moment your mind in a sense

25
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,120
seemingly wonders off in thoughts about the past and

26
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,120
future and fantasy and in a sense is not so then grounded

27
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:10,080
here in the present moment and so here to bring the mind

28
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:18,159
into harmony with a body with your capacity for attention

29
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:24,319
with awareness not so much awareness brought to the

30
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:33,840
body but allowing for the awareness which is in the body

31
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:46,640
and then within this body taking a few long slow deep breaths

32
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,000
to begin attuning yourself to the rhythm

33
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,840
of breathing the coming and goings of the in-breaths the comings and goings of

34
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,079
the out-breaths that here this body breathing

35
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,480
is where you'll be centered

36
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,799
and as you exhale relaxing your body

37
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:24,000
is a way to continue to center yourself here

38
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,840
now

39
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:43,440
letting your breathing return to normal

40
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,680
and from the inside of the body

41
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:57,440
noticing where there's tension and holding in your body

42
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:05,360
almost as if you're you discover the awareness that's inside the tension

43
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:15,520
and gently as you exhale to continue relaxing the body

44
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:25,680
relaxing the belly

45
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,160
the more relaxed the belly is the more it's part of the river of

46
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:39,600
change with no sensations frozen in time

47
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,240
the sensations of the belly just move and

48
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,880
appear and disappear flow by making room for the next one

49
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,840
relaxing the shoulders maybe a deep relaxation of the shoulders

50
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:20,080
the top of the shoulders shoulder joint down the arm

51
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:27,440
and feeling the vitality the pulse of life the energies that are

52
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:35,840
a little bit freed up when the muscles are not so held tight

53
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,840
and relaxing the muscles of the face

54
00:06:52,080 --> 00:07:00,840
as if the face could sit back in an easy chair and just take a break

55
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,840
rest

56
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,479
and then within this body as part of this body

57
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:31,840
become aware of how the body experiences breathing

58
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:45,840
breathing in and breathing out

59
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:27,840
and to bring a little more careful attention to the breathing so the awareness is more continuous

60
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,560
with each inhale and each exhale

61
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:47,120
stay stay stay right there with the whole length of the inhale

62
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:55,839
and notice how the sensations that come into play are changing during that length of time

63
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:10,880
stay with the full length of the exhale notice how there are changes in the

64
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:23,839
sensations connected to exhaling

65
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,839
and not that you're leaning into it or staring at your breathing the more

66
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:43,120
you're settling back and opening allowing receiving

67
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:52,080
the full length of the inhale the full length of the exhale it's the receiving of all the changes

68
00:09:52,080 --> 00:10:05,839
that come into play as you breathe

69
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,839
and then notice

70
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:27,200
the path that some sensations pass away

71
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,760
the sensations of inhale come to an end

72
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:42,959
as we begin to exhale some of the sensations within and inhale

73
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:49,279
pass away come to an end before the end of the inhale

74
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:58,839
just settle back and without trying too much or straining just receiving

75
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:06,480
appreciate the help how sensations pass away

76
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:15,680
and if they don't don't worry about it just notice the ones that do pass that are no longer here

77
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,760
they might return but just noticing noticing their passing

78
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:29,839
or noticing that they're now gone

79
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,839
so

80
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,959
without thinking or reflecting on it you can also open your awareness more

81
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:38,480
widely to be aware of any sensation

82
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,880
in how it passes notice what comes to an end

83
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:56,240
passes away and maybe it starts again but just noticing the passing of it

84
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:03,200
or notice the passing of our attention on it this week attention is on one thing and

85
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,839
then it pulls to something else

86
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,760
i appreciate all that is passing away

87
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,839
coming to an end

88
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:55,600
as you notice that things are in the process of passing away

89
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,840
whereas you notice they have passed away

90
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:07,679
appreciate that then at that moment those moments

91
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:13,039
it doesn't make sense to cling to anything to depend on something which is fading

92
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,799
away which is gone and see if you can appreciate that

93
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:26,000
openness that non-clinging to it

94
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,760
the freedom and space that that provides

95
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:47,679
that in and of itself when things pass away in the passing

96
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:58,320
there can be a feeling of freedom spaciousness peacefulness

97
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,840
in and of itself settle back into the flow of present

98
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,919
moment experience appreciating all the things that are

99
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:18,640
passing sounds sensations thoughts

100
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:25,840
anything that changes is also there's part of it that's passing away

101
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:46,960
chances are the thoughts that you had at the beginning are not the same thoughts you have now

102
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:53,440
those thoughts have passed away some of the sensations of your body that

103
00:23:53,440 --> 00:24:02,840
were current at the beginning of the meditation may no longer be current something else

104
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:09,279
is what you were feeling has maybe changed

105
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:19,840
it's no longer here

106
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:38,640
appreciate the absence that's left behind

107
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,240
when something disappears or

108
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,840
no longer present

109
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:57,278
don't be a hurry to feel the absence appreciate

110
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,880
the openness the spaciousness the freedom that comes

111
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:11,278
when there's nothing there to cling to to hold on to or to resist

112
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,840
because it's no longer present

113
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:04,480
and as we come to the end of the sitting if you have some sense some feeling for

114
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:10,559
the openness or freedom that comes when something passes away

115
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:17,840
and how it doesn't make sense to cling to something which has passed away in the process of

116
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:25,120
passing away will pass away and even if it's inconstant it comes and

117
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:31,760
goes and comes and goes it's going can teach

118
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:38,480
us the value of not holding on

119
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:48,159
not expecting demanding wanting but allow it to pass

120
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:55,600
and to remain open and free

121
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:03,200
for the next thing to arise

122
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,080
and if the next thing to arise is another person

123
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:15,360
as you go through your day and you meet a person you communicate

124
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,159
with a person you think of a person

125
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,158
to become aware of that person in that

126
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:38,960
way of the way of non-attachment the way of openness receptivity

127
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,559
the freedom that can come when we don't cling

128
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:50,799
to what is passed away and then maybe we don't cling to what

129
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:56,480
arises we stay open

130
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:06,000
non-clinging non-contentious without need or demand

131
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:17,679
and this can become our gift to others that we receive them and know them

132
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:23,440
without the filter of our attachments and our demands

133
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:29,520
expectations bias prejudice

134
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,679
that in the freedom that we learn

135
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:43,278
we meet people with an openness a peacefulness

136
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:52,320
and maybe this is one of the gifts that we can offer the world

137
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:59,039
from our meditation practice because may it be that our meditation

138
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:05,440
practice not only benefits ourselves

139
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:11,039
it benefits others maybe at some point it's even more

140
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:16,240
valuable for us to meditate when we know we do it

141
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:23,039
for the welfare and happiness of others

142
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,640
what a gift to be attentive and aware and present for

143
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:37,840
others without any filters of attachment

144
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:43,440
may all beings be happy

145
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:50,480
may all beings be safe

146
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:58,080
may all beings be peaceful

147
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:05,840
and may all beings everywhere be free

148
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:27,679
so we're still lingering in the 13th step of

149
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:33,320
mindfulness of breathing that of observing

150
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:39,919
inconstancy and that there's something about inconstancy and observing it that leads

151
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:45,679
to the 14th step which is usually translated

152
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:52,159
into english as dispassion when we'll get to the meanings of it

153
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:58,320
maybe tomorrow but soon but there's something about seeing

154
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:05,360
impermanence that is onward leading seeing in constancy which opens

155
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:12,240
something up that allows something to unfold and deepen or move along and the very common

156
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:19,840
uh term in the buddhist scriptures is the idea of the dharma is onward leading and it's

157
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:26,000
armored onward leading to greater and greater freedom and one of the things that's very much

158
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,760
so a part of this onward leading nature is this settling back resting in

159
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:37,360
awareness in a sense and becoming more and more aware of the

160
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:43,840
transiency of experience the inconstancy of experience sometimes it's called impermanence but

161
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:50,000
as i've said that's going to imply for some people only means that sooner or later something will no

162
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,480
longer exist it'll die or be gone forever and well there's wisdom to that

163
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:03,440
understanding for sure and it can be freeing in itself in a certain way the core insight of the

164
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:10,800
buddha has more to do with the momentary and constancy of things that everything is kind of part of like

165
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,320
it's he didn't say this but it's like the inconstant waves or ripples

166
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,240
on um on a river that flows by and the little wavelets come in and go they

167
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:27,760
exist and don't exist and and um and they're in constant they're constantly being reborn

168
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:35,520
constantly passing away and so many of our sensations are coming and going coming and going

169
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,520
sometimes they stay longer than we wish but uh sooner or later they pass and

170
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:47,040
maybe come back again but to really settle in and really start

171
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:54,960
seeing more and more precisely or intimately uh closely how much of our experience is

172
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:03,359
it's a flowing experience the changing sensations is a things are peering and disappearing

173
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:10,320
sometimes in rapid succession or sometimes it can just feel like everything is just

174
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,359
flowing sand and the reason for flowing sand rather

175
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:21,760
than water as some people say is that sand is a little bit more like particular so it's a little bit more

176
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,599
particular sensations that have some kind of clarity to them whereas

177
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:33,680
water flows but there's no sense of a particularity to each molecule of water

178
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:40,240
whereas then there's a particularity or some people it feels like snow just everything is just like snow you

179
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:46,400
know or raindrops but the flowing sand and

180
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:52,800
everything and just really settling back and getting very still and then appreciating how everything is

181
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:59,520
arising and passing this was a very significant insight for the buddha was like his

182
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:06,400
in the ways described in some texts is like this was his big aha moment this is what he in seeing this he

183
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:13,599
realized this is the path to liberation with seeing this arising and passing the inconstancy

184
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,640
there was light there was wisdom there was clarity there was

185
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:24,640
the path opened for the buddha but in particular what was particularly both seeing

186
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:30,000
arising was very important for him but seeing the passing was very important as well

187
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,320
and it seems like the passing and the ceasing of things was even more important than seeing their arising

188
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:43,440
i know exactly you know i'm not sure but one reason is that when we know that things pass even if

189
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:49,280
they're in constant they come back we know that they're not permanent

190
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:56,480
we know that it's not always that way and uh and uh and that frees us from the

191
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,520
mind that it's that kind of unconsciously or subconsciously we relate to things

192
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,640
as if they're always going to be there and um as opposed to relating to them as being

193
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:14,000
oh this is just part of the flavor of the moment this is what's coming here now and in due time it'll pass and in fact

194
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,280
if i replay really careful attention to the particularity of the moment it's already

195
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:26,000
passing and then arising passing and arising and so knowing that it's not constant so

196
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,520
that's very helpful with things like suffering if we think that suffering is

197
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,359
durable stuck solid unchanging then it's very hard to get in

198
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:42,800
this like concrete it's very hard to get in there and try to do anything with it but we see it

199
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:50,640
as more as flowing sand or flowing water then you know you try to reach into

200
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:56,000
water and hold on to it grab a fistful of it it just disappears

201
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,200
through your fingers very quickly and um and so we realized suffering

202
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:07,680
doesn't have that solidity we thought before self all the things we think of as this

203
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:14,800
myself or we identify strongly as being this is who i am to to really see that it also has a

204
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:22,079
certain way a certain way of inconstancy that it comes and goes the sensations the

205
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:28,720
experience the thing the role the ideas the feelings the intuitions the

206
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:34,800
whatever it might be that we think is it this is myself we start seeing that too as part of this

207
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:43,760
flow and current of a river and we can't quite hold on to it and so there's these gaps

208
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:50,880
in the arising and passing there's this moment of freedom and the passing begins to teach us not

209
00:38:50,880 --> 00:39:01,200
to cling not to grasp and we start seeing it's simply not worth grasping it's um and this is a powerful

210
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:08,880
insight that comes uh many many times in life all kinds of ways but in deeper and deeper meditation

211
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:16,160
there's a sense of well-being or freedom and openness lack of clinging that's so palpable

212
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:22,400
that we begin feeling that any movement to contract any movement to resist any movement to

213
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:29,280
hold on tight or to linger and be involved with

214
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,320
something that's going on um is a loss of some of the peace

215
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:41,119
we're actually better off in the freedom we're better off in this deep subtle quiet peacefulness and in that

216
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:46,400
we can learn it's not worth clinging we lose something in the contracting

217
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,839
we lose something in the resisting and it isn't that we are told you know

218
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:57,200
it's a good buddhist you should let go of clinging it's more like there's no

219
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:04,480
admonition like that it's more like pay careful attention become quiet and when you notice for

220
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:12,079
yourself that you're worse off clinging then don't cling and one of the lessons for

221
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:17,680
this that helps this is when we realize in certain deep states of meditation

222
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:23,680
that clinging doesn't work at all because whatever it is we're clinging to is also

223
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:30,160
constantly passing away constantly passing away and whether you don't have to be in that constant

224
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:36,079
passing away place in meditation to begin appreciating how much does pass away

225
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:42,319
and how in the passing away it is possible to tune into a kind of

226
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:49,440
peacefulness a freedom a spaciousness an openness that that kind of allows or makes room

227
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,880
for permits if we don't cling to the next thing that comes up

228
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:01,920
kind of allow it to pass and in the space that it leaves behind in a sense

229
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:08,560
just be open there be relaxed there take that in the next thing will

230
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:15,599
something else will arise but rather than being you know preoccupied by it or caught by it or

231
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:21,839
analyzing it or reflecting on or doing things with it allow the next thing to arise to rise in

232
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:28,319
that space in that openness in that field of awareness that just lets it comes and

233
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:34,000
goes and and in the process of doing that we

234
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,079
learn more and more about letting go we learn more and more

235
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:49,839
we're not holding on to anything and and

236
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,160
i need to charge my battery

237
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:04,960
and so because batteries also pass away and it's probably good

238
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,680
for the next couple of minutes to keep it going

239
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:16,880
so the um

240
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:23,839
and so uh this teaching on not-self that is often perplexing for people

241
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:32,000
is a teaching that makes more more sense when we understand that nothing qualifies as an enduring self

242
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,640
there's nothing that we can find inside of ourselves or in direct experience then we're really intimate and close to

243
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:46,319
direct experience not that that qualifies as oh that's myself because it passes as well and the idea

244
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:51,920
being that anything that passes cannot be an enduring self and

245
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:58,079
any theory any um for the buddha's point of view any doctrine of self any theory about

246
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:05,599
what the self is uh lends itself to a kind of reification a kind of solidification on what to self

247
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:12,400
that's not possible when it's things are constantly changing it's kind of like there's no place to

248
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:20,720
hang your hat there's no place to tack with thumbtack no place to attack

249
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:26,560
any philosophy idea concept theory about what the self is uh you know it's

250
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,599
like taking a thumbtack and trying to stick it into a river and have it gets you know stuck it doesn't stick

251
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:38,400
anywhere so any theory about self just doesn't quite stick doesn't quite work when this

252
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:45,440
constantly flowing in constant nature of experience that begins to open up in deep vipassana

253
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,880
practice so this the core deepest kind of

254
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:57,359
important insight of inside meditation is this inconstancy of phenomena the

255
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:04,000
changing nature the current of of uh phenomena as it flows through and arises and passes

256
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,240
here in the present moment so to settle back and observe that and

257
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:19,280
this 13th step is what's talked about and as we do that we begin feeling that the things that we

258
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:25,200
cling to have passionate lust for passionate

259
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:30,960
hatred for that all that kind of um

260
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:40,400
the ways in which we're driven or about things passionate around our attachments

261
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:49,040
just doesn't make any sense as well and it stops losing its allure it stops losing its enchantment we start

262
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:54,400
stop falling under its spell and then we begin observing

263
00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:00,800
that we're less and less interested in clinging less and less interested in

264
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:06,560
lust and hatred and you know this driven driven attached kind of passion that can

265
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:12,640
happen like the passion for money or the passion for power or kind of the negative understandings

266
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:19,599
of passion and so then the 14th step is observing this dispassion

267
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:26,640
so um so then it will end and this will pass

268
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:34,240
as well and we'll make room for the next thing to happen and and chances are

269
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:46,720
it's simply inconstant and we'll meet again here tomorrow at the same time thank you
