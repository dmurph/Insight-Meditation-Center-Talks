compassion and then um once we've once we've really spent some

16
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:53,680
time cultivating compassion we'll take a look at just what is the quality of the

17
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,960
mind when it is uh arousing compassion sustaining

18
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:06,159
compassion when it's suffused or filled with compassion what are the qualities that are

19
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,440
there let's start with the

20
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,760
settling

21
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:41,599
May our posture be balanced and

22
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,920
grounded connected to the

23
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,319
Earth of the

24
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,760
Earth

25
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:15,239
man with each breath coming into coming into

26
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,159
balance alignment and

27
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,680
presence

28
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,680
a few minutes to

29
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,240
settle to be with the

30
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
senses

31
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,520
and when we're

32
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,280
ready inclining the Mind toward

33
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,000
compassion arousing compassion in the

34
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,440
body taking that

35
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,720
attitude perhaps with the help of an image or a

36
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:01,319
reflection may we be free from suffering and harm

37
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
from

38
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,760
may we be free from the

39
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
suffering

40
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:06,200
Red Line On Our intention the wish that others be free

41
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,640
that we be free from

42
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
suffering

43
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:50,800
rousing the wish that beings be free from

44
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:02,759
suffering sensitive to the effect this has on our body and

45
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:15,199
mind inviting compassion throughout the

46
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,720
body this kind

47
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:32,040

arousing compassion sustaining

50
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,799
compassion this body and mind becoming

51
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:36,039
compassion now to bring in the question just how is this compassionate

52
00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:48,320
mind bring in just a little bit of

53
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:55,480
Investigation not to interfere with our practice of

54
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,120
compassion but to come to know it

55
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:11,039
is this compassionate mind clearly

56
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,919
mindful how is it

57
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
energy

58
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:42,200
is there Joy even

59
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:04,559
Joy or is there a calm

60
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,600
balance

61
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:15,679
settledness just how is this compassionate

62
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
mind

63
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:56,679
just how is this compassionate mind what qualities are

64
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
here

65
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:01,679
now as we come to the end of this

66
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:09,919
sitting inviting ease and relaxation into this

67
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:16,200
body with a wish for the welfare of all

68
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:23,080
beings as we hear the sound of the

69
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,880
Bell May our in I of compassion go along with the

70
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:37,600
sound spreading in all directions may all beings be

71
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,278
happy and may they be free from

72
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
suffering

73
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:56,960
hello again welcome good moment good morning good

74
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:03,278
day it's our fifth day on the topic of

75
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:10,320
compassion and I'd like to talk a a little bit about compassion and

76
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:20,360
Awakening gosh my curiosity is so strong I wonder how it's been for you to um see

77
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:25,639
and practice bringing com compassion

78
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:33,440
into into your worlds each of our worlds how has that

79
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,639
been I wonder if there have been any moments in your in your week that stand

80
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:44,919
out to you when you're when you're bringing this attitude of kindness into

81
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:49,960
your words and your thoughts and your Deeds anyway my curiosity is strong as

82
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:57,559
we get started we we've talked a lot about how the the

83
00:31:57,559 --> 00:32:04,440
Practical scope of compassion is this meta loving kindness

84
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:11,200
that can be expressed in all of our actions and this is inspiring in part

85
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:17,000
because it means it means that our compassion can be

86
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:23,600
expressed uh through our conduct and that we can bring our wisdom

87
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,919
our wisdom to recognize what we need to

88
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:37,279
recognize what others need and to in one way of speaking uh live

89
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,880
beautifully so to say something about compassion and Awakening will move the scope just a little

90
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:53,080
bit from the expression in daily life to

91
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:59,039
meditation so

92
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:09,760
one of the things that makes compassion and the other Brahma viharas loving kindness sympathetic joy and

93
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,880
equinity such powerful meditation practices is they have this they have

94
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:23,279
this natural uh natural way that they can undermine some of the challenges that

95
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:30,240
come uh with some other focuses of meditation practice um I know for for some people it's

96
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:36,320
possible when say we're focusing on the breath or um there can be a way that we

97
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:42,159
grab after the focus of meditation the object of meditation and the mind can sort of

98
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:49,559
get contracted and tight to maybe get a headache but there's something folded

99
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:54,760
right in with the gentleness the gentleness of compassion and the focus

100
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:01,320
that is the whole body and then actually all all space all

101
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:06,919
beings it takes a very very wide hug to hold all

102
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:12,520
beings so this um you can see right there in the posture this the difference

103
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:20,679
between sort of a crunching or pushing Contracting head that's uh trying to

104
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:26,398
follow after the breath for example versus the natural posture of

105
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:33,638
this br God hug of course breath meditation does not have to be contracted it's just one of

106
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:41,079
the one of the things that can happen there's also a way that the um

107
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:49,560
taking compassion as a meditation subject it perfumes the mind the object

108
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:56,040
itself or focusing on compassion and it it creates an atmosphere almost in in

109
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:03,680
our body and in our our mind that's um that's conditioned by

110
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:09,480
compassion this is pretty powerful because it it undermines directly those

111
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:16,680
roots of what we call UNH wholesome conduct those roots of um

112
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:22,280
greed grasping um the roots of ill will and

113
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:30,079
aversion and hatred uh and cruelty and the roots of delusion

114
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:36,800
ignorance and all of these with this gentle mist of compassion they're all

115
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:44,200
undermined they're all undermined so that instead instead of our our thoughts words and deeds feeding these roots

116
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:50,960
instead we feed the roots of meta and we bring real care and love into the

117
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:57,520
world and then a third a third um Fe

118
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:02,920
feature of all of the Brahma viharas but speaking specifically about compassion

119
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:09,880
is they have they have the power to bring both calm and insight right

120
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:16,520
together and this is a this is a powerful combination in the early tradition of course we've seen over the

121
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:25,000
week the way that compassion uh can bring can can BR soothing settling

122
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,920
calming just here just here and of course as Gil says many many

123
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,440
times um we the meditation brings calm not

124
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,560
just to be calm we bring calm in order to see and

125
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,599
that's where the Insight comes in it's like uh calming in order to see

126
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:53,240
is a bit like uh setting up our telescope on a on a tripod nice and

127
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:58,680
steady nice and still so that we can see the stars

128
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:04,720
or another metaphor is like letting the letting the uh

129
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:11,119
water say a deep say a deep pool become very very still and very

130
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:17,920
very clear so that we can see all the way to the bottom there's a beautiful there's a

131
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:25,760
beautiful image in a Zen poem of seeing all the way to the bottom of the the bottom of the water the large silent

132
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:33,160
fish that are swimming there these things we wouldn't be able to see without

133
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:38,240
Tranquility but these both coming together tranquility and

134
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:45,599
insight so something we did this morning in the meditation and one of the ways that we can invite the Insight aspect

135
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:54,680
into into um compassion practice is by by opening this

136
00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:00,680
investigation a little bit of of a little bit of curiosity posing the

137
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:07,079
question just how is this compassionate mind and with that question we lean in

138
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:14,359
the direction of insight bringing Insight together with tranquility and especially

139
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:20,920
powerful in in terms of the movement toward Awakening with a practice like

140
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:27,599
compassion we take a few steps in the direction of Awakening um but by looking after the

141
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:34,079
seven awaking Awakening factors so is there uh is there

142
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:39,599
mindfulness in a compassionate mind Compassionate Heart Is there the second

143
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,960
factor which is investigation uh this is the this is the

144
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,040
the quality that asks oh what what exactly is here if mindfulness

145
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:55,400
mindfulness is the quality that knows what's here investigation is the one

146
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:03,640
that says oh what exactly is here this this um investigation Builds

147
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:09,599
on with the next Awakening Factor it takes some energy to look into the mind and the heart and do the medit

148
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,960
meditation practice so energy can be aroused and then these first three

149
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:21,599
together mindfulness investigation and energy they

150
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,960
seed um they seed the arising of joy

151
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,680
like a bright full body beautiful Joy it can be or it can be quite

152
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:37,440
subtle but is there joy in a compassionate

153
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:43,760
mind and then the fifth of the seven Awakening factors is there

154
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:49,160
Tranquility is there Tranquility then is there

155
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:55,400
concentration collectedness settledness here is the Mind

156
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:00,800
settling and then the seventh is their mental balance

157
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:06,440
equinity that can look upon all things all beings all phenomena with a measure

158
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:11,599
of balance so are the are these here what

159
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:17,800
exactly is here in this compassionate mind and doing this sort of

160
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:23,440
Investigation as we're saying it brings together tranquility and insight which

161
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:32,560
can set the stage for a very deep letting go or another deep letting

162
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:37,720
go just as uh just as I quoted Gil is saying we don't we don't practice calm

163
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:43,000
just for calm and actually we don't even practice Insight just for

164
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:49,400
insight but uh but we condition a sort of Letting Go that allows us to be free

165
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:55,319
allows us to be free in some way in all

166
00:40:55,319 --> 00:41:02,680
circumstances so I wanted to take a moment to to say a couple of things about why why

167
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:08,160
compassion and Awakening why this um why this is so

168
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:13,280
inspiring there's something there's something to me I wonder how it is for

169
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,760
you there's something for me that's that is quite inspiring about

170
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:24,560
um the power of compassion as a meditation practice to bring

171
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:30,920
about um these degrees of freedom just very very

172
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:37,480
quickly uh it's not only about the speed um but it's it's that we can taste the

173
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:44,240
flavor of Freedom uh it with compassion it's right there it's right nearby and that this

174
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:49,319
can be such a powerful uh Touchstone for us or a guide or a

175
00:41:49,319 --> 00:41:54,760
guideline we taste taste the flavor of freedom and we know to move in this

176
00:41:54,760 --> 00:42:04,079
direction something that's inspiring about compassion practice and that also on the on the the

177
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:13,599
um let's say the path of the path of compass compassion is onward leading and it goes so far in the direction of

178
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:20,520
freedom and then the third reason is that the the freedom that we taste and

179
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:26,800
the inspiration that we take from the possibility of Freedom it's

180
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:34,240
the um the influence of compassion is evident throughout the path and it's evident in every action

181
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:39,319
when we practice it this there's this one teaching that

182
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:45,880
says a mind well cultivated and loving kindness is supreme in

183
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:51,880
Beauty a mind well cultivated in loving kindness is supreme in

184
00:42:53,839 --> 00:43:00,920
Beauty so over the last several days we've covered a covered a bit of territory from compassion as it relates

185
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:07,079
to deep rest and how to love sustainably how to release the hindrances and practice seclusion the

186
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:13,440
importance of meta as a root for compassion and then discuss to not self

187
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,880
and then how this path can lead onward in the direction of

188
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:27,240
Awakening I'd like to close the series with a an image and I mentioned before

189
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:33,520
about uh the circle of compassion the circle of compassion and

190
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:41,640
the notion here is that um self-cultivation the work that we do on

191
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:47,480
with ourselves it benefits others and then benefiting others

192
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:53,400
enhances our self-cultivation we we enact and develop

193
00:43:53,400 --> 00:44:00,079
cultivate compassion right here right right here with this one and that benefits

194
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:07,240
beings real concrete actual beings and then the benefits to those

195
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:15,800
other beings that that circles back and nourishes a practice the circle of

196
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:22,319
compassion thank you very much for your your um kind attention and your practice

197
