00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:07,140
welcome to Monday night I am here for Diana who is on retreat

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:12,900
conducting a retreat I have all kinds of things hanging off my ear here just a moment while I

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,060
make sure it's all secure so um

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:26,460
what I'd like to talk to you about has to do with the experience of being at ease in

5
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:34,320
practice however as I was considering that I realized

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,460
that there was a tendency on my part to jump right into the middle of the discussion and that maybe it would be useful to

7
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,640
have some place to start from and since I'm going to be here two Monday nights in a row

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,160
I'm going to start not talking about that what I would like to do

9
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,760
is talk about the importance of how we understand mindfulness what it means in

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:08,100
the practice and the value of long-term practice the valley the value of not giving up on

11
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,500
practice so first I would I'm going to tell you a story

12
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:20,759
so recently I watched a movie a film called the way back

13
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:27,900
and it's not the latest one by Ben afflecked about a

14
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,680
sports team this is the one that was made a number of years ago about

15
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,799
a group of prisoners in who were in a gulag in Siberia

16
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:47,759
who escaped and walked four thousand miles to India

17
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,119
now when I first when the when the movie comes up the first thing that is shown is it says this is based on a real life

18
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,520
experience so it turns out turns out that not everything in the

19
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,100
movie is entirely true or defensible nevertheless

20
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:12,180
the movie really impressed me with what it took to get those prisoners who were

21
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:19,739
starving and sick and in the dead of winter to leave a gulag in Siberia and

22
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:26,060
make their way all the way to India now

23
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:31,440
in the process there were there were uh there was

24
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,140
six of them and not all of them made it to India there were only three that made

25
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,959
it to India and um turns out one of the characters was

26
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:49,140
entirely made up but the movie was based on a real life experience and a memoir

27
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:56,640
that maybe this person had or maybe he was talking about someone else's experience and so what's interesting to me is how

28
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,220
the movie impacted me with the one characteristic that was

29
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:08,040
most important which was you just did not stop you kept walking

30
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:15,060
no matter what happened you just kept going and he there was one particular leader

31
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:23,879
who was a Polish engineer and he had been accused of spying so he

32
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:30,300
he was in Poland and this is in 1939 and the Russians were occupying Poland at

33
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:36,840
that time and he had said some inflammatory things against Stalin and

34
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,060
so he was arrested and he never

35
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:50,840
agreed that he had done any of these horrible things but they tortured his wife who testified against him

36
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:58,379
so he got he got a sentence of 25 years in this Gulag and off he went and

37
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:04,980
all the trials and tribulations of being in this Gulag and they set out on the road and he said the one thing I have to

38
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:10,439
do is I have to get back to Poland I have to get back so that I can tell my

39
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:15,140
wife not to feel guilty about doing this

40
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,340
he had that was his primary motivation I mean obviously he wanted to escape he wanted out but mostly he worried that

41
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:30,419
his wife was going to be carrying this burden and that was the thing that kept him going and so he was constantly

42
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:36,060
encouraging people as he went along you've got to keep going you've got to keep going

43
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,900
they left with a hatchet a knife and a week's worth of food

44
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,259
he was uh this character was the leader of the group because he believed they

45
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:56,520
could do it he believed they could do it everybody else said okay it's worth a try I'm just

46
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:02,340
going to die here otherwise and so they followed him religiously

47
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:08,759
what do you think are we going the right way you know I don't think we're going the right way are you sure we're going the right way constantly wanting

48
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,860
reassurance and we do that we do that in our practice we say well am I getting to

49
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,960
where I need to go how am I doing you know the answer you have to tell me how

50
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,100
this happens how do I make this happen what am I doing wrong why can't I concentrate why can't

51
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,360
why am I not there how come I can't measure that I am better on the path

52
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:37,860
that I'm I'm the person that I want to be how can I what's happening they were constantly asking him

53
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,620
and he would go on ahead and come back and get them

54
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:51,539
and all of the characters changed over the course of this Trek

55
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:57,380
they changed in ways they didn't expect mostly they tended to be very

56
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:04,380
distrustful of one another and independent totally isolationist and what they

57
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,960
discovered is it took all of them to survive it took all of their skills whether they

58
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:17,340
particularly valued those skills or not it took everyone to make that happen and

59
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:23,240
they began to feel the the lines between them

60
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,440
totally unintentionally of course they set out with a yeah we all have to

61
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,020
be together but I'm keeping mine to me and then discovered that didn't work

62
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:43,259
they had to keep going they had to depend on one another and this one could cook and that one could

63
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:50,280
hunt and that one could fish and that one knew how to make the directions work and it took all of them

64
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:56,400
they took the guy who was willing to risk being found to go ask people why

65
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:03,240
are the why are the mosquitoes so bad and why aren't you affected by the mosquitoes oh well you have to use this

66
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:10,500
particular thing which is a mosquito repellent you just go over here and pick oh okay and all of a sudden all that

67
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,138
misery went away foreign

68
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,860
they didn't know they thought they knew what the obstacles were going to be but they

69
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:30,240
actually didn't know the path that we set on out on

70
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:37,199
we don't know the outcome we don't know what's going to come up what's going to be an obstacle for us

71
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,500
what's going to not fit the vision we have

72
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:50,660
and then what happens when that obstacle arises

73
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:59,160
okay I guess I wasn't meant to or or can we say well that's interesting

74
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:05,160
now what and what we learn along the way

75
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,680
is how the idea that we have about what the path is how we're going to get where

76
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,259
we're going maybe it's just an idea

77
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:24,240
and it may be something that gets us started or gets us moving but what truly has value is what's

78
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:31,139
actually true where am I on the path am I have I found

79
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:38,520
the lake have I not found the lake mostly they trekked across Siberia they went to

80
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:44,459
Mongolia and they thought okay when we get to Mongolia we'll be safe we'll be out of Russia but then the first thing

81
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:50,279
they saw when they got to Mongolia was a picture of Stalin and they said whoops

82
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:57,180
it seems that this country is also not safe for us and so they decided to go on to Tibet

83
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,100
which meant crossing the Gobi Desert

84
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,519
they lost a couple of the people in the desert that was hard that was difficult that

85
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:14,720
was terminal for some

86
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,160
and they kept going at the beginning of the trip one of the characters who was an American

87
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:34,800
told the leader he said well I'm going to go with you because you have a fatal flaw that will work in my favor

88
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,580
and he said what's the flaw and he said kindness I've watched you you're kind and when I

89
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:48,600
am really failing I'm going to count on you to carry me and that actually happened

90
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:54,180
you know he didn't actually have to physically carry him but he had to literally drag him along and know we're

91
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:58,519
not going to leave you and yes we can do this and

92
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:06,800
what we think of is our flaws or our gifts are not necessarily so

93
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:14,100
not necessarily so and very often we get caught in the Trap in our practice

94
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:20,360
how we think it ought to look how we think we ought to be

95
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,920
there were two major things that happened to this man as they as they went along

96
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:35,459
they eventually got to Tibet and the American went off and joined in an American

97
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:41,519
group somewhere out of Tibet and three people went on over the Himalayas

98
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:48,779
and when they got there the first thing is they said well where are your passports and they you know they left and and the and the the man said well

99
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:54,980
how did you get here from Siberia and they said we walked

100
00:10:55,019 --> 00:11:00,839
I think it was that the repetition of that phrase we walked we just did it

101
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:06,660
we just did it we just kept going and we didn't stop

102
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:14,399
now the rest of the story is that the the poll eventually got back to Poland

103
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:20,540
now he was arrested in 39 he arrived in India in 42.

104
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:26,339
he didn't get to go to Poland until 1989

105
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:35,220
when the Communists left Poland after the after the Berlin Wall fall fell and like

106
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,980
the lesson in the solidarity movement took over in Poland then in 1989 he went

107
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:47,660
to Poland and he found his wife and told her it was okay

108
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,959
the determination and the willingness to say I don't want you to have to carry

109
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:04,320
this so there were kind of the two tracks it was the determination to keep going and

110
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,839
the issue of what are you carrying on your journey what is it that you're

111
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:16,380
carrying mostly what we carry on our journey is

112
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:21,899
memories we carry memories

113
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:27,000
we carry our beliefs on how things should be locked up in the process that

114
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,200
we call memory and part of what we do on our path is we

115
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:40,019
lay down some of those memories or we shift those memories you know when I was

116
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:46,800
in high school I was fascinated by the idea of memory and I wanted to the the reason I became

117
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,160
a scientist in the first place was I wanted to understand how the brain

118
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,079
chemically created a memory what the hell does that mean how do we

119
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:05,100
do that and at the time actually that wasn't as strange a way of thinking about memory

120
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:12,180
but over time neuroscientists have come up with other explanations for how memories are formed and what actually a

121
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:17,300
memory is so the brain

122
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:22,680
operates on a kind of it's it's kind of a way to think about the brain is a very

123
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:28,200
sophisticated chat bot what it does is take information that

124
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:34,260
has been that it receives about experience and it forms meaning boxes

125
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:41,339
you know little little synaptic circuits of with this set of conditions

126
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:46,560
with these things that happen this means there's danger here and the reaction

127
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,680
should be fair the memory is actually a process it's a

128
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,720
series of synaptic firings that form patterns that we

129
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,620
assign meaning to

130
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:10,380
so that the the brain actually works as a kind of predictive device it says oh

131
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:17,579
oh I see this is happening this is the reaction giving an example of what what that might be you might

132
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:24,720
say well um I'm thinking of ice cream as soon as I say ice cream something happens in you

133
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,820
you either have a you have a visual idea of ice cream or you have a giant X in

134
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:36,120
front of ice cream and the ice cream might be vanilla or it might be chocolate or it might be pistachio and

135
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:41,399
if it's pistachio then maybe your salivary glands start moving because now

136
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:51,660
you're you have a memory of taste all right Incorporated in this circuit

137
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:58,079
is the process by which we make sense of what our experience is and we predict

138
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:04,980
what we need to be how we need to approach something so hearing ice cream

139
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,800
all kinds of things get triggered off triggered

140
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,259
and the ice cream isn't even real it's not even here

141
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:23,639
so the way memory Works memory has a it has a number of uh you know it's it

142
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:29,760
it has some characteristics so memory I looked up what's the definition of memory memory is the continued process

143
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:35,540
of information retention over time continued process of information

144
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:41,699
retention over time it's a process it's not a chemical

145
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:48,300
stored somewhere in the brain and memory has has some characteristics so

146
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:55,079
there's the encoding how do how is the memory laid down there is the uh

147
00:15:55,079 --> 00:16:01,680
uh let's see no yeah it's laid down it's

148
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,959
stored how is it encoded it's stored and then it's retrieved that's you know that's

149
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:13,139
functionally that's what the memory does right so it turns out and there are different

150
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:20,220
kinds of memory they're short-term memory and long-term memory short-term memory only lasts for a few seconds

151
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:27,120
and it's usually auditory in in nature so we can remember lists of numbers for

152
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:33,600
example long-term memory is encoded a different

153
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,420
way it's not just repetition it has associated with it some other

154
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:46,079
kinds of encoding how something looks how something sounds somatic

155
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:52,259
coding throws it definitely into the long-term memory what that means is it has a

156
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:57,600
meaning when we store it with a meaning it goes into long-term memory

157
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,139
so when we say uh

158
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:11,100
a siren going off we hear siren then in that siren we can hear danger or

159
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:18,480
we can hear safety depending on what we laid down how we think about that sound does that

160
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:26,880
sound mean somebody is coming to save me or does that sound mean oh there's people in danger somewhere what what is

161
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,040
what is the emotional thing laid down in that memory circuit along with what you

162
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:41,000
hear now the reason I'm talking about all of this is it affects how we view our experience

163
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:49,500
just the process of how the brain works so for example

164
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:55,340
um when I smell yeast I get happy

165
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:04,020
automatically my mood goes up and I go oh it is associated with a very old memory

166
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:09,960
of my mother baking bread and when she baked bread

167
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:15,780
at the time I initially started thinking about this and the neuro circuit was set

168
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:20,960
up I felt very safe

169
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,120
really safe there's my mother making bread and I'm just standing there while she's making

170
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:33,179
bread now the details of that I actually don't have in my memory bank

171
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:39,539
but as I tell the story I'm reinforcing that association between yeast the smell

172
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:44,640
of yeast and the memory of being safe

173
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:51,480
and every time I tell myself that story I embellish it a little bit you know it's like well yeah I kind of remember

174
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:59,640
she had this aluminum bowl that she's just no maybe that was for the biscuits but but I do remember right and so as as

175
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:07,280
you begin to expand the story you start creating other associations

176
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,360
just the smell of yeast

177
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:19,500
all of the things that we conjure up about our experience

178
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:26,520
can be found in these memory banks that consist of neural circuits

179
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:32,780
now the reason I'm spending so much time on this is I want us to understand

180
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:40,380
the depersonalizing that occurs when you look at it as just a neural circuit and

181
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:48,020
not from the point of view of ownership this is me and who I am

182
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:56,220
as soon as we make this Association where we say the this experience this sensory input

183
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:02,880
has this meaning we are shifting away from the experience

184
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,820
into what we think about the experience

185
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:17,820
we've added things together and homogenized them in such a way that we begin to think that this memory

186
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:25,500
this process of putting together data is who I am

187
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:32,120
it's me when it's just a process

188
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:40,080
it's just a process so when we obsess about something

189
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:48,059
we're reinforcing it as a neural circuit in our brain as we retell a story to ourselves we're

190
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:54,059
reinforcing it so if I tell a story um

191
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:59,280
these people have upset me these people are really terrible people this person

192
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:07,740
is really a horrible person I'm laying down a memory Trace that says

193
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:13,519
when I hear the sound of this person's voice

194
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:20,940
I have a bad reaction a reaction this is bad this is undesirable

195
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:27,120
this is unpleasant maybe when I said ice cream you imagined

196
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,940
the ice cream splotch on your favorite shirt and ice cream is not a pleasant thing

197
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:41,480
for you at all and for someone else is a very pleasant thing it's just ice cream

198
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:48,600
and in fact it's not really ice cream it's the idea of ice cream

199
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:56,240
to my knowledge there's no ice cream in this room and we're not directly experiencing it

200
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,860
or we see a highway patrolman what happens do you automatically step on the brake

201
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:11,760
and look at to see what your speed is I do

202
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:18,840
it's amazing to me how quickly that happens and I say well why are you doing that I'm not necessarily speeding

203
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:24,480
break first thing break somewhere in the in the laying down of

204
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:31,440
that with that car the appearance of that car means is some fear associated

205
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:38,700
with authority discipline something and the reaction is I have to I have to

206
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,919
be sure I have to be I have to be safe

207
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:50,340
when we think you know well the fear reaction comes is you know

208
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:56,940
an automatic reaction comes from the amygdala we have all these stories about the location of these thoughts and the

209
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:02,820
source of fear really it can be found in these memory

210
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:08,960
circuits that aren't necessarily true

211
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:17,600
aren't necessarily real they're just habits of mind

212
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:24,380
so when we talk about habits of mind we're not really just talking about

213
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:32,460
our tendency to do something we're actually talking about not seeing

214
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:37,679
how this set of conditions is triggering some circuit

215
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,658
that calls for a certain reaction

216
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:48,620
it's you know it's not really our fault it's kind of how the brain works

217
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:55,980
but when we see it when we see oh look I'm reacting

218
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:04,340
we can say but I don't have to because it is not me

219
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:11,159
it's just something that you know what it's misinterpreting what's going on

220
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:17,159
so this afternoon my husband came to me and he said uh no I said let's have some tofu and

221
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:22,320
vegetables for dinner he said okay great he said you know uh we'll try out that

222
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,360
new press that we've got and he said we'll put some olive oil on it

223
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:34,080
so I looked at him and I thought olive oil now the way he interpreted that was I

224
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:42,620
did not want olive oil under any conditions to be put on the tofu so he baked the tofu

225
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:49,980
which turned out to be really you know hard and and kind of crisp and tasteless

226
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:56,580
because he interpreted my look to be oh whatever you do don't put oil on the

227
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:02,460
tofu and no amount of my saying you know it kind of depends on what you're doing

228
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:07,760
with the tofu whether you put oil on it had any impact

229
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:13,799
he had already heard that I didn't want oil on the tofu now all of this is just

230
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:16,519
interpretation

231
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:27,919
it wasn't my intention it's not what he wanted to do but he wanted to please me

232
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:35,299
okay that's interesting this happens all the time

233
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:42,360
in order for us to learn from our mindfulness what's

234
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:47,580
actually happening we have to watch what the Mind does we

235
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:52,700
have to be able to see oh this is the mind doing that

236
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:59,940
so in uh in the last month despite all my efforts and good actions

237
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:06,779
I managed to contract covid and it was interesting to get coveted

238
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:13,140
because well there were all kinds of ways to watch my my mind work under those

239
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:19,740
conditions so I noticed anger coming up I told the FDA they should be freeing up

240
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:25,320
that next booster shot and I'd laughed at this what am I being angry at you

241
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:31,919
know some faceless government organization that I felt should have been doing something they didn't do and sure enough

242
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,139
I got coveted and it's their fault

243
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:46,020
we often assign blame when we feel discomfort

244
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:51,539
and it's very difficult to appreciate the fact that we are causing that

245
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:58,440
suffering not they it is our reaction to that suffering to

246
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:04,760
that stimulus it is totally owned by us

247
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,460
that anger is my fault well maybe not my fault it's just that

248
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:17,400
narrow circuit but I have to own it it's still my choice

249
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:24,299
to allow it to stay there it arises it passes away unless I keep

250
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:30,960
telling my story about how the FDA was remessed for not releasing the shot right the more often I tell that story

251
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,919
The more often I have a justification for being angry

252
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:46,620
or I watched my energy level being really low really

253
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:54,960
low energy and I was starving all I wanted to do was eat

254
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:02,279
I was just starving well I wasn't starving but my body was reacting to low energy

255
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:08,940
by saying we got to get the energy up let's eat some food because the energy that was being used

256
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:14,059
up all the ATP was being used up fighting off the infection

257
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:22,380
and I was unable to say you know you're not starving and then I would catch myself and say

258
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:29,159
you know Maria you're not starving you don't have to eat you don't have to chew

259
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:36,480
to to watch the reaction and say I don't have to I don't have to

260
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:43,380
so that it's not me saying well I'm not going to allow myself to eat so that I'm denying something I'm

261
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:50,159
saying the urge to eat is definitely here I feel like I'm starving

262
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:57,000
but what's actually happening is I feel this hollowness in my stomach well the hollowness in the stomach can

263
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:06,020
be caused by any number of things sadness feeling of isolation

264
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:12,299
I got caught after all I made a contract with the universe if I

265
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:19,020
always wore my mask and got my shots this wouldn't happen and look what happened

266
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:24,179
and to feel that caving in part and say you know that's not actually

267
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:30,360
hunger it's the caving in so that I can separate what is the

268
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:35,700
experience from the meaning that has been assigned based on

269
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,960
how the brain is working

270
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:51,480
you have to actually catch yourself doing this and it takes a lot of practice

271
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:57,240
you have to just keep walking you have to say oh

272
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,760
look at that it's doing that again

273
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:09,779
we come to recognize the tendency of the Mind to correlates around a concept

274
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:16,740
around any around sensory input hearing taste smell feeling

275
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:23,720
oh this means and to watch the Mind say this means

276
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:31,440
in Buddhist practice when we talk about what is experience we talk about the

277
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:38,340
Aggregates and we say okay here's how we know we're having an experience the features of the experience

278
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:45,720
or the physical sensory input the the feeling tone this is Pleasant

279
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:54,179
unpleasant or neutral the naming the concept this is you know

280
00:30:54,179 --> 00:31:00,000
I picked this up this is round it's cool there's some fluid in here and I call

281
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,220
this a glass that's a concept as soon as I name it now I've given it function and meaning

282
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:13,200
and usefulness it's still just a piece of glass which

283
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:19,320
you know glass is a liquid actually but okay

284
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:25,799
it makes sounds when I tip touch it with my fingernail okay so there's the concept and then

285
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:31,860
there's a well this is a nice glass I like the lines on the glass now I'm thinking about the concept so there's

286
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:39,360
the thinking part the thinking mind and then there's the awareness

287
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:45,139
until I looked down at this glass it didn't even exist

288
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:52,500
until I look up I could sit here with my eyes closed talking and none of you would be here you might as well be

289
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,720
uh listening on YouTube or something

290
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,720
so those pieces of the experience

291
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:10,500
can be found in all of our experiences and when we look at them closely

292
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:16,140
we can distinguish between The Experience itself

293
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:24,020
and the meaning we've assigned to that experience the concept attached to that experience

294
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:33,899
so why is that important as we look at what is the experience

295
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:40,200
happening In This Moment a it means we're in this moment and not

296
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:47,880
in our memory we're not relating it to what happened before that kind of reflective thinking

297
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:54,600
can be very useful when you're solving problems but if you're just looking at an experience

298
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:59,640
to see just the experience it's all extra stuff

299
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:05,880
and it can be misleading and the concept that we attached however

300
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:12,059
we describe the experience then conditions us for the next moment

301
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:19,260
when we are here in this moment having a new experience with conditions that are not exactly the

302
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:24,720
same because now we've added the preconception to the next moment

303
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,880
I'm depressed I have low energy and I'm depressed

304
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:36,600
oh and now there follows from that all the things I'm looking for around depression and the feeling that I need

305
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:43,260
to get out of depression and why am I depressed I shouldn't be depressed and know I'm I'm criticizing and I'm lost in

306
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:49,620
the self-critical mode and each of these things is building on the other

307
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:55,140
when really it was just low energy and maybe the problem is

308
00:33:55,140 --> 00:34:02,460
I have covered and I'm weary maybe the problem isn't depression to

309
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:10,378
begin with but created by my adding a concept to the feeling of

310
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:13,460
very low energy

311
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:24,480
and so when we tell people you know when you notice that you are

312
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:31,339
anxious just stay with the anxiety let it be the just let it be there

313
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:38,580
I wonder how useful that is because as soon as we call it anxiety

314
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:44,339
we have a whole string of meaning to attach to that word anxiety

315
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:51,419
and anxiety is not a momentary thing but it becomes another thing and we reify it

316
00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:58,440
we make that experience into something rather than the process that it began

317
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,800
with

318
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:11,400
and we get trapped into cycles of suffering having to do with just the way the brain

319
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:18,300
works and are saying yeah yeah I get it I know what that is so

320
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:23,660
I have I've been working on a major project

321
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:31,740
for three years for my homeowners association having to do with installing EV Chargers

322
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:38,280
this was it unpopular project nobody really wanted it

323
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:43,500
and when I started out three years ago it was just an idea let's see how we can

324
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:49,800
make EV charging capability possible in our apartment complex because we're

325
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:55,680
limited it's an old complex and I have a charger

326
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:01,920
but that means other people in the building may not be able to put it in because there's a limited capacity

327
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:09,240
so I started looking into this and lo and behold as time went on Peninsula clean energy came up with some

328
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:16,260
incentives for people like us to install EV Chargers and so now we have a project

329
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:22,920
and last week the board approved it and pce approved

330
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:28,800
the incentives and it's actually going to happen but the last six weeks of the project

331
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,839
were hell I kept thinking we already decided we

332
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:40,079
were going to do this let's go let's go and everybody was moving at a different pace

333
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:47,280
and I was thinking all the things that could happen because I'm used to Big projects and

334
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:54,420
that they always have something happen and Things fall out of bed and then you have to pick them up

335
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:59,119
but for sure it's not going to happen if you don't start

336
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:07,980
and I noticed patterns of stress being set up that we're very familiar to me

337
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:14,700
from my work life and I thought wait a minute wait a minute what's going on here I could feel

338
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:22,140
the reactions the reactions that would set in and and how I was going to solve these and how important it was

339
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:29,400
hmm and as I asked more and more questions of myself what's really happening here

340
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:38,520
what's really happening here I came to understand that I was falling into an old pattern

341
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:44,760
that I didn't have to there were several things that happened

342
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:50,820
one of them was that because I'd been working on it so long I owned it it was

343
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:56,119
mine my project

344
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:01,859
my very important project as soon as I said it's not your project

345
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:07,200
you don't need this to happen there's nothing if this doesn't happen

346
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:13,079
there are no consequences to you and in fact it just means you know

347
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:20,099
there'll be another solution in the future but it won't be this solution and so what are you attached to that is

348
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:23,420
causing the suffering

349
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:34,220
and I realized I was attached to a feeling of ownership responsibility

350
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:41,220
competence I could make this happen and as soon as I let go of that all of

351
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:46,920
the stress went away as soon as I said I don't actually have to do this

352
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:52,700
I don't have to make this my project it doesn't have to be about me

353
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:59,700
I don't have to be embarrassed because they've asked me to go get somebody to get in writing what they've told me

354
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:06,660
verbally I don't have to be feel like this is a failure for me I

355
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:12,839
don't have to react this way but I have to see it really carefully I

356
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:20,640
have to see that's what's happening in order to stop creating my own

357
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,180
suffering

358
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,619
I have to see what's being triggered

359
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:38,760
I have to see how the mind is interpreting everything that's

360
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:44,660
happening and that I don't have to interpret it that way

361
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:54,780
I don't have to look at the people who are dragging their feet

362
00:39:54,780 --> 00:40:00,480
and think negative thoughts about them

363
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,640
I don't have to I can say oh they're really worried

364
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:12,960
about something and not make it about

365
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,720
me really really

366
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:25,320
actually difficult actually difficult to rephrase

367
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:30,079
the meaning that the brain assigns to something

368
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:38,460
so another thing that's going on is around me that there's a golf course and they're re -constructing this golf

369
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:45,420
course and they've cut down trees huge huge redwood trees and

370
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:51,660
digging up the yard and they're all these strange pieces of equipment

371
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:56,760
and I watched the pieces of equipment moving around and I try to imagine what

372
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:03,000
they're doing what is that thing that looks like a dungeon beetle that big thing that's got

373
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,040
that big thing on the front of it and what is it doing and why are they doing that

374
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:13,460
and the process of watching The Mind curious

375
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:21,060
I can see that the mind is trying to establish meaning around every piece of equipment

376
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:29,460
they're doing this so that this is true they're doing this because and to watch the mind doing that allows

377
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:35,339
me to feel what the Mind feels like when it's creating Concepts

378
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:40,500
does that make any sense sort of the experience of watching The

379
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,480
Mind make new connections

380
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:52,380
make new stories and what was interesting was to have my

381
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:59,400
husband and I both looking at the same dung beetle piece of equipment which was his phrasing for that by the way

382
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:06,540
I called it a rake to look at that and see that we were forming different meanings for what that

383
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:11,820
device was doing he says oh well it's digging up the

384
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:17,160
roots I said no no no no it's sorting through those piles of debris you know just

385
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:24,780
different stuff not important not significant but to realize that the meaning that is

386
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:31,800
established by the mind is based on experiences that have come before

387
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:38,220
all of the conditions of our lives have conditioned the way we react to what's coming next

388
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:43,619
we have to see that and the way we see that

389
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:47,059
is by constantly

390
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:55,560
being mindful watching watching what's happening seeing what's happening we just keep

391
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:01,020
walking and the longer the more consistently we walk

392
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:07,260
the more we see the more we see

393
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:14,220
the more clearly we see we just keep practicing

394
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:23,359
and what comes out of it is the realization that we don't have to judge what we see

395
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,460
oh oh that's happening

396
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:37,400
we replace judgment with discernment Ah that's what's happening

397
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,900
know where you're going and go there

398
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:48,380
be aware of your intentions and take the next step

399
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:53,540
that's it thank you

400
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:01,380
so I'm sorry I talked a little longer than I expected but if you have any questions we can talk

401
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:07,940
afterwards or now if you have something you want to say

402
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:19,519
okay may you watch the mind

403
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:26,220
it's a magical device but it doesn't do magical things

404
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:32,520
it just does what it sees may you see clearly and well thank you

405
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,060
good night
