1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:08,400
so good morning good day hello everyone we come to the end of

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,799
this series on the six qualities of the dharma

3
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:20,400
five qualities of the dharma and one of them is that it's

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,640
not doesn't belong to time there was a i mentioned yesterday as a

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,800
story of a celestial being that challenged a young monk and said you're young you should

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,320
enjoy sensual pleasures and

7
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:45,120
you're pursuing things that are taking time pursue something that's immediate

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:54,480
you know sensual desires and the monk says no it takes time to pursue sensual desires

9
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,480
i don't know about time i'm not living in time i'm just being here present

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,320
for what takes no time and so this idea that

11
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,439
that this dharma is something that's immediate that's

12
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,640
right here implies that it is here

13
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,640
in some way and i think it's probably fair to say that when we

14
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:31,438
were often too preoccupied with our concerns to see the dharma operating right here

15
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,680
and how do we see it one of the most common ways in which these ancient

16
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,040
teachings of the buddha emphasize is we see it

17
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,280
by first seeing that there is attachments greed

18
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,399
aversion delusion that there is conceit there's concern

19
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,000
with self self preoccupation often our preoccupations are centered

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,040
and the main character is me myself and i

21
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:12,319
and we see that clearly so there's an honesty and like this is what's happening i see what's happening

22
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,680
as opposed to being pushed around by it and being carried by it and

23
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,599
kind of involved participating in this stream of thoughts and preoccupations just really

24
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:30,480
see it all this is what's happening and at the same time is seeing what this is what's happening

25
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,800
seeing there's something about that's here now which is not caught in it

26
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,400
something which is not right now which is not involved in greed and hatred and

27
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,959
delusion and conceit right here there is when where there

28
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,360
doesn't our preoccupations are not the whole picture

29
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:02,400
there is available right here something which is not preoccupied

30
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,280
something that's not involved in conceit

31
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,720
and one of the clues one of the one of the aspects of this

32
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,879
is the simplicity of awareness itself the more simple we can be aware of

33
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:25,200
what's actually happening we sense that in in what's happening

34
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,519
in that awareness there's no preoccupation that's where the timeless

35
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,720
immediate dhamma is found in seeing that contrast oh yes

36
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,280
i am caught up and yes there's part of me that knows that that's not cut up

37
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,959
to see what is not caught up and sometimes our caught upness goes

38
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,120
away and we just see and clearly know that we're just not caught

39
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,239
and i like i liken it to if we're holding something in our hand

40
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,280
we might be so concerned with the object that we don't notice that we're grasping

41
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,959
it noticing we're grasping it we might notice i don't have to grasp it i can

42
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,759
hold it with an open hand in a relaxed way just hold it up the hand upright and hold it there

43
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:26,240
and then i'm so aware of the relaxed hand i'm holding it and there's a relaxed

44
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,919
hand at the same time so to see those two things we see it

45
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:38,240
and to experience this for ourselves to know this for ourselves the dhamma that's

46
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,639
immediate that's here to be known by the wise

47
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,880
so take heart in your meditation

48
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:57,759
that if you should get caught up in preoccupations those preoccupations are the stepping

49
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:05,600
stone to freedom by seeing clearly all i'm preoccupied

50
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,120
and then appreciating that oh maybe here

51
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,160
in addition to being preoccupied there is a place of not being

52
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,280
preoccupied in the knowing in the peace that's there

53
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:28,000
so i hope that makes sense and with that we'll begin

54
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,039
and again for this day i will just sit quietly and you're left

55
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,280
to yourself

56
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,360
so

57
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,440
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

58
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:02,480
we come to the beginning as we come to the end of the sitting

59
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,679
when there is no time for the dharma

60
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:14,480
because a dharma is always here always with us

61
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:23,919
always onward leading in that it shows us

62
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:34,440
where attention needs to be so that we can be free

63
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:43,120
if attention is caught and involved in our thoughts we're not free

64
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:54,880
if we're thinking but also know we're thinking

65
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,278
we can also know

66
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,039
the timeless freedom of now

67
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,720
and in a sense you need to give time

68
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:29,080
to experience the freedom of here and now

69
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:36,320
you have to give time to experience the timeless freedom of here

70
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:46,240
that means there has to be some stopping of the incessant

71
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:52,480
leaning forward preoccupation rumination

72
00:28:52,480 --> 00:29:00,398
just enough so you can see clearly what's happening

73
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:07,760
and in that clearing see the way forward

74
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:13,840
to be free and may it be from what we're learning

75
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:19,120
through this practice that we create a clearing for others

76
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:25,679
that we create the time the presence the sacred pause

77
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:33,279
the sacred openness to the moment in which we can receive others know

78
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:39,279
others that they can have the experience of being known

79
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:45,200
in freedom maybe they won't recognize it

80
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:52,240
exactly what's happening but something in their hearts will know

81
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,200
that they're being received and known by a person

82
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,080
who has space openness awareness

83
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:13,200
of them without our neediness and greed and aversion and

84
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,799
judgments resentments without our

85
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:23,840
fantasies and imaginations and delusions

86
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:31,360
what a great gift to give others may it be that through this practice

87
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:39,919
we give people the gift of freedom and attention and respect

88
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:48,398
may all beings be happy may all beings be safe

89
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:57,200
may all beings be peaceful may all beings be free

90
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:02,279
and may our practice contribute to that

91
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:17,059
so [Music]

92
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:26,309
thank you [Music]

93
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:35,039
the last of the characters of the dhamma is that it's to be personally known by

94
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:42,559
the wise or personally experienced by the wise depending how the word

95
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:48,159
is understood but

96
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:53,120
personally means directly immediately here

97
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:59,120
and i think it's very hopefully encouraging and inspiring

98
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,159
that this dharma that we're doing is is pointed to something very deeply

99
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:10,399
personal that the answer is found in us

100
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:18,080
the book to read is in our own hearts is here that the teachings that are to be really

101
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:23,760
followed are the ones that you find here personally not necessarily by someone like me

102
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:30,000
talking about it these uh these the five characteristics

103
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,200
of the dhamma that it that it's visible here it's now

104
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:42,799
it's uh inviting us to see it's onward leading and to be known by the wise this is uh

105
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:49,679
in the ancient text this is the the exclamation the inspired

106
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:56,720
utterance of people who have really tasted the full potential of the

107
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:03,679
practice for the first time or have really experienced the full potential really never tasted or

108
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:10,559
this sense of how mindfulness how awareness can lead to kind of freedom in the midst

109
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:15,919
of our life we can experience that personal freedom here and now

110
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:22,320
and and there's no more there's confidence there's no more doubt

111
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:28,640
that this is what it is so uh so this whole expression you know

112
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:34,399
the characteristics of the dhamma are are in fact something to be experienced by their wise to known by

113
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:41,360
oneself to to discover for oneself not to be taken as articles of faith or creed

114
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:47,760
but they're pointing to an experience something that's personal no and no known

115
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:55,120
but in order to do that we have to be available for this experience of the present

116
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:02,480
moment we have to be available to experience to know something personally

117
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,398
and this ability to be available to be receptive to be

118
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:15,200
open to to have the clarity for experiencing what's happening here now

119
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:22,158
is not easy to come by um it's something that uh

120
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,520
uh you know for whatever reason this minds of ours mind of ours

121
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:33,520
like so easily races ahead so easily uh is

122
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:40,079
caught in his cycles of rumination is somewhat leaning forward into the next moment into the next moment

123
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:47,359
as soon as one thing is finished we're already on to the next thing because of the momentum of that mind

124
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,560
and uh and so the idea is to stop and be present

125
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:59,040
many years ago i had this analogy for this or kind of for myself that when i was young

126
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:04,960
growing up in europe there was much more handshaking than there is now

127
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,160
i think but i remember that sometimes then when there was

128
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:15,520
someone like a politician or someone who was somehow an

129
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:21,119
important person and was going around and shaking everyone's hands

130
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,720
there were a few times i experienced someone who would as soon as their hand was in my hand to

131
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:33,359
be shook i already i felt the hand immediately went limp because you could see their

132
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:38,400
their body their face everything was already um

133
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,839
looking for the next person to shake hands with and it was very unsatisfying because

134
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:50,240
there wasn't this little bit of firmness a little bit like that here i am or connecting and present for you

135
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,359
and so the mind is like that sometimes that uh we're on ready for the next

136
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:01,200
thing ready for the next thing and the kind of way we both grasp at something tightly

137
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:07,599
and we don't grasp we're grasping but we don't really know

138
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:14,480
in the buddha's language in buddhist teachings what we grasp at is the concepts the ideas the fantasies

139
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:23,839
the dreams the delusions the imaginations of things we don't really grab anything in solid

140
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:29,839
and so the very grabbing of things as it is keeps us going

141
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:35,839
and we're not available not present not here for the experience

142
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:41,119
so to make oneself vessel for

143
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,160
experiencing something deeply personal to experience our life ourselves in some

144
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,200
deeper way that allows us to tap into

145
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:56,560
what is really present here visible here

146
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:03,520
that concepts ideas and stories are not exactly something worth seeing or not really

147
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:09,200
seeing reality really they obscure it but if you see

148
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:16,240
how we get caught in thoughts see how we get caught in attachments and clingings and aversions

149
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,440
that's the way we begin seeing the dharma oh look at that

150
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:27,920
then with that seeing it's possible to see and find the alternative

151
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:34,480
but if we're so involved in greed hate and delusion that we can't even see it then there's no way

152
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:42,160
but to stop and be available to even see that which is not flattering in ourselves oh look at that

153
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:48,079
and rather than being discouraged by what is not flattering about ourselves in our minds and our hearts and our

154
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:54,480
dispositions in the dharma that's a source of encouragement of inspiration

155
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:01,440
not being inspired by what's not flattering but be inspired oh now that i know it

156
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,839
this is a stepping stone to freedom i needed to know this of course i needed to know this and see

157
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:13,359
this now where's the freedom and part of the freedom is found

158
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:18,960
in that seeing that recognition as part of that freedom is found in not

159
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:25,040
succumbing or collapsing or being upset by what is not flattering the faults we

160
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,720
have or difficulties we have inside see it oh that's what it is

161
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:37,280
and then we start seeing getting a taste of the simultaneous freedom

162
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:45,599
the simultaneous way in which we're looking come and look come and see

163
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:51,680
the way that it's we see then a way forward we're guided into that clarity guided

164
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:57,520
into that more freedom that more letting go and then the more we experience that

165
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:03,040
non-clinging where we experience that attention that's free and

166
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:08,240
not clinging not grasping then the more we can just really be

167
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:15,760
present in a full way for experience we can have that handshake with reality we're really there with it

168
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,319
and the mind is not already going off to something else

169
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:26,400
and and so to

170
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:33,599
be available and then to find a comment about this uh for

171
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:39,440
the buddha when he was talking about this uh what it means this um visible it's

172
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:45,599
here it's come and look at it it's onward leading

173
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:51,520
and experienced by the wise uh he wants and wanted an explanation of

174
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:58,720
all that he just kind of little bit changes seemingly change the subject and he talks about

175
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,920
not being involved in the conceits of feeling that you're better than

176
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:09,680
others worse than others or equal to others we're not involved in the game and the

177
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:15,040
ranking and the status of self and so

178
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:20,320
this freedom from comparing ourselves to others

179
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:25,760
that's part of this freedom that he's talking about it's available here and now

180
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:32,480
and what a gift to give to others the gift of not comparing

181
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,480
not making ourselves worse or better than others or even the complications of making ourselves equal

182
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:45,040
we don't play that comparison game and that the gift to others is that they're allowed to be who they are

183
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:51,119
and we can be present for them in a full way we can shake their hands or the equivalent and really be there and

184
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:56,560
present and give them them some kind of gift of freedom

185
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:02,560
so um to be personally experienced by the wise

186
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:09,200
may that be may you be a wise person may you be available to experience this

187
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:17,680
life in a deep way and may that availability translate to a greater respect reverence care

188
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:24,560
love for others as well and uh if you would like to have homework for

189
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:30,079

190
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:37,280

191
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:44,000
