5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,800

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:38,640
so so practicing practicing kindness practicing loving kindness

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,960
practicing meta and the other brahmavihara is the other

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,110
practices of the heart so the theme i'd like to bring in today is this

9
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:56,399
[Music] realization is this realization that

10
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,559
when we practice when we uh create

11
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,320
ourselves others and also what arises in our

12
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:15,600
heart in our mind emotions maybe even challenging emotions fear

13
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,840
anxiety etc when we treat everything with with

14
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,240
with gentleness with kindness instead of pushing them away instead of being

15
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,439
aversive towards them hating them if we

16
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:41,159
share kindness if we share meta if our attitude is one of meta

17
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:48,159
then then it feels like the world is responding to

18
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,159
us with meta because we form our own perceptions we

19
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:02,320
form our own world the world that we live in it's similar to when say someone is

20
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:09,360
angry or or or upset and goes through the world

21
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,440
uh feeling upset and angry at everyone and they they feel that everybody is angry at

22
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,879
them and this is a very hostile world so creating our own reality

23
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,800
with not with all of our actions quote-unquote actions and in buddhism

24
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,120
this is fun actions also refer to actions of the mind so

25
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,959
thoughts are actions of the mind speech is actions of speech and of

26
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:47,120
course actions in the world what you do but your thoughts the way you think the way you re react the way you

27
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,280
frame something or refrain something they're all actions actions of the mind

28
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:01,519
the mind door in buddhism so so however we act quote unquote act

29
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:09,120
again actions of the mind however we act in the world um for every action there is a reaction

30
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:17,040
right there is a sense of how we um if we are spreading if we perceive if we

31
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,720
are sending or sharing or have the perspective of

32
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:29,120
of aversion anger fear anxiety all of that and of course

33
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,799
that's how we perceive the world to be we perceive the world to be a very

34
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:43,200
unsafe and unfriendly place whereas with meta it we

35
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,040
live in a world in in our we perceive a world that is kinder because we are

36
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,040
being kinder to ourselves first and foremost and kinder to others

37
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:02,640
one last thing i want to say to set the frame today is um the story of why the buddha or how the

38
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,640
buddha started to teach metta many of you may know the story but i like to

39
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,519
bring it again tonight so it is said that a group of monks were sent by the buddha

40
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,199
to a forest to practice diligently

41
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:28,960
on their own and the tree spirits were very upset to have their

42
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,000
peace intruded upon by these monks so they

43
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,479
scared the monks away and they created ghastly images and and smells and the monks were terrified

44
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,520
so the monks run back to the buddha and say oh buddha please send us anywhere

45
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,160
but not that forest it's a scary scary place trembling

46
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,479
and the buddha the sense of humor he says well actually i'm gonna send you back to the very same

47
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:06,320
forest but i'm gonna give you the only protection you need

48
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,440
and that's when he taught them the story goes metta the practice of mittal

49
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:18,639
sharing loving kindness good will so they trusted the buddha they came back

50
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,680
the monks came back to the forest and practiced diligently loving-kindness

51
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:30,720
good will kindness for the tree spirits and the story goes that the tree spirits

52
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,320
after a while they decided they actually liked the monks they started to care for them

53
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,639
protect them and they lived happily ever after so

54
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,960
so whether you take this story to be an archetype the point here as an archetype

55
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,080
the meta as an antidote to fear meta as an antidote

56
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,000
to fear the perceptions and also you can think of an the archetype of the story is that the

57
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,560
monks in their mind they were creating the sense of lack of safety they're afraid this world is a dangerous place

58
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:13,280
ah this forest is awful terrible gosh this is awful then they come back

59
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:19,919
with a sense of meta for the tree spirits whether or not they exist but just sense of meta and

60
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:27,680
kindness good will fills their heart and they feel happy and practice happily so

61
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,919
so we are not so different from those monks so i think i have said enough of a frame

62
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:41,199
for our practice today so ah like to invite us all to settle and

63
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,400
settle in our chair

64
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:53,800
to arrive in our seat

65
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,960
and whether you're sitting standing lying down

66
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:22,240
turning your gaze inward to this body and inviting it to relax

67
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:29,280
inviting it to soften [Music] when the body relaxes the mind can

68
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,800
relax can you invite this relaxation in the

69
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:42,840
body into stillness not moving not moving

70
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,680
as an act of kindness to yourself to invite yourself to be still

71
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,080
when the body is still the mind can be still

72
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:13,840
the body keeps moving the mind keeps moving

73
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,880
turning the gaze inward and connecting with the breath in the

74
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:52,839
abdomen sensor refuge

75
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,040

77
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,959
sleepy or anxious however it is

78

for your own sake and the sake of others is an act of kindness

85
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,480
in the space of practice every breath

86
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,480

87
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:06,000

90
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,839
i'm going to start our eyes as they pass

91
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,279
can we meet them with kindness not with judgment

92
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,279

aversion

maybe or is hungry or is hangry there's patience there's love

133
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:15,760
knowing the causes and conditions have given rise to this so let there be grandmotherly mind

134
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,600
you may not know you don't need to know all the causes and conditions

is arising

138
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:56,760
and whenever you're ready let there be a sense of expansiveness

139
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:03,240

to everything everything

149
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,119
as we bring this practice period to a close

150
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:17,119
can we offer kindness safety grandmotherly mind to whatever rose

151
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:22,720
whatever arrows or did not arise no judgment

152
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:30,720

165
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,800
anything that shifted for you anything that you notice perhaps especially with the in between

166
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,000
the grandmotherly mind

167
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:30,440
was it easy to offer grandmotherly mind did things shift

168
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:42,160
private uh chat may all beings everywhere everywhere know their own goodness

169
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:47,280
lovely refrains the situation yeah thank you

170
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,290
cherry [Music]

171
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,079
so um it was difficult

172
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,760
initially and then it's interesting how a word

173
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:10,480
my grandmother was had

174
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:16,160
many children and thus even more grandchildren

175
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:22,880
i think at numbers close to 30. and so grandchildren so i was one of them

176
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,160
and the younger ones that the much older ones for some of them it

177
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,599
could be my parents but she had a term that she used

178
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:40,240
and it was pet and i would ask something oh pet do you want some juicy fruit gun

179
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:46,400
and so that um word pet just like oh there it is i haven't

180
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,440
thought of that word in many years and it was like

181
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,720
oh that's warm that's that's kindness you don't have to yeah whatever else

182
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:02,320
comes after that it's um so it just it was a a click of a

183
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:09,359
switch but until then it was seemingly um i guess a little back academic

184
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:14,480
uh but i got that word and i thought okay

185
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,760
i'm i'm here so hope that helps others oh that's very

186
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:26,720
sweet jerry it brightens my heart and helps me connect that's so sweet oh

187
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,760
hello pet you know just it's just so sweet just one word has so much kindness

188
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:40,079
in it that's very sweet thank you that's lovely thanks for sharing that katrin please

189
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:46,319
um i was having a uh in daily life practice because i wanted

190
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:52,160
to be meditating outside in some grass and their people were loud everything like

191
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:58,480
and it just felt like oh this day has been so hard already and i just wanted to meditate on the grass and now there's

192
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:04,800
these people and i was really mad at everyone and mad at myself and just feeling so bad i was like i should

193
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:12,000
be meditating right now instead i'm walking home and i've like i'm ruining my one chance to get calm

194
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,680
of the day and on my way home so i was like kind of hustling home to like

195
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:24,000
i was like i don't even want to be inside but i'll go meditate um and this i was passing a neighbor and the

196
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,520
neighbor smile like smiled and waved and i just stopped and i like took out my

197
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,560
air pods and i asked her about her tomatoes and she was like they're actually this

198
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:40,079
guy's tomatoes and then he came out with his 10 like 18 month old and the mom

199
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:45,920
and suddenly we were all having this really sweet conversation about tomatoes

200
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,760
like three generations of humans just connecting um and then

201
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:57,359
and the rest of the night that felt so good and then and the rest of that walk everything

202
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:03,280
changed like everything that had been like dark and like icky just suddenly like

203
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,560
opened up and felt so beautiful and transformed everything and it was that

204
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:15,680
choice the choice that was a hard choice for me to make to stop and just say something kind to her

205
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:22,720
and then allow that moment to open and to receive the sweetness of the of the connection

206
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:27,760
so i didn't quite do the practice but i did a different practice and i wouldn't have

207
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:34,079
been able to do it without the teachings in my ears so thank you

208
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:39,760
thank you catherine that is so beautiful oh what beautiful practice you did in

209
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:45,839
this session thank you that's so gorgeous it's meta and so in all of

210
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:52,480
its beauty and it's the jewel the action that you took the action of the mind

211
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,920
saying something nice opening up the the perception right the perception is the

212
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,839
same evening same walking home same where everything the perception just shifted like

213
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:09,359
it's it's just one moment oh that's so beautiful thank you that's great practice love it

214
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:17,280
gene please i what what i was thinking of is that um

215
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:23,920
i felt like your guidance was helping me maybe start to build a muscle that i

216
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,680
don't have already and i was kind of challenge channeling my

217
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:35,359
kindergarten teacher he used to hold me in her lap and rock me and um

218
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:42,400
i've been dealing with you know trying to deal with chronic pain and a lot of fear around that and kind of

219
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:48,640
um grief and remorse and it's really hard you know i definitely resisted

220
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:53,920
so i think this was a good um kind of first step but it really does

221
00:43:53,920 --> 00:44:00,800
feel like a capacity i have to build but i'm not sure i would have had the courage or opportunity without that

222
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:06,079
beautiful guided meditation so thank you thank you thank you so much ian for

224
