maybe a roll of the shoulders to relax the back can align the bones

18
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:20,000
and a few deep breaths to establish the connection

19
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:25,580

91

Ty

92
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:11,960
a group of practitioners it's a rare and wonderful thing

93
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:22,880
so for today I have a few Reflections to offer and I would also like to hear from you

94
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:30,299
but to begin let's say this week in the

95
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:37,460
in in our consideration of the Buddhist teachings on social and communal Harmony

96
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:46,080
we started with right view of course that are our actions have effects

97
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:52,919
and that we can discern we can choose then we practice this tool of repeated

98
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:59,940
reflection which gave us an approach to discern how to move forward skillfully

99
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:05,658
with both our challenges and um

100
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:11,880
those joys in our life then we looked at good friendship form

101
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:18,559
of friendship and the question I would like to ask on this last day

102
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:27,720
is having looked at all these means or methods or approaches what is our aspiration for a harmonious

103
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:33,919
community what does it look like and what is it for

104
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:45,899
in the in the Zen teachings there's this image of a um

105
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:51,440
is orienting toward the North Star

106
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:57,120
uh that there's a there's this distant North Star that we direct our in this

107
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:04,460
case a boat interact your boat and you sail in the direction of the North Star

108
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:10,679
the the north star of course is our vision it's our aspiration

109
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:17,940
and we move uh interestingly as folks who say oh no

110
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:23,159
you don't go straight at the destination you have to tack

111
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:30,840
left right left right and respond to the particulars

112
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:36,000
of the the challenges the terrain I guess

113
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,000
all in all making this um uh making this

114
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,399
vow this perseverance a dedication of moving in the direction of this North

115
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:53,519
Star so in this in this discussion of the

116
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:59,279
week we've been talking a lot about how to meet the waves how to move amidst the waves

117
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:05,279
approaches how to row and I'm really interested today in

118
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:10,858
what's the North Star about I may have more questions about this

119
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:16,618
than answers and I'm curious about what comes up for you too

120
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:24,000
but just briefly say a couple of things as someone who um for maybe nine of the

121
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,240
last 10 years I've been living in Dharma communities a fortunate life

122
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:38,220
um I've noticed a couple of things about these different spaces one is the the first Dharma Community I lived in

123
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:44,878
I had a very particular strength it was kind of amazing to witness and that

124
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:52,320
strength was its Singularity of purpose it was so clear to everyone who was

125
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:59,280
there that the community was set up for the practice and the practice was absolutely first

126
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,980
priority all the time it was amazing it was amazing

127
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:11,280
um one of the best examples of this that might sound a little drastic in our in

128
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:17,099
our regular day-to-day life there were three times every day for one

129
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:23,760
hour that all of the work on the property stopped completely and everyone went to

130
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,980
the meditation Hall everyone

131
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:34,800
can you imagine it was so still and we got into this

132
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:41,220
Rhythm this Rhythm as a community in a way we kind of harmonized

133
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:48,000
now is the time to go to meditation there was no deliberation about it but they had this real strength in this

134
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,099
community of the singularity of purpose the clarity that shine like a bright

135
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:56,900
light from a distance

136
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:04,619
and then in another Community I was living in I saw a different strength this community

137
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:11,040
um had many functions many arms we'll say

138
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:18,599
um and their strength was responsiveness this community was uh was such that

139
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:25,260
there were there were many people asking many things of this community and there was there was a way that in

140
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:30,900
contrast to just having this one thing that we focused on instead it was trying

141
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:36,380
to meet the needs of a varied a varied and very large group

142
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:42,660
and this was a function of its location its people even its teachings

143
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:47,700
I heard a story of one of the well-known

144
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:53,339
um uh projects for support of the unhoused

145
00:36:53,339 --> 00:37:01,740
that's associated with the Dharma Community the the teacher who initiated this program said oh

146
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:09,119
I I never intended to start this program but I saw a need and I responded

147
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,838
so responsiveness

148
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:22,020
purpose responsiveness these were our strengths but what were they for

149
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:28,560
what were they for I really hold this as a question I wonder what it is for you

150
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:34,500
in the Buddhist teachings of course he he holds holds forth the the per the whole purpose of the

151
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:42,619
teaching in the community is for the sake of liberation it's an inspiring possibility

152
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,839
and I think I've seen the way in in our Dharma communities that [Music] um

153
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:53,940
they perform a function for so many people

154
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:59,400
they can be a home for rights of Passage important ceremonies they can walk us

155
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:06,480
through these big transitions of birth and death and change of job and

156
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:12,839
um so many things so many things under the umbrella of

157
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:18,839
Buddhist practice so it's interesting to contemplate

158
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:25,920
what's the purpose what's all this for one way I help myself get grounded is

159
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:33,000
actually to look smaller and I ask myself the question how would people treat each other

160
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,020
what do the interactions look like you know there's some

161
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:46,440
says this thing I've heard that the mind is not our own but we are

162
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:51,839
responsible for it I feel a little bit that way about our

163
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:57,900
communities and our relationships too they're certainly not our own uh

164
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:04,560
but we belong to them we give ourselves to them we're responsible for them we're responsive in

165
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:10,560
them and what does that look like Buddha has this beautiful teaching you

166
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:16,680
may know about the six principles of cordiality that to me pretty pretty beautifully

167
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:23,720
encapsulates what a harmonious Community can look like in terms of relationship

168
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:31,020
he's teaching these monastics these six principles of cordiality and they're meant to produce cohesiveness in the

169
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:37,380
community they're conducive to non-dispute to Concord

170
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:44,339
and to Unity and the first three are all variations on one

171
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:50,760
variations on loving kindness the first three of six principles of cordiality

172
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:56,640
he says that um a person in this community maintains

173
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:03,900
bodily verbal and mental body speech in mind

174
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:09,960
acts of loving kindness toward the others in his community or Community

175
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:15,240
their community and that this this produces respect and

176
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:22,500
Concord and affection and unity what's interesting about this is that

177
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:28,680
the the acts of loving kindness they can be said openly or privately which means

178
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:33,900
they can be things that others know about and see and they can be things

179
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:39,420
that they don't see that they don't know about but even still

180
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:44,640
it's conducive of respect and affection cohesiveness

181
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:51,240
and Concord so the first three variations on loving kindness the fourth

182
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:58,140
is that one shares what one has we often reflect in in these talks on

183
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:03,740
the the power of giving and sharing it's no surprise

184
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:09,900
the fifth is possessing in common with those in your community

185
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:15,780
virtuous Behavior that kind of Sila the commitment to the

186
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:21,599
the precepts in short the commitment

187
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:27,960
to non-harming and that this shared in common with others in your community is conducive

188
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:33,480
Concord and then finally we come right back to

189
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:41,520
the beginning the sixth principle for a Concord or for cordiality is a variation of Right View here we are

190
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,920
with Right View again it says a monastic dwells both openly

191
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:53,220
and privately possessing in common with fellow monastics of you that is

192
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:59,760
noble and emancipating which leads out for one who acts upon it to the complete

193
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,940
destruction of suffering this too is a principle of cordiality

194
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:11,099
that creates affection and respect and conduces to cohesiveness

195
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:15,920
to non-dispute to Concord and to Unity

196
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:21,680
so maybe maybe this is what specific

197
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:27,619
interactions look like can look like in a harmonious community

198
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:34,560
well my hope is that over the course of this week we've we've covered a fair amount of territory a fair number of

199
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:41,400
teachings about social and communal Harmony and I hope that it gives rise to some reflection about

200
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:46,980
what would you like what would what would you aspire to for a harmonious community

201
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:54,420
for your harmonious Community ours what might that be for us

202
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:59,700
I hope we hope we feed that reflection and then in our last two minutes and

203
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:05,940
I'll stay a couple after I'm interested um you know my connection my connection

204
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:11,400
with you is the YouTube chat but I thought maybe I would ask

205
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:17,220
what is it what might it be for you from the week

206
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:23,760
but you feel like you that you're making your own that um

207
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:31,200
you're turning or considering or applying or seeing or recognizing in your in your own life

208
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,359
in your own relationships wherever you are This Global Sangha

209

210
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:48,720

211
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,619
