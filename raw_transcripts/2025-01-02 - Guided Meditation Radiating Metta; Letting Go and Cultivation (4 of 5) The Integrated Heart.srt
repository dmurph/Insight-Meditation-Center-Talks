1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:07,080
so good day to everyone I always love looking in the chat and seeing

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,639
um the greetings coming in very much appreciate that some of you know each

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:20,400
other we really have quite a sa here don't we so let's go ahead and get started

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,439
with our sitting together closing the eyes if that's okay

5
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:34,960
for you and settling in to a meditation posture knowing that you're sitting with

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,680
a large group of people from around the world many of whom have expressed their

7
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,960
happiness for being here and being together and just feel the nice feeling

8
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,160
from all of that connection of the

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:00,559
Dharma maybe taking a couple of long slow deep breaths and on the

10
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:07,360
breath softening into the body arriving in the

11
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,360
body maybe there's kind of an energetic

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:22,720
feeling as you let the body awaken letting the energy flow into the

13
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:29,040
[Music] cells permeating through the way water

14
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:37,040
would permeate soil it doesn't always feel like this

15
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,920
but that's the invitation to invite sense of opening to the body's

16
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,209
energy and [Music]

17
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,799
aliveness you may notice as you do so that the body

18
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:02,399
naturally settles into a position that is upright and also

19
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,599
relaxed that has some dignity and straightness to

20
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:15,879
it but is soft somewhat

21
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:27,160
flexible and so too in the mind inviting the mind to be

22
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:35,000
present alert and also

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,680
receptive willing to receive what is happening in the body the heart the

24
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,920
environment around us

25
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:09,000
we may not always appreciate what an unusual stance that is in the world

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,760
actually to be alert receptive calm and yet

27
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,560
engaged and we don't always pull it off of

28
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,920
course but even the intention toward that is quite special in the world

29
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,400
a gift of the human body and mind to do

30
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:47,000
that perhaps sensing the breath coming in going

31
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,680
out tuning in to that natural life activity breathing

32
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:16,400
inviting the mind to rest with that

33
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,919
flow and even if there's some busyness or

34
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:30,120
tiredness or emotions going on we can breathe through that and still

35
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:35,360
sense the breath and allow that to be there in the

36
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:42,400
background or bubbling away but we're still breathing

37
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:12,039
and gently allowing the attention to settle toward

38
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:20,120
the the heart area down into the chest the upper

39
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:28,080
torso could be a broad area could be smaller

40
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:42,080
just sensing Into the Heart Center how is

41
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:50,319
it it's fine if there's some aching or

42
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:58,800
tension it may feel open may feel warm you may not feel anything

43
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:19,120
but I'll be inviting some instructions in meta practice loving kindness Good

44
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:26,720
Will which you invited to participate in as it feels right for

45
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:34,520
you also okay to do your regular

46
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:53,919
meditation so allowing the breath to move through the heart

47
00:06:53,919 --> 00:07:00,479
area some people like to imagine the breath directly coming in and out of the

48
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:07,560
front of the chest or if that imagination doesn't

49
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:14,080
quite make sense you can note how the air flowing into the

50
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,918
lungs naturally flows around the

51
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:30,520
heart so breathing in and out through that area of the body

52
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,720
softening and we'll be doing a form of meta

53
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:58,479
practice it is a a radiating practice

54
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:07,840
rather than saying phrases so we begin by

55
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:16,039
evoking an image or a sense of a being for whom it's very easy to feel meta

56
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:21,280
feel Goodwill feel friendliness

57
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:29,919
well-wishing a really good choice is a pet an animal that you have a simple

58
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,440
happy relationship with or it could be an animal you see

59
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:44,079
outside the window a bird a squirrel or maybe a

60
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:50,360
baby a being For Whom the relationship is

61
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:58,959
simple and the Heart naturally uplifts just on seeing or sensing this

62
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,440
being

63
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:13,320
and you just bring in this image or

64
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,800
feeling and allow it to evoke some sense of friendliness in the

65
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,160
heart doesn't have to be anything

66
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,360
big just tune into that feeling that it brings

67
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:50,720
and then with the breath just the way the breath brings in

68
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:58,000
oxygen that circulates throughout the body imagine this feeling of

69
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,560
friendliness warmth Warth being infused through the body by

70
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,760
the

71
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,880
breath it stays centered in the heart

72
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,600
area but there's a feeling that it can spread a bit

73
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:44,880
and make sure you let it spread to the back side of the body and the

74
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:52,440
sides not just through the front where most of our attention tends to go

75
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:20,240
and now imagining a little further that on the in

76
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:28,720
breath this feeling of friendliness meta grows brighter and stronger as if

77
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,880
it were a light in the

78
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:42,240
chest like the way when you blow on a spark it gets brighter on the INB

79
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:50,639
breath and then on the out breath we feel that spreading or

80
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,040
shining of the meta

81
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:13,959
breathing in it gets brighter stronger Fuller breathing

82
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:17,680
out it's spreads

83
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,600
outward and as you get the hang of this you're welcome to just drop the image or

84
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:33,000
sense of the particular being and put all your attention on the feeling of the

85
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,560
meta that's the

86
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:03,480
object for me there's sometimes a feeling of gathering myself

87
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:08,440
around this intention or feeling toward

88
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:16,440
meta sometimes I imagine the way the the dust out in outer space gets kind of

89
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:25,600
gathered up and when it's dense enough like a star it begins to

90
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,680
shine so we have this star in the middle of the

91
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:42,000
chest breathing in the parts of ourselves are gathered together toward this feeling of goodness

92
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:50,279
friendliness and they shine and then on the out breath we just let that

93
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:56,399
radiate as far as it wants to go there's no sense that

94
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,600
we're pushing the meta out or trying to stretch

95
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:08,160
it to reach somewhere that's not what a light does a

96
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:14,800
light just [Music] shines might be a little candle might be

97
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:21,240
something larger however it is now is

98
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:29,320
[Music] fine the radiation of this sensor of

99
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,519
good

100
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,880
will maybe it just gets to the surface of your

101
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,839
body maybe it gets a little bit out into the

102
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,199
room it can be quite

103
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:04,480
modest keeping the attention on that feeling

104
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:38,319
the radiation of meta is said to be boundless without

105
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:45,560
boundry and that doesn't necessarily mean that it goes all the way out to

106
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,600
Infinity that's a lot but instead we would see

107
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:58,480
boundlessness as being that we don't place any bounds on it we don't limit it

108
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:06,000
in any way and one way that we embody that in

109
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,120
the practice bring it about in the practice so that we

110
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,560
imagine removing any boundaries that might be

111
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:24,600
there so the imagination is that there's maybe a a

112
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:31,440
curtain around the heart that's obscuring a little bit this

113
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:40,360
radiation and now if you would imagine drawing aside a curtain to the

114
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,680
front so suddenly the radiation is spilling

115
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,120
out to the front of your body completely unbounded doesn't matter

116
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:58,639
how far it goes but it's been freed by having the curtain drawn aside

117
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,920
it spreads

118
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:20,600
forward and now drawing a curtain aside to the right side of your

119
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:30,400
body so that the radiation spreads out shoots out farther to the right

120
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,360
drawing the curtain back now to the back

121
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,400
side and the meta radiates out

122
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,559
unbounded to the front the right and the

123
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,760
back see if you can imagine it radiating backwards it's not often that we put our

124
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,960
attention that way but it's

125
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,640
unbounded to the back

126
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,880
and now to the left side also we draw aside this

127
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:47,559
curtain radiation unbounded out to the front right back and

128
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,960
left boundless meta

129
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,679
we further imagine it spreading

130
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,840
upwards and downwards meta is now blocked by the

131
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:19,440
floor the Earth can radiate all

132
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,039
around freely as far as it goes

133
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:45,039
and even if you're not feeling much meta is not so available to

134
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:51,080
you it's actually still helpful just to have directed the attention in all of

135
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:59,840
these directions to have some sense of awareness all around the body

136
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:07,120
even without meta that groundless allaround awareness is

137
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:13,799
beneficial and if you're feeling meta perhaps there's a sense of warmth or

138
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:17,960
radiation in addition

139
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:39,320
so see if you can soften the effort at this point and just

140
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:45,159
rest in whatever sense you have in the heart

141
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:50,440
area this is not meant to be a strong

142
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:58,000
doing more like we're being this allaround awareness or

143
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,919
radiation of

144
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,760
meta in a very soft easy

145
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,600
way and you may notice that if it starts from the heart

146
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:21,080
area and expands outward it must pass through every cell

147
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:26,840
of your body before it gets

148
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:34,240
out you are naturally the first recipient of your

149
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,960
meta and just resting

150
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:31,159
and now letting go of the feeling of

151
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:38,760
meta it may linger a bit but just releasing that

152
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:43,880
intention and just sitting with simple

153
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:50,200
mindfulness of the body of the mind or you can return to the breath if

154
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:56,760
that feels natural just letting go and letting

155
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,440
experience flow

156
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

157
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
for

158
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

159
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,360
e e

160
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:58,679
and as we move toward the end of this sitting

161
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:07,000
i' just like to invite a reflection on the

162
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,080
way this heart quality can have a kind of a penetrating

163
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,158
feeling through our whole

164
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:27,720
body we don't have to necessarily direct our love and care and good will toward

165
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:36,399
particular beings or categories of being we can imagine instead that

166
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:43,158
there's also a way it can just um become part of our cellular

167
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:51,600
structure so that it's kind of there in the background and that this can inform our

168
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:57,360
way of being in the world I don't think we need to imagine

169
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:03,919
an ideal like will will always be a loving kind

170
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:10,440
warm perfectly socially attuned [Music]

171
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:16,720
person ideals are not always so

172
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:23,720
supportive but nonetheless having a a sense of General Goodwill especially

173
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:29,480
toward oursel can greatly inform

174
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:35,200
our way of being in the world such that we're a little more

175
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:41,399
resilient in how we can meet our own difficult states of mind or

176
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:47,080
challenges in the world and also it informs us to be able

177
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:54,159
to see what is easeful and good and beautiful if we're caught up in concerns

178
00:27:54,159 --> 00:28:02,600
and habitually in a negative mind State we may not respond to the simple moments of joy

179
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:07,720
that come a beam of sunlight coming through the

180
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:16,200
window a cup of tea somebody giving us a compliment in

181
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:22,320
the grocery store we may Rush past simple moments like

182
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:28,679
that and if we have this General background or permeation

183
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:34,320
of good will will'll catch more of those so

184
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:41,440
there's a great enrichment of our life through tuning in to the positive

185
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,080
abilities in the heart and that's a small bit of what we've done

186
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:54,170
today so I hope this will carry forward for you today and perhaps in other

187
00:28:54,170 --> 00:29:00,440
[Music] days as a a support in your way of being

188
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:07,720
in the world that benefits not only you but can spread out

189
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:16,039
to others also sometimes in unexpected ways may it be so

190
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:59,519
so it's a week of talking about letting go and

191
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:04,919
cultivation in the spirit of these New Year intentions that many people are

192
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:10,360
drawn to make but also just in the spirit of walking the path skillfully in

193
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:16,760
our life on Monday we named the three wise

194
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:24,000
intentions that are taught by the Buddha which are renunciation non-ill will and non

195
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,480
cruelty and the second of and third of those are essentially about

196
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:35,840
non-harming and sometimes they're made into a positive form by calling them a

197
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:43,120
loving kindness and compassion I think that's okay um but today I so I want to

198
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,760
address those today you know these these cultivations that we that we bring in

199
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:56,840
but I want to talk not just about kind of abstract cultivation of them like we would do on the cushion but also kind of

200
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:03,080
an integrated C cultivation you know how would we bring the heart more fully into

201
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:08,799
all aspects of our life and I want to start with a just an

202
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:14,120
anecdote um so I was driving along a

203
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:21,039
country road one day after a morning of hiking and I I came around a corner and

204
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:26,679
I suddenly saw an oncoming car in the other lane flashing its headlights and

205
00:31:26,679 --> 00:31:32,240
my mind said w oh what's going on why are they doing that and you while I was

206
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:38,799
I didn't see a obvious reason while I was trying to figure it out the car went by but then I saw it I saw that there

207
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:45,039
was a deer crossing the road that the other driver must have seen also and I

208
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:52,039
had plenty of time to stop um but I I reflected that you know the flashing of the lights did help you know it brought

209
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:58,760
me to attention maybe I wouldn't have had time if if they hadn't given me that signal

210
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:03,799
and then I felt really happy I thought about how the other driver you know

211
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:10,760
wasn't they didn't have time to think carefully about what they were doing there was the deer there was my car

212
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:16,480
coming around the corner there was the concern to prevent harm and so somehow

213
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:23,279
they just decided to flash their headlights quick give a signal to that other person and probably all of that

214
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:28,799
happened faster than ordinary thought so I don't know the actual mind

215
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:34,480
state of that other driver but it did remind me of what I like to call

216
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:42,120
Integrated care in action so the way in our finer moments um acts like that come

217
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:48,320
forth naturally we we just do something because that's what you do because

218
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,960
that's how uh we would care for the world around us and for the situation that we're

219
00:32:53,960 --> 00:33:00,440
in and of course we know that sometimes those inte grad care in action doesn't

220
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:07,840
come forth right we remember painful moments where it didn't come forth so I felt really happy to have

221
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:14,960
been kind of part of that in that moment in Dharma practice we don't have

222
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:22,440
to leave that kind of uh integrated care in action up to chance we can cultivate

223
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:28,559
certain wholesome qualities so that they are more likely to come forth when needed

224
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:33,880
they become a more integral part of our life and you know many of the good

225
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:41,679
qualities that we would want to cultivate and integrate are in this realm of non-harming things like meta or

226
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:49,240
Compassion or patience or care um friendliness Good

227
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:55,000
Will so many of us do learn meta practice first in the form of saying

228
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:02,960
phrases of well-wishing for various categories of beings ourself a benefactor a friend a neutral person a

229
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:09,158
difficult person and that kind of formal practice is very good it can establish

230
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:14,200
and strengthen this intention of Good Will and it can also stretch it into new

231
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:20,240
territory as we start including beings that we might not want to include at

232
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:27,720
first and there's also this radiation that we did which is also a very good way I find that to be a very effective

233
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:35,200
effective way of cultivating meta but I would say that there's yet another level to practicing meta or

234
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:40,480
Compassion or any other kind of non-harming if we want it to more fully

235
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:48,200
integrate into our action and speech and thought then we can kind of we have to take it on maybe as a training not just

236
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:55,240
a technique that we're doing So Meta is one of a set of character traits that

237
00:34:55,240 --> 00:35:00,960
are called parami that apply to a person who is walking the path to Freedom

238
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:08,359
someone who is walking the eight-fold path and they're they're meant to become you know character traits actually part

239
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:14,839
of how we are in the world in a sense and luckily long before we've completely

240
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:21,240
mastered this um you know like maybe the Buddha had long before that our mind can

241
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:27,160
call them forth reliably in our actions in in many cases and they get expressed

242
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:32,359
through how we are in the world we have kind of a general tendency toward being

243
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:37,640
kind or considerate or helpful so at the appropriate moment we might say

244
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:42,760
something helpful or not say something right or maybe flash our headlights to

245
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:50,000
alert alert another driver of a of a deer so I want to read um a quote from

246
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,319
aan suito in a book that he wrote about the about the parami these character

247
00:35:56,319 --> 00:36:02,040
traits he says when we make the resolution of kindness not just toward

248
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:08,280
kittens on a nice day but even toward cockroaches on a bad day when we include

249
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:16,319
dictators and brutal Maniacs as well as all aspects of ourselves then we're making meta into a

250
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:23,839
Perfection a vast and transfiguring way of life so it's not just kittens on a nice

251
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:31,680
day but even people whose actions are clearly harmful and even harder than that might

252
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:37,680
be to include all aspects of ourselves we all have aspects of ourselves that

253
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,560
make us cringe um and they come forth sometimes and that's you know then we

254
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:51,119
feel bad about that but we're meant to really include all of that all of it if we want to make meta nonharming into an

255
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:58,319
actual way of life um then we we try to be more and more inclusive even of those

256
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:05,119
parts that are that are still suffering within us and the promise of doing that is

257
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:11,960
quite amazing it's a potential to transform how we live in the world we don't need to start though we

258
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:19,599
don't need to start with the grandio ideas we tend to start more right here and right now with the ordinary aspects

259
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:25,640
of our life so if you're interested in in this idea of cultivating meta as

260
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:31,319
something that's a a character trait or that pervades our way of being even amid

261
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:37,760
the ups and downs we can actually start pretty much with what we've got so for

262
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:43,720
example um there's my neighbor my neighbor feeds the squirrels

263
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:51,800
he's a very nice fellow but he likes to feed the squirrels and it's kind of sweet in a way but we have this shared

264
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:59,760
entryway and sometimes when I come out the door there's a s hovering there um

265
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:06,680
and I feel they're quite bold and I feel like they're just close enough that if they wanted to they could bite me so I

266
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:12,599
have a little bit of nervousness around that sometimes and um also there's uh

267
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:18,160
you know there's a tendency since they're all there is that there's some urine stains accumulating on the

268
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:26,319
concrete also right so there's this um you know kind of mundane aspect of life

269
00:38:26,319 --> 00:38:33,839
but I've learned to f focus on my neighbor's generosity and appreciate the the very real Delight that he takes in

270
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:41,839
in giving the squirrels treats so um this practical cultivation of meta

271
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:47,880
uh helps it become more integrated in us and it comes um it comes through in

272
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:55,920
various actions of speech and body and mind that we do and if you want to uh consider you

273
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,560
know how do I actually tune into that in a practical sense I would recommend

274
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:10,640
using the energetic Sensations in the body so the way our emotions and thoughts manifest in bodily Sensations I

275
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:16,200
know not everyone can feel the body so easily but it's well worth tuning into

276
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:21,560
that uh and developing that a bit if you can so when we develop meta on the

277
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:28,319
cushion for example instead of just focusing on the phrases we can feel it directly as sensation that's what I was

278
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:33,599
inviting in the meditation this morning uh sometimes we'll feel warmth or

279
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:40,400
softness or uprightness a certain kind of dignified strength that comes in and

280
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:47,680
then as we do that on the cushion that begins to translate into daily life because we also have access to

281
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:55,200
sensations of the body maybe you know less finely when we're out in everyday world but nonetheless it's like the echo

282
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:01,000
of it from the cushion is there so we can have sensations of energy or warmth or

283
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,119
contraction we're tightening up and we can as we learn to manage those and feel

284
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:12,720
those in the body then we'll have a sense of when the mind can be oriented

285
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:19,440
toward meta and when it's starting to orient toward ill will or some form of U

286
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:25,839
harming essentially so the thought for example of my neighbor and his squirrel

287
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:31,079
feeding habit it might bring in a tightening of the throat or a sense of

288
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:36,240
judgment you shouldn't be doing that something like that but I can also

289
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:43,040
notice if I notice the discomfort of those somewhat ill will related thoughts

290
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:49,200
there's something in the heart that wants to release that and not get caught up in that and so then the Mind tries to

291
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,640
find a way to soften focus on something different expand awareness into the

292
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:01,319
bigger picture so that I can be a little more relaxed about this one little instance of something that's happening

293
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:07,520
so sensing tension and the release of tension is a great tool for learning to

294
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:13,680
relate well to both our internal mind States and to other people in the world

295
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:21,760
I think this was what aan sucho is referring to when he calls meta a way of life um meeting our own anger our own

296
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:28,040
sadness or agitation with Clarity with kindness neither resisting and judging

297
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:33,520
them uh nor believing them and collapsing into them but being able to

298
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,960
be with them we talked little earlier also about capacity having the capacity

299
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,319
to be with all the different aspects of our self one could say that's part of

300
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:50,280
what meta is part of what friendliness and goodwi is and maybe it will

301
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:57,040
translate also into meeting other people even those whose values differ from ours

302
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:02,160
um we can have some degree of flexibility or Grace in meeting them

303
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:09,359
seeing them in a bigger picture being able to treat them as the human being that they are even if we don't agree

304
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:17,400
with some of what they what they believe so if we do this if we take this

305
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:26,839
on as a training there's a part of the heart sometimes that objects a little bit and says well if I really commit to

306
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:31,920
kind Ness and Good Will and compassion as a character trait probably I'll

307
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:39,880
become a doormat and I'll I'll just start agreeing with everything I won't have empathy I won't have enough empathy

308
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:45,599
for the injustices of the world I'll just think it's all okay I haven't found

309
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:51,599
that to be true on my own as far as I've been able to go so far on this

310
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:58,520
cultivation it seems that we do still have the ability to differentiate what is helpful and what is harmful to

311
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:03,720
clearly name dictators and brutal Maniacs for instance to choose a phrase

312
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:09,160
for majan such chito's quote in fact I would say that ability even gets

313
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:15,720
sharper um but nonetheless we're at the same time broadening and softening our

314
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:20,800
mind to be able to Encompass the fullness of experience and how the world

315
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:26,480
really is out there aano goes further in this book um

316
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,559
about the part me to say that when nonharming becomes mature in a person's

317
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:38,800
heart he writes the result is a mind that is grounded in wisdom and

318
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:46,040
compassion and which easily opens to the Peace of nibana so that's Freedom

319
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:52,920
Awakening so may that be so I think that I think that is the potential is that if

320
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:59,160
we really allow uh meta Goodwill sense of friend less and care you know the

321
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:05,800
intention of non-harming to permeate our being we become more able to stand in

322
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:11,760
the world be clear about what's skillful and unskillful and yet to have the

323
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:21,599
bigger picture that the suffering doesn't penetrate our heart and so we're able to act and respond even better so

324
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:28,720
may that be the case and I encourage this um somehow with within this set of

325
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:35,280
you know New Year orientations of the mind that we tend to bring at this time of year I hope it will include the

326
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:41,079
cultivation of these traits of non-harming as is uh implied by the

327
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:48,599
second and third of the wise intentions non-il will and non cruelty or goodwi

328
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:54,000
and compassion so may it be so for all of us

329
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,040
for this world that needs it so much thank you
