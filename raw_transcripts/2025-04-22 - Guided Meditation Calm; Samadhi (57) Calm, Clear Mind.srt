1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:12,240
so hello and welcome to this 30 minute

2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:20,080
meditation and uh as we begin and and also continue the

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,119
series on samadei a word that I haven't uh

4
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:31,399
evoked uh that's closely connected to samadei is the word

5
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:37,879
samata and samata has a sounds like samadei but it has a very different

6
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:43,239
ethmology and it means to calm and

7
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:49,399
to and the whole world of samadei has a lot to do with

8
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:55,640
calming calming the body calming the heart calming the

9
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:02,879
mind and uh and so one of the ways maybe of

10
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,080
practicing today that maybe builds on how we've

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,560
been practicing samadei for the last now over three

12
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,960
months is um to have a gentle emphasis

13
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:26,640
on calming the mind and what I mean by gentle is that um almost as if you're

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:34,960
not doing anything uh except maybe uh at at a choice points

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:42,600
saying the word calm or calming in a very unforceful

16
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,840
un expecting kind of way and allowing something in the mind to come the

17
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:57,680
primary kind of the real important area of us that's for samadei to calm is a

18
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:05,040
calming of the mind calming of mental activity a quieting of mental activity

19
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,319
even certain mental activity uh uh ceases during deep

20
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:16,959
samadei for example there's the end of discursive thinking commentary

21
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:24,400
conversations in the mind images and of great stories and the the

22
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,160
image-making mind quiets down dramatically and the mind gets quieter

23
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:37,680
and quieter and one wonderful metaphor for this is um the waves on a on a lake

24
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,920
or lay waves on the ocean when the wind is there big big waves can be born can

25
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:51,599
arise when the wind quiets down so do the waves till finally when there's no

26
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:58,080
wind there are no waves when there are no discursive thoughts no active

27
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:05,760
thinking reacting to what's happening in the mind uh that uh now the waves of the mind

28
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:14,400
become very quiet and as the waves on the lake become still then the uh the

29
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:24,840
lake becomes clear we can see right down to the bottom so as we do this practice today

30
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:33,440
um for the uh inhale just let the inhale fill your

31
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,599
with the with the air filling your lungs uh with the movements of the body as you

32
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,200
breathe in have a feeling of that attention spreads through your body so

33
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,360
you feel and sense uh widening circles of your body just a kind of a feeling a

34
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,560
sensing sometimes different parts of the body sometimes more like a starting from

35
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,480
some the resting point the centering grounding point of breathing that it

36
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:10,080
spreads outwards into your body like a broadening wave and then on the exhale begin the

37
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,120
beginning of this sitting have the exhale be a place that relaxes

38
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,600
relaxes the body just allow something to relax and then let there be a brief

39
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:29,320
pause at the end of the exhale just long enough to say the word

40
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:36,280
calm or calming which functions as a

41
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:43,280
reminder for the waves of the mind to become calm

42
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:50,320
no matter what is happening to you nothing to solve nothing to fix and

43
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:57,479
nothing to figure out it's just a time to let the mind

44
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:05,120
calm calm calming of the mind and uh trust just the increasing

45
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:12,400
just letting the mind become quiet and still the waves of the mind settle out

46
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,759
so breathing in to feel what's here breathing out to kind of in the

47
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:24,600
beginning of the sitting to relax the body and then it's and then a brief

48
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,479
pause then long enough before you breathe in saying

49
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,840
calm reminding the mind it can become calm after a while you want to stop

50
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,280
doing the relaxing on the exhale it's no longer needed and at some point maybe

51
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:50,880
you don't even want to do the active kind of expanding of awareness into the whole body it's enough just to be in the

52
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,680
whole body um breathing in and breathing

53
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:05,600
out but maybe again at the end of the exhale calm and if you get particularly calm uh

54
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:13,360
you don't have to say the word calm anymore you can just say just a nonverbal recognition ah this is a time

55
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:20,080
to calm or maybe just say in your mind

56
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:28,000
ah so assuming a meditation uh

57
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:36,440
posture a posture that in some ways makes you

58
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:42,160
bigger whether you're lying down or sitting or standing

59
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,400
for meditation kind of be be somehow

60
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,960
stretched opened a feeling of being expansive in

61
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,160
your posture not crunched not crunching any part of your

62
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:06,240
body as if you can become large

63
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:17,759
big expansive posture and gently close your

64
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:26,800
eyes and take three or four deeper breaths to begin this process of feeling

65
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:33,198
the body on the inhale relaxing on the

66
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:43,000
exhale and saying the word calm to yourself at the end of the exhale

67
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:18,080
and then to let your breathing return to normal and

68
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:28,560
gently let your awareness spread through your body as you

69
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:37,599
inhale relaxing ing the body on the

70
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:46,320
exhale pausing with the word

71
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:55,480
calm calm mind no matter what you're concerned

72
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:03,080
with no issue nothing to do or fix or solve

73
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,560
except trust the value of calming the

74
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,440
mind stilling the mind

75
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,800
if any part of this

76
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:38,200
exercise seems stressful

77
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:45,160
are too much work lighten up do it

78
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,480
simpler and simpler

79
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,079
rather than waiting for a pause in the

80
00:13:55,079 --> 00:14:03,680
exhale to say calm you might begin or gently ly say

81
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:12,040
it during the exhale in a way that

82
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:19,160
slides into the stillness at the end of the exhale

83
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,639
so you feel the silence of the mind at the end of the

84
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,639
exhale

85
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:46,360
as you meditate trust the calming distilling of the mind

86
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,600
and it might be that all you

87
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,160
do is very

88
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:05,440
quietly whisper the word

89
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:11,200
calm as you breathe in and as you breathe

90
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,760
out making less and less effort

91
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:26,789
at meditating in [Music]

92
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,320
favor of a stilling

93
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:38,640
quieting of all distractions all

94
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:48,559
thoughts being here in this

95
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:04,200
body with an expanding sense of

96
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,320
calm pervading all things

97
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:09,600
any agitation you have any active thinking you

98
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:21,679
have focus on calming underneath it

99
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:28,399
let there be a deep calming in the mind that's

100
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,400
below the thinking

101
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,519
mind that is the source of the thinking

102
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:49,640
mind trust this deep stilling of the waves

103
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:56,960
by trusting the peace and the

104
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,799
quiet that's in the lake below the waves

105
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,679
and as we come to the end of the

106
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:18,960
sitting to feel or sense whatever degree of calm is here

107
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:27,400

calmness are you are your eyes it's through your calmness that you

113
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:18,559

114
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:26,279

141
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,158
thank you

142
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:26,360
so hello and welcome to the next talk in this samadei series

143
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:33,399
and today's talk is um kind of one of the themes of it is

144
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:41,039
calm because the general topic this week is the fourth Janna and the fourth Janna

145
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:48,200
represents a very profound calming of the mind calming of mental

146
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:54,640
activities and if you understand that a lot of the agitation that we have comes

147
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:02,039
from thinking as the thinking quiets down that doesn't trigger

148
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:08,000
agitation and we appreciate how um the mind that is for and against

149
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:15,279
things or reacts to pleasure and pain u quiets down and calms down the

150
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:20,720
relationship to pleasure and pain recedes and quiets and surprisingly

151
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:29,679
enough uh we might not feel much pre pleasure and pain certainly there are times when uh

152
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:35,960
pain gets uh actu

153
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:42,840
accentuated by our preoccupation with it by our vigilance against it by

154
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:49,519
our meaning making and fear and predictions around the pain we feel the

155
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:57,440
micro muscles around the pain tighten up the pain just seems larger in the mind it's like a magnifying glass on it but

156
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:03,519
when we no longer are caught in the preoccupation with pain something of

157
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,878
sometimes even the pain recedes into the background and in this quieting calming

158
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:14,480
of mental activities in the fourth genre um that uh pain and pleasure of all

159
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,040
kinds just recedes and becomes irrelevant disappears from the

160
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:26,240
mind and it represents a a kind of a uh

161
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:31,398
a uh a certain kind of coming into fullness or

162
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:38,480
completion certain kind of the gradual calming uh of the mind that goes on throughout

163
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:45,638
samadei practice and the somati practice has a general uh name of being called

164
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:51,358
samata and samat s a m- a t h a uh

165
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:57,240
sounds like samadei but it's a different word and samata means to calm

166
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:02,320
tranquility and uh it's a calming tranquilizing of the mind making

167
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,520
tranquil peaceful tranquil like a deep clear

168
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:14,720
tranquil lake and um and so we're we're calming mental

169
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:21,040
activities and the mind gets calmer and calmer and it's not turning the mind off

170
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:26,760
it's just quieting certain activities of the mind that are extra that they're not

171
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:37,000
needed and uh and in and what comes in return is um a a tremendous sense of

172
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,200
clarity and uh the tradition calls it a pure clear

173
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:48,000
mind and um and uh it feels like this is like the

174
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,800
way the mind is the healthiest most present most fully alive uh in this uh

175
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:00,520
vast pure clarity of the mind that can be there clarity of clarity of

176
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:06,960
awareness and um and so it's not going into a trance it's not kind of checking

177
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:13,599
out it's not becoming unaware but uh there's no thinking

178
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:19,720
uh no um acts of you know

179
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:26,880
um recognition of what's there but there might be a deep nonverbal knowing that

180
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,599
is part and parcel of the clear pure mind but there's no

181
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:38,320
thoughts and uh but there's a kind of clear knowing that there's no thoughts

182
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:45,040
but we're not telling oursel there's no thoughts it's just kind of it just it's just known without any effort without

183
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:51,839
any agitation or any waves and um and because this calming of

184
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:57,200
the mental activity has gone more and more the way that we take in sense data

185
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,560
from our body from the world around us begins to quiet as well we're not

186
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:09,760
actively taking in sense data the places that we register sense data on the body

187
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:16,800
don't operate in a conceptual way anymore it's not taking in the data and putting it into the usual concepts we

188
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:25,520
have of body hand room sound distance here there there's

189
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:31,119
all these subtle ways which we take for granted which is kind of kind of

190
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:36,280
recognizing the truth of reality that it is a kind of

191
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:41,320
conceptualization of the sense data that comes in in a particular

192
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:49,280
way and um and so even something as innocent as me you know recognizing this

193
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:55,280
here as a bell it is a bell but there there's

194
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:03,599
a a subtle mental activity that recognizes as a bell and um and it feels

195
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:11,160
effortless it feels you know nonverbal but uh it is um uh it's

196
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:17,240
contextual it's uh learned it's um

197
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:23,599
um a concept an idea that in another time in another situation this same

198
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:30,000
object might be used as a holder holder of paper clips a pen holder it might be

199
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,240
a spatoon it's so solid it could even be someone's pot that they put on top of a

200
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:42,880
fire to cook their soup and someone called call this a pot so the context

201
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,440
changes what this is and so so that there so there's a very subtle

202
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:56,000
conceptual activity of the mind that makes that choice what they able to call it and then deep in the fourth genre

203
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,200
this kind of conceptualization is quieted down and so there might still be

204
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:07,160
a recognition that there's something here but it doesn't have a name it doesn't con it's not

205
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:12,560
conceptualized so in the same way with our body we're We're not conceptualizing

206
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,839
our body in the usual way and the body begins to become diffuse no clear

207
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:23,800
boundaries no clear details it's just kind of a generalized peaceful

208
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:31,200
clear kind of vibration or flow and this explains a little bit the metaphor

209
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:38,000
that's used for the fourth Janna sitting in the fourth Janna is just as

210
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:46,240
though a person were sitting covered from head down down with a white cloth

211
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:52,960
so that no part of this of one's whole body so no part of one's whole body is

212
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,320
not covered by the white cloth so a white cloth represents a cloth that's

213
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:05,160
very clean and and um in which um

214
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:11,359
the light that comes through a white cloth sometimes feels very diffuse and

215
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:17,599
clear and wonderful and um and so the idea of sitting with a white cloth covering

216
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:23,599
ourselves our whole body is um wouldn't it's not strange for the ancient Indian

217
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:30,480
world because that there was no de there was no mosquito nettings and so the way

218
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:37,760
to be kind of untroubled by insects was to cover yourself with a blanket with a

219
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:44,320
shawl with a cloth and um so the people meditate monks would

220
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:49,520
sit meditating that way and and from the outside you know there's a human body

221
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:56,720
underneath the cloth but there are no details there's no clarity of exactly the shape the sit the shape the

222
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:02,000
characteristics of that body it's diffused and kind of uncar characterized

223
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,839
except for a general sense of the outline that's in the cloth and um at

224
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:13,839
the same time the person inside it feels very cozy and very safe and very

225
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:20,720
comfortable um where where there's no real sharp kind of boundary in a sense to the outer

226
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:27,119
world in the felt sense there's a soft kind of clear light feeling light with

227
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:36,400
weight and light that's as luminous and um and uh some people uh uh

228
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:42,560
in order to harmonize this metaphor with the idea of the lake in the second and

229
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:48,160
third um uh Janna the metaphors for the third

230
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:53,520
second and third Janna uh the lotuses that are floating in the lake the person

231
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,640
just floating in water and they get very clean then they come out of the water

232
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:04,240
and sit under the tree to meditate and they wrap themselves in a clean towel

233
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:10,880
completely wrapped and covered feeling a pure clean

234
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:18,000
uh fresh quiet content in this way the feeling of being

235
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,560
in the third Janna feels very clean

236
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:28,920
pure content peaceful kind of indistinct nothing's

237
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:36,560
needed everything is cozy so um and there's no pleasure and pain

238
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:43,440
because the quieting quieting of that part of the mind that registers and conceptualize and engages in the

239
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:50,319
construction of pleasure and pain has gotten very very quiet that's both physical pleasure and

240
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:56,000
pain and also a mental pleasure and pain that might be emotional

241
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,560
so this is the description abandoning pleasure and

242
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:08,359
pain with a previous disappearance of mental happiness and mental

243
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:14,440
suffering one enters and abides with neither pain nor

244
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:20,560
pleasure in the purity of a quantamus awareness of the

245
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:29,280
fourth Janna when sits pervading this body with a pure clear mind when sits pervading

246
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:36,040
this body with a clean clear mind so that no part of the entire body is

247
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:42,880
untouched by the pure clear mind it is just as a just as though a person were

248
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:51,040
sitting covered from the head down with a white cloth so there is no part of

249
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:58,240
one's whole body that is not covered by that white

250
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,318
cloth so

251
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:13,480
um may you find calm may you find the calm that

252
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:18,920
comes from not overthinking

253
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:24,760
overreacting over involved being over involved with our present

254
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:30,760
moment let calm be your companion through the

255
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:38,880
day and in whatever way you can and maybe the calm is the calm of not adding

256
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:49,799
more agitation to the circumstant you're in may it be a calm day thank you
