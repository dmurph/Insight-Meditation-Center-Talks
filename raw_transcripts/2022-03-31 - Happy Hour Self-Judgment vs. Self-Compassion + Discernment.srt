1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:09,679
okay here we go so hello hello and welcome to happy hour everyone glad

2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:15,440
you're here glad we are practicing together at this time

3
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:21,199
coming together with our intentions with our goodness to cultivate and support

4
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,320
ourselves support each other so the theme for

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,359
this evening um is uh self-judgment

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,320
self-discernment and self-compassion [Music]

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:45,120
so so self-judgment you're probably

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:52,160
well we're all familiar with self-judgment oh darn it i didn't do this right oh i'm

9
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:59,600
no good i'm bad i'm terrible you know hurling various insights at ourselves when we make a

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,878
mistake or we don't perform or we forget something

11
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:12,159
or or we don't get something done you know hurling insults you're lazy

12
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,439
you're not good oh you know your flavor fill in your your own versions of

13
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:24,520
of self-judgment now self-discernment is different

14
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,880
self-discernment with self-compassion so

15
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:36,560
self-discernment is when there is self-compassion actually let me bring you self-compassion self-compassion

16
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,560
is the best antidote is the best way to meet self-judgment because

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,479
we often have this wrong perspective that if we

18
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,920
self-flagellate and if we abuse ourselves we're going to whip ourselves into shape and yes we're going to

19
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,320
actually perform better and do things and and it's not true and there's research

20
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:07,119
actually supporting that psychological research that um people who have who are more

21
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,280
self-compassionate in fact they take more responsibility

22
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:19,520
instead of blaming themselves or blaming others actually they take responsibility

23
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,520
and and um the the

24
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,760
um instead of having shame they have remorse so let me actually say a little bit about

25
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:38,000
that so shame is not helpful shame is when you feel ashamed

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,319
really small this feeling of a sense of feeling small and inadequate

27
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,360
it makes you even smaller and more inadequate for taking responsibility for

28
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:56,160
doing what's right if you're either for yourself or or for the benefit of others

29
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:03,680
however what is helpful is remorse remorse is skillful remorse is helpful

30
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,560
to reflect to have discernment about something that went wrong and to intend

31
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:17,400
to correct it for your own benefit for the benefit of others so there's a sense of

32
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,040
uprightness clarity and a sense of kindness towards yourself and others

33
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:30,560
that self-judgment doesn't have self-judgment is very painful just it's as if you're

34
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,360
taking a dagger and and hurting yourself throwing perfectly good moments after

35
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,000
the moments that are already gone whereas with

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,159
self-compassion um when there is a sense of self-compassion self-care self-kindness

37
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:56,959
one has and this is really important i want to make this very clear

38
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,799
when there is enough kindness for oneself in the psyche

39
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,000
one can take responsibility and say oh sweetheart yeah okay that was not good

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,400
okay all right you messed up and i still love you you're not bad we'll do better instead

41
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,160
of the comparison if there is no self compassion it's like oh you screwed up

42
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:27,600
you're terrible you're awful you're not worth living you're you're not worth it like ouch ouch ouch one gets smaller and

43
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:35,120
smaller and smaller again i'm exaggerating but sometimes the way we speak to ourselves is not that

44
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,360
different whereas again the scenario is self-compassion one has the capacity and this is what

45
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:48,000
research has been done about that folks were invited to remember some

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,040
indiscretion something that they regretted having done and then one group

47
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,160
was asked to have a reflection of self-kindness and

48
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,759
another group was um i forget what the control group was with but it was definitely not a

49
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:10,720
compassion or kindness and the group that actually was uh primed with kindness and

50
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,000
compassion they took more responsibility for the action

51
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,840
um without shame but actually responsibly like yes this was not an appropriate and

52
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,039
they they um instead of pointing the blame pointing the finger

53
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,320
at others which is the control group which was not the compassion group

54
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:39,600
they pointed the fingers at others oh it was their fault it was their fault i didn't you know it would i was okay whereas

55
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,680
when there's kindness you can actually take responsibility for what you've done wrong

56
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:53,360
because it doesn't hurt it's like okay it's all right it's okay i'm still okay i'm still the word worthy of love and

57
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,560
care and compassion separating

58
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,639
the self-worth from the behavior separating those two and that's where

59
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:11,840
the discernment comes in the self-discernment becomes available when we have

60
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,360
self-compassion so self-compassion makes self-discernment

61
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,639
with mistakes available to to do better

62
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:30,400
with remorse whereas self-judgment just brings out shame and it's just a spiral downhill

63
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,840
so i have said plenty

64
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,520
and what i'll invite you in a minute is

65
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,280
we'll just explore we'll just explore these um

66
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:54,080
self-judgment self-discernment self-compassion just how they feel in the body these are not ideas i mean well

67
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,520
there are concepts but really we need to feel them we need to feel them in the body

68
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:07,039
embodiment embodiment embodiment so when all else fails

69
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:13,199

and now if you like i'd like to invite you

115
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:35,600
to bring to mind perhaps something today

116
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,400
or this week

117
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:50,280
that you perhaps had some self-judgment about

118
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:08,320
maybe not the most challenging or difficult event but something relatively

119
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:15,520
challenging not top one but maybe three or four down

120
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,640
the list bringing this

121
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,520
event to mind

122
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:35,679
and perhaps as i invite you to do this maybe some contraction arises in the body

123
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:41,200
the heart mind manifested showing up felt in the sensations of the

124
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,200
body

125
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:59,200
first getting a clear description of what it was say oh you wasted time today

126
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:06,799
you had so much to do and you wasted time or you did this and it was unkind

127
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,000
or whatever it might be

128
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:22,720
and now i'd like to invite you to put it down

129
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:29,799
release it for the purpose of this practice release let it go

130
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,080
we'll come back to it in a minute we just did this to get a sense of the

131
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,880
contraction and what it feels like in the heart and mind

132
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,919
and now let us feel held conjuring up

133
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:55,039
your compassionate being one who represents

134
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:03,760
the paragon of compassion kindness complete acceptance for you

135
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,080
could be someone in your life maybe a parent grandparent

136
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:16,000
or maybe it's the buddha

137
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,240
or kuan yin [Music] or any being that

138
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:28,760
resembles that signifies

139
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:37,440
compassion acceptance for you it might even be your pet

140
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,120
it just looks at you lovingly completely compassionately kindly

141
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:49,520
acceptance maybe you see them as the deity of

142
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:56,799
compassion whoever whatever

143
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:05,120
fulfills this role this compassionate being for you conjure them up

144
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,840

150
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,360

completely held

154
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,360
let yourself soak it up don't get in your own way

155

156
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,480
through being health and kindness

157
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,120
acceptance

158
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,120
just as you are

159
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,799
now as you soak in their kindness

160
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,720
maybe even physically let yourself be held

161
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:05,240
if it feels appropriate maybe you're sitting on the lap of the buddha

162
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:19,399
there there here it's okay it's okay

163
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:48,000
let your heart be open stay open to receiving

164
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,840
kindness soothing healing

165
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,039
acceptance

166
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,480
just as you are

167
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,480
and now bringing up this

168
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,919
misstep this challenge you had earlier today

169
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:35,919
this week what you were judging yourself or earlier

170
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:42,240
the space of compassion come bring it up bring it up

171
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:48,640
and share it put it on the lap of this compassionate being

172
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:55,120
in your mind's eye let them hold it with you

173
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:07,360
and from their compassionate perspective pay attention listen to what comes up

174
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,120
and helping you supporting you with it

175
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:49,360
maybe the compassionate being reminds you of some difficulty that you've had

176
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:01,919
which has led to this maybe they remind you that you are doing

177
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:09,120
your best if you could have done better in this circumstance you would have

178
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,720
to be kind and gentle with yourself

179
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,080
maybe through their love and care they support you to feel

180
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:46,398
not shame but remorse

181
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:56,640
we should have been different but it couldn't be how can it be different

182
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,880
in the future accepting loving

183
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:09,840
that it had to be the way it was or it would have been different

184
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:17,039
given all the causes and conditions it had to be exactly

185
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:23,840
as it was given what came before

186
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:45,600
let there be discernment awakened in this field of compassion

187
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:50,279
and care and acceptance

188
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,398
complete acceptance

189
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:12,679
sense of a brightness empowered compassion for yourself

190
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,880
feeling yourself held

191
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:07,039
the compassion acceptance love of the compassionate being

192
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:14,720
returning to that is their primary

193
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,080
object in the awareness

194
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:31,440
feeling health it's okay

195
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:38,120
it's okay you're doing your best

196
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,720
coming back to the body

197
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,320
feeling the breath in the abdomen being breathed

198
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:36,000
here here offering your heart offering your

199
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,398

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:09,680
to ourselves and all beings everywhere may all beings be free

204
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,240

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,240
thank you all thank you for your practice

206
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:38,880
so [Music] he

207
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:45,359
one one phrase that was coming to my mind is one by suzuki roshi

208
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:53,359
that says you are perfect as you are and you could use a little improvement

209
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:04,480
and just the wisdom of acceptance and and practice and and doing our best so

210
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:10,319
perfect as you are and you could use a little improvement

211
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:18,800
so so [Music] you're welcome to uh you're invited to

212
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:24,640
to share if you like what discoveries aha moments perhaps came up

213
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:30,800
for you in your practice [Music]

214
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,839
maybe challenges for the benefit of yourself and benefit of others to

215
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:41,440
share them practice report report from the field

216
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,760
it's always helpful for others and you can type them to me individually

217
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:54,880
privately in which case i'll read the reflection not your name and if it's typed to everyone i will read your name

218
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:00,880
also or you can raise your zoom head your physical hand i will likely not see

219
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:07,040
thank you for the beautiful sitting you are very welcome says one of you

220
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:12,720
any reflections you like to share what what was it like was it did it feel

221
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:18,800
different when you [Music] brought up this shortcoming

222
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:26,240
and alone the field of self-judgment and then later in the field of self-compassion is there

223
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,400
something that shifted were there awarenesses observations or

224
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:37,800
empowerments oh that came up linda please

225
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:45,119
um oh i'm nervous about doing this so i'll try and give myself self compassion

226
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:51,200
i had a really hard time imagining anybody who could

227
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:56,960
who could give me that who could wrap their arms around i mean you know and

228
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,560
i didn't ever get that as a kid but but so that's my causes and conditions

229
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:08,079
but i you know i could imagine my dogs looking at me with those loving eyes

230
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:15,599
and i also could imagine myself doing it but i just kept going back to

231
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:20,640
certain people that i thought should be doing that for me

232
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:27,040
and you know it it wasn't there i yeah so that that was my difficulty yeah yeah

233
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:34,480
thank you for sharing that linda and and um to appreciate you bringing it up and and what i'd say actually i don't hear

234
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:40,400
that as a difficulty let me tell you why the difficulty perhaps there was

235
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:47,280
difficulty in trying to get it from places that's like yeah i'm not quite yeah like you should be doing yeah so

236
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:53,440
that doesn't work and yet what i'm hearing in the beauty of what you shared is that yes

237
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,880
it was available to you there's from yourself good heavens that is

238
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:06,000
gorgeous because i usually actually bring in the compassionate being you know the buddha kuan yin or being of

239
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,520
light or because often folks have difficulty

240
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,839
giving it to themselves so hallelujah

241
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:26,720
yeah this is great and of course you had your your your dog supporting you there too the the the um the the the

242
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,800
compassionate beings that they are you know it's always fun to make them into a deity of compassion you know your dog

243
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,000
looking at you here like you know sitting across i don't know cross-legged so

244
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,480
so yay okay yeah thank you thank you thank you so

245
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:52,000

um yeah yes allowing helped out sure

247
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:07,200
uh wanted to show my source of compassion [Music] wanted to show my source of compassion

248
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:13,440
not sure what that means claire steve says combining self-compassion

249
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:20,960
with the practice of seeing sleepiness distraction or whatever it is as awesome

250
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,880
as in monday's discussion is very helpful great great thank you steve

251
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,000
wonderful yeah great

252
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,640
one more reflection privately it's pretty incredible how it actually feels in the

253
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:43,760
body the reactivity and pain of the experience and then the warmth and

254
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:50,960
comfort and okayness when compassion was present we don't always need the answers or for

255
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,400
the painful experiences to go away sometimes holding and accepting

256
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:04,319
and loving just as is is enough beautifully said beautifully said i

257
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:11,599
couldn't have said it better thank you exactly noticing the difference and doesn't have to go away compassion can

258
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:18,720
hold it all beautiful yeah great

259
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:24,560
so so i'd like to invite us

260
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:30,160
um at this point if you wish to

261
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:37,200
to turn into practicing with compassion

262
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:43,599
in small groups and

263
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:48,800
and the invitation in the small groups is to

264
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,880
only speak from your own experience and you can also be silent in the small

265
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:01,440
group you can when it your turn comes you can say pass you can hold

266
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:08,720
compassionate silence for others it's perfectly okay being fully present

267
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:16,160
it's a way that you're offering support to others and to yourself so speaking from your own experience

268
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:23,680
alone not managing not reflecting on other people's experience

269
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:29,599
and um you're welcome to share one nugget one

270
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:35,200
brief nugget then the next person will share a nugget perhaps or say pass

271
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:40,400
the third person will come back to you and then go round and round and please

272
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:47,599
this is a sacred space it's not just go talk amongst yourselves imagine that you are the compassionate

273
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:54,560
being for these other two human beings and they are the compassionate being for

274
00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:00,640
you giving and receiving in not an overbearing way but maybe it's just

275
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:06,560
silent so so this is the invitation for this evening

276
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:13,839
um and i will create the rooms in the moment

277
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,359
and maybe let's see anything else i want to

278
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:26,400
add before we start the groups and maybe we'll go reverse alphabetical order

279
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:31,520
um or just for the fun of it

280
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:38,839
and yeah i think i think that's it and stay

281
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:46,400
embodied stay in your body stay in your bodies don't get heady i think it's important

282
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:52,400
not to get heady so stay embodied um stay

283
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:59,359

284
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:04,880
and one more minute

285
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,680

286
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,440
okay welcome back everyone all the rooms are closed and we have just about a

287
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:22,640
couple of minutes if any insights reflections have come up that you like to share

288
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:26,799
for the benefit of yourself and others

289
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:33,800
again you're welcome to raise your zoom hand or you can type a chat

290
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:49,720

291
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,880
quiet bunch tonight

292
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:08,799
which is perfectly fine dave

293
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:15,520
yeah nikki thinks that was a great practice um great class i think he structured it really well i could see

294
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:21,440
clearly that self judgment is what i do when i compare myself to others my my college

295
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:28,960
classmates and how you know how well they're doing and how poorly i'm doing and oh you know and i can also see how

296
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:37,200
uh beating myself up is a way of feeling good about you know i'm right about being wrong and i feel

297
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:45,760
that's a strange dynamic but i can tell self-discernment is when i see it with compassion i see because of the way

298
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:52,400
things happened in my past the causes and conditions yeah so that's that's of course the way it went that way

299
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:59,359
so that really worked well for me thank you very much beautiful thank you so much dave thank you for sharing that

300
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:05,119
beautiful great steve please

301
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:10,240
i just it was very nice to ended up in a group where the other two

302
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:18,160
people were not only knew each other but were related so that was seemed to me quite synchronistic and

303
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:24,319
amazing but they said it actually happened once before as well so that's pretty nice

304
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:30,160
nice nice the pleasure of being in groups and when people are

305
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:37,920
related unrelated we're all human beings we're all related and maybe actually closer relationships beautiful
