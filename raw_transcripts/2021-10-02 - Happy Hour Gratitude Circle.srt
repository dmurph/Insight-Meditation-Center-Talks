1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,640
okay now formally hello and welcome [Music]

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,840
to happy hour this friday or saturday for some of you

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:19,119
it's already saturday or might be a different day if you're listening on audiodharma

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,720
so [Music] for our practice today

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:32,880
as i gave you a slight preview i guess on wednesday a couple days ago

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,600
the invitation is to to invite our heart in the practice of

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:47,440
gratitude but the way we will approach it tonight today is a little different from how

8
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,719
we've approached it in the past always a new there's so many different ways to do

9
00:00:52,719 --> 00:01:01,039
these practices have you noticed we always discover something new about our hearts and about our capacity

10
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,760
so the way i'd like to invite us to consider the gratitude practice today is is

11
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,799
somewhat similar to metta in that

12
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:19,680
we will [Music] uh engage in pri in gratitude practice for the people in our lives as if we're

13
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:26,479
doing some kind of a life review but with the perspective the perspective of appreciation

14
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:33,600
perspective of gratitude so just as in meta practice we would invite

15
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,960
first people who are near and dear to us the concentric circles will do that and

16
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,880
and invite them with a sense of appreciation with a sense of gratitude

17
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,920
so tonight in our practice it's as if we'll have a little visit with each

18
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:59,280
person we'll stay for a little bit just appreciate them appreciate what

19
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,280
they have brought into our lives um [Music] qualities our friendships our

20
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,720
relationships and we linger with them hang out with them

21
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,920
in our heart space for a while and then we move on to the next and

22
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:23,200
um just to say some a couple of things to note one is

23
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,280
the longer we stay with one person the more the steadier our heart

24
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,879
and mind become so if we're doing this practice for the sake of

25
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:40,480
concentration developing concentration we would stay with one person for the

26
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,720
entirety of the period which is what we do with meta we usually stay with one

27
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,920
person for a long time so please know that but tonight we're

28
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,000
just approaching it a little differently so if you notice your mind getting a little restless or starting thinking too

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,840
much then just stay with one person okay and you judge if your mind is pretty

30
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,159
stable having a visit with one person and then another person enters and you

31
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:16,800
have a visit a gratitude visit in your heart with this other person then it's okay

32
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,560
you can move on from person to person to person so be your own guide see what

33
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,720
works for you how long to linger with one person um as long as your mind is is pretty

34
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:36,560
stable doesn't get too um to too scattered okay

35
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,400
and one last thing i want to say before we engage in our practice is that

36
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,319
um as you will notice there are

37
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:55,680
similarities of course there are similarities between the practice of meta loving-kindness wishes

38
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:03,200
for well-being and the practice of feeling grateful appreciating for

39
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,120
apprecia expressing appreciation in our hearts for someone

40
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,280
and while you might notice you might notice that

41
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:22,720
they lead to one another and in fact appreciating having gratitude for

42
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:29,520
someone easily leads to easily leads to goodwill for them oh thank you for being in my

43
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:36,080
life thank you for having been in my life oh may you be well i wish you well so you

44
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:42,880
you might discover that the heart naturally flows from one to the other so be mindful be aware

45
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:49,680
and [Music] at any point if

46
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,520
the mind needs more stability and quiet just come just come to one person or

47
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:03,680
come to yourself just stably appreciating this being who is you okay

48
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,199
all right that is the framework for our practice

49
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,479

so we approached gratitude practice today

168
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:25,960
slightly differently gratitude for people in our lives present and past

169
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,039
in the style of a life review almost

170
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:42,560
and this practice tonight is inspired by some practice in

171
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:50,160
the book a year to live by peter peter levine

172
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:56,640
so so love to hear your reflections what did

173
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:03,680
you notice what came up for you you can raise your hand or type in chat

174
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:09,760
and again if you type in chat just to me i will only read your reflection not

175
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:16,640
your name if it's to everyone i'll also acknowledge your name and as i'm waiting for your hands to go

176
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:22,480
up and your reflections to come in and your or your questions um

177
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:28,960
oh great i already see your reflection please fred

178
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:38,720
i noticed and i was struck by the fact that in a couple of cases

179
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:47,680
people i thought of who i wouldn't say i'm the closest to had the strongest emotional valence

180
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:55,200
i i felt our connection i could remember some words that we had spoken not about the

181
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:00,720
so long ago and had a lot of emotion for me it was um

182
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:07,839
it was it was touching and pleasing and where

183
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:14,960
so that's someone who's you know a friend a friend but not someone i see all the time and not

184
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:20,960
not someone i would think of as being in the closest circle of my heart uh still

185
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:27,119
had a lot of love and energy there and that was a nice surprise

186
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:35,599
thank you so much for for sharing that friend that gladdens my heart that that

187
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:42,240
surprise of oh wow as we practice

188
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:49,040
just these beautiful discoveries how lovely it brightens my heart as as i

189
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:55,839
feel your heart brightened by this lovely surprise thanks for sharing fred that's lovely

190
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,440
other reflections what did you notice

191
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,920
don please

192
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:22,560
thank you um i noticed uh all the people i was surprised just uh

193
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:29,119
it sort of appeared oh wow i haven't thought about you in a long time it was

194
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:35,520
was nice and um and and the other thing i confess i was

195
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:41,440
um sort of overwhelmed and uh and i sort of had a retreat after a while and this

196
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:48,720
were focused on myself for a bit but uh very nice practice thank you

197
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:55,760
great thank you don i love hearing the sense of just the joy of wow so many people in

198
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,960
this gladness and also really appreciate hearing how

199
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:07,680
you wisely worked with a sense of overwhelm because overwhelm can indeed come up with this practice like wow so

200
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,280
many people and probably there's so many more people i haven't thought about or whatever however overwhelm comes and

201
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,640
just coming back to yourself wonderful great great lovely thanks for

202
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:24,319
sharing that yeah that came up for me also that the sense of wow so many

203
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:31,599
people so many people i hadn't thought about in a long time some childhood friends some family

204
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:36,880
members some people from way way way way back it was just

205
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:43,760
so just so lovely so many people who've touched my lives and just being with who

206
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,599
they are they've graced my life with with their presence

207
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:54,960
jerry says i noticed a much wider gratitude list that i needed

208
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,720
to pay attention to and the nuance of the different types of gratitude

209
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:05,920
for all of them yes yeah thank you jerry i appreciate that

210
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:11,920
so a wider list it's just both a white list and also the nuances of gratitude

211
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:17,200
for different types actually i wonder if you you'd be willing to say a little more

212
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:22,720
you don't have to but if if you like to um what you mean what you notice about this

213
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:31,359
nuance that you're referring to i don't where are you i don't see you to ask you to raise your hand uh hold that

214
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:36,119
there okay try now

215
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,400
um so uh i know i speak uh frequently so i don't

216
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,520
want to hog the time but uh you have you haven't for a while so i'm trying to

217
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:53,760
restrict myself i can talk a lot but anyhow um so uh

218
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,880
it was the issue that like i really liked these uh sanghas

219
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:05,520
they really have transformed my life i you know i actually was commenting to someone at lunch today

220
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:11,520
another colleague and her she recently lost her um husband

221
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:17,119
and she said haven't you felt lonely in this uh period of of um

222
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:23,359
covert and i said you know i i don't feel lonely and i was reflecting to my own psychiatrist about this

223
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:28,880
and i said you know this sangha it is taken me into such gravitas

224
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:34,480
that a nuance that uh uh

225
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:41,040
and depth and growth that uh it's not even part of my feelings and

226
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:47,680
i'm quite impressed by it you know i've gone on retreat as you know with joseph goldstein and they talked about having

227
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:53,760
you know faith in the dharma faith in the in your practice and in the sang and of course

228
00:45:53,760 --> 00:46:00,160
in a large city i live in getting to sangha and traffic and subway trains and all that i did never do it but this has

229
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:07,839
been quite amazing and so it's part of the nuances of the gratitude that i have for this sangha that there are so many

230
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:13,520
different people from different walks of life and and continence

231
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:19,920
that it has overwhelmed me at times with the

232
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,280
richness and when i go to bed at night and write out three things that i'm grateful for

233
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,319
i'm amazed that the sangha comes up almost each day

234
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:36,319
as one of the three and i i never thought in my life that that

235
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:43,280
would be such a major part and so i'm ever so grateful that it's going to continue after covet it's one of the

236
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:49,359
richnesses of a life that i never thought would when i was on retreat with joseph goldstein

237
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:55,200
with you as my tutor in 2014 i remember thinking of sangha how am i going to get

238
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:02,240
to a sanctuary in toronto like it takes me uh uh you know half an hour to go 20 blocks or 10 blocks or something

239
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:08,000
and uh now i did now i just click on that computer and here you are

240
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,319
everyone from australia to ireland and back so that's an example of the nuances and

241
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:20,880
there are many others but that was one and i also thought of students and professors and other people who have

242
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:27,440
influenced where i am today and as long as i'm alive

243
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:32,000
i will try to make this place a better place

244
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:40,319
thank you so much jerry good thank you so much for your reflection has brought up so much joy and gratitude

245
