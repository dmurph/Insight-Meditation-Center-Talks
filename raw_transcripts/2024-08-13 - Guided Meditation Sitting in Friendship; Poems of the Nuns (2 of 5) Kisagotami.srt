1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:08,480
hello everyone and welcome and

2
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:16,960
U so for this uh meditation today maybe

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:25,599
I'll do a little less guiding but more um setting a context for the

4
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,759
meditation uh Community SA spiritual

5
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:37,800
friendship is uh very important very supportive for Buddhist

6
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,520
practice and when I was uh living about three years in a Buddhist

7
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,680
Monastery uh it it was a very important time in my life and the practice was

8
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,600
important and I could not have done it without the support of the community being Community with people I didn't

9
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:05,280
have I wouldn't I would say I didn't have good friends in the monastery but I had a village I had uh regular

10
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,799
social contact with people who were nice and and um and it was

11
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:17,320
a a wonderful place to be and so I had this wonderful balance between spiritual

12
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:23,159
friendship and ability to be kind of also at the same time um not having the

13
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,520
social life complicate my life um and allowed me to settle into the

14
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:35,040
practice uh having having my teachers and that was a little bit slow to understand but in retrospect I've

15
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,600
understood how important my early teachers were and their their support

16
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:49,200
their encouragement was invaluable for me to to continue and to this day uh I feel very

17
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,719
much that uh the support part of the fuel part of the inspiration for my

18
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:00,399
practice is the spiritual Community communities that I'm part of

19
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,320
IMC and now for the last almost over four years here on YouTube with all of

20
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,959
you coming here there's something very uh valuable that uh the association the

21
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:18,000
connection the shared practice that we have and this goes back I feel very much

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,920
that uh uh that um sometimes I sit down to meditate and I appreciate that there

23
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:31,120
are thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of people at this very moment uh engag in Buddhist practice and

24
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,360
meditation around the globe maybe more and that um we had there's a

25
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:44,760
shared uh Community for this practice here and now we don't know each other necessarily but the fact that so many

26
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:52,840
people are practicing and that is important for me and then if you go back through time uh

27
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,360
my many teachers my teachers teachers they teachers and that there's been

28
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,280
people doing this practice for you know over 2,000 years and we're in the

29
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,400
lineage we're in the wave we're standing on the shoulders of the people who went

30
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:17,040
before us so that's the context for this meditation and to have that sense of

31
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,799
that Mutual support the circle of friends that are around us spiritual friends spiritual community that then in

32
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:30,360
a symbolic ways are around us all the time to support us but not too much not

33
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,560
to complicate our lives not to entangle us in uh

34
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,920
in the complexity of social life social

35
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,400
needs and concerns and uh at least the the Dharma

36
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:55,360
Community ideally is a community we feel supported by but not we don't invest so

37
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,159
much in it or we don't um expect such a high thing from it that we get entangled

38
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,400
in expectations and in that combination Sometimes some of the best relationships

39
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:14,239
some of the richest uh social connections can be in Dharma communities

40
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:20,880
support so um so in this kind of symbolic way I know some of you have had

41
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,360
complexities with Buddhist communities but this symbolic way we we are not here

42
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,080
without the support of others and to meditate today today have some sense of

43
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:39,840
that you're not meditating alone you're meditating with this online community uh meditating

44
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:46,199
here and um and don't let it be too much of a of a thinking some you think about

45
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:53,919
and fantasize about but if you find yourself wondering off in thought thinking about other things um as you as

46
00:04:53,919 --> 00:05:01,639
our means to come back to Here and Now appreciate the circle

47
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,160
of spiritual Community Dharma Community meditate meditating

48
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:15,479
community that uh is here with you and that uh you're not alone doing

49
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:23,319
this and let that be the bridge to coming back to here to feel that support to feel that

50
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:30,720
encouragement to feel the inspiration so whenever you wonderer off wake up to the

51
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:38,080
community and through that wake up here to your lived experience at this

52
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,360
moment so with that today I'm going to have it be silent the rest of the time

53
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,880
and um and uh many of the guided guidance I

54
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:56,440
do for these meditations Begins the same way more or less the same way and you've heard it many times most of

55
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:04,319
you but uh the idea that you're inclusive of the community is new so I'll just be quiet now and those of you

56
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,400
who are inclined let there be the support from

57

e e

101
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:27,799
and then as we come to the end of this sitting to appreciate that

102
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:36,480
coming out of meditation is to come out into a

103
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:41,799
community though maybe you're meditating at home

104
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:48,960
alone there's all of us sitting here on with this YouTube

105
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:56,039
Sitting that is coming out of meditation together

106
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:04,600
here to meet me again to meet each other again those of you reading the chats to

107
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:11,120
read the chats participate with each other coming back into a community that

108
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,840
has been continuous now for a long

109
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:23,360
time and then not to take this for granted but this that uh the very

110
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,960
existence of this YouTube Community has allowed this YouTube

111
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:35,600
event practice to live and occur and to for me and other IMC teachers to show up

112
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:42,919
here and and to be inspired to teach because of all of you and and how we

113
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:49,760
come together so every single one of you who's here contributes to

114
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,760
that so and then coming out of out of sitting

115
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:03,519
into community to do so slowly gently without high

116
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:09,039
expectation but appreciating what we have here and let

117
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:15,840
it be an inspiration that this practice that we do is for the benefit of our

118
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:23,039
communities this one our neighbors our friends all the different communities

119
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:30,159

126
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:19,849
[Music]

127
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,960
beings thank you for

128
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:32,639
so hello and welcome to this second talk where I'm uh reading from my translations of the

129
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:38,519
poems of the ancient Buddhist nuns the early first bu Disciples of the

130
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:44,440
Buddha and as Paul it's called a Terry Gata and

131
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:50,799
uh and the um and so for this poem uh this is a

132
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:57,320
poem of uh Kisa goami and uh and it's a very touching

133
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:02,440
poem and it involves a conversation between

134
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:08,919
kizami and pachara and I think in the modern West

135
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:16,039
Fair number of people know about kiso goami and um not so many know about

136
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:24,320
pachara but we have a beautiful statue of pachara uh at IRC and uh there's about

137
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:31,679
five different photographs that uh cycle through on the IMC homepage and

138
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:37,200
one of them is of pachara of um an beautiful wooden

139
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:43,480
statue that was given to us uh made for us and given to us

140
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:48,600
by and uh and so these are two famous uh

141
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:54,559
early Buddhist nuns so kog goami is um

142
00:32:54,559 --> 00:33:03,559
is known as the for the mustard mustard seed story uh Kisa means frail so it's frail

143
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:10,639
gotami and um so maybe she's not that well she's she's uh maybe somewhat weak

144
00:33:10,639 --> 00:33:17,559
or sick maybe or she's certainly poor and uh she has the circumstance of

145
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:23,480
being married into a family probably an ranged marriage back then and her status

146
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:31,600
uh was very low and in Ancient India the status of uh of a um bride they join you

147
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:38,960
don't just join a husband you join the husband's family often and the status is quite low and difficult and often uh

148
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:44,279
expected to kind of be a servant almost and uh so we don't know exactly

149
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:50,480
what the circumstances are but um she she then had a son uh and that changed

150
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:58,960
her status then she had a place in the family she has a status because back then ma male Prodigy was really

151
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,480
important and so there was a lot of things the mother probably loved her son

152
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:14,118
but it also put her in secure in a secure place in the family and society and then the son died as a baby

153
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:21,000
and she was distraught and she refused to believe the son had died and she went carrying

154
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,480
the dead baby around asking everyone for help for medicine and someone finally

155
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:32,480
said to her there's someone who has medicine and that's the Buddha with great hope she goes to the Buddha and

156
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:39,000
the Buddha says yes go to uh around and and collect mustard seeds which was a

157
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,079
very common spice that people had in the kitchen in Ancient India so everyone had

158
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:51,440
mustard seeds that they would grind up for cooking and G and gather a mustard seed

159
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:58,880
from all the households that um have not experienced death

160
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:06,160
and uh she starts going around and she discovers that everyone every household

161
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:11,280
that she came to has experienced death of CH children of parents of siblings

162
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:17,079
somehow death has been part of everyone's life and um and at some point

163
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:23,920
she realizes that and realizes then that uh the universality of death and that

164
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:32,560
she could accept the death of her baby and she went back to tell the Buddha this and and um and then he taught her

165
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:39,839
and she ordained and attained Awakening but aara the in this the

166
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:44,920
second person in this conversation uh uh she also had a tragic

167
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:50,599
uh uh death of family but there was kind of a massive uh death all at once you

168
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:58,560
know at the same time uh she was giving birth to her second child and she wanted to go back to her be with her parents

169
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:05,440
Family Home and but then she started giving birth uh during that walk and the

170
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:13,680
husband went out to try to find some grass and something to create an cushioning or bed for her to for um to

171
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:19,280
make her comfortable and he came across a snake that bit her bit him and he died

172
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,359
distraught uh pachara then uh gave birth and and uh was going to carry go to her

173
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:30,520
family's house me crossing a river and she first crossed over with her baby

174
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:36,440
and put him on the on the other Shore and on the way back to get her other uh

175
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:42,720
child um a u some big bird or prey came in and grabbed the baby and flew off

176
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:49,400
with it and while she was trying to yell and try to do something about that uh the

177
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:55,760
younger one ventured into the river and drowned so then she did go back to her

178
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:01,040
home Village to only discover that uh her mother and father and brother had

179
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,079
all died and were currently uh on the funeral PES being

180
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:13,280
cremated so a tremendous amount of suffering all at once and whether this story is a fable or an actually thing

181
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,960
that could have happened back in Ancient India I we don't know but I can imagine it could have happened these kinds of

182
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:25,040
horrible tragedies so these two women had huge tragedies both of them became nuns both

183
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,480
of them became enlightened and they were friends friends and so this is a conversation

184
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,560
between them and it's important to understand as you hear this poem that uh

185
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:40,599
they are both enlightened they're both free and what they talk about they do so

186
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:46,160
uh not the burden of their suffering but seeing it clearly knowing it clearly and

187
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:53,400
knowing that they are now have a degree of Enlightenment or Freedom so the poem begins with an

188
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:59,400
introductory three introductory verses and it was probably uh chanted in the

189
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:06,040
ancient world and there was probably three voices that chanted it so it's a little bit of a performance a little bit

190
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:14,200
meant to kind of highlight something and the the first three verses are probably chanted by a chant leader or someone and

191
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:22,240
it sets the stage for the conversation between these two nuns and um and so the first two are

192
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:28,838
quite lovely and uh the sentiment about spiritual friendship

193
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:36,440
in this world the sage has taught and praised spiritual

194
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:43,359
friendship by associating with a spiritual friend even a fool can become

195
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:50,599
wise associate with good people and wisdom will grow by associating with

196
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:58,359
good people one will be freed from all suffering so two verses

197
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:05,880
uh promoting the value of spiritual friendship being around good people good people is here in the context of the

198
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:12,480
ancient tradition means people who are ethical and know about the spiritual life and it can point you help support

199
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:18,920
you to uh understand and address and learn about the core Buddhist teaching

200
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:27,680
which what is presented in the third verse one should know suffering

201
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:36,319
the arising of suffering and its cessation and the Noble eful

202
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:43,400
Path and so these are usually called four noble truths and it's a little slightly different than that here but

203
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:48,880
it's for our purposes but the uh this is the task with our spiritual friendship

204
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:55,079
spiritual support from Wise people is to really know suffering and to know the

205
00:39:55,079 --> 00:40:01,480
arising of it the cessation of it the ending of it and the eful path Noble eful

206
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:07,480
Path and now we begin the conversation between the two nuns and um it starts

207
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:14,960
with kisami and this is maybe difficult to hear but it speaks to the tremendous uh

208
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:21,480
difficulty of ancient life we're talking about the Bronze Age before medicine and hospitals and doctors and when people

209
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:28,240
giving birth had to do maybe alone without any help or with just local uh you know

210
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:35,520
um and um and so uh kizami and pachara are

211
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:41,040
going to demonstrate that they know these core Buddhist teachings they know

212
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:48,040
suffering they know the the rising the cessation and the noble a full path and

213
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:53,119
so you'll witness now the conversation kind of is a is a demonstration of

214
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:58,200
spiritual friendship with these two friends and that both of them really

215
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:06,760
understand the whole uh point of what the Buddha was teaching so K gotami says

216
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:12,119
Womanhood is suffering Womanhood is suffering

217
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:20,079
declared the trainer of people to Be Tamed being a co-wife is suffering and

218
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:28,440
for some so is giving birth even once some women cut their

219
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:37,440
throats those who are discreet eat poison some fetuses within are

220
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:45,440
killers with misery for both mother and fetus so for some the ancient world

221
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:51,720
being a woman was very difficult for all for for biological reasons and for

222
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:59,240
social reasons and then pachara responds and now she's talking

223
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:04,599
about herself walking around about to give

224
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:11,160
birth I found my husband dead before I reached my house I gave

225
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:16,480
birth on the road for miserable miserable me two

226
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:23,960
children died a husband dead on the road mother father and brother burning on one

227
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:32,280
funeral p and then kagami speaking about pachara responding

228
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:42,200
to her friend miserable with family destroyed your suffering was

229
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:51,000
immeasurable you have said you have shed such tears for many thousands of

230
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,520
births but theara answers and now she continues talking about her suffering

231
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:01,800
after the death of her family I lived in the middle of the

232
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:08,119
charnal ground where my children's flesh was

233
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:13,800
eaten with family killed I was despised by

234
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:19,720
all but then with husband dead I

235
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:24,440
attained the absence of

236
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:30,319
death and then um um kogami then

237
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:37,880
speaks and replies as well similarly that she also has attained I cultivated the noble

238
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:45,839
Eightfold Path leading to the absence of death I have realized release my

239
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:52,280
translation of nibana I have realized nibana and have looked into the mirror

240
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:57,440
of the dhma I removed the arrow laid down the

241
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:06,319
burden and done what had to be done so these two women who had maybe

242
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:12,680
for some of us unimaginable suffering great difficulty and

243
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:18,880
um but uh they experienced this the new

244
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:25,920
suffering that's for sure and they just show that they show that this is something they know and they knew the

245
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:32,280
arising of it they see it they experienced it appear and they experienced the end of

246
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:38,839
it the cessation of it they uh they were not stuck in their suffering there was a

247
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:45,119
way out there was possibility of freedom and then they knew the Noble eful

248
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:52,280
Path that sometimes that's understood as being the path to that freedom and sometimes it's understood

249
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:58,240
the path one lives how one lives After experiencing that freedom that nibana

250
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:04,240
that absence of death that attainment of freedom of cling freedom from clinging

251
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:11,480
absence of clinging and they're explaining it very confidently they have attained they

252
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:16,680
pulled out the arrow laid down the burden done what had to be done so in

253
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:22,839
this uh conversation with two friends they're sharing with each other yes we

254
00:45:22,839 --> 00:45:29,720
understand the Dharma and we've seen it to the end both of us and uh and they're

255
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:36,720
they're spiritual friends for each other and having this Dharma conversation and they speak about their attainment with

256
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:42,079
confidence and with that they're able to look back and talk about the horrendous

257
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:48,520
suffering they had uh with freedom with Clarity with matter of factus without

258
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:54,839
suffering anymore because they had once suffered so badly they were

259
00:45:54,839 --> 00:46:02,000
free and um and and so I find this poem very touching that

260
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:08,839
uh it's meant to demonstrate the spiritual friendship this two good people having this conversation about

261
00:46:08,839 --> 00:46:17,680
the Dharma and a conversation about uh what's possible uh uh as an alternative to

262
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:23,280
living a life that is so difficult um we

263
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:31,480
can lay down the burden pull out the arrow and we can experience the absence of

264
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:38,520
death a very strong metaphor very strong metap symbolic idea of the absence of

265
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:45,079
suffering absence of clinging so may

266
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:50,280
you see this path to the end of your

267
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:57,240
suffering may you be able to stand there and be present and talk about about the

268
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:04,319
suffering you've you have had with the same Clarity and honesty and directness

269
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:11,559
that is untroubled by it just this is how it this is how it was and now I'm

270
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:16,240
free so thank you
