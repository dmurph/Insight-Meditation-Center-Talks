00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:20,800
hello everyone welcome to this meditation and

2
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:31,599
um to begin straight off to assume a meditation posture

3
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:38,079
here and to gently close the

4
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:44,960
eyes and to become aware of what's happening with you Just

5
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,680
right off like this Now

6
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,719
recognize how it is in your body

7
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,320
Recognize how it is in your mind

8
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,320
and and in a very general way to recognize how it is in your

9
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,640
heart Take a few moments also to recognize how is your breathing at this

10
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,119
time

11
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:48,520
And all these acts of recognition are activities of the

12
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:55,439
mind that are recognizing things that maybe you would not have noticed unless

13
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,438
you were directed to do

14
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,679
so Sometimes the way the tensions in our body how our body

15
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:14,920
is is not noticed because we're not paying attention

16
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,480
We can feel what's happening happening in our body and we can also do

17
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,840
recognition of it We can be so busy thinking we don't

18
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,840
recognize how we are in our mind

19
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,160
Recognition is an activity of the

20
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:55,959
mind in and of itself It's distinct from what it

21
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:03,720
recognizes What it recognizes can be there whether it's recognized or not

22
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,760
And this distinction between recognition and what's

23
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:32,920
recognized is a distinction where peace calm equinimity can be established

24
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,840
Sometimes the act of recognition comes along with a lot of

25
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:48,239
associated activities judgments preferences

26
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,120
opinions

27
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:02,920
attitudes And sometimes the act of recognition is very

28
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:09,879
simple ordinary and carries no

29
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:17,759
extra complicating factors Just simply recognizing calmly

30
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:30,400
peacefully And it's the calm recognition that begins to come into play as we

31
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,960
meditate So now

32
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:45,320
calmly take some fuller breaths and relax on the exhale

33
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,080
relaxing your

34
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,360
body If you're open to relaxing whatever your

35
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,360
body

36
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:17,240
relaxes can you recognize calmly what relaxes

37
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:31,680
letting your breathing return to normal And take a few moments to calmly

38
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,720
know the experience of breathing an ordinary breath

39
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:02,680
Calmly know the quality of your mind your thinking

40
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,560
mind how is it right

41
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,160
now And as you

42
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,360
exhale to soften that thinking

43
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:27,599
mind

44
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,800
recognizing what it feels like to Relax

45
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:56,478
And then returning to the breathing and calmly

46
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:05,520
recognizing breathing in and breathing out in any way in which the breathing

47
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:13,400
the muscles around the bright breathing can relax and soften Mhm

48
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,760
Breathing in Breathing out

49
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,360
And then settling

50
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:25,560
in [Music] to focus on breathing in and breathing

51
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:32,959
out And with the lightest touch very

52
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:42,519
softly let the mind's ability to recognize Breathing in breathing

53
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:50,080
out the sensations of breathing Let that support and entry

54
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,279
into the world of breathing

55
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:28,640
There are simple acts of recognition that the mind is doing all

56
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,960
the time

57
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,640
Let them be simple

58
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:47,799
calm Sometimes they come with thoughts

59
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:52,158
words Sometimes they feel more

60
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:06,960
worthless And it with a light touch without trying too

61
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:13,440
hard appreciate the almost spontaneous acts

62
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,679
of recognition calm peaceful

63
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:29,200
knowing that occurs with present moment experience

64
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:36,440
with the sensations that come into play

65
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,320
And as we come to the end of this

66
00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:00,480
sitting to imagine what it might be like to see

67
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,000
someone maybe in a

68
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,320
distance and to recognize

69
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,400
them in a clean simple

70
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:23,760
way without agenda without fear or

71
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,360
desires without judgments

72
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:40,480
allowing yourself to have a very calm clear simple

73
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:48,589
recognition that creates space [Music]

74
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:56,760
room for a wellspring of goodwill to arise

75
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,480
Clear simple calm

76
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:15,320
recognition that can function as a gateway for good will

77
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,400
And may it be that we

78
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:29,880
trust a calm mind a clear

79
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,000
mind that sees the

80
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:45,039
world without our judgments biases

81
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:54,799
agendas but sees it simply ly so we can wish the world

82
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:01,600
well May all beings be

83
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:07,520
safe May all beings be

84
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:15,158
peaceful May all beings be free

85
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,000
May all beings be

86
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:30,640
happy And may all beings see each

87
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:40,799
other through a simple clear recognition That is the gateway for

88
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:49,919
mutual respect and care May all beings be

89
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,319
[Music]

90
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:03,559
[Music]

91
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:07,799
happy Thank you

92
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:14,399
So hello welcome to this series on insight the meaning of insight and how

93
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:20,039
it's practiced in the insight meditation uh

94
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:26,480
practice And uh in some ways insight is less interesting than samadei It doesn't

95
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,960
have the excitement the thrill the great promise of wonderful feelings of joy

96
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,480
happiness and peace And um and it is there is a way in

97
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:45,279
which it it has a more of a cognitive role that has to do with a clear

98
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:51,360
recognition of something And for some people that's kind of boring or why would that be

99
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,919
interesting but uh in this uh insight meditation uh

100
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:04,640
understanding is that um uh clear seeing a clear insight

101
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:11,279
uh allows something very deep inside to release It can allow a lot of letting go

102
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:16,799
and along that way Uh but the deepest forms of release

103
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:23,440
the deepest forms of freedom um uh are touched with with very profound insight

104
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:29,159
which we'll get to as as we move along here But that process the path of

105
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:36,559
insight is a process It's a path It's a journey in a sense And uh the different

106
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:43,200
kinds of insight that a person can have can be um kind of put together as a

107
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,240
journey as a progression and sometimes people follow that progression but sometimes it's in a different

108
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:56,159
order So yesterday I mentioned that the one the important of the five forms of

109
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,279
insight is personal insight and to understand something unique about

110
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:06,720
yourself that helps free something helps you be wiser helps you to be resol

111
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:14,799
resolve certain kinds of issues and not be in conflict with yourself or the world or settle something in a deep way

112
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:22,000
And these personal insights are phenomenally helpful and some people have a profound need to settle aspects

113
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,679
of their personal life so that they can come to meditation to settle further So

114
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:35,279
in a sense this journey begins by enough self-standing to be able to engage in a

115
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:40,399
process of meditation that's not involved with the stories of our life

116
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:48,799
The the uh not involved with you know our history and biography and

117
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:55,679
who did what to who and things like that Those are important but at some point you want to settle them enough so you

118
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:03,360
can really start being in the present moment And what we're beginning to move into in inside meditation is to see

119
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:09,600
something which is uh universally true for everyone And uh and that doesn't

120
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:16,799
mean that it's unimportant It means that actually we're getting into the underlying foundation of what builds our

121
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:22,399
personal world and uh and rectifying it cleaning it up finding how to find

122
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:28,080
finding freedom in it So in the the first the next insight the

123
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:34,559
first of these universal insights is um uh has to do about seeing

124
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:42,080
the difference between uh the role of the mind uh and the role

125
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:49,519
of sensations to see that there's sensations that we have and then there's the mind's recognition of it and those

126
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:56,600
are two different things The tradition calls this appearances and name Name and

127
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:02,000
appearances Nama rupa And so the appearances here

128
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,158
primarily you can understand it as being the direct experience we're having in the present moment uh which comes

129
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:14,000
through the sense doors And so the sense experience is happening and then there's

130
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:21,358
the recognition of what that is And those are two distinct uh activities

131
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:30,240
So I'm very fond of how uh the intimacy between uh sensations and sensing If I

132
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,358
put my hands together like this I feel the warmth the pressure the smoothness

133
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:43,040
the texture of the palms of my hands touching And uh and I also feel uh the

134
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:49,280
play of sensations is kind of somehow some random way uh attention moves

135
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:56,960
around the different parts of the palm to feel different things at different times And um and I feel a teeny bit of

136
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,680
moisture ever so slight and teeny bit of stickiness as I move my hands a little

137
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:08,440
bit And um so the sens all those

138
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:16,240
sensations occur in the very location of sensing Sensing and sensations arise

139
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:23,240
together They're almost can't be separated So they're really in a sense part of the physical bodily

140
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:33,760
experience The recognition of what's happening there the knowing of what it is is um is uh an aspect of the mind

141
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:40,240
uh to know that my hand is touching my other hand that's an act of recognition

142
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:45,359
Uh I you know I've done like this uh with someone else's hand and I've known

143
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:50,720
that it's their hand It's such an innocent ordinary non you know non-event

144
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:58,000
almost to rec do that kind of recognition but that level of recognition is going on all the time

145
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:06,320
Uh now I feel a slight tiredness tension a little ache ever so slightly uh in my

146
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:12,079
muscles my arm for holding my hand up like this and um and knowing I can know

147
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:18,400
that ache and know enough enough of it to wonder now should I rest my hand have

148
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,520
I had enough holding my hand up and so the recognition then allows for

149
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:30,320
consideration allows for wisdom to operate Um but it's two different things It's

150
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,920
possible to have sense contact without the recognition

151
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,200
Sometimes that's confusing or sometimes the recognition is inaccurate We see

152
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:46,880
something and the mind projects something onto it and we think we're seeing what we're seeing something but

153
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:53,720
it's not I've seen people from the back who have the same hairstyle the

154
00:36:53,720 --> 00:37:00,760
same height the same maybe kind of clothes and assumed I was seeing my

155
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:05,839
friend and uh and um and so I wasn't

156
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:13,760
seeing accurately The recognition factor was kind of jumping ahead before I had all the information I've seen as I've

157
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:19,200
often said um a stick on the ground in the hikes I do in the hills here and for

158
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,400
a moment will think it's a snake and um and so this kind of sometimes the

159
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:30,079
recognition is not accurate Uh and um and so but it's a

160
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:37,560
distinct mental activity their recognition So as we mind gets calmer and quieter

161
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:44,880
in meditation at some point the insight is to see the insight into a these are two

162
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:52,000
different events Uh there's the sensation and there's a knowing of what

163
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,480
it is And uh sometimes with sounds I don't know what that is there's a recognition

164
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:05,200
not knowing and then at some point uh I I know and there's recognition oh that's

165
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:11,760
what it is and um and so uh maybe recognizing a bird and I don't know it

166
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:18,760
at first and then some I recognize oh that's a woodpecker or that's a a

167
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:26,400
dove and u so this act of recognition is going on all the time and to see it as

168
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:32,560
two different events Hence uh is called uh in a kind of to paraphrase or to

169
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:41,200
adapt a traditional language is to have uh clear seeing Um it's a um

170
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:49,440
clarification of our view clarification of how we see that these are two different things Why is this important

171
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:55,400
because it sets the foundation for the deeper insights If our

172
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:01,920
recognition and the sensation are entangled or caught up with each other

173
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:09,280
uh then uh the uh they things get confused The act of recognition is a

174
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:15,839
kind of a concept and concepts have a kind of enduring value I mean they're

175
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:22,560
kind of enduring life I mean a concept can be unchanging and uh and so we have concept

176
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:28,720
of a circle and uh and kind of that never changes A circle is a circle We

177
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:37,240
you know never the circle never becomes a square and um and uh so if I see the stick on the

178
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:44,160
ground as a snake the concept of snake kind of is more or less a concept that

179
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:50,040
doesn't go away And unless I take a second look at the stick I could uh run

180
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:57,119
off uh down the trail and never change my view of what I saw I was you know

181
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:05,680
think it's a snake But if I see that the the seeing and this and the recognition

182
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:13,839
are two different things then I'm more likely to uh see more clearly that uh

183
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:20,480
these are two different events and in fact it's a stick If I'm walking down the street and

184
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:28,640
I see someone um who looks like maybe my friend but I don't really see

185
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:35,520
the person And I see that uh I I recognize the seeing and I recognize the

186
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:42,720
thought friend and I see there's two different events then I can question is it really

187
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:48,200
my friend but if I see them as the same as if

188
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:55,359
inseparable this the seeing and the recognition then I might not question whether I'm seeing accurately I might

189
00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:02,160
run up to my person and give them a hug and the person is not my friend and I'm they're totally surprised There's

190
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,440
something about the entanglement of the way that we recognize something with the

191
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:14,800
ex the sensory experience we have that gets us in trouble Uh we uh we sometimes

192
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:22,079
live with the recognition the activity the judgments all the desires the fears

193
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:29,640
all the things that come along with recognition pile on right away as if it's that's the way it

194
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:38,720
is We have judgments about people So if we see someone and uh and uh the seeing

195
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:45,280
of them the recognizing of them uh as someone who is you know an angry person

196
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:51,040
you know not a nice person for example uh it's almost as if seeing and not a

197
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:57,359
nice person are one of the same thing As we begin seeing as two

198
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:04,280
different things then we can see more clearly and we see each event as its own

199
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:10,720
thing and now we can begin to have wisdom Wisdom can operate much better in

200
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:18,760
seeing that distinction So in the course of insight practice this this difference is

201
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:26,079
invaluable And it isn't that we have to work hard to make ourselves see this way As

202
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:32,720
the mind gets quieter as the mindfulness gets clearer then at some point this

203
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:40,960
becomes easy to see At some point we see oh there was a um uh a sound and

204
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,880
recognition of the sound of hearing recognition car and those are two

205
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:54,240
different events Sometimes uh it's quite lovely to not have the recognition really operating

206
00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:01,440
and we don't and it's kind of the mind is just kind of very relaxed um and sometimes it's invaluable to have

207
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:09,680
their recognition Inside practice works uh partly by the support of recognizing the

208
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:15,680
present moment Uh the recognition keeps us here Stay here Don't go on don't

209
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:21,680
wander off recognize what's happening As we do this

210
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,800
uh we start recognizing better and we wander off and then we have maybe more

211
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:32,880
personal insight of what's driving that Don't get lost in the personal

212
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:39,680
insight They're useful but for the purpose of meditation they're useful for the way of helping us um not get caught

213
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:45,440
in that world Stay present Stay here Stay let the recognition keep you in the

214
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:51,200
present And over time as you calm and relax and

215
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:58,240
soften you'll start seeing the difference between um recognition and appearances

216
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:04,640
appearances and recognitions sense experience of all kinds and then knowing

217
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:10,800
the recognition of what that is and being able to see that uh difference is

218
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:18,240
invaluable and we'll continue with this tomorrow uh because this sets the stage page for the further kinds of insight

219
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:28,040
that are going to go that are important for insight meditation So thank you
