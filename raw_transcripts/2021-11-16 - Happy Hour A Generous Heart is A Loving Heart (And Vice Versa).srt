00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:07,359
okay so hello formerly hello officially hello

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:13,440
and welcome to happy hour it's lovely to see your faces see your names

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:20,240
feel your presence getting together this hour in this moment in time

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:28,000
for practice together so so for today's practice i want to invite

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,320
us to explore practice and

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,680
specifically practice of meta loving-kindness

7
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:49,120
as an act of generosity to ourselves and to others

8
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,840
what happens if we take on this perspective

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,000
of generosity of spirit when we practice

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,719
what happens with say quote-unquote distractions

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,759
can we be generous to distractions or to sounds

12
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:22,400
to quote-unquote distracting sounds loud sounds what happens

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,799
when we take on this spirit of generosity towards ourselves

14
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,799
practice as an act of generosity towards ourselves and towards whatever

15
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,280
is coming up in our environment and towards others

16
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,560
how may that shift the way that we show up

17
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,960
in this moment in this practice and in general

18
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,560
how we show up for others for loved ones

19
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,600
for colleagues for friends for people we don't know at the grocery store

20
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:11,840
if we take on this perspective of generosity so we practice

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,239
we practice what does it feel like to take on perspective of generosity

22
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:25,360
as a perspective of meta as a perspective of good will that we cultivate towards ourselves

23
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:32,160
towards others so that is the theme for today

24
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:39,040
how generosity of spirit and meta are synonymous in many ways many

25
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,879
dimensions and it's for us to discover how that shows up for us what it means

26
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,879
to us so so without further ado

27
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:58,560
let's practice together let's lend in our bodies

28
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,680
in our hearts and our minds can we

29
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:15,280
show up with generosity for this body in this moment the sense

30
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:23,120
of care whatever is arising

31
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,400
can we be generous towards it

32
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:39,040
feeling a sense of spaciousness it's okay you can be here

33
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:45,640
if there is pain in the body the heart

34
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:58,720
not feeling stingy about oh this is mine this is my space

35
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,000
this is my practice time what if we shared it

36
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,360
if we relaxed a little bit and shared it with whatever shows up

37
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,079
not giving the house away not giving all of our attention away

38
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,560
but making space making room

39
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,840
it can be stably present

40
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,160
and with this attitude of generosity of spirit

41
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,520
landing landing

42
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,800
merced bones

43
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,520
landing

44
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,039
in the chair the cushion the contact points

45
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:41,840
turning the gaze inward and just receiving the breath

46
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,000
for a few minutes in the lower abdomen

47
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,319
the relaxed body relaxed body

48
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,960
arriving suddenly

49
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,080
as emotions as thoughts arise

50
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,039
how can we be generous with ourselves

51
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,000
not self-flagellate not judge ourselves but have a sense of

52
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,919
spaciousness of generosity

53
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:43,440
thoughts can arise and pass the heart can be free

54
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,760
not grasp

55
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:03,200
generosity as this action

56
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:10,720
of opening a hand giving away not clinging

57
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:18,160
relinquishing can that gesture of an open hand opening

58
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:24,800
hand be the gesture of our heart our mind

59
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,320
with whatever arises

60
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,080
can we freely give away love care

61
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,200
warmth to ourselves

62
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,560
to whatever rises this fear of experience

63
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:20,160
can our bodies relax our heart relax

64
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,399
into this gesture of the open hand

65
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,040
gesture of generosity

66
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,800
there's not so much doing to be done in this practice

67
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:21,160
but just to land relax into

68
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:29,040
sense of kindness generosity to whatever rises

69
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,920
with ever rises

70
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,839
things don't have to be pushed away

71
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,320
into some idea of perfection

72
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:06,639
with judgment thoughts emotions can arise and pass

73
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,360
there can be openheartedness

74
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:20,000
spaciousness relaxedness with the breath with the sensations of

75
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,639
the body that's all

76
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,480
a generous heart is a loving heart

77
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:06,000
a loving heart is a generous heart discover this explore this for your own

78
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,399
heart mind

79
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:17,038
remember the breath the body is always available

80
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,918
there's a reference point it's a grounding

81
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:29,280
in case you find too many thoughts arising

82
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,840
into needing grounding come back to the breath

83
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,200
the ease to the generosity of the breath

84
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,200
it's an anchor is grounding

85
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,039
if the thought arises i'm not doing this right i don't know

86
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:28,559
what i'm doing i'm no good at this it's confusing

87
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:37,039
can this thought be believed

88
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:43,060
but treated as a guest with generosity not with ill will

89
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:50,640

towards whatever rises

100
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:13,440

101
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,399
generosity

102
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:28,960
towards this being who is you who is me who's showing up in this moment

109
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:31,360
trying on this way of being not doing but being

110
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:37,640
try it on for size again and again

111
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,240
receiving with generosity with appreciation

112
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,600

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:46,000
and offering kindness generosity every sensation every thought every

114
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,200
emotion giving and receiving

115
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,080

117
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:05,120
you know how to be kind to yourself

118
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:12,120
to whatever arises trust trust that you already know

119
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:25,120
if at any moment there is trouble connecting with it remember the gesture of the open hand

120
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,159
the hand that opens and giving

121
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,000
ah feel

122
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:44,520

123
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,320
in your heart in your body in your mind

124
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,919
first and foremost to yourself

125
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:20,799
trust trust the goodness of cultivating kindness

126
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:25,639
and generosity towards yourself

127
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:36,919
as a stepping stone for others

128
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,760
notice notice how much

129
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,599
easier

130
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,680
this meditation can become

131
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:16,280
with a mindset of generosity to ourselves

132
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:26,480
especially when we discover we're lost in thought

133
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,400
there's sense of ease

134
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:40,480
instead of yanking the attention back or judgment if there is ease

135
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:47,119
ah so much more joyful

136
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:56,040
to be sitting and practicing so much more nourishing

137
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,079
for the last moments of this practice period

138
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:13,839
appreciating ourselves with kindness with generosity

139
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:19,359

141
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:31,520
and relinquishing letting go opening the fist

142
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,680
if it's holding any judgment

143
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,040
and appreciating with gladness

144
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,000
this practice period may the goodness

145
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:00,078
may the goodness of our practice support us and all beings everywhere

146
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:08,838

147
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:24,349

hmm so [Music]

150
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:51,400
generosity and meta generosity and loving kindness

151
00:37:53,760 --> 00:38:00,400
so i noticed that i feel a lot more at ease

152
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:09,359
a lot more content and happy with this style of not so much doing

153
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:17,200
but sitting being this with this spirit of generosity towards self towards whatever

154
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:24,640
arises and we have time for reflections if you'd

155
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,640
like to share what you discovered what was it like for you

um thank you so much nikki um at one point maybe

159
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:55,119
a third of the way through you uh mentioned something about perspective perfection and i was in some

160
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:00,880
reverie and i just sort of latched on to that and i thought

161
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:08,480
that's really interesting and i don't know the context and anyway

162
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,520
i always be delighted maybe i'll just have to like replay this tape and

163
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,560
but uh if you happen to recall yeah yeah yeah yeah sure

164
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:23,599
sure what i was saying and it's interesting just before i say that it's

165
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:30,480
it's so interesting that sometimes these words these they resonate so how the word perfection

166
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,680
really appreciating how it served as a mindfulness bell for you

167
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:43,520
which wow that's nice that's interesting and um

168
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:48,800
and yeah and it's all good i appreciate the comfort and

169
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:56,800
and also another thing i want to reflect on is that i still appreciate in this uh practice space of happy hour there's

170
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:03,680
so much comfort and ease there is no shame with mind wandering that's one mind to do and i so appreciate you

171
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:10,720
bringing that in there's such a sense of ease and safety that just gladdens my heart in the way that that you bring

172
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,920
that in and this help because that is so important for every practitioner not to

173
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:21,520
feel shame or bad or like not it's that's what

174
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:28,079
minds do they fall into these reveries and then they the moment of awakeness happens so thank

175
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:35,040
you for bringing that in dawn with the benefit of all beings also anger

176
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:43,280
and now that what i was talking about um was um the invitation was not trying

177
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:50,800
to push away which again i guess continuing around along the same theme

178
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:57,599
you know when we realized that we're lost in thought with don't don't try to push it away with

179
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:06,079
you know or when emotions come up don't try to push it away for some perfection like what we imagine

180
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:11,359
this perfect yogi is supposed to be

181
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:16,880
that's the idea like can we have generosity kindness not this idea of the

182
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:22,400
perfect yogi actually along the way of getting there

183
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:29,119
we're actually having a lot of ill will so just pointing that out

184
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:35,839
and if i may uh just one piece onto that about sort of perfection i i

185
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:40,880
sort of go sort of at one point you're talking about this

186
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,560
kind of self-judgment and and i just you know just sort of underlying i had so like this

187
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:52,240
man i'm sick i just turned 60 and jesus i'm just like starting to really

188
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:58,319
get serious with practice what the hell you should have been doing this three decades ago before that

189
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:03,838
and i sort of had this like crazy dialogue

190
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:11,119
yeah yeah um and you know there's so many

191
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:17,520
so many things we can have these unhelpful dialogues about because it's not getting us anywhere right it's it's

192
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:24,480
throwing perfectly wonderful moments of awakening after moments that we have not been awakened

193
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:30,400
so instead wow what a gift that i've actually discovered this i could be

194
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,520
going through my whole life and not be doing this so

195
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:42,000
what what a tremendous gift what a tremendous tremendous gift it is so

196
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,200
that's the invitation i would have yeah thank you don

197
00:42:53,839 --> 00:43:00,160
any reflections yes

198
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:07,280
we're glad you're here we're glad all of us are here any reflections any questions any

199
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,280
comments

200
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:25,119
maybe what we will do today we will go into our

201
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:31,920
small sangha practice discussions first and then maybe when we come out we'll

202
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:38,720
take more reflections so so with that i'd like to invite us all

203
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:46,800
to as we go into small groups to engage with a sense of generosity for

204
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:52,480
ourselves and for others what does that look like what does a sense of feeling of

205
00:43:52,480 --> 00:44:00,480
generosity look like for ourselves and for others with with the sense of meta and let's start with

206
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:06,400
15 seconds of silent meta silent generosity for ourselves and

207
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:13,119
for others so i'm going to make the rooms and if you're on the edge

208
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:18,160
if you're shy about being groups with others please stay

209
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,280
and see how it goes be on the edge of your disk a little bit

210
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:29,040
of discomfort and um but if you have to go

211
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:35,119
no problem no judgment no worries it's all good so

212
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:40,319
creating the rooms and they are open now take care of

213
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:46,000
yourselves take care of each other okay here we go

214
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:57,040
welcome back everyone the rooms are closed lovely so we have a couple of minutes

215
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:03,680
for a new reflection so it came up i see lots of smiles that makes me happy

216
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:08,720

217
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:15,599
i'd love to hear your reflections especially oh i see a heart oh that's sweet

218
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:21,119
um yeah please we'd love to hear from you

219
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:30,359
whether you're new or you you've come back after a while we are so happy you're here

220
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:43,920
why did you discover with this mindset of generosity what was it like for yourself

221
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,720
or maybe showing up with sangha

222
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:57,040
yeah clinton thanks thanks to my partners with your

223
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:03,920
generosity of information and personal experience oh that's sweet

224
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:09,040
generosity is so expanding yeah jerry says

225
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:15,839
it is feeling is it as expensive right this is expansiveness of the heart

226
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:21,760
that's why the buddha taught generosity as the as a primary practice

227
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:29,920
it's not it's not just about giving money your resources it's it's such

228
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:37,599
an important internal practice discovering this internal dimension of generosity so expansive

229
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:43,480
it's really a liberative practice

230
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:49,839
yeah friend i see you and it's seven and so

231
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:55,359
i'm gonna ask you to yeah naked succinct please

232
00:46:55,359 --> 00:47:01,119
i've found today after doing a meta meditation this morning that i was

233
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:08,160
uh much more open to uh being a more generous correspondent on

234
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:13,680
the phone with several friends that i was speaking with and

235
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:20,559
not needing to step in and say too much myself when i could when i could feel someone really

236
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:27,920
wanting to talk and just letting the line go out and out and out and it felt very good

237
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:34,079
nice lovely i appreciate hearing that the sense of how actually your practice of meta in the

238
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:41,119
morning gave rise to a sense of generosity they are so connected beautiful thank you fred

239
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:46,800
yeah report from the field um generosity seemed more warm and loving

240
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:53,280
than just acceptance as ken kenneth and yeah

241
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:59,920
and dave says today i counted myself and including myself in the zoom meeting instead of wait i think that's a partial

242
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:06,240
comment mima i see your hand and let's make this one succinct too

243
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:12,319
please i think one of the things that um resonated with me tonight with this meditation was that i

244
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:18,559
need to work on becoming more mindful on that generosity is like you said it's not just about giving money

245
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:24,960
it's like um becoming more mindful of um how it comes through the from the heart

246
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:31,359
on uh taking time to listen to someone or including someone like i i could see

247
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:37,119
that now it's it's vague yes but i think it's i think i'm

248
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:43,040
trying to get the sense of that yeah thank you for that yes thank you for that yay

249
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:50,720
