4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,199
take inspiration from

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,400
what is called the fire sermon

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,960
the fire sermon and the buddha and the fire sermon says

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,559
practitioners all is burning and what is

8
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,559

9
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,760
all the ways we experience life in the world

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,239
the eye is burning forms of the eye eye consciousness eye contact whatever's

11
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:09,760
felt etc etc ear nose tongue body and then mind the mind door the mind is

12
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:16,080

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,840
whatever is felt is pleasant or painful or neutral that arises and contact is

14
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,240
burning burning with what burning with greed hatred and

15
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,079
confusion so i love

16
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:40,720
that suta and the the teaching that all is burning feels like sometimes our

17
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:48,320
world is burning burning externally sometimes burning internally

18
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,320
and speaking from california where there are fires literally burning and there's

19
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,719
smoke here today with windows closed with air unhealthy and again situation

20
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,640
in the world situation in the world feels like there is burning there is burning in the world

21
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,560
and of course internally with with what is arising

22
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,560
we're all living through a pandemic all of us together none of us are immune to

23
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,680
the burning of the challenges internally in our lives in the lives of people we

24
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:32,400
care about so meta meta is considered to be cooling

25
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,360
healing healing waters of metta for a world that is burning internally

26
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,959
externally all that is burning so we offer meta to cool our hearts to

27
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,200
cool our minds and to offer our goodness our cooling

28
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,599
healing [Music] comforting intentions

29
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:05,599
gifts in any way we can by cultivating our heart

30
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:13,440
offering this cooling healing loving-kindness menta to a world that is

31
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,879
burning so setting our intention

32
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:28,319
for offering this healing cooling meta

33
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:35,360
for ourselves and all beings today and with that let's start our practice

34
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,480
together settling in to our seat

35
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,040
you need to move if you need to lie down

36
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:52,400
or sit up straighter whatever is appropriate this always will

37
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:59,120
start with settling in the mind

38
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,599
the body with the breath

39
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,080
riding inviting a settling of the mind

40
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,840
as if it were a snow globe that had been

41
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,359
shaken all the thoughts twirling around

42
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,240
setting it down

43
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,400
letting it all settle

44
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,560
just being breathed just being simply breathed

45
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,960
in this moment not pushing not trying so hard

46
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:55,240
putting it all down putting down trying so hard not needed

47
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,560
not eat it

48
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:20,400
just resting moment of refuge nowhere to go nothing to do

49
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:29,160
taking refuge in the simplicity of this moment with the breath

50
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:35,319
and if thoughts arise it's okay no need for judgment

51
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:43,039
seeing them clearly and inviting them to settle

52
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:49,520
putting down the snow globe again and again letting it settle

53
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,000
with the body with the breath

54
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,639
here just here

55
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,560
putting down what's not needed

56
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,600
putting down whatever is not needed

57
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:40,320
just here with the breath with the body settling arriving

58
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,940

59
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:51,399
[Music] calming

60
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,399
connecting with the entirety of the breath

61
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:39,839
as if you are surfer surfing the breath in this body

62
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,320

63
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:49,040

64
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,079

throughout the body breathing

66
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,720
what if we imagined ourselves being soaked

67
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,959

healing wash wishes of meta internally externally

174
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:56,560
so the floor is open for any reflections

175
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:04,160
for any thoughts any questions anything you've noticed anything that came up for you

176
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:11,119
and again if you raise your hand your zoom hand especially if you haven't shared in a

177
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:17,119
while that'd be lovely consider it a gift to the sangha to

178
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:23,680
share your practice what you discovered or your question something that didn't

179
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:29,760
work and you can also type it in chat if it's typed to everyone i would read your name

180
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:38,680
if it's just typed to me it will be private and i'll just read the reflection not your name

181
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,440
what was this like for you

182
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,960
did you have fun soaking your loved ones

183
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:11,200
did was it an image that worked for you as i wait for you to come forth with

184
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:18,400
what worked what didn't don't say that that actually worked for me was surprisingly fun and

185
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,920
and uh especially one deer being in my life was really suffering

186
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,280
and just feeling that this water was soothing calming and just the burning

187
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:36,800
they have right now in their heart in their life that ah may this bring you ease dear one may this bring you

188
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,880
um freedom from from this burning

189
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:50,079
it was another way to connect with the good wishes of meta and compassion for them

190
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:57,839
patricia says the healing waters were delightful that's lovely

191
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:04,480
would you like to say more patricia you don't have to but if you do

192
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:10,640
let's see after oh no i need to change something here

193
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:15,760
you're welcome to unmute yourself if you wish and if not it's all good

194
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,520
don't feel like you're on the spot bill says i found myself feeling

195
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:26,880
frustrated that this exercise doesn't directly help other people then i

196
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:33,920
realize that by transforming ourselves we might be able to help others

197
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:40,160
yes well said bill well said

198
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:46,720
right on i especially like how there was a sense of frustration and then oh yes and then

199
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:53,920
the inside realization coming through beautiful stephanie says yes i loved soaking my

200
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,920
loved ones i appreciate the flexibility of my mindset and heart during this

201
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:07,280
meditation moving from aversion towards compassion oh beautiful thanks for sharing that stephanie that's

202
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:13,599
lovely and any of you who've shared you're also welcome to to unmute yourself if you

203
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:18,480
wish to share more if you like

204
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:27,720
please melanie says i liked when the sprinkler hose was able to cover both me and my loved one yeah

205
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:33,040
yeah sweet i like that too

206
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:39,200
and it's an inexhaustible it doesn't run out that's another that's

207
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:45,920
another idea here with this metaphor because sometimes we feel like we have to pump it out it's our meta we have to

208
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:51,920
give it to others and oh i'm already running dry i'm already suffering how can i wish others well it's like hey

209
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:57,440
it's an inexhaustible supply can cover you cover

210
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:04,319
the others cover both you and others cover whole continents countries so

211
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:10,319
just the idea there again the metaphor here i'm trying to bring in which

212
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:16,240
isn't for us not to feel that it's ours and we're pushing it out which can become hard whereas it's just

213
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:22,480
good well good well offered good well offered that's one way that this metaphor can

214
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,680
help us not get caught in the sense of scarcity

215
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:34,000
of goodwill and just share it it's not ours here take it be well may you be well may you

216
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:41,119
be healed me too any other reflections before we turn to

217
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:46,318
practice in small groups together

218
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:54,640
one more reflection a good old friend of mine is in her last days oh and i get emotional and teary

227
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:47,280

and the invitation is as always we start

232
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:18,560
with 15 seconds of silent meta for ourselves for each other and then

233
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:25,599
imagine actually in this case tonight that you have this meta hose

234
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:32,640
that is you turn into yourself may i be well and then you're soaking the people who are with you in the small groups

just have fun with it tonight don't be so serious just you know you're soaking each other with

236

250
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:16,359
with fellow practitioners about this practice

251
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:33,440
kim i enjoyed um hearing all the

252
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:39,040
the metaphors and the different kinds of dryness and moisture

253
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:44,640

254
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:51,599
she had ridden her bike to a location was leaning against a tree and talked about so you could see the

255
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:58,480
tree that was quite dry and and talked about moisture coming out of the earth

256
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:06,078
and terence was talking about feeling feeling dry when he came into it and that what a healing

257
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:13,680
meta it was what a practice it was and so i really like that dryness and moisture and for myself i

258
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:19,520
