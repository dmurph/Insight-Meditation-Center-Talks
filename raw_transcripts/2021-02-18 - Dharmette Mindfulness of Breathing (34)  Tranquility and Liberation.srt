1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,640
so

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,719
in these

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,920
16 stages 16 steps of mindfulness of

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,520
breathing

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,279
as i've said that they are organized in

6
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,119
groups of four called tetrads

7
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,880
and that the last step in each tetrad

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,360
the instructions are has to do with

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,239
something in the family of letting go

10
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,000
or of freedom or of release

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,079
whatever your language that you like to

12
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,040
think of that

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,320
is and in

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,719
step four it's calming

15
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,079
the bodily formations

16
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,800
sometimes it's translated as

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,680
tranquilizing

18
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,640
and i love the word tranquil but

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,879
tranquilizing i associate with

20
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,799
something you do with animals or

21
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,720
something

22
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,840
so it doesn't really evoke a positive

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,119
obviously positive response for me

24
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,040
and and but

25
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,520
you know bringing about tranquility of

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,200
the body

27
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,280
in the eighth step it's calming relaxing

28
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,840
tranquilizing the mental formations the

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,520
mind

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,799
we'll see in a while that in the

31
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,400
12th step it's

32
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,880
freedom release releasing the mind

33
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,399
freeing the mind and then in the

34
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,079
final step of the 16 steps number 16

35
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,640
it's something called relinquishment

36
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,200
which

37
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,960
maybe it's a big word that doesn't

38
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,880
really inspire so much

39
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,240
but it involves a real qualitative

40
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,479
transformative experience of freedom of

41
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,118
liberation

42
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,040
and so the movement towards greater and

43
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,399
greater freedom

44
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,800
begins with this simple thing of

45
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,959
relaxing the body

46
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,360
and uh it's kind of beginning to learn

47
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,560
the lesson

48
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,560
of freedom it's beginning to have a

49
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,760
reference point

50
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,480
for the goodness of what it's like to

51
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,440
not be tense

52
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,319
not be caught and i think for many

53
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,120
people

54
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,200
it's a little bit more accessible this

55
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,599
physical relaxation than it is

56
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,200
full-blown

57
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,480
liberation but we're beginning to get a

58
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,160
little taste of it

59
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,920
um and this embodied taste of it

60
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,319
and most people don't associate you know

61
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:45,200
just simple

62
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,519
physical relaxation with buddhist

63
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,959
liberation

64
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,400
but maybe there's um the liberation is

65
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,840
kind of such a

66
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,200
matter-of-fact thing it's uh it's not

67
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,319
once you the greater liberation we have

68
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,159
uh the more it just seems seen as

69
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,599
i don't know if ordinary is the right

70
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,360
word but uh

71
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,280
not such a uh

72
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,440
unusual thing or not such a

73
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,400
um

74
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,519
otherworldly thing in a sense it's uh

75
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,120
it's just a very profound

76
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,680
experience of what we're beginning to

77
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,319
experience

78
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,200
as we begin to relax the body as we

79
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,200
begin to relax as we begin to

80
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,560
experience a physical tranquility

81
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,840
so in so you know as you know those of

82
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,360
you following along

83
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,120
that i give a lot of emphasis on

84
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,440
relaxing at the beginning of the body

85
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,560
the beginning of the meditation

86
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,760
and now relaxing

87
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,319
you know it's maybe a little bit too s

88
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,200
limited in describing the sense of

89
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,959
tranquility that comes

90
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,959
that can come as we continue deeper and

91
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,760
deeper into this anapanasati

92
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,400
but looking for tranquility looking for

93
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,400
the calmness or the serenity that can

94
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,360
exist

95
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,840
in our practice is said to be the

96
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,799
support for

97
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,840
greater tranquility we're not making

98
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,280
calmness or tranquility

99
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,840
the beel and end-all but it's a

100
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,720
wonderful foundation that begins to

101
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,560
soften the hard hardness of the heart

102
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,320
the hardnesses of the mind

103
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,040
the word stuck and things don't move

104
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,720
tranquility begins to create a sense of

105
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,560
safety inner safety

106
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,400
where things begin to release more and

107
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,759
more

108
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,720
and we're not looking towards you know i

109
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,320
like the word tranquility more than

110
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,120
calmness

111
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,280
in my use of the words because calmness

112
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,040
can lend itself to the idea of becoming

113
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,160
too calm so calm that you fall asleep

114
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,520
and my vocabulary tranquility has an

115
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,680
alertness to it

116
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,280
and their tranquility is not just calm

117
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,440
but it's also kind of a harmonious

118
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,960
energy kind of

119
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,000
energetics and so this calm kind of

120
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,880
aliveness

121
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,919
a tranquil aliveness that can be here an

122
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,600
embodied way so i say all this as a way

123
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,199
to encourage you

124
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,240
to begin appreciating

125
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,080
the the influence that relaxation has

126
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,720
that in your daily life as you go about

127
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,000
if there are times when

128
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,680
you've noticed your shoulders relaxed

129
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,919
your belly relaxes

130
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,680
you sit down at the end of a long day

131
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,600
and you finally let let down

132
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,120
all your preoccupations and drive and

133
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,600
you know momentum that you have and you

134
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,479
feel more relaxed

135
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,440
see if you can appreciate the the

136
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,199
influence that has on you and

137
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,560
see if you can maybe begin feel some of

138
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,039
the initial feelings of

139
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,800
a certain kind of freedom if some kind

140
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,160
of release

141
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,919
a certain kind of no longer being

142
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,240
limited or bound or caught

143
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,000
in something feel feel what it's like

144
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,120
physically begin to appreciate the small

145
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,400
little movements

146
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,520
of freedom that can be here and as you

147
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,720
get a hang of it

148
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,240
you might find that there's actually a

149
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,720
lot more little movements of freedom

150
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,080
little movements of not being

151
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,440
caught that are happening all along

152
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,880
and and that may be often so easy to

153
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,520
overlook

154
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,160
because we're it's not valued

155
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,759
particularly

156
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,039
other things getting something done is

157
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,120
might be more valuable but there might

158
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,520
be a very a lot of little movements of

159
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,319
of just kind of oh that's great you

160
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,919
might step out of your house

161
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,240
after a rainstorm and the rain has

162
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,240
passed and the sun has come out

163
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,000
and something inside of you just kind of

164
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,360
releases

165
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,599
um in that feeling of just being in the

166
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,160
sun being outdoors in the fresh air

167
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,120
and so what does that influence what's

168
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,240
that effect on you

169
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,479
in the body to be there and

170
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,639
to appreciate it don't hang on to it

171
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,759
don't

172
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,319
you know get too complicated around it

173
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,360
but just kind of start

174
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,919
feeling the little movements of freedom

175
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,759
little movements of

176
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,360
release of relaxation of tranquility

177
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,160
of peacefulness that seems to emanate

178
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,720
from

179
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,880
the movements of relaxation of ease that

180
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,960
happen

181
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,880
and the more we start recognizing this

182
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,080
in daily life and

183
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,120
meditation different places

184
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,120
it reinforces that movement it

185
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,160
reinforces

186
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,440
the value of not being tense

187
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,160
it enforces the value of not being

188
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,319
caught up in preoccupations or

189
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,800
driven or or or

190
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,639
bracing ourselves since things or

191
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,400
closing down or trying to run away from

192
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,360
things

193
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,840
it it reinforces it kind of kind of

194
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,919
begins to question those movements of

195
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:56,879
mind those

196
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,120
ways in which we are which are the

197
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,360
opposite of freedom

198
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,440
and to do that in the small areas of

199
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,199
your life

200
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,240
ordinary things is a

201
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,800
wonderful stepping stone that supports

202
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,680
us finding it

203
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,240
deeper and further further along until

204
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,879
the deeper areas of letting go of

205
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,840
freedom that

206
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,720
anapanasathi is taking taking us to

207
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,560
become

208
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,160
more natural more accessible more

209
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,039
understandable because of what we've

210
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,360
kind of

211
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,680
really taken in earlier on in the

212
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,959
practice

213
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,039
so not just simply in meditation to

214
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,240
experience this

215
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,080
but in other times of the day as well

216
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,760
begin you know if you really want this

217
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,839
anapanasati to really

218
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,839
deepen deep deeper deeper deeper and

219
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,360
deeper in it

220
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,480
this movement towards freedom

221
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,079
can be called it can become a

222
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,720
a a

223
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,760
an ongoing sensitivity an ongoing

224
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,200
attention that we have

225
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,440
and it's not being self-preoccupied to

226
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,120
do this it's i hope you don't think it's

227
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,080
selfish

228
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,080
because the freedom is kind of beginning

229
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,399
to turn ourselves inside out

230
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,279
so that we're actually in the freedom we

231
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,000
are

232
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,399
i think kind of more easily naturally

233
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,680
going to be

234
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,160
more sensitive more caring for the world

235
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,720
around us

236
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,120
so tranquility

237
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,800
letting go release relaxation

238
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,720
calmness all kind of

239
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,640
all ways are connected to this the

240
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,920
family

241
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,240
of experiences of movements

242
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,080
that's connected to liberation and

243
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,160
and to become a connoisseur of this

244
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,200
become a

245
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,680
sensitive to it being informed by it to

246
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,480
be

247
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,120
inspired by it to be in touch with it

248
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,320
regularly

249
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,839
maybe even so it becomes a little bit of

250
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,920
a habit

251
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,399
so they can grow and develop in you

252
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,200
and so that may this practice that we do

253
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,959
lead you to greater and greater

254
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,040
experiences of freedom

255
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,279
and in doing so may it be for your

256
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,440
delight

257
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,640
so thank you so much for today and

258
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,839
we'll continue this tomorrow
