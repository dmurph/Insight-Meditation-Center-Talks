1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,279
so warm greetings from redwood city

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,960
and looks like it's going to be a beautiful

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,920
blue day blue sky

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,600
and uh the vast blue sky

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:32,160
with no clouds in it is sometimes seen as a synonym metaphor

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,200
analogy for our mind

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:45,120
and to begin appreciating the sense of settleness wholeness

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,519
clarity that can come through meditation practice

9
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,239
arouses arouses evokes

10
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:07,040
a sense of delight or satisfaction or being pleased

11
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,600
in this opportunity to sit with oneself to sit and meditate

12
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:21,280
and and that is the 10th step of these 16 steps

13
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:30,399
is being pleased or steeply satisfied or delighted the word can mean rejoice

14
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,360
and there's something about stepping back a little bit and appreciating this opportunity to

15
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,880
meditate and then as the meditation as we become more

16
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:52,399
centered in the moment with ourselves becoming more whole more whole here then

17
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,840
there is um

18
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:05,119
hopefully some deep sense of beings of satisfaction in this process

19
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,160
so here we are and

20
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:21,280
we've been doing this some of us for a while now and so to take your usual meditation

21
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,920
posture or the one that is the right

22
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:37,840
for now and gently close your eyes

23
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:47,360
and even if you're agitated about something if you're sitting in your regular

24
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:54,800
meditation posture is there um

25
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,080
something comforting about doing so

26
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:10,319
something settling or something familiar that's

27
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:18,080
feels good to be in this posture

28
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,720
if you've been doing this little ritual of taking a few deep breaths at the

29
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:32,400
beginning is that also something becoming a little bit comforting or settling or familiar

30
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,760
that you can get settled into so taking a few long slow deep

31
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:47,840
breaths and as you exhale

32
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:58,000
to relax maybe a long slow deep long slow exhale

33
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,840
settling in here

34
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:16,000
the deep inhale is a chance to feel the fullness of the body the

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,919
width and breadth of the body or the wholeness of the body that's always more whole than the parts

36
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:32,479
always greater than the particular places of discomfort or distress that we might have to take a

37
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:39,520
deep breath in that spreads the awareness through the body so the awareness is

38
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,440
more encompasses more than any particular issues we have

39
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:55,120
and to exhale to let go of this intensity of some of

40
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,120
the thoughts and concerns soften and quiet the mind

41
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,680
soften and quiet the heart and the inner your inner life

42
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,840
settling in

43
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:24,160
and then taking breathing normally

44
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:32,800
and to some degree the process of meditation is a process of coming to a kind of wholeness

45
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,120
where all things are kind of held together without any

46
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,800
and divide within us everything has a place

47
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:53,600
and the relaxing of the body moves in that direction

48
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,560
on the exhale relaxing the muscles of the face

49
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:20,479
on the exhale relaxing the muscles of the shoulder

50
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:35,120
on the exhale relaxing in the chest

51
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:49,840
and on the exhale relaxing the belly softening the belly

52
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:25,039
and perhaps on the exhale there's a way of releasing the whole body

53
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:35,199
releasing the way we might be bracing ourselves we're releasing the way we're

54
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:45,840
leaning ahead of ourselves

55
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,840
and then feeling the breathing

56
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,720
for a few moments familiarizing yourself

57
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:27,840
with your breathing the experience of it

58
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:53,839
and then whatever pleasure or joy

59
00:08:53,839 --> 00:09:00,480
well-being that might be here even if it's in the cracks between

60
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,839
other things breathe with a pleasure breathe with a

61
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:14,079
well-being tingling in the body a warmth the glow

62
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,320
feeling of pleasure and the breathing maybe

63
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,880
or as you relax a kind of spread of

64
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:41,200
energy through the body that has a pleasant quality

65
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:51,839
breathe with a pleasant

66
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:39,360
and as you exhale relax the mental activity

67
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:47,839
quieting your thinking

68
00:10:50,079 --> 00:11:01,839
relaxing any tension or contraction in the thinking mind

69
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,800
maybe relaxing the thinking mind on the exhale

70
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:19,600
and letting the mind become broader wider quieter

71
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:34,240
kind of like the waves on a vast lake the waves quiet down and the top of the

72
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,320
lake becomes still quiet the flatness the calm

73
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:57,839
stretching wide out towards the horizon so the mind gets quieter

74
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,880
and then be breathing with your mind state noticing the general mind

75
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:05,600
mood the atmosphere of your inner life

76
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:13,440
breathing with it allowing it to be the way it is

77
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,319
but being mindful of it as you breathe

78
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,880
maybe appreciating

79
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:36,639
that a mood or a state is broad wide

80
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,320
maybe has no boundaries

81
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:49,839
his soft transparent translucent

82
00:13:52,480 --> 00:14:02,639
the mind state is not a solid thing it has no weight

83
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,759
maybe no color

84
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,680
maybe appreciating

85
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,839
the insubstantiality of mind state

86
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:31,839
breathing with it breathing through it

87
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,360
and rather than letting your mind drift off in thought

88
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:13,839
let your mind be concerned more with the breathing

89
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:24,839
breathing in the middle of this wider hole of body and feelings

90
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,920
and mind state

91
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:41,839
appreciating the breadth and the width of this whole

92
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:55,760
and then is there anything about sitting here now if you really settle in really connect

93
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:02,960
to the direct experience of meditating that has a feeling of satisfaction or

94
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:11,520
goodness to it something that's pleasing or something that makes you feel glad

95
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:20,159
or delighted being delighted in the being on the path

96
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:27,919
of practice having a practice being settled

97
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:34,080
not caught up in the busyness of the day

98
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:41,679
breathe with what is pleasing not so much the ideas of it

99
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,960
but maybe the ideas give rise to

100
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:55,840
an embodied feeling of satisfaction joy delight

101
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,080
in this experience of becoming moving towards wholeness or subtleness

102
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:16,320
or ease more peacefulness

103
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:25,200
and breathe with that satisfaction that delight and breathe with it in a way

104
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,240
that helps the mind become more quiet

105
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,880
a quiet breathing

106
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,399
with the inner delight and satisfaction

107
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,840
of being here now

108
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:54,320
instead of caught up in activities and concerns and thoughts

109
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,840
the goodness of just being here meditating

110
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:02,399
stepped hand of anapanasati is breathing in

111
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:17,840
delighting the mind breathing out delighting the mind

112
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:35,200
and how might you look out onto the world with eyes of the light

113
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:43,120
how might you look upon the world with eyes of kindness and

114
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:50,799
love how might you look out from your heart

115
00:28:52,799 --> 00:29:01,520
sharing delight sharing joy as if it's food

116
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,120
for the for the hungry

117
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:17,039
as if it is missing resource in our lives

118
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:27,840
to no delight to no joy

119
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:41,840
and to look upon others having delight in them

120
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:55,039
appreciating others with respect and love and and may it be

121
00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:01,200
that our delight and appreciation and respect for others

122
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:09,120
that we concern us ourselves with their happiness

123
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,919
their safety

124
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:24,159
their capacity to be at peace in this world their freedom and may our delight

125
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:31,279
our joy and others our appreciation of their beauty and their the wonder wonderfulness of

126
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:38,559
others be contagious and support others

127
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,480
so that all beings may be happy

128
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:51,919
all beings may be safe so that all beings

129
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:59,200
may be peaceful so that all beings may be free

130
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:19,840
and may our delight and in the existence of others support that

131
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:34,320
so so today we're going to touch into the

132
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:41,120
10th step of anapanasati breathing in one

133
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,360
delights the mind breathing out one delights the mind

134
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:55,440
and and this word mind cheetah appears in step 8 9 and 10.

135
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:01,679
in 8 it's calming the

136
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:09,360
activities of the mind then step nine it's

137
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:16,000
experiencing the mind and then in step now 10 it's

138
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:23,519
um delighting the mind and um and so this is the light

139
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:32,240
the word that's translated i'm translating now is the light can be translated as pleasing the mind

140
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,360
or satisfying the mind and it rather than it being an active verb that

141
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:43,760
what we're doing we might understand it as being recognizing or allowing for a certain

142
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:51,519
sense of deep satisfaction deep being pleased a deep kind of very glad gladness

143
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:57,919
in the mind and that comes from meditation practice

144
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:03,200
and there's a number of ways to understand this and there are different ways to experience this

145
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:11,200
one of the classic ones that the tradition talks about is um finally

146
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:17,919
the mind is no longer out of control or to say differently finally the mind

147
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:23,200
doesn't have a mind of its own and and where the mind were led around

148
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:31,120
jumping around agitated trashing about in the mind with our thoughts but we

149
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,480
feel like now we've really come home or we're settled we're back to in ourselves

150
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,600
the mind is under control or the mind is not um

151
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:48,480
just doing whatever it wants wandering around and picking up thoughts and chasing thoughts and

152
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,559
but we're really settled here and we've come home to ourselves the mind is settled and present

153
00:33:54,559 --> 00:34:02,640
it's a word and the word that's often used in the ancient tradition is mind is now tamed i suspect a lot of us in the

154
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:08,158
modern west don't really like the idea of taming ourselves so that if a tame mind doesn't really

155
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,200
inspire but but the opposite of that you know having

156
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,480
a mind which is no longer untamed or out of control

157
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:26,878
maybe just feels better to appreciate that or value that and um one of the metaphors for an

158
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:33,440
out of control mind in the ancient world is um like a fish trashing about in a very

159
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,560
shallow puddle of water you know just flap flapping around and

160
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,919
so sometimes the mind just flaps and does its things and jumps around and chases one thought

161
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:50,480
after the other and and um and we have no control or no say

162
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:56,320
over the mind and but to get the mental activities to quiet down

163
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:02,320
to settle and a feeling that we're not really going to wander off into the past and the future anymore we're not really

164
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:09,520
going to get lost in thought anymore we are now really here and um and feel that sense of it's

165
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,720
deeply satisfying to start feeling really connected here and

166
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,800
and at peace here or settled here and and there's a kind of a satisfaction

167
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:27,599
of not having the agitation or the energetics of the mind jumping around moving out going here and there

168
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:35,599
and it allows the mind to be start becoming peaceful or being a deep rest or just here and it can feel like very

169
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:42,000
solid or very centered it can hear and the mind is in the present

170
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,760
moment and any tendency to leave that present moment by going off into thought

171
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,680
it just it just doesn't go very far it hardly goes anywhere at all it's like a rubber band attached to their thoughts

172
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,520
and they just get pulled right back to the present or we just like no you know why bother

173
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,800
it's really good to be here and this movement of the experiencing the

174
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:12,480
mind this way is a movement towards wholeness to becoming more whole that's only

175
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:18,640
possible if we're in the present moment by almost by i don't know if definition is

176
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:25,119
the right word but by definition if we're lost in the future caught up in future concerns or past

177
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:30,720
concerns we are partial we're involved and focused on the future and we're not

178
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:36,240
really connected to what's here or if we're involved in fantasy it's no

179
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:42,640
matter how wonderful and nice the fantasy might feel a fantasy is only a small part of who we

180
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:49,440
are and there's a disconnect even dissociation in extreme forms with our body our mind states and it's

181
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:56,800
really what's happening right here and so as we start settling and able to be here in the present moment in a

182
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:03,119
rooted way grounded way it allows begins allowing for this

183
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:10,160
of a process of feeling whole becoming um and a whole

184
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:17,119
is is a process also of a lot of the sharp boundaries we have

185
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:23,520
time and space begins to fall away or sharp boundaries between um

186
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:29,040
the body and the mind or sharp boundaries between the edges of our body and the space

187
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:34,240
around us a lot of um the um

188
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,800
a sense of wholeness starts moving into what some people would call

189
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,880
altered states of consciousness altered states of mind but that suggests that somehow it's

190
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,400
non-nor like not normal or and well maybe it's not so normal because

191
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,359
we don't go into those states very much but um

192
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:03,280
in in meditation we start feeling this settled in the present moment and start opening up to a whole

193
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:10,000
feeling of wholeness of being here it starts feeling like this is natural

194
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,000
this is a homecoming this is what should be ordinary ordinary states of consciousness

195
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,040
ordinary states of mind are fragmented narrow limited

196
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:27,119
bounded and frazzled and even though they might be

197
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,400
familiar with us in that sense comfortable for us to really experience starts feeling a

198
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,000
settled wholeness it starts feeling oh this is health this is healthy

199
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,880
healthy mind this is um you know it's the altered states of mind

200
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:52,320
are daily mind states those are the ones are altered and and strange and preoccupied and things

201
00:38:52,320 --> 00:39:00,160
like that but you know a subtle feeling of wholeness that feels good some people uh

202
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:05,680
when they um meditate are struggling with a distractible mind you know being

203
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:11,359
caught by the hindrances and caught in desires and aversions of

204
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:19,599
all kinds and they're coming back and coming back and working with that to finally have those quiet down

205
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:26,320
and the mind is able to finally be present it's like the mind has found itself

206
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:32,240
it provides a deep satisfaction a delight a joy a pleasure

207
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:39,680
and this is what we're talking about in this tenth step of delighting the mind or pleasing the

208
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:46,240
mind or gladdening the mind allowing the mind to feel a deep satisfaction

209
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:52,000
and i offer all these different words because different people will find different words speak to what their

210
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,440
own flavor of all this might be in their meditation and

211
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:04,720
and but the important thing here is that we're allowed to feel the goodness of that we're allowed to

212
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,720
feel the delight and the joy and the satisfaction certainly not to cling to and hold on to

213
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:17,680
and congratulate ourselves for in some egotistical way but we're not supposed to ignore the joy

214
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:25,440
the happiness the well-being the pleasure the satisfaction of meditation in fact feeling that is there's a way of

215
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:31,119
feeling a way of experiencing it that allows us to continue this process of settling in

216
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:41,040
quieting the mind expanding the sense of wholeness that we're moving into and in doing so

217
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:48,960
we open up to states of mind qualities of mind that are coterminous that are

218
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:55,599
intimately part of this feeling of a wholeness or a broad

219
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,640
awareness or centeredness clear knowing clarity of mind

220
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:07,200
that are that are considered a form of wealth in fact for the buddha the greatest

221
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:12,319
wealth a person can have and acquire is the wealth that

222
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:19,119
comes from a settled clear and open mind the sense of wholeness so the seven

223
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:27,280
factors awakening that i mentioned yesterday mindfulness investigation effort

224
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:33,760
joy tranquility samadhi and equanimity these all kind of belong

225
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:40,240
to the realm of this settled wholeness that comes with it as the awareness the attention gets full

226
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:46,880
and complete and um and uh and so it isn't just like we're losing something

227
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:56,079
by settling down and really letting go of the distracted mind and really being present we gain so much and um and it's called

228
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:03,280
an inner wealth if you want to be wealthy develop your inner life and it's uh it's a wealth that i mean it

229
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,960
qualifies as a wealth because um it provides some of the greatest pleasure and

230
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:15,440
safety and happiness and that that's available to us and

231
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,880
certainly greater happiness than any material wealth can ever produce

232
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:26,240
so so

233
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:33,839
breathing in delighting the mind breathing out delighting the mind you

234
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:39,599
can't do that too early you can't just sit down and decide to do that it comes when

235
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:45,359
when meditation is really settle down and settle down settle down so remember it's now we're talking about

236
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:51,520
the 10th stage of the 16 stages but when it happens to you that you get

237
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:56,880
that you start feeling inklings of kind of this kind of delight satisfaction pleasure

238
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:03,839
being pleased by what's happening deep satisfaction open to it allow for it let it spread

239
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:09,839
wide and broad throughout your being be nourished by it

240
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:16,960
and and let it be something you appreciate and enjoy and that sets the stage for the next

241
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:23,599
step amanapanasati which we really won't do for a couple of weeks which is samadhi which is the

242
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:29,040
unification of the mind this concentration of the mind and until then we're going

243
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:34,319
to spend next week with the seven factors of awakening

244
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:40,240
and maybe this will support experiencing the mind and experiencing the delight in

245
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:45,280
the mind to really kind of spend some time with these seven factors of awakening

246
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:52,880
and they'll also serve for the 11th step the samadhi
