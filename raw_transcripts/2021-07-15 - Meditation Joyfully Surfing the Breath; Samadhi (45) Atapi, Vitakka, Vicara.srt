00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,559

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,960
shared planet earth and i greet you in this moment in time from mountain

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,240
view california from my home uh from virtual imc

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:33,120
a virtual background i'm actually using zoom to youtube hence the difference in audio

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,280
and why i can beam in um without needing to sit as usually guild

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:47,200
does so hence the explanation so so um so

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:54,640
let's continue our practice together we've been exploring various

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,120
supportive conditions supportive practices for samadhi for calming the mind

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,759
for settling the mind for unification for concentration

11
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:18,799
so just a quick review of the techniques we're building upon

12
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:27,759
we started with relinquishing relinquishing what is not helpful putting aside what is not needed

13
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,799
and then the other side of the coin of relinquishment is turning our attention

14
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,560
our wise attention to what is actually here what's already here not

15
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,520
the distractions outside but what is

16
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,159
joyful what is delightful what is wonderful in the simplicity of the present moment

17
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:59,840
right here right now so instead of the stick the carrot what is delicious here to

18
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,439
have contentment and peace with what is already here to recognize

19
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:13,760
what is already here and we continued with the invitation to

20
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,040
relax to soften the body to open up the body

21
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,760
so that the mind can relax can and can settle a relaxed

22
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,920
sati a relaxed mode of mindfulness drawing inspiration from the buddha

23
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,519
under the rose apple tree as well as um the

24
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:46,000
uh the simile of the the cow herder under the tree

25
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:53,840
when the harvest has been done so their sense of relaxed spatial awareness so we'll bring

26
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:01,200
all of these in today in addition to the new theme today

27
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,400
that we'll be adding all of these are interrelated all of them depend on one

28
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,239
another [Music] is gentle perseverance

29
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:19,440
gentle persistence coming back keep coming back keep coming back you

30
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,040
need to relinquish it's okay keep coming back relax the body

31
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:32,239
notice the the simple delight joy of the pleasant moment keep

32
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:40,720
coming back keep coming back but gently atapi is one of my favorite words

33
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,080
in the sitters especially shows up in

34
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,680
the four foundations of mindfulness the four establishments of mindfulness

35
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,720
gentle perseverance so it's not a forceful it's it's not a jackhammer

36
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,280
like okay bring the mind back yank it back bad mind it's not like that

37
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:17,600
it's the force of a feather but it's repeated bring the feather back

38
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:25,280
bring it back bring it back gently kindly patiently a thousand times

39
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,479
maybe more during a 30 minute set without

40
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:38,160
grudges without judgment self-recommendation just gently okay all right

41
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:45,759
distracted buddha in this moment okay gently back a tapi gentle persistence

42
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:53,199
gentle persistence so with the basis of everything we have been cultivating

43
00:04:53,199 --> 00:05:00,080
turning our attention to this week and now today special attention to this gentle

44
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:08,000
persistence coming back and i'll say more about both this and vitaka and vichara

45
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,800
which are essential and to translate them initial application of the mind with the

46
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,160
breath with the object and sustained application so initial application

47
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,720
as if you touch the breath you gently bring back the attention touch the breath and

48
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,039
sustained attention as if you're rubbing a ball because if you're rubbing a ball with a cloth

49
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:39,600
you rub the breath with your attention gently coming back initial application

50
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,160
sustained application until the the attention drops drops away and then

51
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:54,240
again again and again so a day for cultivating

52
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:01,440
cultivating gentle gentle persistence and patience joyfully

53
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,759
so let us begin

54
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,639
blending landing in our posture

55
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:21,840
in our meditation posture whether sitting or lying down

56
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,840
and inviting inviting the body to relax

57
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:48,319
the forehead to soften

58
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,280
for the eyes to rest back in their socket

59
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,840
for the jaw

60
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,280
perhaps to open up just a little bit

61
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:17,840
ah and then settle into a comfortable position

62
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:33,599
inviting the neck and shoulders to give their weight to the earth the arms

63
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:45,840
the hands to drop

64
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:59,840
the chest the abdomen

65
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:13,840
letting go at the next out breath ah

66
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,800
and the sit bones

67
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:27,840
the lower part of the abdomen connecting to the sit bones

68
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:45,680
dropping dropping their weight onto the earth in lieu of the chair

69
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:55,839
the cushion

70
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,320
letting go of the weight the lower legs upper legs and feet to

71
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:20,080
the earth bringing attention to the entire body

72
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,839
relaxed soft

73
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,720
breathing being breathed

74
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,519
the in-breath

75
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:51,839
the out breath

76
00:09:51,839 --> 00:10:00,030
connecting attention awareness satay

77
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:07,600
[Music] connecting with the in-breath

78
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:33,480
or the out-breath in their entirety as much as possible

79
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:39,440
relinquishing what is not helpful in this moment

80
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:47,360
nothing wrong with thinking per se but in this moment

81
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:54,720
we choose to give our hearts fully

82
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:01,839
our minds wholeheartedly

83
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:15,200
to this moment this moment's cultivation and goodness

84
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:22,880
hear the simple joy of just being here

85
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:43,839
simply sitting and breathing

86
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:49,839
with gentle gentle persistence

87
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:55,519
connecting connecting with the breath

88
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:03,199
as if awareness lands on the breath connects with the

89
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,600
breath

90
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,639
and serves serves

91
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,639
the breath joyfully

92
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:30,959
the attention surfing the breath joyfully for as long as possible

93
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:38,480
and if and when it drops the attention drops it's okay

94
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:46,320
gently relinquishing without judgment

95
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,040
smiling

96
00:14:53,440 --> 00:15:00,720
coming back gentle persistence coming back

97
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:09,120
connecting tension awareness connecting with the breath

98
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:20,399
continuing to surf to be with the breath joyfully

99
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:29,360
for as long as available no problem

100
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,519
again and again this is our practice

101
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:55,839
this is our training of our mind

102
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,690
every now and then [Music]

103
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:29,520
as you notice the mind is resting on something else and you relinquish

104
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:43,120
without judgment with e smilingly check to see the body is relaxed

105
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:52,640
if any tension has crept in ah release relax

106
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,320
with the next out breath

107
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,480
and connect with the breath

108
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:23,840
surfing the wave

109
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:35,840
returning again and again to the joy of surfing the breath

110
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:14,799
surfing as long as possible

111
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:27,840
if we're dropping off

112
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,880
and however our practice was in this moment

113
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:39,200
trusting there is goodness generated trusting

114
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:49,440
that are coming together aligned with our intentions

115
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:57,840
our actions for cultivation that goodness is generated

116
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:06,559
for ourselves for others around us and the whole world

117
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:16,399
and offering sharing with generosity that goodness that is ours and not

118
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:24,080
ours sharing it generously with the whole world

119
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:33,519
may our cultivation may this merit generate this goodness

120
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:40,000
okay cause and condition for freedom

121
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:49,919
liberation of all beings everywhere may all beings be happy may all beings be free

122
00:31:49,919 --> 00:32:01,840
including ourselves

123
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:15,840
thank you for the grace of your practice

124
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,760
greetings greetings everyone

125
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:34,080
so our fourth day of exploration with supportive practices supportive

126
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:42,000
tools for cultivating samadhi translated often

127
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,840
as concentration but perhaps better translated as unification of the mind

128
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,960
settling of the mind calm abiding

129
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:01,278
so today's theme

130
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:09,600
one is atapi as i mentioned this favorite word of mine that shows up

131
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:16,640
a lot uh especially in the four foundations for establishments of

132
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,279
mindfulness

133
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:27,919
where the buddha in the refrain that repeats so many times in that suta

134
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:34,799
says to come back with atapi with gentle persistence gentle persistence there's a sense of

135
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:40,480
gentle persistence that we cultivate and

136
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:48,880
what's really important to keep in mind here is the persistence

137
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:55,600
we keep coming back we keep coming back we keep coming back and yet there is the

138
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,120
gentleness because if the coming back is like a sledgehammer

139
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:09,040
it becomes exhausting it becomes painful very soon if every time

140
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:15,839
the mind and the mind is a puppy we are training this sweet darling

141
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:21,919
beloved puppy of our mind and it just just as puppies like to run around

142
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:28,878
it's in their nature it's in the nature of our minds to like to think and go here and there

143
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:35,200
etc so so training this beloved puppy of the mind you don't want to

144
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:42,560
yank it back traumatize the puppy every time he comes back come back sit sit and beat

145
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:49,280
up the poor puppy beat up the poor mind gentle come back sweetie come back

146
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:56,158
come back you may do it a thousand times come back gently it's okay it's okay or run away

147
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:01,599
it's okay come back come back with bad level of gentleness

148
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:08,960
training caring for a beloved puppy another simile that i mentioned is

149
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:17,359
is um the pressure of a feather pressure of a feather not a sledgehammer

150
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:22,560
so it's persistent it happens over and over and over and over and over again

151
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,760
without without the problem not make it into a problem yes

152
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,680
this is the nature of the mind oh yeah it's the millionth time this morning in the 30 minutes i'm

153
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:40,400
coming back it's okay just calling oh today the busy buddha is showing up on this

154
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:46,720
question the busy buddha that happens for me many times in fact i remember once i was teaching a retreat

155
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:52,480
and there's so much planning going on and i'm sitting on the on the dice and realizing wow the mind

156
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,760
is going everywhere okay all right busy busy buddha is showing up

157
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:04,400
in this moment busy buddha ah and the mind that the heart can settle with that

158
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:11,119
can settle with that with that gentleness of okay it's like this it doesn't become conflictual and yet

159
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:16,960
there is persistence yet there is persistence after you say okay it's the busy buddha

160
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,560
all right sweetie okay come back all right yeah it's the busy buddha today yes

161
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:30,560
come back come back this beautiful word in pali my one of my

162
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:37,280
favorites and the other couple of concepts i like

163
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:43,200
to bring in today is vitaca and vichara

164
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:50,960
which are two of the five gianic factors so vittaka means initial application

165
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:58,640
and vichara is sustained application so one simile is that imagine you have a

166
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:06,240
bowl and here i have a bowl and you have a cloth and vitaca is like okay

167
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:12,320
the cloth touching the bow this is vittaka the initial application the initial contact

168
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:19,599
the initial connection and then vichara is the sustained application is as if

169
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:24,880
you're rubbing the bowl with the claw then at some point

170
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:31,760
so so the cloth is awareness and the bowl is your breath

171
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,920
is the object is the object of your attention which could be many different objects there are 40 different

172
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,560
samadhi objects in the visudi maga in higher teachings but

173
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:52,320
here we're using anapanasati the breath as our object so this in this

174
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,359
case for our practice today is the breath it could be again many different things

175
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:05,680
could be sounds sensations etc but here's the breath so attention being the clock initial

176
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:11,119
application the contact when we make contact we we grok

177
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:17,520
we grab we get on the wave um if we're surfing i'll talk about

178
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:25,200
that analogy a little more and then vitaka and then vichara sustained application sustained

179
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:32,000
application we rub the bowl attention rubs stays on the

180
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,119
breath the entirety of the breath as if touching the breath touching the entirety of the breath

181
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:48,240
before at some point at some point it will fall off it's okay with atapi with gentle persistence we come back

182
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:53,520
we make contact vitaka and then we sustain the attention

183
00:38:53,520 --> 00:39:00,320
vichara we sustain the attention for as long as possible before he drops off again then when it

184
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:07,920
drops off no judgment just that's the puppy it just drops off that's what happens okay

185
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:15,599
with atapi we come back initial application sustained application so

186
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:22,320
so whichever of these metaphors work for you and the another metaphor that i invited

187
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:28,160
you to consider today is is being a surfer and those of

188
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,280
you who are surfers maybe can easily connect with the joy and even

189
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,640
though i'm not a surfer but having watched surfers there is so much joy

190
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:46,160
watching surfers when they catch away when they connect with the wave and then they stay on the wave as long

191
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:52,160
as possible there's such joy so for us to connect

192
00:39:52,160 --> 00:40:00,400
with the with the wave with the breath initial application to to connect with

193
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:06,000
it and then ride the breath surf

194
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:14,319
serve the breath for as long as possible and joy arises joy arises with the

195
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:20,960
out breath in breath the pauses the breath oh it's pausing pausing oh

196
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:28,880
and then there's another breath you can continue to surf it so this is a lovely metaphor

197
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:36,800
i just came up with today so it's it's new fresh off of my practice here it is enjoy

198
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:43,920
surf enjoy surfing and there's also this joy of the delight of this this idea of

199
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:50,720
surfing the breath really connecting into somebody the mind doesn't want to go anywhere else surfing

200
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:56,960
the breath is so much fun why would i get out of the water this is so much fun

201
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:04,160
so the joy which we talked about a couple days ago can actually be part of this metaphor part of this way

202
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:11,040
of working and i want to end with

203
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:17,280
saying making a distinction many of you might already know this but

204
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,400
but might also might be helpful as this week we are working with

205
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:28,640
samadhi and you might think what is the difference between samadhi concentration practice

206
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:35,119
and vipassana insight practice often translated as inside practice

207
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:41,839
so this can be a long long lecture and there are many similarities and

208
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:49,680
differences but in terms of technique um one thing to keep in mind

209
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:55,760
is and this is giving credit to um the similes giving credit to steve

210
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:01,760
armstrong um a teacher a senior teaching the trivada

211
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:10,079
i learned this from him a couple of decades ago he would say that

212
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:17,119
vipassana is like serial monogamy for the attention

213
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:24,480
so the attention is with the breath and then um and then there's a sound so

214
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,760
the attention can go to the sound and be with that but really there's monogamy you're really

215
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:37,599
dedicating giving yourself staying with that object and then um maybe a sensation arises in

216
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:42,800
the body then you go to that then you're monogamous but it's serial you go

217
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:48,720
from one object to another to another insight an insight opening up to all

218
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:54,000
these different objects after the mind has settled with

219
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:01,760
samadhi now samadhi concentration on the other hand is

220
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:08,000
in his words absolute monogamy it's just the breath you come back to the

221
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:15,760
breath and you're just with the breath absolutely monogamous faithful to one object whatever the

222
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:24,079
object of your concentration of your practice is just with the breath and often

223
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:30,079
one thing that actually might sound confusing is that we often in the practice of vipassana we start

224
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:36,560
with a few minutes or a period of uh samadhi practice to settle the

225
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:43,359
mind we keep coming back to the breath with this sense of oh just a breath just a breath and then when the mind is

226
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:49,359
settled with some concentration samadhi practice at the beginning of

227
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:54,800
inside practice then we can open up usually we open

228
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:02,240
up the attention this fear of attention so that when the mind is settled then it

229
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:08,319
can stay with the sound oh yes impermanence the sound is coming and

230
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:14,319
going oh the sensations oh notice the vedana in the sensations

231
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:21,119
so there is that malleability that flexibility so i just wanted to offer these and i

232
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:26,160
realized this was kind of brief i hope it was helpful and made sense um

233
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:35,839
there's so much more here to cover there's so much more dharma and to be a scientist of your own mind

234
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:43,680
so explore explore for yourself today what is the nature of gentle

235
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,800
perseverance gentle perseverance in your daily activities

236
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:55,359
gentle perseveres without judgment coming back coming back initial application

237
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:03,760
sustained application enjoying enjoying really tuning into the joy of surfing the wave

238
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:10,240
of whatever it is you're doing so thank you all for your practice may you

239
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:18,318
be well and see you tomorrow
