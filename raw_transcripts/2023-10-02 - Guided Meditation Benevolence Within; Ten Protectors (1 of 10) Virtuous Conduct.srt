1
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:10,280
sitting down here for the first time in three weeks I'm uh feel

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,678
very delighted

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:22,119
happy and I wish you a warm greeting here from the Insight

4
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:28,920
Meditation Center and warm greeting from

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:36,640
the from the momentum of the 3-we retreat that I was just teaching at our

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,760
Insight retreat center and uh it's nice that they ended

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,600
on Saturday it's nice now to come Monday morning and and sit here when just first

8
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,399
arrived here it was still dark and just like uh going for the morning meditation at the retreat center

9
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:03,680
it was still dark so um thank you for being

10
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:17,640
here one of the challenges around meditation is to avoid over prioritizing

11
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:25,119
thinking certainly to avoid being stuck in thinking and it might be useful to

12
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,759
consider that uh the role of thinking ordinary

13
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:38,640
thinking discursive thinking the useful role that it has is it's a

14
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,119
bridge between an inner Source

15
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:52,680
within and our action how we live and if we understand that to be a

16
00:01:52,680 --> 00:02:00,079
bridge then we see that action is more important than thinking we learn more about ourselves

17
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:05,640
in our actions than we do in our thoughts even though many people are trying to understand themselves trying

18
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,000
to understand something through thinking we understand more of ourselves

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
through action than thinking if our thinking is a bridge to understand to be in touch with

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,640
this some a source within exactly what the sources is is

21
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:31,519
maybe each person needs to discover for themselves but it's The Source from

22
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:38,080
where generosity flows where love flows

23
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,120
kindness benevolence where respect for others and

24
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,159
for oneself the source for an inner peace and

25
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:56,000
well-being the source for an inner intuition

26
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:04,959
for for wisdom for acting on love acting on kindness acting

27
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,040
on generosity these wonderful positive

28
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:15,319
motivations and impulses have a source within us they

29
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:23,760
don't just kind of appear out of thin blue Air and it's possible to be disconnected

30
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,959
from them partly by being overly preoccupied with thinking

31
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:39,760
and partly because uh more surface reactivities dominate for us our our

32
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:47,119
aversions our desires our [Music]

33
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:58,680
greedspeed itation is a place where we more discover this Source

34
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,879
Within than action but in discovering that Source

35
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:09,000
within for these this whole nurturing

36
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,480
tender kind strength that we capable of having

37
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:22,079
inside uh we discover it there so that uh when we act we can act from that

38
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:28,880
place mediated by our thinking so to assume a meditation

39
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,120
posture and perhaps you find a

40
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:44,000
posture that provides you with some sense or some approximation or some

41
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,360
intimation of an inner strength that is also intimately

42
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:58,039
connected to a kind a tenderness or a Simplicity

43
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:03,638
of being that

44
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:11,400
gentleness tenderness and gentleness are trying to point to a way

45
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,600
of being where we're not asserting

46
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:24,720
ourselves demanding things of the world and of ourselves not fending things off

47
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:32,080
involved in conflicts and fights it's simp Simplicity of being at

48
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,960
least in our inner

49
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:47,000
life finding a place within that will provide

50
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,680
wisdom for how we act in the world

51
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:01,479
later and then gently closing the eyes

52
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,440
and taking a few moments to

53
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:19,759
feel in your body whatever place you

54
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:27,360
think might be the source for your goodness

55
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,478
for benevolence for

56
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:42,639
kindness and from that place as if the breathing begins there

57
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,280
taking a few long slow deep

58
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:58,400
breaths maybe an expansion of the body as you breathe

59
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,599
in that spreads out words from that

60
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,240
source and returns to it on the

61
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
exhale

62
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,160
letting your breathing return to

63
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:48,639
normal and as you exhale continue to relax parts of your body your face your

64
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:56,758
shoulders your belly but doing so is a settling

65
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,840
in through some sort Source

66
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:13,280
within that you might Inuit it or or use your best

67
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,800
guess where such a source might

68
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
be

69
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:56,120
feeling whatever tension or pressure or weariness there might be in the thinking

70
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:05,320
mind and gently Relax The Thinking mind as you

71
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
exhale

72
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
for

73
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,240
and then if it is comfortable for

74
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,320
you to settle into your body

75
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:30,640
breathing where the beginning of your breathing of the inhale

76
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:39,480
is connected to some place inside deep inside in your torso

77
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:49,720
perhaps where there's a feeling of inner intimacy

78
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,880
or Stillness or

79
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
calm

80
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:13,200
as you exhale letting go of thoughts and letting go into that

81
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:19,160
Stillness that intimate quiet maybe tender

82
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
place

83
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
for

84
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
for

85
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
for

86
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
e

87
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
for

88
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
for

89
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
for

90
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
for

91
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
for

92
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
e

93
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
for

94
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
e

95
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:04,720
e if thinking is the bridge between some

96
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,200
inner source of benevolence

97
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:17,880
goodness and our actions and the action of

98
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:25,799
meditation involves having thinking gently

99
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:31,039
quietly point us back to

100
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:40,720
Inner source of tenderness goodness a place of safety

101
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,039
and good

102
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,880
will gently simple

103
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:03,360
thoughts bring you back to that

104
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,919
inner that inner source that inner

105
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
quiet

106
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
for

107
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
for

108
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
for

109
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
for

110
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
for

111
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
e

112
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
for

113
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
for

114
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
for

115
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
for

116
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
for

117
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
for

118
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
for

119
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:12,320
and as we come to the end of this sitting to see now feel

120
00:27:12,399 --> 00:27:21,398
now for any place within that feels tender or

121
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:29,520
gentle a place where self preoccupation self

122
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:38,039
assertion anxiety around self is lessened is

123
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:45,919
quiet maybe a place of softness or

124
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:56,519
warmth a place that from where love kindness can

125
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:05,919
arise a place where that can receive love or

126
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,960
kindness can recognize

127
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:22,519
it and consider if you're in touch with such a

128
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:29,440
place within that this is something that is worth protecting

129
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:40,679
safeguarding because it safeguards us it protects

130
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:44,919
us to stay close to

131
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:59,279
this and may we at the end of this sitting wish this for

132
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:06,960
others that they feel an inner safety and

133
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,200
well-being that connects them to the source of

134
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,360
benevolence in their own hearts and their own

135
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:21,159
body may all

136
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,880
beings receive and offer the

137
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:39,159
full pallet of benevolence that humans are capable

138
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:46,960
of may all beings have the safety that allows for them to

139
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:52,000
be generous and kind and

140
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:59,799
friendly may all beings have the trust that allows them

141
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:05,640
to rest in inner safety and

142
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,640
well-being may all beings have the

143
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:21,360
freedom to be able to act from the benevolent Source

144
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:28,320
within may all beings be happy may all beings

145
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:34,320
be safe may all beings be

146
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,600
peaceful may all beings be

147
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:51,320
free and may we find ways to support this in the

148
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,240
world

149
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,039
[Music] thank

150
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,159
you

151
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:32,200
so hello and welcome to this Monday where we begin a

152
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:39,919
new theme for 7 a.m. teachings our 7 a.m.

153
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:47,440
Explorations and um I'll be here for the next two weeks and then I go back on to teach

154
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:54,559
another weeklong Retreat so in these two weeks it's 10 of

155
00:32:54,559 --> 00:33:01,200
these weekday morning City things and uh so I'm inspired to teach

156
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:09,799
uh to use the basis for these 10 days uh what's called the 10 protectors the 10

157
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:17,120
supports and uh this uh word uh Nati can

158
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:24,320
mean someone who really is a protector someone who safeguards others and um also someone who helps

159
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:29,760
someone who supports and the idea is that um there

160
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:36,000
are these 10 protectors that we have and how we live

161
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:43,960
how we act in the world how we um the attitudes we have the

162
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:50,760
motivations we have and that uh these 10 protectors that we have are something we

163
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:58,639
can call upon something we can um have as a protection and this assumes that

164
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:04,320
there is something worth protecting um and it's not you know

165
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:11,158
ourselves in the kind of General way we might be concerned about ourselves uh because we have all kinds

166
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:17,800
of complicated relationships with ourselves all kinds of complicated uh maybe some not so helpful attitudes

167
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:25,079
About Me Myself and mine and even selfishness that comes along and um and

168
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:31,760
we're not trying to protect our selfishness but to protect uh a deep Source within

169
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:38,158
and I use the word Source um maybe it should be the idea the word should be

170
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:45,560
that concept should be held a little bit lightly but um uh we have anxiety for

171
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,919
example that's the source for um fretting and worrying about our life and

172
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:59,040
the future uh and that that anxiety could be felt physically somewhere in our body that's activated in tense

173
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:05,760
maybe uh we could have uh a feeling of a different kind of tension inside

174
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,359
different kind of maybe um um hurt or

175
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:19,440
anger that can be the source for ill will and even hostility and we have a sources within

176
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,640
or a place or a location or something that some conditions that need to kind

177
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:32,240
of be in place for us to come with into the world with generosity with benevolence with

178
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:39,079
kindness with friendliness uh with um a sense of care

179
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:46,680
and for the for the world and ourselves and that that that Source if

180
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:55,079
we may on inside tends to be overridden or covered over or uh obscured by

181
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:01,480
overlay active mind that's driven by anxiety or hostility or conceit or

182
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:07,480
desires of what we want lust and greed and when those kinds of uh things

183
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:13,160
settle quiet um then these deeper U motivations

184
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:19,040
deeper way way of being can show themselves and uh it can appear through

185
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:27,079
as we get calmer more subtle and it can be quite wonderful to feel a kind of deep sense of inner Intimacy in the here

186
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:32,280
and now in the present moment with our lived experience that's below the

187
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:39,359
discursive level of thought where we might often be caught up in and discursive thinking that's driven by um

188
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:44,800
these more unhealthy or obscuring uh attitudes

189
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,560
motivations so we C and settle and come into the present moment through our body

190
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:57,880
and some point there might be a feeling of I'm home there's an intimacy there's a a place of where there's more wisdom

191
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:05,119
more sensitivity and um and so that sense or feeling for that inside which it's not

192
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:10,640
meant to be a spec I call it a source it's not meant to be uh you know

193
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:16,319
identifiable as okay right there is where it is um but sometimes there more

194
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:22,280
effusive place within U maybe somewhere in the Torso in the belly some people

195
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:29,079
might associate with the heart some people with the belly uh some people in some other kind of effusive way that

196
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:36,119
spreads through the body a kind of sense of goodness or Wellness that is

197
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:41,920
there and um and this uh uh and so this

198
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:50,160
is worth protecting this needs a protector for us because the way life is the way that um uh we are sometimes

199
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,760
caught up in the world um not only can obscure it but can also kind of limit it

200
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:02,560
or or or even damage it in some ways and so to know how to to call upon those

201
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:07,800
things that will protect it and um and the first thing that uh in

202
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:15,040
this list of 10 is um virtuous conduct the actions that we do in the

203
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:23,800
world that we do actions which are ethical or are wholesome uh that have that uh uh that

204
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:31,400
are beneficial in the world that do not cause harm so um

205
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:36,800
nonharming actions in the world and these uh virtuous actions and it's

206
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:43,000
thinking about this it's useful I think to consider that um sometimes we learn more

207
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:50,640
about ourselves through our actions than through our thinking I think some people in the modern world have become

208
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,680
excessively preoccupied with their thoughts trying to think their way out

209
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:02,520
of everything or to to figure out everything or understand everything as if thinking is a vehicle for making

210
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:09,160
sense of the world making sense of oneself protecting oneself planning better for the future remembering all

211
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:17,240
about the past to make it better or something and certainly thoughts have a very important role in our lives but uh

212
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:24,680
uh it's not necessarily where we come to the best understanding of ourselves that um many ways we

213
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:33,200
understand ourselves better through actions but what we do in our lives and how what we say in our lives and if we and if we

214
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,880
see and hear and understand that the actions then become a window into

215
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,520
understanding something deeper about ourselves and the role the thinking has

216
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:53,119
is to be a bridge between our actions our speech and some uh the source within

217
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:59,480
and if the source within is anxiety and anger and hostility greed and lust then

218
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:06,560
the actions have a particular shape and form but if um The Source

219
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:13,839
uh of is this place of benevolence non- assertiveness non-c conceit nonhostility

220
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:20,720
non greed non lust uh uh very then

221
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:27,040
thinking is the medium is the me is a bridge for that that place to come into

222
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:35,160
the world and uh in our actions and it goes in both directions so our actions

223
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:40,520
protect this inner place of goodness and it's really worth

224
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:47,240
protecting and so the more people meditate for example there are other ways of tapping into this the more we

225
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:54,440
understand this is Health this is a kind of Inner Health inner uh um Beauty

226
00:40:54,440 --> 00:41:00,760
inner um uh um Freedom that's worth

227
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:07,160
protecting it's a place that um where that

228
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,960
recognizes the value of being truthful recognizes it truth in

229
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:21,040
ourselves recognize it in others it's a place that um that uh resonates with

230
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:28,040
kindness It's a place that uh uh acknowledges or conf affirms the value

231
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:33,800
of friendliness or generosity and um it can see it in the

232
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:40,599
others see it in the world and and uh and respond to it it can offer it to the

233
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:48,720
world and so one of the ways to protect this place is to live a life of virtuous

234
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:55,800
conduct to live a life that uh abstains from doing the things that we know are

235
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:02,200
going to harm harm other people or we maybe uh maybe suspect

236
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:07,800
might harm other people and the tradition certainly lists five things

237
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:12,880
that uh are harmful it's harmful to be

238
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:19,040
killing or uh physically harming others with violence

239
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:25,000
with it's harmful to others uh to steal to steal from them to take what is not

240
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:33,040
given it harmful to others to to be involved in sexual misconduct sexuality

241
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:38,319
which take advantage of people we're we assert ourselves over people there's an

242
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:46,400
aggression in the in the sexuality there is a deceit in it there's lying there is

243
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:53,319
um uh a lack of respect for for the other person that lack of respect for

244
00:42:53,319 --> 00:42:59,079
other partners that we have and and um and then uh there's uh

245
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:06,480
we harm by lying and we harm uh not directly but

246
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:12,119
indirectly ourselves and others with uh the consumption of alcohol and

247
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:17,720
recreational drugs and a lot of harm gets done in our society for this and

248
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:27,079
there might be other ways in which we harm but uh at least for these five areas to really uh a if you want to

249
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:33,119
protect our inner goodness want to help Discover it and let it kind of flourish

250
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:38,599
then um these things are are really important so in the list of these 10

251
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:45,000
protect protectors our actions can protect they there's a and there's a

252
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,760
bridge there's a channel between uh these actions to living a life of uh

253
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:57,160
ethical integrity and this inner inner life and that bridge that channel is our

254
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:04,400
thinking if we know that we're living ethically know that we're not causing other people harm intentionally and

255
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:11,720
overt ways uh that's to be celebrated that's to be appreciated and so to have

256
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:16,920
thoughts that uh uh that have inner confidence that we're not causing harm

257
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:23,599
thoughts that uh recognize it appreciate that um uh and letting those thoughts

258
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:29,520
kind of point us back to that place The Source within that resonates that

259
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:37,119
recognizes the inner wholesomeness of uh of of living

260
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:44,160
without motivations to harm anyone at at all without any hostility or any greed

261
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:50,160
that that can cause harm and there is this kind of sensibility sensitivity

262
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:57,960
that exists within us that uh that um that

263
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:04,559
that that's what feels the best the intuition of our goodness intuition of

264
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:13,000
our ethical Integrity intuition of a deeper Wellspring of um benevolence that we can

265
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,200
live our life by so the first protector we have is our

266
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:26,240
actions and specifically uh being careful to live a wholesome life a wholesome uh based on the five precepts

267
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:31,880
not to kill or physically harm people not to steal not to engage in sexual

268
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:39,040
misconduct not to lie and not to abuse intoxicants so

269
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:45,800
um I hope that uh on this day as we go through these 10

270
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:53,079
protectors that we can have that um you the the kind of the most obvious because

271
00:45:53,079 --> 00:46:01,599
they can be seen um and maybe you could take a look at your actions and your speech and

272
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:07,400
consider um where your actions where your speech comes from and is there a

273
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:16,079
way of speaking a way of acting that you feel Safeguard something precious uh

274
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:22,960
within so thank you very much and uh I look forward to

275
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,800
it tomorrow
