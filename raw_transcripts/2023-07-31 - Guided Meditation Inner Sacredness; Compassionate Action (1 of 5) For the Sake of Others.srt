1
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:07,880
so hello and warm greetings

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:15,900
and happy to be back here at IMC at 7 00 a.m sitting here with

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,660
all of you and um

4
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:30,420
and um so the last three weeks was at the

5
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:37,559
Sahara Zen Monastery in deep in the Los Padres National Wilderness which is kind

6
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:43,020
of in Monterey County and it's several mountain ridges over from

7
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:49,320
the Big Sur Coast deep in the mountains and um

8
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:57,660
up and over one of the mountains in a kind of 14 mile dirt road coming down steep valley and narrow Valley too this

9
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:04,920
beautiful Creek river called tasahara Creek tasara river and in there there's a now for 55 years

10
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:12,600
a Zen monastery I trained there many years ago and it was formative for me to be there

11
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:20,040
in many ways and it was very significant to go back there to actively support people who

12
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,900
were practicing in that ballet in that monastery and to be in conversations with them

13
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:32,220
and I'm reminded over and over again but

14
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:38,100
certainly being there for something which I feel is quite sacred

15
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:46,280
and uh and that's uh and what we might call everyone's hearts

16
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:52,340
the depths of people's inner life inner

17
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:58,560
capacity for feeling connected and belonging and and

18
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,200
alive in this world and how that deep inner sacred dimension

19
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:11,220
of our heart that which maybe is in some ways most personal and at the same most impersonal

20
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:18,900
most transpersonal is sometimes

21
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:28,560
buried sometimes wounded in deep ways hurt sometimes difficult to access

22
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,260
uh sometimes people are afraid of it

23
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,900
but to come close to it and support people and meet people in the depths of

24
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,000
their inner kind of the most valuable most important parts of what their inner

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,920
life is about their full life is about uh that's where we're not distracted not

26
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:59,459
caught up in the things of the world or in our conceit

27
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:05,040
is um for me that's that's a sacred Dimension and and to care for that

28
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,800
sacred Dimension to meet it to be part of each other's sacred kind of inner life

29
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,140
and perhaps you could use a different word than sacred just the word I like

30
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:24,420
um and but I do feel that coming here and surprisingly coming here at 7 A.M with

31
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:30,180
uh alone in this room with the camera on the wall opposite me and

32
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:38,300
two monitors in front of me a laptop and a large screen so I can see more easily you all in the chats

33
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:44,640
surprising that for me that this uh is a vehicle a means for feeling something

34
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:51,299
that again I call sacred kind of a very special the profound maybe profound is another

35
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:57,620
possible word than sacred maybe heartfelt Maybe

36
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:04,799
something very core or essential so it's very nice to be here it's very

37
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:11,459
nice to be able to share this part of myself and hopefully touch this part of you

38
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:18,440
and coming from dasara I feel kind of it kind of

39
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:25,759
inspired quite a bit by all this and I I offer this introduction because

40
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:33,300
this week I'll continue this series I've been doing now for about I don't know six maybe seven weeks related to

41
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:39,180
compassion and um and the uh

42
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,479
the poly Sanskrit word for compassion is karuna

43
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:51,240
and there is a kind of I don't know if wordplay is fair but there is a kind of Association in the word and how it was

44
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:59,820
used in ancient India with the word Karma they both have the word the the root to make or to do

45
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:06,060
and uh and they also have a strong Association to pre-buddhist uh

46
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:13,080
associations to Sacred action and um especially with the idea of

47
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,900
sacred rituals and things like that and the Buddha took the ancient brahmanical

48
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:25,020
religious orientation and adopted some of these words that they use but moved

49
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:33,080
them away from the idea of ritual to being something deeply personal and so here we have this a word that uh

50
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:41,880
Karma that has a variety of meanings but has association with um with sacred ritual

51
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:48,660
and now karuna so there are some Scholars who have said that karuna as

52
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:55,039
has this kind of meaning or association with a sacred ritual sacred activity

53
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:02,220
sacred doing that comes out of us and so you know my association with the

54
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,259
sacredness of the profunda in the profound aspect of our human life

55
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:12,479
and how do we care for each other and how do we meet that and how do we come from our own

56
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:20,039
depth in order to support other people and their capacity for depth or profundity or fullness or

57
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:26,759
sacredness or something um so here we are

58
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:33,000
the enactment of something that touches

59
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,900
the sacred with care with love with compassion what a wonderful thing and to learn that

60
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:45,060
or to feel like we're in the in in the neighborhood of it that it's being

61
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:53,699
discussed and being explored in a world where this may be a stuff not common enough to do is a remarkable

62
00:06:53,699 --> 00:07:02,819
thing and I feel grateful to be here with you so to begin this meditation

63
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:08,400
to assume a meditation posture that's appropriate for you

64
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,580
and and this idea of appropriate and wise posture for yourself

65
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,860
that is considered is can be seen as an act of compassion

66
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:26,699
or inner care or kind of being attuned to you know

67
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:32,039
something deep inside for what really feels most connecting

68
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:38,419
the most enlivening most personal way of meditating

69
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,159
and gently closing your eyes

70
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:51,960
and one of the ancient Pali words Buddhist words that I love is a word for

71
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:58,560
Assurance to be confident or assured

72
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,960
and it means to breathe that the literal me the word comes from the poly root or

73
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:10,560
meaning to breathe easily and to find a way to breathe easily to

74
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:18,900
be at ease in this world and have the breath be free and easy is a wonderful task a task of a lifetime

75
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:24,599
and not always easy but to know that that's the direction we're going

76
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:30,599
because the breathing for many of us kind of sits at the Nexus

77
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:35,820
the meeting place of so much of our life that is closely related to this

78
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:45,260
profundity of possibility within us and so to take a few long slow

79
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:51,620
gentle breaths a little bit deeper than usual

80
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:59,459
so it feels good it feels nice just to the extent in which it feels nice maybe even delicious

81
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:06,800
to breathe in deeply and to relax as you exhale

82
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:26,339
and letting your breathing return to normal and again at the in the exhale to relax

83
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:35,300
the body not thinking that relaxing is superficial or rudimentary or

84
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:42,920
relaxing is really a whiff beginning to approach or settle into

85
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,720
a profound connection to oneself

86
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,120
relaxing the face

87
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,800
around the eyes as you exhale

88
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,800
softening the shoulders

89
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:37,220
relaxing in the area of your heart the heart center

90
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:49,100
maybe even loosening up in the diaphragm

91
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,920
and to soften the belly

92
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:34,579
as you exhale to relax the thinking mind

93
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:44,779
a gentle and slow quieting of the thinking

94
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:05,339
the settling into a calming calmness

95
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,440
in the mind

96
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:39,600
and then relaxing into the place within

97
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,639
someplace within your body within your heart

98
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:54,079
or maybe within your mind if that's what it is where you feel most at home or most safe

99
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,320
most comfortable

100
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:13,040
and in that comfort that safety may be profundity Within

101
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:21,860
breathe breathe with

102
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:27,980
with it breathe through it

103
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:35,940
let breathing with to accompany that place that sends that intuition of

104
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:43,880
what is most profound or most safe or most at the Home Place Within

105
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,139
settling into it each time you exhale

106
00:13:54,300 --> 00:14:00,740
letting the thoughts about other times in other places distracting thoughts

107
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:06,480
float away recede in the background

108
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,860
as you settle in

109
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:23,339
to what within feels most home

110
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:29,779
most intimate Here and Now

111
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:03,259
having sat these minutes together in silence and quiet

112
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:10,820
might there be some way that you can sense or feel or into it

113
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:21,320
something that's below the usual discursive mind the usual daily concerns and feelings

114
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,320
can you drop into some Dimension Within

115
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:37,519
that feels like the most intimate the most profound most centered place within

116
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:49,639
a place which is both very personal

117
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:57,779
and very non-personal Maybe transpersonal

118
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:04,020
so personal that is no longer

119
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:11,780
part of your ideas of Who You Are fears of Who You Are

120
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:20,179
no longer part of how others see you and how you want to be seen

121
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:30,539
for every exhale settling into this place

122
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:33,379
Within

123
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:59,480
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

124
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:09,179
to consider how the depths of your being

125
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:18,020
the depths of your heart and capacity to feel and connect to others

126
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:24,779
can at times be a source of care of compassion and love

127
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:29,840
concerned with the welfare and happiness of others

128
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,679
may all beings be happy

129
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:44,940
may all beings be safe may all beings

130
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:51,980
be peaceful and may all beings everywhere

131
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,799
be free

132
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:03,659
[Music]

133
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:12,569

compassion the foundations for compassion and uh hoping I'm hoping or trying to

152
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:19,980
expand outwards for you the richness of what compassion is and all the

153
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:26,820
dimensions of it and aspects of it so that you can appreciate the

154

they you know the the you know how to be compassionate in this

155
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,240
world how to bring forth this beautiful quality we have in a way that is

156
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:44,778
nourishing for you and nourishing for others

157
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,640
um it's been the first person I heard really teach this was that it was Dalai

158
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,159
Lama that if you want to be happy be compassionate care for others

159
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,440
and um and so disassociation with personal happiness

160
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:08,220
and well-being in having Compassion Care love for others is a really profound

161
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:14,940
aspect but to find that uh we really I think it really helps to understand more

162
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:19,980
deeply the different aspects the different things that come together to

163
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:26,280
support the healthy forms of compassion it's too easy for compassion to be feel

164
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:32,339
like it's an obligation it's too easy for a compassion to be a reaction to our

165
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:38,339
own distress our own pain sometimes what looks like compassion is really trying is trying to certainly

166
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:45,480
trying to help others not suffer but the motivation is mostly so we don't suffer so we're we're too uncomfortable trying

167
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,760
to you know make ourselves more comfortable or it could come with an excessive

168
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,858
feeling of responsibility or or a feeling of you know trying to it's kind

169
00:34:55,859 --> 00:35:01,859
of an exchange the wanting to be compassionate to others so that we can get something back from them their

170
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:07,920
approval or something but to have clean compassion compassion

171
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,440
that needs nothing in return compassion that is does not come out of

172
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:19,320
our distress does not come out of our conceit does not come out of our fears

173
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:26,520
and doesn't come out of obligation a sense of obligation but rather it comes out of some

174
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:32,160
Wellspring within that that is sweet

175
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:39,720
that is satisfying that has a rightness to it and sometimes the suffering of the world

176
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:44,760
that we contact UM it just doesn't you can't really feel

177
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:50,760
like the The Compassion is sweet or has a right has a you know even Joy or

178
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:56,640
happiness in it because it's the suffering is so great but we don't feel still we don't feel

179
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,980
distressed or obligated it doesn't trigger our conceits and self-concepts

180
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:07,500
of what who we are and who we're trying to prove to be or something and so there's a kind of feeling of

181
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:13,380
rightness or feeling of yeah kind of yes this is

182
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:19,260
painful this is difficult this is terrible and

183
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:25,920
I'm here in a clear and clean way to do the best I can and that Clarity that

184
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:32,579
cleanness that openness is um is kind of what contributes to in the

185
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:39,420
long term that stepping out of our own little inner dramas about ourselves and

186
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:46,320
into the wider world of caring for the world and being open and available is one of the really fantastic things that

187
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:53,160
the person can do and so hopefully these talks have been supportive for this

188
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:59,880
and um and so I've kind of uh

189
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:06,599
look now at Compassion I'm kind of looking at the compassion through five lines of five different aspects of

190
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:14,040
compassion or five different supports for compassion and uh a week on each of these of

191
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:19,400
awareness Attunement appreciation

192
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:27,119
aspiration and this week it's action and many people think of action almost

193
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:32,400
first and foremost with compassion we have to do something we have to step up

194
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:40,079
and and uh and save save others or step up and somehow take care of them and

195
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:48,599
certainly sometimes it what's needed is needs to be done immediately but to um to have cultivated and

196
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:55,640
developed a capacity to to show up to be mindful to be present

197
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:03,060
in a full and embodied and and Wise Way supports the possibility that when it's

198
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:09,180
a my immediate action is needed that it comes along almost a second

199
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:15,240
nature a capacity for wise awareness

200
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:23,220
a capacity for wise Attunement to the situation a capacity for really a deep

201
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:29,240
appreciation of the people the persons that we're involved in respect for them

202
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:34,440
and appropriate aspiration for what we want to do

203
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:41,940
and then that supports the action an action maybe is uh you know is one of

204
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:49,140
the Central features of compassion it isn't just simply wanting people not to suffer

205
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:56,460
feel their suffering have empathy for it and wish that they don't suffer that's significant but there's one more

206
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:05,220
step and that is action to do something and uh some people it's only by doing

207
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:10,339
something in the world doing something acting that we begin

208
00:39:10,339 --> 00:39:16,619
dissolving some of the crusts some of the hardness of our

209
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:21,900
sometimes our laziness sometimes our indecisiveness sometimes there are hurt

210
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:28,640
sometimes our stubbornness sometimes our our way we're closed the way we're

211
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:37,440
afraid all kinds of things where we get stuck and um and uh may be frozen in despair

212
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:43,680
that we have sometimes with and but to step forward and act there's something

213
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:49,260
about the movement of activity that begins loosening us up that begins

214
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:59,339
almost getting ourselves out of ourselves and so to do an action that's beneficial

215
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:06,180
for some other someone else besides ourselves where the focus of attention part of the focus of attention is on the

216
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:12,480
other person enough so that self-pre-occupation self you know

217
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:19,740
sometimes a self-pre occupation for some of us is almost like kind of an addiction that we're so kind of centered and so

218
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:25,099
concerned maybe because our life has been very confusing and very

219
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:30,839
disorganized and very disorienting and very painful and so of course in those kinds of

220
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:36,119
situations it's it's almost necessary to have a lot of attention on oneself in

221
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:41,700
order to find one's way in order to survive and to somehow continue

222
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:47,220
and I don't want to belittle how some people really need as a first step in

223
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:53,579
their lives essential step is to be focused on themselves but it's easy to get stuck there it's

224
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:59,160
easy for that to be built up in such a way that there's a wall between self and

225
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:05,099
other there's a closeness there's a collapsing inwards

226
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:12,240
so how do we loosen that up and and action makes a big difference

227
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:18,660
and so to act for the sake of someone else

228
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:25,020
to such a degree that some there's some kind of self-forgetting some kind of dropping of

229
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:32,280
self-concern some kind of of um of lacking of lacking or dropping

230
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:37,440
conceit and I keep saying some kind because we

231
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:43,560
don't want to lose ourselves in the compassionate action we don't want to lose touch with what's happening inside

232
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:49,260
of ourselves we want to be responsible we want to be mindful and monitor ourselves and what's happening

233
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:54,619
and that's why these words these concepts of developing awareness

234
00:41:54,619 --> 00:42:00,119
Attunement is such an important foundation for my for mindfulness and to

235
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:06,359
really have a strong foundation in Awareness practices so you're tracking and knowing what's happening within when

236
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:12,300
we stress when we're getting caught up or getting afraid or getting overly

237
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:18,660
ambitious and kind of can track ourselves but there's a way of tracking ourselves and being present that's not

238
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:26,040
exactly focusing on ourselves it's kind of being present and aware of the whole

239
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:31,680
environment including self it's kind of like if you turn on a light small light

240
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:37,500
in the middle of a dark room in a sense it's a very fast super fast so you can't

241
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:43,020
tell but the light radiates outwards and it it first lights up the part of the

242
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:49,500
room that's closest to the lamp and then outward and outward until it gets to the walls of the room

243
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:56,400
and you know with the kind of speed in which we can notice in the eye it's all instantaneous with but um

244
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,760
uh but so the same thing with awareness is it spreads outwards from ourselves

245
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:08,160
and first it touches us and knows what's happening here without it being

246
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:15,240
the kind of confused by self-preoccupation defining ourselves by what's going on

247
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:21,960
limiting ourselves by our identity of who we are in the moment and trying to prove ourselves trying to

248
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:29,220
protect ourselves trying to defend ourselves whatever it might be so we want to be aware of ourselves but

249
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:36,119
in that awareness the self-park begins Falls away we're aware of the emotions and feelings and

250
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:41,940
Sensations here and we're very aware of the people we're helping we're extending ourselves

251
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:51,960
opening ourselves letting self almost disappear in the process so in this way the action of compassion

252
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:57,859
is focused on supporting and helping others

253
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:04,980
but it also is supportive of ourselves support of our own inner freedom to offer our

254
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:10,520
compassion with a sense of freedom without resistance without attachments

255
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:17,400
and to find our own Freedom this is where compassion can be beginning of a

256
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:23,160
source of Joy a source of sweetness a source of goodness a sort of a source of rightness

257
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:30,839
and a source of a deeper connection to what I call the sacred aspect of life

258
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:36,359
compassion ideally but being deeply attuned and appreciative of other people

259
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:42,540
and ourselves we're not just putting Band-Aids on people's cuts

260
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:48,660
we are putting Band-Aids on people's Cuts as a way of communicating a deep

261
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:53,880
care for their hearts for their inner life for

262
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:58,980
their fullness as a human being and it's a way of offering our respect and our

263
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:05,880
Fuller love in our appreciation and delight and joy in the other person as a

264
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:13,020
human being in their Humanity no matter who they are so yes the putting a Band-Aid on

265
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:18,540
someone's cut is valuable but the but the deeper forms of compassion that what

266
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:26,099
brings Joy is that's the vehicle for a deep connection to our own sacredness the sacredness of

267
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:31,260
others and the meeting of those two in the act of compassion

268
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:38,880
so to this week the idea is um to talk about action the fifth of these

269
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:44,280
parts of compassion and um and when that wave started

270
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:50,119
so if you'd like over these next 24 hours until we meet again

271
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:57,200
you might see and study the ways in which you

272
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:03,720
do nice things for other people whether you open a door whether you let

273
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:09,660
someone else have um the Short Line in the supermarket and

274
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:15,780
let them have it first whether it's smiling at a supermarket checkout Clerk

275
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:21,240
and being kind to them and whether it's helping someone and with some little

276
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:26,520
tasks they need or offering to do someone a favor or

277
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:32,460
do an errand for someone else so many different ways is we might actually do something for other people for strangers

278
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:38,579
for people we know well colleagues as you do these small things for others

279
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:45,660
or big things for others monitor yourself see see what's happening here

280
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:51,720
and in that doing for others uh is there contraction is there fear is there

281
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:58,200
self-preoccupation is there conceit is there concern about their desire for how you're seen in a good way

282
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:04,560
or or is there a way to drop all that and to have the care to be somehow a

283
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:10,980
beautiful Act of generosity a beautiful Act of opening and letting go of self-concern appropriately letting go of

284
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:17,520
self-concern a certain kind of self-concern so that it's there's a feeling of freedom and

285
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:23,040
openness in the care for others and maybe also a sense that you'd be

286
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:28,619
doing more than simply um

287
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:35,160
you know offering someone to have the shorter line in the supermarket or

288
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:41,339
giving people the right of way on the freeway there's some deeper sense of these other people as being the depths

289
00:47:41,339 --> 00:47:47,960
of their humanity and and care that we want to offer so

290
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:52,760
thank you and um

291
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:59,780
then thank you and I'll be here again tomorrow
