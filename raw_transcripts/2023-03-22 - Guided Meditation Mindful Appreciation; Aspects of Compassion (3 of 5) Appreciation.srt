1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,140
welcome and warm greetings to this time

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:13,740
these next 30 minutes for our meditation and um

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,779
meditation has a lot to do with being local

4
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:25,260
uh everything from you know the Dharma point of view in a sense is local it's

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:33,480
here local means in the Locale of this body this time here now

6
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,700
and um and so it's possible to have a bird's

7
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:46,200
eye view of something I was struck by I was in New Zealand in

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,660
February during the cyclone and the bird's eye view of the intensity

9
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:58,920
of the storm was terrible and the News was focusing on some of the

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,760
great damage that was being done and people killed and the bullet was not being shown shown

11
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,979
from this kind of high-end View where all the people who were helping

12
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:16,740
each other locally a lot of people coming to the aid of

13
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,560
neighbors and friends and a lot of people mobilize to try to help

14
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,520
so we got closer and closer to where we were the people right there in the little

15
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,640
place that I was staying and practicing was they were so kind and so friendly

16
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:42,479
and so supportive and and that didn't make the front news that

17
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:50,220
there were kind supportive helpful people so we begin being really local

18
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,799
and here the most local is here with ourselves

19
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:02,360
and here we try to

20
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:09,300
care appreciate for the people who are most

21
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,959
close with you which happens to be you you yourself

22
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,599
not in some kind of sentimental way not in some kind of conceited way

23
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:29,520
but kind of a straightforward very simple appreciation and respect for the life that's being lived in this

24
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:37,260
body in this heart in this mind that this life too if you come in close

25
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:45,540
is something to care for support and do and to appreciate and to respect

26
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:52,560
we come to our mind we learn over time that everyone it can be respected

27
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,160
including ourselves deep respect everyone can be appreciated a deep

28
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,560
appreciation including ourselves partly because

29
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:12,480
the alternative of not having respect and not having appreciation is not very healthy it's not doesn't

30
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,760
it's actually in some ways takes more work takes more mental power even though

31
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:26,700
sometimes people have it as a habit and it's so easy to do and and the most local most deep place

32
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:32,159
to be is to be here caring for

33
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:39,180
respecting appreciating this life life around us people people around us

34
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:45,200
and the most local of it all is here with ourselves and with the eyes closed in meditation

35
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,299
it's a training ground of letting go of all that is not

36
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:58,099
respectful all that is unappreciative about yourself

37
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:03,900
and you'll find you don't have to do appreciation or do respect

38
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:09,360
if you let go of all that disrespect and non-appreciation

39
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:16,919
then you'll find that it's kind of like the appreciation is there the respect is there it's just

40
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:24,380
there the deepest respect is not something we have to muster up

41
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:31,860
so to assume hey respectful meditation posture that posture in which you're going to

42
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,680
appreciate this body this life now

43
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,759
so no not no posture that requires excessive

44
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:51,380
strain no heroic posture

45
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,639
gently closing your eyes

46
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,620
and becoming aware of your body breathing

47
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,819
your body has breathed many many many breaths in this lifetime

48
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:40,020
breathing has been a companion support the helper

49
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,919
in all its different ways it cares for you the best it can

50
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,440
and deeper than the breathing is your heartbeat

51
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,860
sometimes in meditation you can feel it sometimes you can't

52
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,960
the heart's been beating for you for as for longer than you've been

53
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,319
breathing

54
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:37,860
some people consider the heart beating

55
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,000
the body breathing

56
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,919
to be the source the origin the beginning

57
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:56,060
of this life we're living now here

58
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:08,120
breathing and heart beating and blood moving through the body

59
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:16,819
are part of a vast physiological system neurological systems

60
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:22,979
that are here to support you operating often without any thanks or

61
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:28,819
even recognition here

62
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,699
and to have some modicum of appreciation

63
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,560
and respect for this body

64
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,180
even with all its challenges

65
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:07,520
and rather than appreciating yourself for now

66
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:14,819
appreciate that you can appreciate the body be the appreciator

67
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:20,060
the respecter of this body

68
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,699
This Heart

69
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:36,919
and this mind they're appreciating it respecting it

70
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:49,640
even though they all have their challenges and and difficulties

71
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:59,459
still close up there's a lot of goodness a lot of help

72
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:06,540
a lot of things that are working a lot that's a miracle to be sitting

73
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,720
here

74
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,959
in every breath every heartbeat every sensation in the

75
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:29,240
body even every thought feeling emotion

76
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,860
is a bit of a miracle that it should even exist

77
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:41,000
all part of a large cooperative

78
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:48,500
effort on the part of this Mind Body to care for you

79
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,300
and for you to care for to appreciate

80
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,220
settling yourself into this breathing body

81
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:06,660
with appreciation for all maybe even a sense of awe

82
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:13,220
that quiets and stills the thinking mind

83
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:12,320
and as we come to the end of this meditation

84
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:18,360
to drop the word into you to drop the word

85
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,320
appreciation

86
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:30,600
dropping it like a pebble into a pond and where does the word appreciation

87
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:35,600
land in you

88
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:47,820
where does it come to rest not pushed away not questioned

89
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:54,240
doubted but let the word the concept appreciation

90
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:00,919
settle in and come to rest someplace Within

91
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:16,559
and maybe from there to gaze upon the world

92
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:24,379
with appreciation gaze upon the people in your life and your neighborhoods

93
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,179
appreciating them respecting them

94
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:40,340
and with that appreciation simple and direct

95
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,900
to wish them well

96
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:55,639
imagine them well and wish it for them

97
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:02,419
may all beings be happy

98
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:09,259
may all beings be safe

99
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:19,519
may all beings be peaceful may all beings be free

100
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:30,380
may all beings be free of unhappiness

101
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:36,559
may all beings be free of fear

102
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:43,500
may all beings be free of war and fighting and

103
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:52,380
aggression and may all beings be free

104
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:58,440
of their bondage to create hatred and delusion

105
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:04,640
may all beings be free

106
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,099
[Music]

107
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:21,029
[Music]

108
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,080
thank you

109
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:35,039
then this will be the third talk on the elements the aspects of compassion

110
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:41,240
one way of thinking about this there are the building blocks for compassion

111
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:46,440
compassion is such a wonderful ideal and wonderful attitude to have

112
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:52,919
this and it's championed in many ways but it's often presented I think that

113
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:58,380
you're supposed to be compassionate or you want to be compassionate or as if you could just kind of mustard up and

114
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:04,919
just do it from you know you know on a moment's notice

115
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:11,220
but I think more realistically is that there's a foundation put in place for healthy compassion

116
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:19,320
for compassion that doesn't slide into distress or slide into a kind

117
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:26,640
of losing ourselves in other people excessive preoccupation with others and

118
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:33,600
losing touch with ourselves and um and so putting in the foundation having

119
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:42,779
the building blocks and on Monday I talked about having awareness not just being aware

120
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:49,140
but having a sense of autonomy in that awareness a sense of stability and strength in the

121
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:54,480
awareness so that the awareness is almost something that is not entangled

122
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:01,559
or caught in what we're aware of that kind of healthy very healthy insane

123
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:06,779
and kind of distance or openness or

124
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:14,220
bigness so awareness is bigger than anything that we are aware of or awareness is a step back and can gaze

125
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:20,039
kindly upon what's there so a sense of autonomy in the awareness

126
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:25,380
that sense of autonomy then is something that we can that comes into

127
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:32,159
um kind of a fullness as we get in get put these elements into place for compassion

128
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:37,620
so finally when compassion is mature there's a clear sense of autonomy or

129
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:45,840
Independence or or freedom in the their compassion itself

130
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:52,620
so yesterday it was Attunement one of the meanings of it to admit is to come into harmony with something

131
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:59,220
so rather than headlong rush into having compassion caring for someone helping

132
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:04,559
them fixing them doing something um is taking the time with that sense of

133
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:11,520
autonomy to find what's the harmonious way of being here what's the way to be attuned

134
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:17,240
or resonant with someone that's appropriate for both of us together

135
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:23,880
and uh and that effort to find that and you know it means we're up we're exercising a certain degree of autonomy

136
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:30,659
we're not lost in the experienced or lost in our preoccupation where they were kind of like standing there you

137
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:36,360
know upright and and uh and stable and then

138
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:41,880
finding where where is the residents where how do I be here in an appropriate

139
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:48,779
way to not identify with the person's suffering or become it but rather how do

140
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:54,299
I um uh be attuned to it to recognize it to

141
00:33:54,299 --> 00:34:00,140
accompany it to to be present in that way that's helpful

142
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:07,799
and then the next step in this these five elements of compassion is appreciation

143
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:15,480
and uh and appreciation carries a lot more value if we're autonomous if we're our own

144
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:22,560
person kind of who then can meet someone with appreciation if we kind of sink or

145
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,599
less than a full person or if we kind of feel like we have to kind of take care

146
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:34,500
of someone or join them in their misery or what's going on then they might feel like there's some

147
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:41,280
companionship and some people want to be have people kind of proving that they

148
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,679
um you know that they're committed to some kind of

149
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:52,200
way caring for them but but there's less there to offer but

150
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:57,660
if we can be kind of upright and autonomous then we can really come with certain kind of

151
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:05,220
healthy strength healthy presence where we're radiating more so that our appreciation

152
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:12,240
and our respect for others as a fuller field a fuller kind of there to be

153
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,940
recognized and um and so uh

154
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:24,660
uh appreciation is a lot to do with valuing someone else valuing who they

155
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:31,500
are it also means appreciating the wholeness of a person and not getting stuck on a

156
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:37,940
particular things they've done particularly things they said particularly quirks they have

157
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:44,220
that you might like or not like but to step back and appreciate this is

158
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:49,880
a human being who's been born who's been a baby who's gone through the

159
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:57,000
tremendous different kind of Life Experiences growing up some very challenging some may be

160
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,760
wonderful this is a person that's had to navigate so many things in this life in a

161
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:07,800
complicated life we all have and challenging lives and and here's a

162
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:14,359
person who's kind of you know taken a lot of knocks in this life and had a lot of challenges perhaps or

163
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:20,760
this is a person who's finding their way and this is a person to grant them their

164
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:28,200
autonomy there's a the respect that's in appreciation is one especially an

165
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:33,720
important thing because of respecting their autonomy their ability to make choices for themselves their ability to

166
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:41,880
be a dignified valued person who has whose opinions that matter who's whose

167
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:48,839
experience matters who's life matters but not to interfere not to kind of come

168
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:53,880
with compassion and try to tell them what to do and what you have to do and all these things

169
00:36:53,880 --> 00:37:01,380
and um so to um to appreciate others

170
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:07,680
and part of uh uh the appreciation Factor where that can come from

171
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,500
is it begins not necessarily with gazing up

172
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:22,578
on the other person thinking about the other person thinking about what to appreciate but rather it begins with in ourselves

173
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:27,839
to get settled in the place of awareness

174
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:33,060
settled in our bodies settled in the present moment so that the reactive mind the judging

175
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:39,560
mind the opinionated mind the scared mind that the the the

176
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:45,420
that's involved with you know lack of that offers disrespect or

177
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:52,020
disappreciation or worse you know Prejudice and bias and or resentment or

178
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:58,079
or Envy or uh blame or all kinds of things that the

179
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:05,700
Mind does one of the functions of meditation and mindfulness is to settle all that so

180
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:13,140
that we can live in the world from a different place and that different place

181
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:19,920
is a place where we appreciate how special it is

182
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,980
to be grounded centered calm we appreciate

183
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:31,260
being aware it's a miracle to be aware it's a

184
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:38,460
miracle to be mindful and and to be but to be busy in life

185
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:45,599
running around doing all the things we do we don't realize how to remember what a miracle it is

186
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:54,260
and so to come to a place where we simply appreciate being aware it's such a miracle

187
00:38:54,260 --> 00:39:02,040
then the Gaze of appreciation is one that appreciates regardless of

188
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:07,740
what it sees so it's not really so dependent on the

189
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:13,740
other person being just right and just perfect and doing everything the way you want the person to do

190
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:19,800
the person can even do things which maybe are unethical

191
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:25,500
and now to the appreciation is not an approval of that or letting them get letting them get away with it

192
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:32,099
but it's not being limited to that and seeing the whole person

193
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:39,180
I've known people who did live an unethical life and it all changed for them the thing

194
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:45,720
that transformed them when they met with someone who didn't see them through the

195
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:52,500
lens of what they had done but saw them as a whole person just appreciate who they were and to be seen

196
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:58,680
that way by someone else they kind of wow they kind of opened them to a more

197
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:04,260
fullness of who they are and what they can be that was powerful for them and

198
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:09,480
they kind of stepped into this Fuller person who they were and their unethical

199
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:15,180
Behavior stopped the kind of Miracle story maybe but it's

200
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:23,820
powerful to have this kind of be gazed on and be seen this whole way with appreciation rather than anything that

201
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:30,500
we're limiting people to a particular kind of small part of who they are

202
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:38,760
and so uh to have compassion without appreciation might not be

203
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:45,060
compassion to have a compassion without appreciation and respect for the person

204
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:52,680
I don't think that the compassionate action we do will be so clean or so

205
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:58,800
effective or touch something so deep it might be fixing or helping or it might

206
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:04,079
be enabling even something that they shouldn't be enabled to do

207
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:10,380
there's something about engaging someone with Compassionate Care

208
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:16,140
where they in the care they feel the appreciation the respect they feel like

209
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:22,980
we're being it you're being treated as a dignified autonomous person who can make your own decisions and you're there to

210
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:31,140
again to be their friend their accompany them to be available to offer what support might be needed

211
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:36,900
but you're not asserting ourselves we're not proving ourselves we're not

212
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:43,260
um uh feeling sorry for someone or have pity for someone they appreciation is

213
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:50,460
there the Deep respect I like to believe that this Dharma

214
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:57,060
practice is a practice that brings forth a lot of respect for

215
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:03,839
ourselves for the world for others and to live with mindfulness is to live

216
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:09,359
with respect the kind of respect that we're always

217
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:15,300
ready to bow to every everyone

218
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:21,540
if the step hour of respect that bow may be even a little reverence about deep appreciation

219
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:28,680
sometimes bowels of gratitude sometimes bows of delight and joy

220
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:34,320
something like that that we're always ready to Bow we might not actually bow

221
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:40,440
but the heart is always ready for that that kind of appreciation that kind of

222
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:46,140
respect even of our enemies to bow

223
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:51,359
at least bow in our hearts to always be ready

224
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:57,180
this is a tall order but some modicum of this

225
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:02,940
awareness Attunement and then appreciation is

226
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:10,020
really the really this building block for us than to eventually get to compassion

227
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:15,900
so um so why don't you go around the day today I think it would be fantastic if you

228
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:23,099
would explore this this concept of appreciation and or respect

229
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:28,140
for others how often do you have appreciation for the people you pass on

230
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:33,599
the street or in the stores or at work or in neighborhoods is that part of your

231
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:40,859
your social orientation is to appreciate or respect the people who come around

232
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:46,079
you or does that something you have to remind yourself to have appreciation

233
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:51,780
what's it like for you to bring forth can you bring forth an

234
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:59,819
appreciation and respect that's less a doing and more and allowing of some deep

235
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:05,220
almost innate capacity for respect and appreciation

236
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:10,260
when disrespect the non-appreciation

237
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:17,280
have fallen away so if you wish explore that during the day

238
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:23,000
and until we meet again and that may be a foundation for

239
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:32,280
tomorrow where we talk about aspiration as part of an element of compassion

240
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,940
thank you
