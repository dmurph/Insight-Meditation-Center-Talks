1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,480
hello everyone and Welcome to our meditation and um I want to

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:14,400
begin by the usual way of that I teach and because it's so usual that way

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,640
I it can be seen as um you know rudimentary or so basic or

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:27,800
beginners or simplistic but it's actually quite important and has very

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,920
profound possibility and that is to

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:39,360
relax and to be able to recognize the difference between when we

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,760
are tense and when we are relaxed is invaluable for finding our own way with

8
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:54,640
Dharma practice in a way all the way to Liberation because what it keeps us from

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,280
being liberated will in one way or the other

10
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,520
in one way or other we can understand is involving tension clinging grasping

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:16,360
Contracting and so to begin recognizing diff difference between uh tension and release of

12
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:24,520
tension and um penetrates deeply deeply into our hearts our minds our

13
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:30,720
body and um and so uh

14
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,040
so starting off with relaxing is uh very

15
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,640
significant now one of the reasons why relaxing is so important is that

16
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:50,000
tension um um pulls it's like it's almost like it

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,960
pulls something out of the hole it's like if there's a lake and it's all one

18
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:04,159
big nice Lake but then a piece of it begins to freeze up and now it's frozen

19
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,800
rigid and um and it's kind of pulled itself out of

20
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:17,519
the liquid state and might not even recognize or be so attuned to being uh

21
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:23,680
with its partners with the water so as we kind of get tense something about us

22
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,920
our attention or Focus or preoccupation something tends to become small or

23
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:36,840
narrower and we're coming away from the fluid state of being that we can be when

24
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,760
there's no tension no rigidity no tightness and

25
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:48,599
contraction and um so um

26
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:56,200
um so as we get ready to go deeper into samade over these next time period of

27
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:04,319
time this is very important because the zadi is a is a unification of all of who

28
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,319
we are bring all of us together to become like flu a fluid Clear Lake of

29
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:16,319
water that's the metaphor that Buddha gives and

30
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,200
um and uh so to relax and return and

31
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,640
feel how relaxing kind of begins to return us to something that's more whole

32
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,080
it kind of opens us and fills us to more of what's actually

33
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,560
happening so to assume a meditation

34
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,200
posture and maybe thinking of your

35
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:58,159
posture as the wide soft Basin of a lake

36
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:07,360
in which which holds all

37
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:16,239
the changing fluid flowing water of our

38
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:22,199
life and to establish and ground oneself in that

39
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,720
Basin so of feeling your posture

40
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,080
gently closing the

41
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:43,720
eyes and taking a few long slow deep

42
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:49,800
breaths gentle breaths not too big a breath that is tiring or

43
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,000
challenging just enough to be comforting and

44
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,840
pleasant a reminder of the wholeness the fullness

45
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,759
of who you are in your

46
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,479
body and as you exhale long longer than

47
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:21,720
usual let go relax soften the body

48
00:05:52,160 --> 00:06:01,639
and letting your breathing return to normal and breathing in a normal way

49
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:07,680
scan through your body to see where there is tension

50
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:14,000
contraction tightness and see if you can be

51
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:22,639
untroubled by that it's okay and as you breathe in

52
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:29,919
feel the tension and as you exhale

53
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:38,400
invite the attention to relax welcome it to soften back into to

54
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,240
be part of the whole of the

55
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,240
body no longer

56
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:58,400
Frozen welcome back into the into the Lake of the body

57
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,479
and as you relax whenever you have the opportunity to

58
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:19,039
relax don't let relaxing be the a simple task to

59
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:28,800
do relax soften release take your time to feel

60
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:36,639
the goodness of relaxing What flows the pleasure of

61
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:48,440
it feel how it might be how it feels better to relax the

62
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,759
muscles than it is to keep them tense

63
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,479
where the gentle rhythm of breathing in and breathing

64
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:25,599
out is a gentle massage

65
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:38,880
for the Holdings in the body it can be quite subtle maybe in the

66
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:44,680
fingers the

67
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:56,680
wrist the elbows can be a little bit tight held

68
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,600
the

69
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,160
shoulders the

70
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:30,120
belly the area around your diaphragm

71
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,000
center of the chest

72
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,959
and then up into the face sometimes the tension associated

73
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:16,079
with thinking manifests in the area around the eyes the

74
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:19,760
forehead sometimes the

75
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:31,319
jaw sometimes in the throat or the back of the neck

76
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:48,240
sometimes thinking is a sense of pressure

77
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:52,120
contraction deep in the

78
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,639
head be untroubled by this

79
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,120
and also as you

80
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,600
exhale

81
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:21,639
relax maybe letting there be a calming in the

82
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:26,639
Body Sensations connected to

83
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
thinking

84
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,240
for for

85
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,519
and then centering yourself on the on

86
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:49,839
breathing and even in the middle of breathing in the

87
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:59,320
body is there little [Music] room to relax and soften

88
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:08,279
maybe at the end of the exhale so the exhale extends a little

89
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,639
bit baby near the top of the

90
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,680
inhale relaxing that allows the body to

91
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,120
receive the

92
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
inhale

93
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

94
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
for

95
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
for

96
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,959
for e

97
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:56,279
from time to time in a relaxed

98
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:06,000
way notice if there's any tension in your body mind

99
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:18,760
heart and if it's easy enough relax the

100
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,280
tension don't make it a big

101
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:30,360
project and if it's difficult to relax the tension

102
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:39,400
then relax your attitude around it

103
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,840
soften around

104
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:56,480
it and notice the what is Pleasant or good

105
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:05,080
or wholesome in the relaxing the

106
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
softening

107
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

108
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
for

109
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

110
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

111
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
for

112
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
for

113
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,559
e e

114
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:45,880
as you're sitting here meditating where in the field of your

115
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:52,039
attention do you feel an absence of

116
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:58,760
tension an absence of contraction tightness

117
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,559
maybe an absence of

118
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:13,520
clinging breathe into that breathe with

119
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,278
it relax

120
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:30,440
into where there is no clinging there is no tension

121
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
right

122
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
for

123
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,360
for e

124
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:57,000
and as we come to the end of this sitting take a few moments to feel or

125
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,480
sense in whatever way and wherever you might be

126
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:10,039
calmer less tense more

127
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:15,720
relaxed from having done this

128
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:28,440
meditation and sometimes the more calm or relaxed we become

129
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:36,159
the more it highlights where we are still tense and if that's the

130
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:42,399
case don't be troubled by that

131
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:49,200
appreciate how valuable it is to hold our

132
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:56,279
life in the in our attention in awareness

133
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:08,679
maybe a calm awareness relaxed

134
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:21,278
awareness sometimes when there's both tension and relaxation at the same time in our

135
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:29,200
body it can be an inspiring contrast

136
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,880
Inspire what's possible and Inspire what practice needs

137
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,640
to still be

138
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:58,840
done and may it be that our ability to stay relaxed

139
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:07,679
with our tensions decreased that it allows us to be more

140
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,360
present for others in our

141
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:22,519
life people we know people we don't know gives us a chance to take our

142
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:29,600
time to see more deeply listen more carefully

143
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:44,760
and may it be that this practice that we do increases our

144
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:54,159
capacity to be present for others with kindness and Care Good

145
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:59,200
Will may it be that even in a silent way

146
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:06,640
way that we're with others wishing them well a well wishing

147
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:15,600
presence may all beings be happy may all beings be

148
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:25,880
safe may all beings be peaceful may all beings be free

149
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:40,520
[Music]

150
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,679
thank

151
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,039
you

152
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,960
e e

153
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:23,200
so hello and welcome to this uh Wednesday morning talk third Talk of the

154
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:30,000
week and the eighth Talk of the series on samade which will go on for some some

155
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:37,080
time and in laying down the foundations for somebody and effective

156
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:44,519
samadi um what needs to be in place first um I'm emphasizing how

157
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:53,159
we um divide ourselves limit ourselves lose

158
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:58,480
the sense of our wholeness the fullness of all of our capacities

159
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:05,080
sometimes if we really want something um that uh our eyes something we want we

160
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:10,639
might be focusing only on what we can see if uh if we want some particular

161
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:18,039
object we don't see anything else we just kind of focusing on what is that thing that we want and so the full

162
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:25,039
capacity of hearing and smelling and sensing and taking in the wider world is

163
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:30,360
limited by the strength of Desire now of course there's nothing inherently wrong

164
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:36,720
with that from time to time it's helpful and important to do that to have be kind of focused

165
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,159
and but we get stuck that way and people get stuck for a

166
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:48,840
lifetime sometimes uh uh strong desires strong aversion strong

167
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:57,320
fears strong pulling that way closing up closing our hearts um leaving uh

168
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:02,840
avoiding what's really difficult in US difficult unresolved emotions staying in our head

169
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:08,440
and our thoughts staying focused on others rather than ourselves or staying

170
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:14,840
so focused on ourselves that we're not aware for others and this kind of partial attention being selecting a

171
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:20,159
piece of the whole to be caught in or to separate

172
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:26,039
from is uh is what gets in the way of a healthy

173
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:32,840
samade and healthy samadi is to is a state of being that's going to open up

174
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:38,600
to all of we who we are in a sense samadi is what knits together heals it

175
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:47,080
all so it could all be together in some kind of wider wider um whole of

176
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:55,559
attention and um the Buddha uses a lot for uh Sade metaphors symbol having to

177
00:33:55,559 --> 00:34:03,360
do with water and sometimes flowing water sometimes very Still Water

178
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:11,398
sometimes um uh a um a very clear pool of water

179
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:18,720
especially Lakes pools of water and uh something about being in somat uh can

180
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:24,599
feel like different different forms of lakes lakes with a nice current in it

181
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:29,679
lakes that are very still lakes that are very clear and

182
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:35,800
um and uh and what all these legs have in common it there there's no mud

183
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:44,118
there's no um you know uh algae that covers it there is no um It's not

184
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:49,720
nothing is frozen there's no dams that are blocking anything it's just a natur

185
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:57,480
a water a natural Basin just being there and um and so it's possible to go

186
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:05,880
to down to the lake and pull out a bucket of water and walk around and tell people this is the lake this is my Lake

187
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:12,760
I'm having the lake but the bucket of water is just a bucket of water and now we've left the lake behind taking a

188
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:18,000
piece of the hole and so this this movement

189
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,680
towards uh dividing ourselves up being separated from the hole often comes

190
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:30,880
along with tension uh some kind of clinging some kind kind of tightening in our muscles

191
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,640
in our hearts in our minds some kind of closing down some kind of contraction

192
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:43,320
constriction uh sometime of craving and uh and this movement uh of

193
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:49,119
tightening that goes on one way or the other uh is something that we want to

194
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:55,319
become aware of and aware of the unnecessary cost that that comes with it

195
00:35:55,319 --> 00:36:01,760
now temporary tightening doing something that needs to be done um that has to be

196
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,560
taken care of of course is fine it's when we get stuck in it that is the

197
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:13,960
problem and uh and so when we sit down to meditate that's the time where we try to

198
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:19,319
set up situations where it's safe enough simple enough and nothing needs to

199
00:36:19,319 --> 00:36:26,200
happen much that it's okay for the tensions and the tightening that have built to relax and to

200
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:34,200
soften and to and and to learn from that it's profound to become aware of um of

201
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:40,520
tensions because uh one way or the other the um all that keeps us from being

202
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:45,640
fully liberated fully awakened is something which is being held tight

203
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:53,800
something which is contracted something which is tense and something which is closed or blocked off again in the body

204
00:36:53,800 --> 00:37:00,520
in the heart in the mind and the progressive softening of of that relaxing of it sometimes they use the

205
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:06,680
word Letting Go releasing Liberation Liberation is very glorified and

206
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:13,079
powerful and impactful form of relaxing and um so to begin becoming

207
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:19,000
wise about the distinction between relaxing on one hand and tightening on

208
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,200
the other that teaches us so much and we can question is it necessary to stay

209
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:32,040
tight is this situation necessary is there another way of being so I've a little bit going through

210
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:38,079
the five hindrances these first few days and the the fifth hindrance is doubt or

211
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:43,520
uncertainty and we can have doubt about many different things and uh to think

212
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:50,839
that the word this word for doubt here in the hindrance is for any kind of doubt we might have um actually can

213
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:58,800
limit us from the full potential of becoming free so for example if I need gasoline

214
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,200
for my car and I see that up ahead and opposite side of the streets are two gas

215
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:12,000
stations that I've been to both of them before and but I'm uncertain which one do I go to wow look they have both the

216
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,400
same gas price today but one of them has clean bathrooms but the other one has

217
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:24,720
good coffee one of them but one of them has uh very clean keep their machine and

218
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,000
their nozzles really clean so I feel comfortable grabbing it with my hand but

219
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,640
the other one has it kind of dirty but the dirty one uh the clean one I have to

220
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:43,680
make it a little bit dangerous U-turn to go to and the other one I can just pull into quite easily but there's a lot of

221
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:49,400
people and a little line of cars in the one where that's easy to get to but the

222
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:56,079
other one after all this a little bit dangerous to go to so what do I do and so I'm kind of stuck and so I just stand

223
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:02,640
in the intersection light turns green it turns red green again I'm just sitting there my car kind of what do I do I'm

224
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:08,720
uncertain I'm I have doubts I'm filled with doubts that's not that kind of doubt

225
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:15,960
we're talking about in the Dharma in the same situation there's no doubt about where

226
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:23,240
to bring my attention the attention should go in how I've now gotten tense how I've gotten

227
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:29,640
contracted and uh and Frozen in some kind of way and to that is where things

228
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:37,640
are UNH wholesome that's where things life is becoming deadening and to soften that

229
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:43,359
relax maybe it doesn't maybe it's not so important maybe the decision of where to

230
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:49,040
go to gas gasoline maybe what I should do if I'm relaxed and open and and don't

231
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:54,079
allow myself to tense up around this maybe I see when the light turns green

232
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:59,280
that I go and I if I need to kind of wonder what to do let me just pull over

233
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:06,079
uh in a parking spot and uh I have better things to do after all I had a nice meditation this

234
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:13,079
morning and still I'm feeling the the the the the Resonance of that still in

235
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:19,200
my body and now I'm getting tense around this gas station question um I'm better

236
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:26,480
off coming back into the calm of my meditation let me go to the park over there I have a lot of time today let me

237
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:33,560
just sit there for a five 5 minutes let me sit and just forget about the whole dilemma of G gas stations and let me

238
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:40,599
kind of I'm better off staying close to my relaxed State I have no doubt I have no

239
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:46,200
uncertainty that this more relaxed open available state is a healthier place to

240
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:51,520
be I still don't know which gas station to go to but now at least it doesn't

241
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:58,839
matter that much anymore because what matters is that I've returned to some kind of healthy way of being

242
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:04,520
and um so when we're talking about the hindrances of Doubt uh it's not

243
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:11,680
necessarily we can have thoughts about a lot of lot of different things but we have no doubt that it's

244
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:17,960
useful to stay relaxed not get Frozen and caught and what we want to do as we

245
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:24,119
prepare to go into samade we want to prepare we want to get ready by becoming

246
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:30,839
conosur experts on recognizing all the ways in which we

247
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:38,560
unnecessarily get tense unnecessarily tighten and how we can do one of two

248
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:45,920
things either relax the tension in the body heart and mind or if we can't

249
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:53,440
easily relax it open up around it soften around it recognize it's happening where

250
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:59,000
the recognition is very different than being swept into the tension and the

251
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:10,000
concerns and the preoccupation and this beginning to kind of uh open up and relax and soften

252
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,280
around tension and learning to see that distinction between all the variety of

253
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:23,319
tension which is every part of the kind of the suffering we're trying to overcome in Buddhism is always suffer

254
00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:28,440
suffering that has some kind of tension in it some kind of stress in

255
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:34,800
it and uh we want to really be able to see that and do that and as we begin

256
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:42,520
seeing it we'll slowly begin to learn how to open up more widely and maybe not so wide before we

257
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:48,160
start doing some the SM part of this course but then we're prepared to

258
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:54,920
receive the opening to allow the opening into the whole lake of our being that

259
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:02,559
somebody is we're not blocking it we understand the Dynamics we understand where how we're holding ourselves back

260
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:10,359
and we can maybe then allow it to soften and open up so so for the

261
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:16,960
next 24 hours the next week the next month the next

262
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:25,640
lifetime um uh make it the best study you can of

263
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:32,200
your your own experience of tension and relaxation and make it a real study you

264
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:38,000
can Journal about it you can talk go for a walks with friends and talk about the experience and what you're learning uh

265
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:45,400
really kind of try to sensitize yourself by so that this is something you're really focusing on and as I said

266
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:54,960
yesterday you might want to put a timer um on um on uh some kind of you know

267
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:01,319
clock and maybe in some kind of reasonable interval every 30 minutes

268
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:07,760
maybe or something it could be sooner it could be longer uh where you're the an

269
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:13,079
alarm goes off to remind you to check in where are my tents have I what's what

270
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:18,319
tension am I holding here so that really keep it on the Forefront as exercise for

271
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:24,520
the next while uh it'll be invaluable when we eventually get to

272
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:31,000
somebody so thank you very very much and um and as usual I'm very much looking

273
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,280
forward to continue in the morning tomorrow morning
