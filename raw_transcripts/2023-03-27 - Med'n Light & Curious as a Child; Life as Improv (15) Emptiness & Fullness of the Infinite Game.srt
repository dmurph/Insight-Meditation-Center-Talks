00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,440
let us arrive in our bodies

24
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:47,959
let us land and the body

25
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:06,959
feeling the connection of our feet to the Earth

26
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,860
our legs if we're sitting on the cushion our sit bones

27
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:18,980
relax let go of your weight

28
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:26,599
to the Earth feeling supported

29
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:48,120
breathing this breath and the body ideally in the lower body in the abdomen

30
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,699
greeting this breath the sensations of the breath

31
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:08,479
as if spring as if new in each moment

32
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:17,460
and not as if actually they are new and fresh in every moment

33
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:24,500
arriving like they have never arrived before

34
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,900
a sense of possibility openness

35
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,080
open-heartedness

36
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:56,759
and now can we bring an attitude of play an attitude of

37
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:02,120
curiosity of Interest

38
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:16,500
and the Curiosity and interest are not so heavy

39
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,720
or not letting

40
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,880
they don't have gravity but they have a lightness a playfulness to them

41
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,400
about this moment in time the experiences that arise

42
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,780
and pass all the possibilities arising in every moment

43
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:10,579
I'd invite you to try this on for size not in your head but in your body

44
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:16,580
breathing this reflection

45
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,980
feeling it in your body and the reflection is

46
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:34,940
what if this moment of awareness this moment of being alive

47
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,360
this moment of being mindful

48
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:59,000
is not so tight so serious

49
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:07,700
but giving it more space of this character who is you

50
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:13,639
this character in it the play or a game

51
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:29,839
is playing an infinite game an infinite game without winners and losers

52
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,120
it came with curiosity with interest

53
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:46,980
like children the way they play games endlessly curious created

54
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,959
with Wonder and awe

55
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:04,140
what if we receive this moment This Moment's experience

56
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:09,360
the breath Sensations thoughts emotions all of it

57
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:18,800
the whole catastrophe what if we receive it receive all

58
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:32,480
as if we're a child engaging in this Adventure this curiosity this

59
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,959
interesting game

60
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:43,100
learning growing

61
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,360
delighting

62
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:26,300
these are the invitations for the practice can we practice

63
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,140
with this perspective this attitude

64
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:12,779
with childlike curiosity interest be light

65
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:17,720
freshness levity

66
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,540
oh

67
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:30,560
you know this we've all been children or witness them

68
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:39,500
your body knows how to do this receive each moment

69
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:54,260
with this perspective

70
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,680
maybe from this perspective of lightness

71
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,399
judgments

72
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:11,579
distracting thoughts ongoing Etc things that otherwise would

73
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:18,798
feel heavy and tight maybe through this perspective they feel lighter

74
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:27,418
the heart doesn't cling around them so much they feel much

75
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:31,039
lighter they come and go

76
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:43,820
and this lightness of being lightness of being

77
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,840
lightness of being

78
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:42,000
maybe through lightness of being perspective

79
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:46,880
the heart is lighter the mind is lighter

80
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:53,600
the body is lighter there are more possibilities In This Moment

81
00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:00,260
more space more ease more freedom

82
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,899
and we treat moments of life

83
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:36,320
not with lots of shoulds

84
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:51,059
make a grim Duty but imbue it with lightness

85
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:58,799
lightness of being lightness of heart possibilities

86
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:10,880

87
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,520
with the light of a child

88
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,419
rekindling delay

89
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,559
and poly Delight

90
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:21,620
and as we bring this into a close

91
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:29,940
depreciating any sense of

92
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:35,279
Delight a shift in perspective

93
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:41,240
to receive this moment with interest

94
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:48,799
lightness curiosity the slightness of heart

95
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,960
where there are lots of possibilities appreciating

96
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:02,779
if there was just one moment or just a little bit of softening

97
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:09,240
into the freshness of this perspective and trusting that we're planting seeds

98
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:14,179
wholesome seeds individually and together

99
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:20,279

130
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:32,220
no so in many ways I think the theme for it

131
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:37,679
this week has been introduced through this guided

132
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:44,220
meditation and and the way that um all of you have engaged with it they're

133
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:49,980
just so beautiful just to feel the engagement uh in any way that was accessible and

134
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:56,030
possible so so the theme for this week

135
00:34:56,030 --> 00:35:03,260
[Music] um let me introduce it in this way so

136
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:11,579
Delight Delight Bliss gladness happiness

137
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:18,480
so many um gifts so many gifts that the practice

138
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:24,420
gives us but also when we support these beautiful

139
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:32,339
qualities in our life in our practice the practice deepens our life

140
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:38,099
finds other dimensions of beauty service goodness so

141
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:44,220
as the opposite of this Grim Duty I should should you know I have to sit I

142
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:50,160
have to practice I have to become awakened I have to serve all of these

143
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:57,540
are so heavy and in fact they get in the way this this tightness gets in the way

144
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:04,500
whereas when we have curiosity interest all Delight this

145
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:10,520
interest this zest this is zest is childlike zest

146
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:16,560
which we've all had at some point of course we've all had it every child has

147
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:23,339
it we know this we know this curiosity interests lightness

148
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:31,680
zest and and that is the theme of this week

149
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:37,920
this week in ways of bringing this this sense of play the sense of play the

150
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:44,579
sense of freshness the sense of practice and life um as

151
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:52,880
as a Divine play as a divine game that we're engaged with

152
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:59,700
and and this week for for the uh for the teachings for

153
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:05,520
[Music] um what I'm finding inspiration in is

154
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:12,780
actually you know as it said sometimes art imitates life or Artistic Endeavors

155
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:21,440
support life and vice versa is the artistic Endeavor of of improv

156
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:27,000
improv so improv for those of you who may not

157
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,119
familiar with this term it's um some people consider it a comedy

158
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:39,599
performance but it's not so much a performance actually in turn well it is a performance from externally that's how

159
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:46,800
it's viewed but internally there's quite an art of the way of being an improviser

160
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,800
an improviser in the art of improv comedy

161
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,920
which actually tie in so beautifully into practice Thai beautiful into

162
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:04,320
practice and in fact we're all improvisers if if

163
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:11,220
I just said the word improv and you froze up uh improv I can't do improv guess what you've been improvising your

164
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:16,500
whole life we're all improvisers we don't know the

165
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:22,380
next thing that's going to come out of our mouths or the the next thing we're going to do necessarily your

166
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:28,380
interactions or life life is an improvisation life is an

167
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:34,140
improvisation we all of us are improvisers we don't

168
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:40,320
have a script things happen and then we improvise responses we improvise our

169
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:46,500
thoughts our our everything is improvised so can we actually

170
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:52,140
um take the art be be a little more skilled

171
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:58,859
in the art of improvising our lives and improvising in the moments of our

172
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:04,760
practice with more lightness with more interest curiosity so

173
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:13,800
and also for some of you might know I I've uh studied and and performed improv

174
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:19,859
for many years and actually have taught uh workshops on improv and mindfulness

175
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:26,339
and how the two can support each other actually well how improv can support mindfulness really

176
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:32,040
um as as an art as a way of being lighter in in the world and deepening

177
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:38,760
our practice and it can actually be very very deep um insightful it can bring so many deep

178
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:44,940
insights this way of approaching so I'd like to introduce some of these Concepts this week

179
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:50,240
um to support to support our practice and bring some lightness bring some

180
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:56,880
ah Delight some freshness some interest curiosity childlike curiosity so that is

181
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:04,140
the frame for this week so

182
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:11,640
so the perspective so the the whole frame is a frame of

183
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:17,280
of as I mentioned during the guided meditation a frame of what's called an

184
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:27,060
infinite game versus a finite game hmm so a finite game is a game where

185
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:33,180
there are winners and losers and there are rules that are set ahead of time so

186
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:42,140
for example chess backgammon um or any sports they're finite games

187
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:49,020
infinite game dancing is an infinite game one one so

188
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:56,460
in infinite games are games are are are played for the for the Delight of the

189
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:04,200
game itself not there no winners and losers and and the rules keep shifting and changing and

190
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:10,320
and they're made during the game so dancing when it's done for its own sake

191
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:16,560
for the Delight of dancing that's an in it's an infinite game there are no winners and losers

192
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:21,900
improv is an infinite game it's just for the delight and the rules get shifted

193
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:28,380
and changed and in fact the um the ultimate

194
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:34,940
game the ultimate uh infinite game is said to be life

195
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:41,099
there are no winners and losers per se we all are born we all die

196
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:46,260
um and and it's so important to have the sense the freshness of

197
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:54,540
this life or the sake of itself for the sake of its its um

198
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:59,940
the you know it's not a winning that we do but the sense of awe curiosity

199
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:06,240
exploring which actually this brings emptiness and it's it's a marriage of

200
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:12,140
emptiness and fullness because in in the dharmic sense

201
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:19,040
emptiness nothing exists independent of anything else there is

202
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:25,740
inherent emptiness everything to everything that is so so

203
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:30,839
that emptiness brings so many possibilities so it's things are not

204
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:37,160
fixed in a in a particular way and then in that

205
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:42,960
emptiness there is the fullness of possibility because things are not fixed

206
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:50,880
in a particular way so so life as an infinite game life as an

207
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:58,560
infinite game really is an expression of emptiness of acknowledging emptiness of

208
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:05,359
all things and fullness this marriage of emptiness and fullness

209
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:13,260
so just try to set a bit of the frame this

210
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:20,040
week there's a lot more that I'll bring in this week but just something also to

211
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:26,900
leave us with is um I often think and have thought of of

212
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:32,819
improv as kindergarten for adults there's a way of playing through this

213
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:40,859
bringing this sense of curiosity play freshness possibility to each moment of life

214
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:47,040
and similarly what if we saw our lives our lives as this kindergarten we're

215
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:55,079
here we're here to learn we're here to explore we're here to to ex express our

216
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:00,900
fullness in the midst of this The Emptiness and possibilities this

217
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:06,839
freshness as if says spring sunrise

218
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:12,260

219
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:17,940
this bringing more Delight curiosity interest this

220
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:24,480

225
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:56,520
