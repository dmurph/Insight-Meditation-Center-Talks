1
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:05,199
so good morning good

2
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:16,000
day and um Buddhism Buddhist Meditation is often

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,560
associated with relaxation with becoming

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:28,960
calm and maybe for good reason because many people in the modern world uh are

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:36,600
stressed and um I would propose that in the ancient

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:43,960
world in the time of the Buddha that the association with calm and

7
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:50,600
relaxation was less prominent than the association with being

8
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:58,120
courageous that the people who really set out to do uh this Buddhist practice in

9
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,160
a in a dedicated way we're often seen as going against

10
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,759
the stream of against the against the current of popular

11
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:16,720
culture and uh against the expectations of what was family and Society wanted of

12
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:26,520
them and also against the current of their own attachments and clinging and

13
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:36,920
that around and uh uh to go against the current to do

14
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:47,880
what was maybe unpopular to really stand up and uh and not give in to attachments

15
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:56,399
of all kinds to fears of all kinds this took courage and uh and so they way that the

16
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,719
word for effort in practice could be translated as courageous

17
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,759
effort some people and I think when in when it was translated to Tibetan it be

18
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:16,239
became a heroic effort and um and this calls it calls a

19
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,280
lot on us relaxation it's almost like doesn't call much on us it's more like

20
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:29,040
giving up or relaxing or or not needing to do anything in a life where people are so

21
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,239
busy and have to do do do it's a medicine to be able to relax and feel

22
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:42,280
comfortable with oneself at ease with oneself and at home with oneself without having to prove oneself or apologize for

23
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,560
oneself so there's good reason to emphasize this letting go and relaxing

24
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:55,800
and just being but at the most it's half of what uh this practice is about the other half

25
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,280
is to actually act courageously um to act on the path of

26
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,599
Liberation with courage with confidence with conviction with

27
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:14,200
Assurance um to make choices of what to let go of and what to engage

28
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,640
in uh so that we can engage in the path of practice so we can engage in this

29
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:27,319
world uh in a caring way for others and um so the he of of Courage so I'd like

30
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:33,159
to suggest for this sitting that um that we we

31
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:38,640
sit uh and we haven't done I don't think we've really done this uh these years

32
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:45,319
now of doing YouTube so at least for today I'd like to call upon you to sit

33
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:51,720
with uh courage or sit with a strength as if you're sitting upright and you're

34
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:58,680
engaging actively um rather than simply s settling back and letting go and letting

35
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,760
go and uh there's a way of

36
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:10,799
engaging sitting upright or laying down in such a way that there's a a real kind

37
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,959
of Engagement uh strength yes I'm here yes I'm showing

38
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,720
up and um and uh and then with that strength

39
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:30,639
with the metaphor of of standing upright or sitting upright um letting the uh all

40
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,000
kinds of things that are unneeded fall away like raindrops are

41
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,960
said to just wash right off the edges of the lotus blossom the lotus lotus

42
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:49,800
leaves and um and you might end up parts of you as relaxed as other ways but with

43
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:58,560
a certain kind of alertness and Clarity and definitiveness yes here I am clearly purposefully

44
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,120
intently almost as if the mind can then relax deeply maybe even deeper the mind

45
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,440
can maybe become quieter than ever because something inside of your

46
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:20,280
knows that you're showing up and being present courageously for something which is important and that is to be alive now

47
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,720
and now without fear without attachments

48
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,840
without clinging without resistance but really showing up for this

49
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,039
moment so to assume a meditation posture

50
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,120
that for you is the right posture but give some care to the

51
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:48,000
posture so that it's a posture that certainly allows you to be at ease in

52
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,720
your body at ease in your posture but also a posture

53
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:02,880
that gives expression or taps into your

54
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:11,120
capacity for being being here and now in a strong

55
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:18,680
way in a confident way for people sitting in a chair in a

56
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:25,599
cushion maybe sitting up a little straighter or a lot

57
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:34,880
straighter maybe allowing that chest or be a little bit open and

58
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,599
expanded and then lowering your your eyes your

59
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:51,120
gaze or if it's comfortable for you

60
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,280
to close your

61
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
eyes

62
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:13,160
and see in this sitting here quietly with your eyes closed your gaze

63
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:19,000
down see inside of you is there a

64
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,120
place for where confidence

65
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:30,800
resides courage and if it's not

66
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,479
available now where in your body do you associate

67
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:42,000
what part of your body do you associate with being confident strong

68
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,599
and courageous in showing up and really being

69
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:58,879
here and maybe offering some energy intentionality into this place of

70
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,319
strength

71
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:20,440
perhaps a courageous strength a

72
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:28,240
courageous willingness to show up and be here that can be that can

73
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,440
Infuse the Deep inhale with

74
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:42,039
strength and a reassuring confident relaxing as you

75
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
exhale

76
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:36,040
for and letting your breathing return to

77
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:54,120
normal and is there a way of breathing in gently but firmly

78
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:04,160
clearly through the places of holding and

79
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,320
tension you might have that doesn't relax them you're not

80
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:15,959
trying to relax anything but as you breathe in through everything

81
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:23,959
confidently it's almost as if [Music] you're breaking through the

82
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
tension

83
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,759
almost like you're walking

84
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,560
through snow which has a crisp Frozen top and each time you

85
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:58,040
step the the ice breaks and you settle into the soft

86
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
snow

87
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:11,279
with every inhale the inhale begins and

88
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,519
arises and expresses confidence

89
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:24,199
courage with the inhale where you can face anything be with

90
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:30,959
anything as if the inhale and

91
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:37,600
moves through breaks through

92
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:45,600
whatever tension there might be resistance there might

93
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:57,760
be and the exhale is landing back into the softness

94
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
Within

95
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880

e

99
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:36,199
e if you find yourself thinking a lot or

100
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:43,279
preoccupied rather than letting go of that become

101
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:51,120
bigger than that stand up metaphorically stand up

102

courageous let your awareness Ness and your dedication be more

104
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,880
powerful than the

105

distractions show up in a strong way here I am to be

106
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,519

situation courageously present with a calm Quiet

126

Mind

127

and as we come to the end of this

133
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:58,919
sitting do once again touch into where inside of you

134
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:05,960
is a place of confidence and courage maybe not present now but where

135
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,880
would it be present when that's true for

136
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:16,760
you and maybe settle into that place open

137
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:23,039
yourself to that place appreciate whatever capacity

138
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:28,200
however small you have of courage

139
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:34,919
courageous effort and imagine

140
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:41,960
yourself standing maybe on a small

141
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:47,360
Hilltop overlooking a vast multitude of

142
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:54,200
people and standing there confidently

143

War may all people be

violence may all people be

150
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:51,360
peaceful untroubled with animosity

151
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:58,320
hostility the hatred is of other people

152
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:04,360
and may all people be

153
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,000
free free of

154
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:19,559
Oppression free of discrimination and free of hostility

155
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,520

158
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:56,519
care for the world be stronger than our

00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:04,120
fear our hate our delusion our greed and

160
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:10,399
conceit let this practice

161
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:16,398
awaken a confident courageous way of being in this

162
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
world

163
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:38,720
[Music]

164
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,480
thank

165
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,399
you

166
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:13,559
so we come to the fifth talk on

167
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:21,279
nonviolence and I think most of you clearly know that this is a maybe

168
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:26,840
understated way of responding to the TR horrible horrific

169
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:34,480
violence that's happening in the Middle East and um but also in my heart the

170
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:43,080
horrific violence in Ukraine and Syria Sudan Burma all over the

171
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:53,399
world and um and then this last meditation I led

172
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:58,760
it might not have been maybe the most popular meditation that I've got of meditation I've

173
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:04,360
given if maybe because many people associate Buddhist Meditation with

174
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:10,440
acceptance with relaxation with allowing with just settling back and being no one

175
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:17,080
going nowhere nothing to do and um i' would like to propose that

176
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:24,559
that's only half the picture and in fact to make that the full picture of what Buddhist practice is is to uh short

177
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:31,440
Change oneself is to to uh uh not really step

178
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:38,840
up to really live in this world in a completely free way the Buddha did not

179
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:47,039
avoid the world after he was enlightened he engaged in the world uh he intentionally went into

180
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:52,240
places where people were back to his home one of the first things he did was go back to his

181
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:59,960
hometown and uh visit his people and and and uh and so half of the

182
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:06,159
practice may be considered relaxation the other half of practice is to awaken

183
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:11,519
awaken a an energy a capacity to act and

184
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:16,799
to uh to not be in held in check by

185
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:24,240
fear uh not be held in check with resistance not being held in check by

186
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:32,399
diminishing ourselves or making ourselves some artificial little there's a way of letting go of

187
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:38,159
self-conceit letting go of fear that allows us to show up more

188
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:44,039
fully uh in fact when to practice mindfulness to really be present in such

189
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:51,080
a way that we're no longer limited by our fear um there's nothing that limits us

190
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:56,320
from acting wisely well compassionately

191
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:03,559
in this world and uh and Buddhist practice is about

192
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:10,279
going forth is about connecting is about living for the welfare and happiness of

193
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:15,840
everyone I quoted it earlier in the week but one of the very important quotes for

194
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:23,159
me in the Buddhist discourses it the one that says that a wise person does not

195
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:28,799
intend harm to self to other to self and

196
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:37,760
and others and to the whole world rather a wise person intends welfare for self

197
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:43,320
intends welfare for others intends welfare for self and others intends

198
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:50,679
welfare for the whole world and it's not just intending but it's also showing up

199
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:57,039
and um so uh I would like to give a couple of quotes and then make a what

200
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:02,440
for me is a very important uh

201
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:09,398
statement so this idea of showing up courageously uh the Buddha uses

202
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:15,398
metaphors that it's not so popular to use in the modern Western Buddhist

203
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:22,118
circles um there's a very strong ethos against anything that is

204
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:28,079
excessively um assertive or masculine or Macho or Warrior

205
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:33,720
like um and so there's been a strong movement of backing down from these

206
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:40,358
kinds of metaphors at the Buddha uses a lot Warrior kind of metaphors and um I've been avoiding them

207
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:47,520
mostly because if I use them people would be critical and uh surprised when uh women

208
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:55,720
teachers are allowed to use it and in hearing it was really inspiring to come from women but here is one that

209
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:01,920
uh um um compared to a person who conquers a

210
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:09,240
thousand times a thousand people is the person who conquers

211
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,440
oneself the person who conquers oneself is supreme in

212
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:21,920
battle so the greatest battle we fight is the one with ourselves we fight all

213
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:27,800
the ways that we limit ourselves hold oursel in check get attached live in fear

214
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:33,200
that is the battle that's where we show up and that's what we have courage to do

215
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:39,359
in this practice and certainly relaxing takes courage to really relax

216
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:44,960
deeply uh to settle back and allow our experience to go through us it takes

217
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:52,040
courage but these two uh elements letting go and courageous acern they go

218
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:57,680
hand in hand one done sometime some situations one predom dominates other

219
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:05,599
the others but it's not all about letting go it's also about action and courageous action and this battle with

220
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:11,599
oneself um that doesn't mean that we're hostile towards ourselves or aggressive

221
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:18,160
to ourselves or hating ourselves it means that we actually love ourselves because we want to stop the ways in

222
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:24,680
which we limit ourselves and then the person who day

223
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:29,960
and night Delights in harmony lessness and has loving kindness towards all

224
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:36,800
beings is the one who has no hate for anyone so here we get again the Buddha's

225
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:43,960
idea of harmlessness but here Delights in living a harmless life comes with loving kindness free of

226
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:49,520
hatred towards hostility towards anyone these are some of the key and most important teachings the Buddha

227
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:55,560
gives and uh over and over again we see this emphasis on living a harmless life

228
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:01,760
but living with meta with loving kindness with no hate for anyone but

229
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:08,319
this does not mean that we're passive and

230
00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:13,359
um there's uh that Buddha's example of his life is not one of a passive passive

231
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:20,119
person he was engaged with people and the situations of his time but here's a

232
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:25,599
small um quote that I kind of like that

233
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:31,040
um it is possible Ananda the Buddha speaking to his main

234
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:37,520
attendant it is possible that you can look on with

235
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:44,359
indifference at an elder monastic a senior monastic

236
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:51,680
being being offended truly

237
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:57,599
Ananda care does not grow from being still

238
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:04,359
unreactive when a senior monastic is being offended so if there's if someone's

239
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:12,440
being offended uh stand up get involved don't just do nothing is

240
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:19,800
the teaching here and um and the Buddha even said to his monastics even if your teacher does

241
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:25,640
something which is an ethical uh speak up talk to the person

242
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:32,920
speak up don't let them get away with it and

243
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:43,160
um and then um so the reason I want to emphasize today

244
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:49,359
action and end this week with us stepping up and doing

245
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:55,200
something is that the more we're troubled more we're

246
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:03,040
distressed but by events in the world the more important it is for us to

247
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:09,200
act to do something to live differently and to Simply sit back and

248
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:15,319
be angry and upset and Afraid and expect someone else to do everything to have

249
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:20,760
opinions about what should have happened and who's wrong is not helpful for this

250
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:27,000
world the world needs people who step up who courageously act in the world

251
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,839
and there's many ways of doing this and uh and and uh each person has

252
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:39,720
to find what's appropriate for them their life their situation and what the doors that are opening for them for what

253
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:48,000
they can do if uh you know I if I think if if the San Andrea's fault U uh

254
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,640
ruptures here in the peninsula where I live and there's a massive earthquake like there was in San Francisco in 1906

255
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:01,680
you know their fault is only a mile or two away um I bet we would see

256
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:07,200
heroic efforts by the survivors uh tireless efforts to really

257
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:14,400
help and step forward and help and do something uh that people are not going to say well I'm going to go meditate now

258
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:21,880
we step up and do otherwise we're actually harming ourselves so in my

259
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:27,280
situation uh the um when 9/11 happened

260
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,440
I had this strong understanding that I had to do something different the first

261
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:40,160
thing I did different was that small thing was that two weeks later I was supposed to give a dayong workshop on

262
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:48,880
the Buddhist teachings of unmindfulness and I decided I can't do that uh not right after 911 so I changed

263
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:56,839
the workshop to be a workshop on the Buddhist teachings on peace and uh but that was a small thing

264
00:40:56,839 --> 00:41:03,760
it wasn't enough and the last thing I was I wanted to do was to go back to business as usual and that happens over

265
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:11,680
and over again in ways we so many times in our life we read something horrible thing in the in the news uh and then

266
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:18,480
we're changed for a while but then things go back to usual the the murdering of George Floyd

267
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:25,520
was horrendous and had a big impact on so many people and highlighted the racism in the United States in a way

268
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,560
that had really been highlighted before I believe and many people were alarmed

269
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:36,640
and there was movements to change but now some years later how much has changed how many people have stopped

270
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:42,040
their focus on this issue and concern and so many things kind of

271
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:47,280
passed much more quickly but with 911 I said I have we I have to be changed by

272
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,720
this if I'm not changed by this I haven't really taken it in and so uh and

273
00:41:52,720 --> 00:42:01,280
also one of the institutions I'm involved with the Sati Center which was a is a Buddhist study center so we have

274
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:07,880
to I said we have to do more than just study the sutas study of the Buddhist teachings we have to do something for

275
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:15,280
our society so uh from that we decided to do the Buddhist chaplaincy program and now

276
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:21,720
for 20 over 20 years now we've been teaching a yearlong introduction to Buddhist chaplaincy that's trained now

277
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:29,359
many many people in the skills and the orientation to Buddhist chaping has opened doors for people into this very

278
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:34,720
significant way of offering spiritual care people have become um hospital

279
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:42,720
chaplains prison chaplains um people have been involved in uh politics and in in in chaplaincy

280
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:48,359
kind of ways and all kinds of places people have stepped up and offered care

281
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:53,559
and um and that his chaplaincy program has started because of 911 has now

282
00:42:53,559 --> 00:43:00,200
spawned two other similar programs uh in chaplaincy and um so you know a big part

283
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:05,960
of my life the last 20 years has been oriented around what impact how it was

284
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:12,520
changed by 9/11 with the with the situation now for a couple of years in Ukraine which is

285
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:17,960
huge the amount of violence we're seeing and what's happening now in

286
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:24,880
Gaza uh and Israel it's huge and you know it's impacted many of us for many

287
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:30,720
decades the endless cycles of violence there but there's something different qualitatively different now more

288
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:36,079
powerful what's happening now they have so many children being killed teens

289
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:41,440
being shot down um innocent people being

290
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:49,960
you know murdered and uh and people kind of living uh a life that's worse than I I

291
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:56,839
go often to St Quinton is the state prison here in California and the pictures and the reports I get of people

292
00:43:56,839 --> 00:44:02,480
how they live in Gaza sounds like it's worse than what it's like in prison here in United

293
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:08,119
States and now it's a lot of opinions a lot of ideas about all kinds of things

294
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:15,200
but free of opinions are we willing to be changed by

295
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:22,359
by this and so what I would like to suggest is the more deeply we are

296
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:27,680
impacted that we do ourselves harm if we don't allow ourselves to change and do

297
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,880
something different and it might not be that we do something for the people in

298
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:39,720
Gaza and Israel how much can we do there from our distance but maybe we do we we now

299
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:47,319
motivated to do something else better uh many times when I read in the newspaper horrific things that impact me

300
00:44:47,319 --> 00:44:54,040
it motivates me to be a better Buddhist teacher to give myself more to this teaching and this work because I believe

301
00:44:54,040 --> 00:45:00,200
this work is peacemaking this this work is helping so many people become free of

302
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:07,079
suffering but sometimes that's doesn't feel like enough so now with for me I've been impacted a lot by these last couple

303
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:14,480
of weeks uh with Israel and Gaza and uh the question is at my age at my point in

304
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:20,839
my life what do I do what how do I do things that are different and um so I

305
00:45:20,839 --> 00:45:27,839
don't know yet what's possible what I can do and what doors will open up that are appropriate to step through true but

306
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:32,920
um you know like I created the chaplaincy program many years ago I've

307
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:38,720
wondered about training in Sati Center this study group Center we have um may

308
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:45,680
be creating a program or facilitating a program in um nonviolence not training

309
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:51,480
in non-violence and the strategies of it and the wisdom of it the uh the

310
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:56,720
philosophy of it the the um and the inner work that that has to happen in

311
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:02,559
order to be able to be a nonviolent warrior in a sense for

312
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:10,839
peace or I may also have been interested in for many years of Buddhist peace studies a little bit

313
00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:17,040
more kind uh social justice and politics and having to do with

314
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:24,800
peace but you know it's uh I've devoted my life to other things these years and as a Buddhist teacher and my my time is

315
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:30,359
limited and what can I create at this point in my life so I'm wondering so I'm

316

enough just to sit in back and have opinions so um so I offer that to you as something

318
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:51,440
for you to think about that the more deeply you've been impacted

319
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:58,119
by tragedies of this world that we live in and your own personal ones or the ones

320
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:04,119
around you or near you or the ones in other places in the world that um maybe

321
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:09,920
you'll do yourself a disservice if you just kind of Hope just to relax chill

322

323
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:24,720
tremendous service of evoking a degree of courage and strength that yes uh you

324
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:32,520
will step forward and be different and act differently and contribute to this world in a different way and to do it in

325

the opposite that you step forward into the world to meet the suffering of the world in such a way that you are a
