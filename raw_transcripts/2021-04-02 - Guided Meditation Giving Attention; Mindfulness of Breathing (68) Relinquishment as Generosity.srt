1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,520
so uh warm greetings to everyone and uh

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:14,920
feels feels wonderful that we're gathering here for our meditation

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,240
together and just saw a message from

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,600
i think one of our members is having heart surgery today and uh jay so we wish jay well

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:45,840
and hope that that all goes well and um

6
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,839
so uh we sit here

7
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,039
holding all of ourselves everyone in our hearts including those going to surgery and having challenges

8
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,439
today of all kinds and

9
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,760
perhaps it's a

10
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,119
this final step of mindfulness of breathing

11
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,159
is very closely associated with generosity and i'll talk more about it during the

12
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,240
talk but the

13
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:37,680
when we remove an obstruction for someone like say we open a door someone who

14
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,280
can't do it themselves and remove that obstruction just that opening a door

15
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,320
is an act of generosity if someone has a

16
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,000
splinter in their foot and they can't get it out themselves it's an act of generosity to

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,960
get some tweezers and and remove the splinter and so

18
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,600
the removal the letting go the stepping away from

19
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:15,599
those movements of the mind which don't serve us can be seen as an act of generosity

20
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:22,640
not as a indication that aversion or pushing things away or

21
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:30,080
or or some negative thing about anything in a sense

22
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:37,680
but rather it's just such a healthy thing to remove the splinters of our life

23
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,560
to move the ways that we um you know harm ourselves and we have a

24
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,319
clearer sense of that harm even the subtlest forms the more

25
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,800
settled and peaceful we become in meditation the more meditation feels

26
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:06,560
a place of freedom and love and peace integrity wholeness

27
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:13,360
the more quiet and still the thinking mind becomes

28
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:23,760
the more um we recognize movements of generosity

29
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:31,280
we move we recognize the splinters that we can take out and letting go of thoughts doesn't so much

30
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:38,080
come from aversion but comes from of course let me help out here let me let go of

31
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,239
these thoughts these ideas when we get contracted or caught in

32
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,519
desires and aversions of course here it's a generous thing to

33
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:56,879
do it's not doesn't have to be done with the obligation to let go it doesn't have to be done with

34
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,640
hostility towards what we're letting go of any more than opening the door

35
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,319
are we hostile to the door or pulling out a splinter we're hostile to the splinter

36
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:15,200
rather it's an act of generosity so to sit today

37
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,280
maybe with a spirit of generosity

38
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:27,680
and so to begin with a posture posture itself the care we put into our

39
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,440
posture maybe rocking around swaying a little bit making small adjustments

40
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,960
can be seen as the beginning of meditative

41
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,320
generosity as we give attention

42
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:57,840
to our body to ourselves

43
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,479
and we might take a few long slow deep

44
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,919
breaths and as we settle in maybe

45
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:20,800
even it's a giving in a generosity of

46
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,960
letting go of tension and letting ourselves

47
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:39,840
give ourselves the goodness of being stable and settled here

48
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:53,280
and with a feeling of generosity of care of goodwill towards oneself

49
00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:01,520
tenderly maybe as you exhale relax the body

50
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,840
perhaps softening in the belly

51
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:19,840
perhaps softening and relaxing the belly with a reminder to the belly

52
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:35,840
it's okay

53
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:44,000
as you exhale relaxing in the heart a generous feeling even if the heart

54
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,319
aches or is challenged in some way to hold it

55
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:58,160
with a generosity good will compassion and allowing the chest and

56
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,840
the heart to settle and relax

57
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,039
relaxing the shoulders maybe even moving the hands a little bit

58
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:30,960
if it frees up the shoulders and the elbows a little bit

59
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,440
and as an act of generosity to your face which has muscles which are in working

60
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:44,080
for us all day long one way or the other those

61
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:52,080
muscle little muscles are expressing themselves and generously

62
00:07:52,080 --> 00:08:00,160
give those muscles a chance to rest thank you for your service and now

63
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:12,080
you can rest relaxing the face

64
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,599
then offering your attention to the

65
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
breathing

66
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:43,919
as if attention is a gift a precious gift that's worth giving

67
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,399
giving over to the breathing

68
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,120
as if the body breathing

69
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:09,839
loves the gift of attention

70
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,600
and if you notice you notice yourself thinking caught up caught up in thought lost in

71
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,880
thought see it as an occasion to be

72
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:31,839
generous to give up your thinking

73
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:40,399
to let it go so that you can return to

74
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:46,240
a way of being that's more intimate more connected here and now

75
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,480
a way of being present it is more satisfying than being lost

76
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,519
caught up in thoughts

77
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:05,839
generously returning yourself to yourself

78
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,399
in the letting go of thoughts opening the doors of the heart and the mind

79
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,680
pulling out the splinters in the heart

80
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:34,800
so as we sit here today if it can help you become quieter and

81
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,839
more focused more present

82
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:50,240
you might practice giving away your thoughts giving up

83
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,720
letting go releasing

84
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:06,560
relinquishing all as movements of generosity

85
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:18,959
generosity perhaps associated with a deep quiet place

86
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:29,839
inside of you

87
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,000
let go of your thinking generously

88
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,400
in that in letting go of them you can [Music] return

89
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:59,679
to some intimacy and peace some sense of stillness here

90
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:06,158
that's better than being lost in thought

91
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:19,840
giving yourself the gift of that better

92
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,840
so

93
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,840
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

94
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:16,480
if it is in fact a form of generosity to

95
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:25,360
give yourself the chance to settle in come to a place here in meditation that

96
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:35,840
clearly feels like it's for your own welfare and well-being

97
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,799
then i also might consider that this generosity towards yourself

98
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:49,440
can simultaneously be a generosity for the world

99
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:57,279
that somehow settling in in such a way the best qualities of who you are

100
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:03,840
come to the forefront or are not eclipsed

101
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,919
then the world can also benefit from these good qualities of yours

102
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:22,720
beginning perhaps with generosity being generous to the world around you

103
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:30,640
not necessarily generous with things but generous with your attention your

104
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:37,039
heart generously letting go of the

105
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:45,840
obstructions inside of you from having a clean presence with others

106
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:59,840
to offer them the best of who you are

107
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:08,880
and if we offer the best of who we are then we benefit others while we benefit

108
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:15,840
ourselves we are benefiting ourselves where we benefit others

109
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:23,440
when we give the best that we have coming from in a good way

110
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:29,200
then we benefit as well we better benefit further

111
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:35,039
at the end of a meditation session or a buddhist event there's dedication of

112
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:42,640
merit and it's understood that if you give away your merit

113
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,360
you produce much more merit for yourself

114
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:56,880
if you can in a clean appropriate way offer

115
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:04,000
the best of yourself to others the best in you can grow

116
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:14,240
may it be that any of the benefits that we receive through this meditation today that we

117
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:22,320
remove the obstructions from letting that be shared with the world around us

118
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,639
may all beings be happy

119
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:37,200
may all beings be safe may all beings

120
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,799
be peaceful and may all beings everywhere

121
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:51,840
be free

122
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:19,840
so we come in this series of talks to the

123
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:26,399
consider the final step of anapanasati the 16th step of mindfulness of

124
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:32,000
breathing and the way it's worded in

125
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:40,320
english the most common translation into english is something like

126
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:52,080
observing relinquishment one trains

127
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:58,559
i will breathe in observing relinquishment

128
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:06,240
one trains i will breathe out and this word relinquishment

129
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:15,840
that translates a pali word patini saga

130
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:23,200
b-a-t-i-n-i-s-s-a-g-g-a that has a double meaning

131
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:32,559
it means a kind of letting go relinquishment and it also means generosity to give

132
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:38,320
and in some contexts in the teachings of the buddha it clearly means

133
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:44,480
being generous and not just that's so nice this passage i'll read it to you

134
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,720
and

135
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:01,679
so a noble disciple someone who has come now towards the to

136
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,518
the end of this 16 steps

137
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:15,200
noble disciples recollect consider their own generosity like this

138
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:22,640
it is truly my good fortune and gain that in a world

139
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:30,640
of people obsessed with greed i dwell freely generous

140
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:38,080
open handed delighting in giving devoted to

141
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,600
charity delighting in giving and sharing

142
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:50,320
and the expression delighting in giving the word giving is the same word as this

143
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:55,760
final step in anapanasati of relinquishment

144
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:02,080
so there is a letting go a deep letting go that's

145
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:07,200
almost an act of choice if

146
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,240
now if you review these last four steps of anapanasati

147
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:19,520
is that as we settle in having gotten concentrated and quiet and still

148
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:25,679
then we come to a stage where it just feels the best just to not be

149
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:30,720
working meditation anymore we don't have to work and we just settle

150
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:36,878
back and just observe we're observing we're kind of like in the process of life the flow of life and we're just

151
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:44,000
observing the transiency and the changing nature of moment-to-moment experience

152
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:51,040
and now there's a fading away of clinging and greed and wanting and that fading away happens up

153
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:57,359
to the point where the greed and the hatred that we have

154
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:03,119
seizes and stops and wow to have a qualitatively hike experience

155
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:11,359
of the stopping of these unhealthy movements of the mind and heart and wow this is good this is

156
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:18,800
right this is health this is freedom and inner psychological freedom

157
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:25,920
and and then knowing that seeing that having wisdom about that then

158
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,680
saying i'm i would like to be done with this i no longer want to invest in these

159
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:37,119
kinds of ways of being i don't no longer believe in them i no longer stand behind

160
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:45,119
being greedy or hateful or resentful or complaining or jealous or

161
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,640
or you know having any kind of annoyance or hostility that i'm keep getting

162
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:58,160
living in cynicism and um and uh and not we don't do it

163
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:04,960
punitively it's not like we feel bad about ourselves but now we know something much better

164
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:12,560
and so we're letting go of what is unwholesome and and if you look carefully read

165
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:20,160
carefully the teachings of the buddha he when he talks about what we let go of

166
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:26,480
he doesn't talk about letting go of things so much hardly at all or if at all like we don't

167
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,920
let go of our material wealth or let go of our friendships our

168
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:41,119
relationships what we're letting go of what we're relinquishing our inner psychological states

169
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:47,839
things inside of us and they're clearly the ones that harm us what the buddha calls

170
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:54,480
unwholesome or unskillful and he says that explicitly in one place

171
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,119
he says

172
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:08,720
if one if when one gives away something

173
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:15,599
unwholesome mental qualities grow and wholesome mental qualities waste away

174
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:21,680
then i say one should not give away in this way and the word giving away here is that

175
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:28,160
word relinquishment so so the word give

176
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:34,160
captures the idea that it's an act of generosity and so i'll read it a different way if

177
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:42,320
one relinquishes anything and then unwholesome mental qualities

178
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:49,200
grow and wholesome mental qualities waste away then i say

179
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:56,560
one should not relinquish in this way but if one gives away if one

180
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:02,000
relinquishes something and unwholesome mental qualities

181
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:09,280
waste away and wholesome mental qualities grow then i say one should give away one

182
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:15,119
should relinquish in this way so this is not blind

183
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:20,320
relinquishment it's not the blind letting go of something just but we hear they're supposed to let go let

184
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:26,960
go of everything it's really we're letting go of that which

185
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,160
interferes with our betterment interferes with the best qualities we have

186
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:39,200
we're letting go so that the better qualities of who we are can come forth and we have a much

187
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,960
clearer sense of what those are and what gets in the way what are the obstructions

188
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:52,560
when we get quiet and peaceful now one of the one most wonderful meditation instructions that i received

189
00:38:52,560 --> 00:39:00,160
many years ago from this wonderful english bhikkhu monk named ajan amaro

190
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:07,440
and he said something like set yourself at ease and then notice

191
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:13,839
what takes you away from that and that was the instruction no 16

192
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:19,760
stages that's so complicated so just recognize to set yourself at ease and i think i

193
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:26,720
understood that to be whatever modicum of ease that's accessible just if it's the simplest

194
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:33,760
kind of just softening and relaxing but then the important part the wisdom part is to notice what takes you away

195
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:42,320
from that and then consider is it really worth it is it really for your betterment to lose

196
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:49,599
whatever the ease you have it's through that then through then deepening the ease appreciating the ease

197
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:58,320
deepening that ease deepening these coming to more ease and more ease we get better and better recognition

198
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:05,520
of the goodness that's here within us to be better recognition of when there's an unwholesome direction

199
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:11,599
and when there's a wholesome direction that we're going when it's uh for our betterment or for

200
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:18,480
the opposite and so we come to hear the lasting last stage of anapanasati

201
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,520
um there is a real real deep relinquishment now

202
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:30,160
where something we're really ready to put something down

203
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,000
and and be done with something enough of this already

204
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,119
and even though we can't necessarily stop certain mental habits that we have or

205
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:46,319
tendencies we have it's a powerful movement to have made an inner choice

206
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:52,880
inner turning and say i no longer stand behind this i don't longer believe in this kind of

207
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:58,000
behavior and we can do that without any aversion

208
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,720
hostility feeling better about ourselves we can do it with joy

209
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:11,200
delighting in this word relinquishment delighting in it that now i'm going to move in a good

210
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:18,160
direction just i know there's a better direction and to know that deeply is one of the

211
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,640
great gifts of this practice great gifts of life and uh and to be

212
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:31,119
inspiring so rather than seeing our four inner foibles and inner you know old habits coming back

213
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:36,560
and feeling depressed or upset by it there can be a stance a recognition

214
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:43,200
oh here it is again and now i get to practice this is what this practice i know what

215
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:48,960
practice is about now the practice i know there's a direction amount of direction

216
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:57,040
on a movement and a journey to really i know what freedom is i know what this is not where it's at and now i

217
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:03,920
have an opportunity to practice with this and that is a fortunate thing anyone who

218
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,760
has the practice has good fortune anyone who has a

219
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:15,520
practice is involved in a path of great goodness and benefit

220
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:22,720
and so to celebrate and delight in the fact you ever practice more than being upset by the fact that

221
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:29,680
one more time you got angry or irritated or greedy or something just keep

222
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:35,040
turning it over to appreciating it and looking for the generosity and the

223
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:41,040
goodness and the delight in the possibility of on being on a path

224
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,839
of liberation or freedom of letting go

225
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:53,520
and so no matter where you are on the stages of anapanasati these 16 stages

226
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:59,200
each step in the way is good for itself is good enough in fact the ancient

227
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:05,760
commentaries said that each step of the 16 can be a complete step in itself they

228
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:14,560
they contain within each step contains within itself the path to all 16 or so if you stayed

229
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:21,920
at the first step of just breathing in long knowing you're breathing in long the other 15 steps kind of will follow

230
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:28,319
along as you really settle in and just do that one get concentrated doing that

231
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:33,680
but it doesn't matter just the fact that you're whatever your stage you're at that's the right place for you that's a

232
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:39,839
good place and that's where your delight and pleasure and joy can be

233
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:45,520
that uh you're so fortunate you have a path you this is your step now this is your

234
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:50,640
movement your ability to practice

235
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:57,119
and the further you go the more you'll understand what's wholesome the more you understand what's wholesome

236
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:05,359
the more with generosity the lighting and generosity you can give away give up

237
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:12,720
the unwholesome and i use these words like the give up in the kind of original apparently

238
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,839
meaning of the word which is to offer something up on an altar or the

239
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:23,200
original meaning of sacrifice to make sacred or

240
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:28,560
the original word of surrender then the latin i think maybe in the french as well the

241
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:34,960
roots of the word is to also to to give something

242
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:42,480
give up so um so that's his uh we've come now to the

243
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:48,480
end of these 16 steps and this the discourse on anapanasati has

244
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:53,839
further things to say about this and what is most interesting for me about the next

245
00:44:53,839 --> 00:45:02,800
kind of instructions of this uh six after the 16 steps is how um the fruit of the practice the

246
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:10,800
liberation of the practice becomes more and more the the basis for the practice and how

247
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:18,880
liberation becomes a basis for practice is the topic for next week so um

248
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:27,119
so thank you for all this and um i can take a little bit of time

249
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:33,520
for taking some questions if you'd like and anything really but if you'd like to ask

250
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:38,960
me 16 steps or anything about this i will try to do my best to track the

251
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,078
questions if they come

252
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:47,839
and

253
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:01,359
any additional advice on how anapanasathi can be

254
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:10,319
practiced in a relaxed open way without turning it into a linear checklist i'm i'm turning this as i sit

255
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:17,440
great yeah i think that every meditation practice we do all these funny habits of

256
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:23,520
the mind will come in and kind of take over and sometimes the practice starts becoming mechanical

257
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:30,400
sometimes maybe a linear checklist where am i and don't be discouraged by this but

258
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:36,160
learn to recognize it and then figure out a way to not do it

259
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:41,440
and um and sometimes i've done some similar things like and i've just kind

260
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:48,800
of backed off and i just gone back to the very beginning or um just just come back and just not try to

261
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:54,720
do the practice of an apanasati and just open my awareness and

262
00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:01,040
then my kind of my my my one of my kind of

263
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:06,480
great default for practicing when you know it seems like nothing's

264
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:12,160
really working is uh to tell myself the word here h-e-r-e

265
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:19,040
and just say here and it's uh not a command like to a dog it's just the recognition i'm here and i

266
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:24,160
say the word and then i open my attention to just recognize what is here

267
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:30,319
and sometimes what i recognize is my mind is out of control and spinning around oh here this is what it

268
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:35,359
feels like to have a spinning mind here this is what it's like to be upset

269
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:40,400
here this is what's like to be agitated and it's a gen there's a

270
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,599
generosity in that here in that in that opening oh this is what it's like

271
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:51,280
nothing has to be any different it's just a clear recognition of this and i'll do

272
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:57,599
that for a while and then at some point things settle down or if i got a mechanical or a checklist

273
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:07,838
approach to practice then i can kind of i've stopped doing it and then i can start fresh again

274
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:21,839
okay

275
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:44,318
it's a lot of thank yous i appreciate them it's very nice and

276
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:53,119
is it to be expected that grief would come with disenchantment ah no it's not to be expected

277
00:48:53,119 --> 00:49:00,720
but it's pretty common and so i think we should just that sometimes when we do this practice

278
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:08,800
we realize that even when we let go of things we know are unhealthy there can be a grief to for the going

279
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:14,960
away of something that's been our companion for a long time or or there's a grief around what we lost

280
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:21,280
because we were caught up so long in some unhealthy way of being and we have to grieve first before we can really

281
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,960
move on there was a psychologist who did a lot of this practice

282
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:32,000
and his his take on all this is that um

283
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,480
the path to liberation is one continuous process of grieving so it might have been true for him it

284
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:44,400
hasn't been true for me and but but grief is definitely can be an important part of this whole process

285
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:50,559
and it's not to be um pushed away or feel like it's

286
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:58,640
unfortunate to have grieving and i did give a talk last sunday on grief sunday morning talk here so

287
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:05,359
i talked about liberating grief that might intrigue you if you didn't hear the talk to hear it

288
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:14,640
the folds and the unfolding yeah

289
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:23,599
what is the source of the excerpt you read about generosity today it's um

290
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:31,280
it's a it's a my own translation so it's all i have

291
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:41,839
here is the reference it's from the numerical discourses of the buddha chapter six um suta number 25.

292
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:06,400
it's very nice to read all these little comments and thank yous and and

293
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:23,838
it's really a wonderful thing to share this path and this practice together with all of us here

294
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:42,079
grief arises in unexpected times yeah for sure

295
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:48,000
i think some some i've heard teachers say that if you don't if you haven't had a good

296
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,520
cry you're probably not really on the path to liberation

297
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,680
at some point or other it does not all the time but

298
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:07,920
can you please clarify again the relationship between 16 steps of our practice off the cushion as well as while meditating yeah well

299
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:13,920
that's a good question i generally don't think about too much

300
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:19,200
about the 16 steps in daily life i do i spend a lot of time

301
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:24,880
because i spent you know much of my adult life meditating on my breathing and and it's kind of

302
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:32,720
been the kind of the foundation of my meditation practice that um it uh it spills over into daily

303
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:38,480
life where i'm frequently kind of attentive to my breathing or

304
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:45,520
include my breathing whatever i'm doing and awareness of it and and so it's been a great gift in my

305
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:51,440
daily life to track and watch my breathing when my breathing gets held or tight or

306
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:56,480
constricted and how it shifts and changes and sometimes it's the first indication

307
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:01,920
i have that i've gotten caught or stuck or reactive or hot and something

308
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:08,640
and so uh just being familiar with the breathing and connected to it and then being able to

309
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:16,160
come back and and relax their breath and have an ease full breath as i go through my daily life has been beneficial in many

310
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:23,040
many ways and whether i'm on any particular step of anapanasati in daily life i

311
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:29,839
don't really think about so much

312
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:36,400
it's the 16 step open awareness

313
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:43,520
some people might experience open awareness with the 16 steps but i wouldn't want to identify the two

314
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:50,960
together because letting go the deepest letting go we do is just a

315
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:56,960
phenomenal absence and to give it any kind of uh

316
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:02,000
description that is something even something like open awareness

317
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,680
just little bit diminishes it or misses the point a little bit

318
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:15,839
oh what is the pali word you said at the beginning meaning generosity so the uh

319
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:24,720
the word there's uh there's three different pali words that mean both uh letting go

320
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:32,960
or relinquishment translators often translate all three of them as relinquishment but also mean generosity and

321
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:38,558
and the one for that that's uh this sixteenth step one of panasati

322
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:50,839
gga and then there's chaga c long a ga and then there's vosaga

323
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:56,640
v-o-s-s-a and so it's a wonderful thing you see this that this

324
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:06,640
is the close association in poly with letting go and generosity

325
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:13,599
okay so this is wonderful so i need to stop and uh thank you all and and

326
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:19,440
we'll continue this uh exploration of an apanasati in context

327
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:27,760
of liberation next week and i look forward to it and and also maybe i mentioned this but

328
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:34,640
i'm teaching two retreats coming up that are not part of imc it might be interesting for you one is

329
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:42,880
the uh they kind of actually kind of at the same time some of them so i'll be moonlighting one to the other

330
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:49,760
uh one is um the san francisco zen center i'm doing a

331
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:56,559
kind of a interesting dialogue retreat it's not a full retreat but it's um like

332
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:03,119
all day long but it's a you know a couple hours a few hours a day and on the weeks a few days of the evenings and the weekend

333
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:09,839
that's um that uh kind of a lot of this dialogue between uh two of the senior teachers at san

334
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:14,880
francisco zen center myself on the harmony of vipassana and zen

335
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:20,880
and that starts on 19th of april and it'll be folded into the 7 a.m sittings

336
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:26,799
so um i'll do the first week and then paul heller and fou schrader will

337
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:32,240
do the other two weeks instead of me teaching this seven a.m

338
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:38,480
so you get a taste of the retreat just by coming here at seven a.m and the other is uh i'm teaching a

339
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:45,040
retreat at spirit rock online for for six days

340
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:51,680
starting april 25th and and that should be a quite a lovely

341
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:56,558
retreat and i love these online retreats and

342
00:56:56,799 --> 00:57:03,359
so okay thank you
