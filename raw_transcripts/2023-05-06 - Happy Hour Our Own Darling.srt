00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,580
hello again and welcome to happy hour everyone wherever in the world you are

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,219
joining whatever this time zone might be

3
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:17,640
so so for today's theme um I wanted to invite us to practice

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,859
with with self-kindness self

5
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,260
yeah self um appreciation in a way not in a selfish

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,719
way but in a way of you know we're often looking outside forsaking ourselves for

7
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:40,559
for others perhaps and sometimes the perhaps in romantic relationships we're looking

8
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:48,300
for the other for the other to to make us happy um not everyone but but romantic love

9
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:54,000
tends to be um idealized quite a bit as the answer to

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,300
all the suffering and all the issues and problems and sadnesses in in our culture

11
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,780
and many cultures so um there is a beautiful poem that a

12
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:13,619
friend of mine shared with me yesterday and it took my breath away it's such a beautiful poem so I wanted to to share

13
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:19,140
the poem with you and uh yeah maybe I'll show it at the beginning

14
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,259
and then also share it when we're meditating together so the poem is by a

15
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:32,460
celebrated author and poet whose name is Maggie Smith and the name of the poem is

16
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:38,640
is bride bride b-r-i-d-e and you are welcome to either

17
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,340
make it gender neutral for yourself or or con get in touch with your femininity

18
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:52,320
you know yin yang we all have aspects of uh the both both feminine masculine in

19
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,960
us so so see how we can work for you but really the the idea of the poem is

20
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:05,159
embracing embracing love and care for ourselves so here we

21
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:12,180
go how long how long have I been wed

22
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:18,500
to myself calling myself darling dressing

23
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:27,599
for my own pleasure each morning choosing perfume to turn me on

24
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,540
how long have I been alone in this house but not alone

25
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:39,060
married less to the man than to the woman

26
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:46,620
silvering in the mirror I know the kind of wife I need and I

27
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:52,260
become her the one who will leave this earth at the

28
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:59,060
same instant I do I am my own bride

29
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:05,400
lifting the veil to see my face darling I say

46
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,380

47
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,400

151
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:04,620
um that I was adding to my own practice to help myself be more present just to say like you know not the partner in the

152
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:12,179
other room but you know myself um to to move it out of the idea of um

153
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:19,679
to acknowledge not only the gender issue but also this very particular kind of heteronormative relationship model that

154
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:27,118
doesn't reflect all of our realities in words like my reality so just another place to just help my body and my spirit

155
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:35,339
be more present beautiful thank you for sharing that I'm I'm delighted to hear how you worked with it to make it work

157
00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:48,000
all of us in different ways and and and a particular poem in a particular way

158
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,300
may not work or might even be like yeah that's not my reality so yay thank you for doing that and also thanks for

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,140
well because my partner is Moroccan and he just went back home for a month and

164
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:34,500
so I'm here in the U.S without a partner for a month and it's a great poem to

165
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:40,619
carry through this next month and just the concept of like dating myself you

166
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:45,660
know I spend a lot of time with him when he's here and I'm gonna have a lot of time on my

167
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:52,440
hands to spend with myself so I'm I'm just that this felt very

168
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:59,820
um serendipitous thank you beautiful thank you Sarah thank you for sharing

169
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:07,380
that that's it I I so appreciate the timeliness um of this poem for what's what's

170
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:14,220
arising for you right now that's that's lovely great um and there are a few Reflections I see

171
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:19,440
in chat um oh did I sense change the chat oh I

172
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,200
haven't changed the chat settings you're also welcome to to share your Reflections uh publicly if you wanted to

173
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:33,359
but uh let's see one reflection just to me so I contemplate a lot about I me

174
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:38,400
versus soul and body which I are we

175
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:45,119
trying to practice today great great that's that's a great

176
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:51,300
um that's so interesting so so the question really has to do with

177
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:59,460
the teachings on the relative and the absolute uh or actually some people

178
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:06,000
don't call it the absolute the ultimate or or the universal um so the relative and the universal or

179
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,420
or ultimate so they're the teachings really also in Buddhism that exist about

180
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:17,940
uh self you know there is a self you exist do you you have an address you

181
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:23,040
have feelings if you get hurt you grow you die so there is a self and then

182
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:30,599
there are the teachings about about not self impersonality it's not personal

183
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:35,760
it's it's what everything that's happening the body also even the body is

184
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:43,800
not personal it's it's nature etc etc so so the way I invite relating

185
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:49,619
to the practice of Meta Meta doesn't quite work if you're wishing well for

186
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:55,800
these impersonal atoms that are arising and passing away and very quickly or or

187
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:01,680
the four elements that are arising and passing away so metal works better in

188
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:08,579
the relative um with relative concerns but in the relative realm but actually the practice

189
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:16,560
of meta leads to insights um in the in the ultimate it leads to to

190
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:24,680
sense of compassion and care and love that's Universal with no strings attached for all beings everywhere

191
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:32,820
so um so that's how I invite you to to relate to that the person who who

192
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:39,540
shared that question one more reflection send

193
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:46,440
love the poems PT with tears ah it's beautiful PT

194
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:52,880
meaning Joy join Paulie with tears that's lovely thank you so much for sharing that

195
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,320
and yeah and let's see

196
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:04,920
um is that long node let's see if I can read it quickly what should I do if

197
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:09,960
thoughts that I am a bad person with examples from past keep coming up I say

198
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:15,060
I know and I'm different now and getting better and becoming peaceful I also send

199
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:22,800
loving kindness to people whom I have heard if they show up in my thoughts that highlight I am bad can you please

200
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:30,960
share your thoughts thank you for sharing that question yeah it's um the need for forgiveness that that

201
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:36,599
the thoughts that arise with you know with the stories that you are bad and

202
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:43,020
believing those stories and and being stuck there so what I recommend whether

203
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:48,720
I suggest sometimes it might be helpful to switch to

204
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:55,020
the practice of um uh forgiveness actually self-forgiveness

205
00:39:55,020 --> 00:40:02,160
as much as possible may I forgive myself as much as possible in this moment it may not be completely accessible but

206
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,560
tuning into that sense of uh self-forgiveness for yourself or asking

207
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:12,660
for forgiveness in your heart from others and maybe making amends later but

208
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:20,460
that's the practice that's needed because sometimes the what what this questioner asked it can feel like too

209
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:26,280
hard to to get through that so the appropriate practice would be self-com it would be

210
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:33,480
um both forgiveness as well as here's another thing to turn toward with towards

211
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:40,260
oneself towards oneself with self-compassion for the pain because in that moment you're the one who's really

212
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:48,119
hurting you're taking a dagger of memory and just stabbing yourself with it you're bad you're bad ouch so turning to

213
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:53,820
that pain and letting there be compassion um for that pain because it's not

214
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:59,160
helping anyone that that pain we think that it's leading to remorse but

215
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:04,440
actually it's getting us stuck it's forgiveness that leads us to to remorse

216
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:11,220
and taking uh responsibility so that's a short dormant there you are

217
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:16,320
welcome the person who asked the question you're very welcome another person said thank you for the poem
