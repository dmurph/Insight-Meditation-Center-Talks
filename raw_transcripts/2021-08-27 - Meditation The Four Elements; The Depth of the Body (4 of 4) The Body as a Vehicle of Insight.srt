1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:07,439
so just beginning to settle in for meditation

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,719
perhaps closing the eyes if that's comfortable for you

3
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,759
and sensing into the place where you're sitting

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,119
your seat your cushion your chair bench

5
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:32,398
bed couch and just having a sense of being

6
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,839
in the sitting posture

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,920
maybe connecting in with that contact point

8
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,840
where your seat is touching and also your feet or legs against the floor

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,480
so having a sense of stability sometimes we can even sense

10
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,320
three-pointed stability

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,320
it's a very stable way to be sitting

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,280
and just relaxing and allowing yourself to be supported by whatever you're sitting relying on

13
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,560
bringing a sense of straightness to the spine

14
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,280
perhaps trusting that the body itself can find a posture that is both upright

15
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:04,960
and relaxed one that is supported from the inside

16
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,600
but not tense

17
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:35,680
and as an extra support for our posture we can gently soften areas that tend to be tense

18
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,720
so the face particularly the eyes

19
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,599
the jaw

20
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,400
softening down through the throat and the shoulders

21
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,599
letting the shoulder blades slide down the back so that the heart

22
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,760
moves forward a bit in the posture

23
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,720
softening the arms

24
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,239
and then down into the belly area

25
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,720
letting the belly fall forward away from the spine

26
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:52,720
and also letting the low back muscles fall away from the spine

27
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,080
so we just have the support of the bones without a lot of tension around

28
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,319
them

29
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,000
down into the hips

30
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,120
the thighs

31
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,198
the calves and into the ankles and the feet

32
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:42,000
just inviting ease to whatever degree is possible today

33
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,320
and for any parts of the body that don't feel at ease or that you couldn't feel very well

34
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:57,840
we just have mental ease about that the body is fine as it is right now

35
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,440
we might open to the idea of the body as a friend

36
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:22,240
just like our friend is fine as they are when they come to our house

37
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:29,600
the body is fine right now you can just open to it mindfully with

38
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,600
kind attention [Music] feeling what it has to offer us right

39
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,240
now various sensations

40
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:16,400
we may wish to tune into the sensations of breathing coming in going out

41
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,400
just letting the breath be as it is

42
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:32,759
or we may sense into the energy level of the body

43
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,800
subtle sensations of having a body

44
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,199
and just resting for a moment and allowing the simplicity of the

45
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:02,840
bodily sensations to help calm the mind

46
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,319
bye

47
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,599
today we will focus on the experience

48
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,320
of the body

49
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:55,680
which is different often from our idea of the body

50
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:03,839
the concepts that we bring to our body the encouragement today will be to tune

51
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:11,279
into something more simple maybe more basic

52
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:18,959
than what our mind does with the body but i'll offer a series of four

53
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:26,480
perceptions that we may find in our body

54
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:35,240
four types of sensations that relate to how it's actually sensed

55
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,760
so first you may notice in your experience of the body that

56
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,560
there are experiences of hardness or solidity

57
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,160
the solid parts of the body

58
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:02,240
and the structure that's holding you up there's some some hardness there perhaps you feel it in

59
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:09,200
where you're touching against the cushion or the chair i'm just sensing that

60
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:15,959
part of the experience of the body is hardness or solidity

61
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:38,720
in the buddhist teachings these are related to elements so this would be the earth

62
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,720
element

63
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:53,040
and then the corresponding feeling of softness is also part of the earth element

64
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:04,560
there are feelings all throughout the body of this hardness or solidity

65
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,040
and we can tune into those

66
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,760
we can understand that this kind of solidity is really the same as

67
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,800
what we feel in external objects so

68
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,480
the table or the cup that we hold also feel

69
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:48,440
solid in a certain way that's the experience and it's the same it's the earth element

70
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,680
and then the second type of experience we have in the body

71
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:44,480
is that of liquidity or wetness

72
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,720
the water element we feel this easily in the mouth

73
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:58,560
sometimes we can sense it in the eyes or if there's any sweat

74
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:07,279
this is the water element of the body it's more subtle

75
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:13,200
but still there are these easy places to detect it

76
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:23,200
and the water element is also related to the cohesion of the body

77
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:30,959
in the same way that when we go to the beach when we're just out on the sand

78
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:36,079
it's very dry but then as we walk towards the water

79
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:42,240
there comes a place where it becomes more solid and actually easy to walk on and

80
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:48,399
that's where the sand gets wet has enough water to hold it together

81
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:55,839
so this is happening in the body also the water element is the cohesion of the

82
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,240
body

83
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,760
consents into that all throughout the body

84
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:55,920
and this water element is really the same as the water in rivers and lakes

85
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,560
the water in our home

86
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,720
it's all water element

87
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,759
and then the third experience in the body is

88
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,839
one of temperature of heat and coolness

89
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:02,079
we may notice that the hands

90
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:11,120
may be warm or sometimes they're cool often the torso area is warm

91
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:21,320
and as we tune into the quality of temperature we'll find it variable throughout the body

92
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,920
is the fire element

93
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,680
at different times different parts are warm or cool and we can just feel for now how it is

94
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,839
now

95
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,440
this quality of temperature

96
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,600
so

97
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:24,640
and we can understand that this heat is the same as the experience of temperature we have

98
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,840
externally the warmth of the sun the heat of the sun

99
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,840
or the coolness in the shade

100
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,159
it's all fire elements

101
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,440
oh

102
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:10,720
and then in addition to the solidity and the liquidity

103
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,840
in the heat we feel throughout the body

104
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:24,960
there is also a sense of motion the body is dynamic it's not static

105
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:31,760
so there's a sense of movement the air element

106
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,759
most easily discerned in the breath coming in going out

107
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,000
causes movement all through the body

108
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,399
but there are other movements going on [Music]

109
00:18:53,360 --> 00:19:00,480
the gut is moving while it's digesting [Music] we may tune into that

110
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,919
other energetic sensations

111
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:14,320
literal movements of the muscles all of this is air element

112
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,840
so tuning into that sense throughout the body

113
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:48,640
and this is really the same as the blowing of the wind outside

114
00:19:51,200 --> 00:20:00,520
the world of motion that we live in it's all related to the air element

115
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:22,960
so as we rest in these flowing sensations you just open your

116
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:29,280
perception and let it move between solidity liquidity

117
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,400
heat emotion [Music] feeling the body as the

118
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,600
union and the dance and the sum of all of these

119
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:50,320
and knowing that the body is part of nature it's one more process

120
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,159
like all of those we experience externally

121
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:26,679
we may sense a certain ease and lightness in perceiving the body this way

122
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,480
so natural so simple

123
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,440
not very personal

124
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,840
may even bring some happiness

125
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:18,760
can we just rest in these simple experiences of nature

126
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:20,640
so as we practice with seeing the body in terms of these

127
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,840
four elements which are really more the

128
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:32,080
experiential aspect of the body how it really feels

129
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:39,440
we free ourselves from various fixed ideas we might carry about our body

130
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,720
things that are more concepts or ideas

131
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,919
instead of the actual experience

132
00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:01,039
and this movement of moving from what is conceptual and

133
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:08,640
idea based and abstract to what is actually real in our experience

134
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:15,440
is much of what we do in practice and so then

135
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:21,600
we discover that we have many fixed ideas about ourself

136
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:28,320
about the world about other people

137
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,360
if we can just open to more of what the actual experience is

138
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:41,360
the sensations the reality

139
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,840
we become freer we can have a freer response to these

140
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:53,840
things so as we go out into the world

141
00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:00,320
how else might we have this light feeling

142
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:06,200
freed from our usual ways of seeing things

143
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,919
would there be some way even just a little bit

144
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:21,320
to see things more as just nature

145
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:38,000
how might this more useful way of seeing be supportive of other people

146
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:47,440
maybe this kind of ease and flexibility and willingness to meet the

147
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:56,080
experience maybe that could open a space for more kindness more compassion

148
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,840
more willingness to be a little flexible

149
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:21,120
sometimes even relaxing and opening a bit

150
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:27,240
brings a surprise that we couldn't have anticipated

151
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,398
when we look back we think ah of course

152
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:48,799
so may your openness to your body

153
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:56,640
seeing it in a different way be supportive to the people around you

154
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,399
be supportive to the whole world

155
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:08,398
as we go out into today or the afternoon or evening

156
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,240
just keeping in mind that there can be a difference between the actual experience

157
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:23,200
and our ideas and concepts i'm trying to tend toward

158
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:31,679
the actuality of the moment may this bring peace and whiteness

159
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:37,880
and kindness into the world

160
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:12,080
so today we come to the final talk in our series on

161
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:17,600
the depth of the body and we'll talk about how the body

162
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,600
can play a role in insight practice

163
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,600
i'm amazed at how fruitful it has been and continues to be

164
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:35,600
to work with the body both on and off the cushion

165
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,880
actually troubles with my body are what got me into meditation and

166
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:48,240
even after many years i can say that it just goes deeper and deeper

167
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:55,679
and the the buddhist teachings uh support this idea it is said that um practicing with the

168
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:01,840
body in the right way can lead all the way to liberation from suffering

169
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:08,000
so there's quite a lot of potential there but to to do that

170
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,080
we do need to take a dharma perspective in looking at the body

171
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:21,200
despite living in our body for many years we may actually know very little about it

172
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:28,399
from a dharma perspective because that's not necessarily the usual way we would see it

173
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:35,760
we could start to ask questions like what what is the body really i mean the sense of the body is so

174
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,600
different at different times imagine how different you feel when you're

175
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:47,519
hungry when you're sick when you're tired when you're sleeping

176
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:53,120
when you're meditating when you're doing a headstand

177
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:59,279
all of these are very different experiences right is it even correct to say this is

178
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:05,519
the body much less my body it seems like it's a different thing

179
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:12,480
from moment to moment so body practice is wonderful because it

180
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:18,480
can be approached at any level actually we've explored a number of them this

181
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,600
week the body is immediately accessible at a top level

182
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,640
and there are times when it's the most obvious part of our experience

183
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:35,760
but also with certain practices that we do often in meditation the body can open to deeper and deeper

184
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:45,200
layers it can become very subtle and it can eventually reveal new perspectives on experience

185
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,880
so through dharma practice we're learning to see the body in new ways

186
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:57,360
maybe this is our greatest teacher and it's very close at hand you know our greatest teacher might be

187
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:02,640
right here with us so the body

188
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:09,679
that we see in the mirror with its eyes and nose and

189
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:15,120
shoulders and skin and hair and that ground belly

190
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:22,000
or whatever it's just one way to perceive it we're strongly conditioned to see our

191
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,640
body in this very conceptual way because we've done that for so long and

192
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:34,159
that's the support that we get from other people and from society around us

193
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:40,559
but many of the classical body meditations and contemplations

194
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:48,159
are designed to undermine or break down these habitual concepts that we bring

195
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:55,039
into our experience of the body and they're actually designed to get us to see things in a different way

196
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:02,320
not because this top level way or conventional way is wrong but because it's only one possibility and we limit

197
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:09,358
ourselves if we just use one so when we do this we do start to see the body differently

198
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:15,760
and actually it is more accurate to begin to see the body more experientially

199
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,960
and that opens a path toward wise understanding the body can be a

200
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:27,440
vehicle through which we start to understand more deeply how things work

201
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:35,919
so just we as we we can take an example of what we just did in the meditation which is the four elements meditation

202
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:42,878
and if you're interested in where that's found it's in writing the key instructions that we have on mindfulness

203
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:49,440
it's in the sati patana suta which is mn10 so this practice

204
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:56,079
of the four elements asks us to touch into the experience of the body

205
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:03,520
which is actually a mixture of different experiences the ones highlighted are the solidity

206
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,960
liquidity heat and motion uh that are found throughout the body

207
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:16,320
and these are not fundamentally different from [Music] external experiences those four things

208
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:24,480
which we encounter all the time in the world around us here in this cup i have some water

209
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,560
it has a certain temperature it moves when i shake the glass

210
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,839
cup so right there we have the four elements

211
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:41,680
it's kind of interesting also to consider when i take this water in

212
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:49,520
at one point at what point does it become part of my body

213
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:55,359
as opposed to outside of my body maybe it's already there because it's

214
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:00,480
disappeared but on the other hand it's still kind of just in my belly

215
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:06,800
it's interesting where is that dividing line we don't need to get really philosophically into this but

216
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,880
when we start to look a little bit just a little bit more carefully we see immediately that there are

217
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:19,280
questions about where is the division between external and internal

218
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,920
it can get you know subtle and not as obvious as we think when we

219
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:32,000
divide things up conceptually into words like internal and external those are nice words

220
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:39,280
but what do they where do they really shift from one to the other where are the boundaries around those not so clear

221
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:46,640
when we look in experience we also see that these things are shifting and changing you know there's

222
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:53,200
uh continual change about what's internal and external and breathing every moment

223
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:59,520
so we can start to see the uh inconstancy and impermanence and

224
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,760
changingness of the body and experience and internal and external and all of this so

225
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,119
we we leave this leads to important insights even at this very

226
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:16,160
basic level of experience into a nietzsche impermanence or in

227
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:22,000
constancy and then also toward anata not self

228
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,880
i mean really what part of this is yours

229
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,839
so this is worth exploring because it's an area of a lot of suffering

230
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:39,680
so all of this is is beginning to take what i'm calling a dharma perspective

231
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:45,920
on the body so we meet the actual experience of the body rather than various concepts that we

232
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:53,119
have about it we start to ask questions around those edges just to play a little bit with

233
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:59,680
what are the ways that our concepts might be restricting us so we also have concepts like

234
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:06,079
knee or back usually when we're talking about pain my knee hurts

235
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:11,760
so um as joseph goldstein says he's one of our elder insight teachers

236
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:18,400
he says there's no sensation called me and it's true right if you look into

237
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:24,880
what is the knee that is hurting right now there isn't one experience called knee

238
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,640
it's a concept it's an idea of some part of the body but when we look at the actual

239
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:37,599
experience we will see that even that pain is you know it's tension it's heat it's

240
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:45,520
pulling its sharpness there are more there are words that are much more specific than pain which is a

241
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:51,680
concept so we can start to meet our experience more at that level

242
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:57,040
grounding ourselves in actual sensations and we'll find that our experience of

243
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:04,079
that pain differs you know then our response to it and our possibilities of how we can be with it

244
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:11,520
also open up when our mental image of it opens up a bit so what we're learning is some

245
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,720
flexibility around experience and this has a lot to do with freedom

246
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:22,240
you know with having a freer response than when we can only be locked into one

247
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:29,760
way of seeing things so as we then going on as we experience the body

248
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,760
is ever changing from moment to moment it's very natural to begin to understand

249
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:42,560
that the body is not going to last forever in this form it's quite finite

250
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,680
um certainly it's undergoing it's undergone a lot of change to get to the point

251
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:54,480
where you are now isn't your body very different than it was 10 years ago 20 years ago

252
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:01,119
if you're old enough 50 years ago 60 yeah of course very different and it

253
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:06,720
will continue to be different that's called aging and of course it's finite eventually

254
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:12,800
something will end there yes so um

255
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:18,079
it's interesting and and important to begin contemplating in these directions

256
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:23,920
we do it gently you know everybody's in a different place around how they want to approach

257
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:32,240
the finiteness of the body but one of the easiest ways that we can start turning our mind in this direction

258
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:38,240
is simply to notice endings of all types so we can you know actually everything

259
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:44,960
ends uh our normal way of perceiving not our dharma way of perceiving is that we like

260
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:52,640
beginnings and so we rush on to the next thing that's beginning we prefer what is new and young

261
00:40:52,640 --> 00:41:00,240
to what is old and decaying and so we start to notice things that are decaying or ending in very simple

262
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:06,960
ways we can do it externally internal external you know so we can notice leaves dropping from

263
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:14,960
the trees for example fall is beginning isn't it so flowers wilt

264
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,680
we can also notice the gatherings of friends come to an end so you know pause

265
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:27,119
to recognize endings just begin to flavor the mind with this notion that

266
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:35,280
there are beginnings and there are endings and it's beginning to take a very simple dharma perspective on life realistic

267
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:41,280
seeing the reality of how things actually are coming and going

268
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,480
there are times when it will be challenging to stay with reflections like this and

269
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:53,040
if that's the case you don't have to but um it's fine to maybe touch into this from

270
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:58,400
time to time you know to consider that the the body is going

271
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:05,520
toward a certain end at some point we may need patience to really take in the reality of the body

272
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:10,640
its ever changingness and its finitude and of course its impersonality in the

273
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:17,599
end these can be a little bit challenging to see into sometimes we can have the sense whoa

274
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:23,280
is this what i signed up for yes it is that we have this body

275
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:29,200
so truly the body is our friend you know it's always in the present moment

276
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:35,280
it's always honest the mind can be very tricky but the body is pretty honest

277
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:41,280
and it gently but persistently serves as a very deep dharma teacher

278
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:47,680
our closest teacher is very close at hand and who could ask for a better friend

279
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:53,680
so just as we talked about in the first talk this week

280
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:59,839
venerable ananda the attendant of the buddha said there's no friend like mindfulness

281
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:06,480
of the body so i hope that you've maybe have gained some

282
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:12,319
deeper appreciation of the depth of the body and its potential its power in our

283
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:17,520
dharma practice we want to learn about how things work and gain the kind

284
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:24,240
of wisdom that will help us live well in the world and really serve the world well

285
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:30,640
the body is a great vehicle a great teacher for that so perhaps you will honor your body in

286
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:37,359
some way today what a gift it is that we have this teacher for the short time

287
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:43,839
that we do so much appreciation for your presence and

288
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:51,640
your dharma practice and i wish you all very well thank you
