uh welcome everyone all of you here in person delightful to have you and

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:13,840
still feels very special to have people together and meditating and i've been alone here for so long

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,039
uh so thank you for being here being in practicing in community

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,320
and those of you who are on youtube watching and welcome as well and

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,439
i you haven't been forgotten even with the people here in the room and and i appreciate seeing the greetings in

6
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,200
the chat and perhaps on youtube you if you log down a little bit early

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:45,840
you see the people kind of walking in across past the camera and hopefully that just makes you

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,160
kind of delighted to see that there's more life here at imc than there has been

9
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,680
and uh so and it feels kind of peaceful in here

10
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:04,158
it's a little bit more peaceful for me that i hadn't thought about it before but a little more peaceful having people here to meditate

11
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,640
than to have i have some of you don't you ever saw the shots of the umbrellas the light umbrellas i have here and

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,479
different paraphernalia and stuff that and so somehow it feels very nice to be here

13
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,640
with all of you so thank you

14
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,159
so um

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,400
so meditation is so many different things for different people

16
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:39,200
and i certainly don't want to narrow it to any one thing

17
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,960
i think uh it's many things for each person over a lifetime of practice meditation

18
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,600
has different functions different meanings different it expresses different things it

19
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,439
realizes different things it's a it's a wonderful varied kind of thing it doesn't even though might look similar

20
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:04,399
just sitting quietly with the eyes closed the range of things that it can be about are quite

21
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:11,120
broad and wide and wonderful i don't want to narrow it to one thing only but

22
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:18,720
i kind of today my feeling a little bit about meditation is uh i'm associating with being on

23
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,920
pilgrimage and uh a sacred pilgrimage

24
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,840
and uh so you you know in the old days they would walk in

25
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,120
pilgrimages you can still do that and go to some pilgrimage sites around the world and

26
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,160
uh kyushu with ireland and japan they have pilgrimage routes and spain they

27
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,360
have el camino and different things and the and uh so the place we're

28
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,680
walking is uh in our own body and mind and sometimes i've thought that the

29
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:58,319
rhythm of the breath the breathing as we breathe is kind of like the rhythm of walking in

30
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:05,120
in the time of the buddha that's the only meaning of transportation except for a few very rare kind of wealthy people who had

31
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,319
chariots or something but buddha walked

32
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:16,560
walked and walked and walked across the plains of india

33
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:24,000
and uh at a time where there were no asphalt and no electricity and no cars

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,280
and and there's something happens in the rhythm of walking

35
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,200
the simplicity the groundedness of it that i think connects people to their bodies connects

36
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,239
people to their environment connects people to the present moment

37
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,959
so for meditation the rhythm of the walking the pilgrimage is done with partly doing the

38
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,480
breathing and just the rhythm and the steadiness and

39
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,720
we're kind of lucky that for most of us unless you have a pacemaker or something

40
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,480
you know we're just sitting quietly with the natural material of life that just like

41
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,920
the buddha did when he sat and closed his mind close his eyes that

42
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:16,000
sitting with the breathing is the same as the buddhas the sensations of the body are probably

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,199
very similar it's the same pilgrimage route same sacred ground that we're going through

44
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,720
and that's the same before there was traffic and cars and electricity and the

45
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,120
complications of life so it's a connection to something that's um

46
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,120
you know it's probably the wrong word to use but it's a word that's kind of in my heart

47
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,759
it's something primordial that we connect to here in this pilgrimage of sitting and being with the

48
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,919
moment so if that uh connotion is nice for you you might think of this next sitting as

49
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:02,560
a pilgrimage if it's not nice for you then it's more than welcome just let go of it

50
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,600
so to as soon a

51
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,560
posture that respects this pilgrimage we're on

52
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,560
respects this entering into a sacred area sacred ground

53
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,479
entering into the domain of where the buddha traveled

54
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:33,600
in his meditation and maybe lower your gaze

55
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,039
relax your focus of your eyes

56
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,160
and if it's comfortable for you to gently close your eyes

57
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,720
and to establish yourself here in this primordial world of our

58
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,240
body and breathing to be reminded of it

59
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,840
you might take a few long slow deep breaths

60
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,560
deep enough so that

61
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,080
it's kind of a conscious

62
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,240
engagement with breathing the exhale

63
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:35,039
long enough that this conscious engagement with releasing letting go

64
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,600
settling in

65
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,280
and then letting your breathing return to normal

66
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:15,280
and part of the art of relaxing at the beginning of meditation

67
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,440
is to relax so that the breathing is a little bit more

68
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:28,880
easeful or that you can connect more to your breathing

69
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:37,240
and so to relax the muscles of your face

70
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,879
soften in the shoulders

71
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,879
especially when relaxing the shoulders if they relax

72
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:05,160
you're gonna be relaxing into the chest and the breathing

73
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,680
relaxing the belly

74
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,479
not to try too hard at all try just lightly

75
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:32,560
but there is an art to relaxing in the belly both on the inhale and the exhale

76
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:41,839
the diaphragm does the work and the belly stays relaxed

77
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and maybe you've entered into some sacred space

78
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,839
special place and it was natural for your mind to become more calm

79
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,600
more quiet in the stillness the peacefulness of the

80
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,959
place out of respect for the place

81
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,839
and so to enter into this body of yours here

82
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,000
as the pilgrim land of their

83
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,959
pilgrimage then the breathing

84
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:47,760
the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out is how you walk across this land or

85
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:55,360
through this land one inhale at a time

86
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,959
one exhale at a time

87
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:07,519
and perhaps have no more ambition with your breathing

88
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:16,040
than to be present for the next inhale the current exhale

89
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:25,920
no need to measure your success by

90
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:33,360
stringing together many breaths in a row in mindfulness just be fully present for this step this

91
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,720
breath here

92
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,720
quiet

93
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:55,680
allowing the breathing to carry you the breathing to do you

94
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,440
rather than you doing the breathing

95
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,639
then as we come to the end of this sitting

96
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,559
one of the gifts you can bring to the world

97
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,039
is whatever inner peace you have

98
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:43,600
and if you have no inner peace one of the gifts you can give the world

99
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:51,279
is the practice you do to find that peace

100
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:58,559
to connect to it it's one of the great noble endeavors

101
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,279
it's the practice to find that peace

102
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:13,600
and may we do that not just for our own sake may we do it to contribute to the

103
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,919
welfare and well-being of this world

104
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:25,279
to help other people be able to find their peace

105
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:31,039
or to help others feel peaceful unthreatened

106
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:39,000
as they go through their life peace is a precious commodity

107
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:47,279
may through this practice that we do may the goodness of it spread out into

108
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:53,480
the world may all beings be happy

109
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,440
may all beings be safe

110
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:07,919
may all beings be peaceful and may all beings

111
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,158
be free

112
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,320
thank you

113
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,440
so what's been on uh in my heart my mind lately

114
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:50,398
is the story of the last days of the buddha's life there's a text called the mahaparinibano

115
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:56,960
which is the longest suta the longest discourse the longest kind of text from this early tradition

116
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:03,040
that is also unique in being kind of a travelogue it kind of describes the

117
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,400
travels that buddha did in the last time period of his time and it kind of

118
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,680
also is set up to be maybe because it was the buddha knew he

119
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,599
was dying he was old to prepare his community for his departure and

120
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:25,520
his absence there and so giving his last teachings his last instructions

121
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:32,640
at this crucial point but as also you get to see this man walking across india and how he engages

122
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,760
with his sickness old age and death and dying and

123
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:43,280
it's i think it's quite inspiring to see the conscious careful

124
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:49,040
considerate way in which he went about his last period of time

125
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:55,760
so i wanted to share that and talk a little bit about it and

126
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,880
the story of the last days of the buddha's life less days last months it's

127
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,480
the text itself might span something like some we don't know exactly somewhere

128
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:13,920
between six and nine months of time and uh it kind of bookends his path of

129
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:20,400
practice and he refers to how he started in this text he refers to how he started his practice 50 more than 50 years

130
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:26,640
before when he was 29 and now he's about 80.

131
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:33,040
and and there's a kind of i think mostly probably most likely a myth about the

132
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:39,440
buddha's beginning of his path but you know he started he was 29 it's

133
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:45,839
you know what what brought him at that age ripe age to engage in spiritual practice and

134
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:52,720
set out for his uh to seek for some solution to his suffering

135
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:59,760
the classic myth is that uh he was uh kind of a prisoner of the palace

136
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,800
uh until that age that somehow his father wanted to protect him from

137
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:11,440
the sufferings of the world and so kept him kind of in this uh

138
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:18,000
within the palace walls and he had different palaces that he moved between but he was protected from seeing

139
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,880
some of the challenges that people live under and uh and i can imagine that probably any

140
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,079
of us if we lived that kind of way kind of cooped up and

141
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:35,520
in a wealthy suburb growing up that way and you know with

142
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:42,000
the walls around their compound and everything that there probably be some frustration some challenge some feeling like this is

143
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:49,119
not life this is not you know not that connected and there to be some kind of restlessness and maybe even built up

144
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:56,079
pressure and that takes the form of the buddha then jumping over the wall

145
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:02,480
sneaking out and uh and then they say he snuck out four times

146
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,560
and uh each time he saw a different one of what's been called the heavenly messengers

147
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:14,400
and uh and when i was 10 or 11

148
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,160
i was in nepal and uh and uh

149
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:29,680
in kathmandu and kathmandu was pretty simple city town when i was there in 1965 i went back 20 years later and it

150
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,920
i don't think there were any asphalted roads when i was there and uh

151
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:42,880
in the dirt road in front of the palace the king lived and uh

152
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:49,280
but it was the first time i saw a body a body of a child being carried down to the river to be

153
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,320
burnt then died and so there was like that so i can imagine it kind of so the

154
00:38:54,320 --> 00:39:00,560
buddha buddha saw these three heavenly messengers first trip out he saw someone who was sick

155
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,599
it says that he never knew anybody was sick before him maybe was really sick

156
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:11,680
for something and so he was shocked and he he was told this is the nature of life this what

157
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:17,520
happens to people next time he went out he saw an old person that shocked him

158
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:23,200
because he was live such a protected life right and he was told this is what happens if

159
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:29,760
you're lucky enough you get old and the next time he went out he saw

160
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,440
what i saw when i was 11 and you saw someone who was dead

161
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:43,359
and and he was told that's what happens and the fourth time he went out he saw

162
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:49,040
a ascetic a spiritual seeker renunciant and the renunciant was somehow just

163
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:57,040
walking through town very peacefully and he'd never seen anybody who embodied such kind of peace

164
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:04,000
it's something about the renunciant got his attention and he and i get to to kind of indicate

165
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:10,240
how that's possible in this world of sickness old age and death the world of turmoil of restlessness of this pressure

166
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,240
this probably this deep

167
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:20,800
deep need that he had from being so cooped up that there was a solution there was a

168
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:27,119
way out there was some some other way another approach to life so he saw these four heavenly messengers

169
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:34,000
and that sparked him to then to actually leave his palace life to jump over the wall fifth time

170
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,400
and to go off to become a renunciant himself a contemplative

171
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:49,040
and which he did for the next over 50 years of his life

172
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:55,760
and then at some point he had a solution to his suffering he became enlightened and then he taught

173
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:01,680
and then he comes to the end of his life and there's kind of a wonderful

174
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:08,400
kind of parallel or something repeating of the same thing

175
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:14,720
of sickness all these heavenly messengers but this time he's the heavenly messenger

176
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,760
it it the story depicts him as being an old person

177
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:25,280
depicts him as being sick repeatedly sick in this last days of his life

178
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:31,839
and depicts him as dying and he's the renunciant he's the peaceful one

179
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:40,240
he's the messenger of what's possible in this life that we can resolve our suffering and somehow

180
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:46,319
become a peaceful a messenger of peace a teacher of peace

181
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:52,480
an embodiment of peace so it's kind of like a wonderful completion to have that at the end of

182
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:58,480
his life that he becomes these heavenly messengers so we become the dharma

183
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:04,560
the dharma is not just something to treat as a you know as an external thing

184
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:11,200
we tap into touch into it periodically it's possible to become it in some very profound way

185
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:17,040
and um so when he when he's when he had started off practicing this you know

186
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:23,280
whatever it was he was feeling as a young man when he was 29 that he felt he had to

187
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:29,280
leave the palace leave his leave his marriage his family even what that pressure was like inside of

188
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,838
him we get a little bit more sense of this from this um

189
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:41,040
which is probably you know closer to probably what actually happened to him than the myth of going out and seeing

190
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:46,480
the heavenly messengers so he's talking about how he was

191
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:52,240
what what he was feeling before he became enlightened

192
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:59,920
and it's kind of just is describing his distress and so here he is not not

193
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:05,520
enlightened yet he hasn't discovered his peace yet so he's a distressed young man

194
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:14,800
violence gives birth to fear just look at people

195
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:20,960
and their quarrels i will speak of my dismay

196
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:28,640
and the way that i was shaken seeing people thrashing about like fish

197
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:34,319
in little water and seeing them feuding with each other

198
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:42,400
i became afraid the world is completely without a core

199
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,280
everywhere things are changing

200
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:55,760
i felt discontent at seeing only conflict to the very end

201
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:04,000
then i saw an arrow here hard to see embedded in the heart

202
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:11,920
pierced by this arrow dash about in all directions

203
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:18,960
when the arrows pulled out they don't run and they don't sink

204
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:27,280
and then uh it goes on a little bit then there's one more verse i want to read that the

205
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,640
maybe a little bit captures what the results of pulling out the arrow

206
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:39,200
let's give the instruction he gives for others what was before

207
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:44,640
let it wither away what will be later

208
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:50,480
do nothing with it not grasping what's in between

209
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:55,599
you'll live at peace so don't be too caught up in the past or

210
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:02,000
the future live here this is where the peace is to be found

211
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:07,520
so in this text then the the story of his last days

212
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:12,720
um he's it's uh some of what he wrote there is still

213
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:18,160
true and you kind of have to read a little bit into the text and some

214
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:24,720
of it's pretty explicit but the top his time as he was dying is changing the world that he knew

215
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:29,359
is radically changing and

216
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:36,400
and uh you know if you're old enough that's what you see sometimes but some of the challenges that we have

217
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,680
in our modern times were challenges that they had back then and isn't like our challenges is to have a little bit

218
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:47,920
different technology that goes with it but the uh but uh you know this human challenges

219
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:53,200
are so similar back then with the buddha his time he had to live with this as well

220
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:59,280
and the text begin opens with a king uh he's in the town living in the town

221
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,880
for the time being where the king lives and the king sends his messenger as minister to the buddha

222
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:12,880
with the instructions that he wants to check in with the buddha about how good ideas for him to attack

223
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:20,079
his neighboring country that's how it begins wars afoot

224
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:25,520
now the king who wants to go attack neighboring his neighboring country

225
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:31,680
he killed his own father who was a friend of the buddha and they'd spent many decades kind of

226
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:37,599
you know in contact with each other so that represents you know that

227
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:44,079
things were changing and not what they had been for the buddha the other king who's even closer to who

228
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:49,200
lived further to the north uh he also had been usurped

229
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:54,960
by his son just uh in the last year or so the buddha's life

230
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,640
and it was sent into exile and died in exile and uh

231
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:05,520
and it's possible why the buddha was way down near rob

232
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:12,079
rajager in india about about 107 80 miles from

233
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:18,960
where he was going to die from his home country and uh

234
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:26,240
and uh so there was all this turmoil political turmoil going on in this time and war

235
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:33,280
was afoot and there's other kind of legends that that uh during that last

236
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:40,160
year of the buddha's life there was even that his own home country was attacked and first attacked and repelled and then

237
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:45,440
attacked and then many people killed and

238
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:50,480
so that's kind of the background that's kind of for the this

239
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:56,079
the buddha is starting to walk from raj gear

240
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:01,760
north towards his home country he's an 80 year old man

241
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:07,359
and uh or so and he's walking across the plains of india

242
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:14,480
and the distance in some ways is not so great but he ends up walking about 180 miles

243
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:19,839
but he takes about six to nine months to do that he stops for the reigns retreats along the way

244
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:27,040
and he stops many places along the way i think someone who is relatively fit could probably do that walk you know in

245
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:33,440
three weeks and so he's taking his time he's not in a hurry and i just love this idea that

246
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:40,559
he's not in a hurry maybe because he's uh old and tired and sick and creaky that maybe he has to

247
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:47,839
walk really slow and take his time and rest a lot one of the repeated refrains in this last text is the buddha telling his

248
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:53,760
fellow monks or traveling with him i'm tired

249
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:59,280
let's go sit down i'm tired i need to lay down you don't have i don't think you see

250
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:06,720
that almost anywhere else in the sutras but this happens a repeatedly as a man who needs to rest

251
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:12,079
and so he starts heading north and

252
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:18,160
comes across more evidence of war is about to happen between these two countries that he spent good part of his

253
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:23,280
adult life visiting and traveling through and teaching and

254
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:28,480
he goes a little bit further and he gets learns that he has two main

255
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:34,559
most senior disciples sariputta and muklayana and he learns that

256
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:42,000
sariputta has died you know and then he learns that magliana his other senior disciple had been killed

257
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:48,000
so things are changing and you know this is what he's living in so and the buddha just seems like the sense

258
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:54,720
i get from the text he's just walking peacefully calmly steadily he's not affected by this he certainly

259
00:49:54,720 --> 00:50:01,200
knows it but somehow his peace is more powerful than what's happening

260
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:08,079
around and and kind of from some of the things he says uh it's kind of like he it it the life

261
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:13,599
around him is i ain't different than what can be expected

262
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:18,640
and so he's not like fighting it or he's not

263
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:25,359
surprised by it he's just walking peacefully calmly living his life teaching doing his final teaching that

264
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:31,119
he has to do as he goes along but in it he's the he's you know he's

265
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:36,240
the heavenly messengers um

266
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:42,160
so he stopped at some point for what's called the reigns retreat a three to four month period where monastics are

267
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:47,200
staying one put in one place supposed to be during the monsoon season

268
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:54,079
and so he was doing that during the reigns he was attacked by a severe sickness

269
00:50:54,079 --> 00:51:00,880
with sharp pains as if he were about to die but he endured all this mindfully

270
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:07,280
clearly aware and without complaining he thought it is not fitting that i should attain

271
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:14,079
final nibana without addressing my followers and taking leave of the order of monks

272
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:22,079
i must hold this disease in check by energy and apply myself to the force of life

273
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:27,599
so it's a powerful statement that you know there's you know you couldn't go down to the local doctor and get

274
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:33,920
some you know little medicine to pump him up or keep him going and not feel pain there wasn't such thing so he had

275
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:39,119
to kind of apply himself in practice and energy and and so kind of and keep his life force

276
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:44,640
going not to let it go up go out i've heard that there are people come to a juncture and

277
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:51,359
when they get old or sick where the um you know you can almost feel the choice

278
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:57,040
between still keeping the life energy going and and then letting it dissipate

279
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:03,520
and move into death so he decided to stay stay alive he had still more work to do

280
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:09,200
um and uh and then his uh

281
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:14,640
uh when he gets better from his sickness uh his main attendant a monk named

282
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:21,520
ananda uh came to him and said i have seen the buddha i've seen you in

283
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:28,240
comfort and i've seen you patiently enduring when you're sick

284
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:34,400
and when i saw you this way sick my body was like a drunkard's

285
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:41,040
i lost my bearings and things were unclear to me because of the buddha sickness

286
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:46,559
the only thing that was of some comfort to me was the thought the buddha will not attain

287
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:52,559
final nibbana until he has made some statement about the order of monks

288
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:58,240
so the last class instructions you know and uh but here's you know again

289
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:04,240
everything's kind of falling apart here his senior disciple says he's like kind of lost it when the buddha was

290
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:10,240
dying so the buddha says you know the word and then answers uh it says this

291
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:16,640
about the final statement to the order of monks but ananda what does the order of

292
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:22,400
monastics expect of me i have i have taught the dhamma

293
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:29,760
making no inner or outer meaning no inner esoteric teachings that's secret

294
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:35,200
and you know in the public teachings i've made no distinction between inner and outer or the secret or the special

295
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:42,319
teaching and that uh i have no teach teacher's fist

296
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:47,440
in respect to teachings teacher's fist apparently is that you hold you hold things inside

297
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:53,520
hidden in teachers in your fist and you only give it to people if they do something

298
00:53:53,520 --> 00:54:00,000
you know so apparently that was something people would do there was a there were other religions at times with the buddha where there were clearly

299
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:06,079
secret doctrines and only taught to some people it never could be shared with other people

300
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:11,839
so he didn't that's not his way and then he says it's interesting

301
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:17,599
if there is anyone who thinks i shall take charge of the order the monastic

302
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:23,839
order or that monastic order should refer to me

303
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:30,160
let him make some statement about the order let him do what he does but

304
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:37,359
i the buddha doesn't think in that way so why should i make a statement about

305
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:42,640
the monastic order i think we're saying he's not assigning anyone to be the successor there's no one who's going to

306
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:47,760
be the leader of it and then he goes on

307
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:54,480
this is a very touching description of the buddha being old

308
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:00,559
ananda i am now old worn-out venerable

309
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:06,000
one who has traversed life's path i've reached the term of life which is

310
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:13,839
80. just as an old cart is made to go by being held together by straps

311
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:21,119
so my body is kept going by being strapped up it's only when i withdraw my attention

312
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:26,480
from outward signs from outward experiences of the world

313
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:32,559
and by the cessation of certain feelings quieting down of certain feelings

314
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:38,240
and i enter into deep concentrated meditation called the sign list that

315
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:43,760
my body knows comfort remember there's no pain medication back

316
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:50,880
then right so who knows what he kind of physical pain he had and so but he had this powerful mind of

317
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:58,319
meditation that he had ability to drop into and so he was able to find his peace and comfort there and maybe refresh there

318
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:07,040
remember he was trying to kept his life force going i suspect that this deep meditation is part of what helped that continue

319
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:15,960
and then he gave as one of the most important last teachings that of his teaching career

320
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:21,599
uh so therefore it starts it therefore maybe therefore you know given that

321
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:26,799
we're all uh you know going to get sick gold and dice all of

322
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:32,400
us someday or there will become at least one of the heavenly messengers

323
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:38,880
at least one and some of you'll probably be two some three

324
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:45,680
and hopefully some of you may quickly you know they'll be the last one the last heavenly messenger the

325
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:51,119
person who walks peacefully in this world

326
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:57,599
so the voice said therefore you should live as islands unto yourselves

327
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:04,640
being your own refuge with no one else as your refuge with the dhamma as an island with a

328
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:11,119
dhamma as your refuge with no other refuge and how does one live as an island unto

329
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:17,039
oneself with no other refuge here

330
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:25,040
a person abides contemplating the body as body earnestly clearly aware mindful

331
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:30,480
and having put away all hankerings and fretting for the world

332
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:35,920
and likewise with regard to feelings mind and mind objects

333
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,960
this is how a person lives an island onto oneself

334
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:46,720
with oneself as one's only refuge so this is what he gives his mindfulness practice

335
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:52,000
four foundations of mindfulness so the last thing the buddha one of the

336
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,839
last teachings the buddha gives is not a doctrine but rather a teaching about practice

337
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:04,160
instructions for practice and this he repeats in different ways

338
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:09,599
as he goes along here that practice is what he's interested in

339
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:16,079
and so he has another place where he teaches

340
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:22,640
those matters which i have discovered and proclaimed should be thoroughly learnt by you

341
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:28,319
practice developed and cultivated so this holy life may endure for a long

342
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:34,720
time that it may be for the benefit and happiness of many people

343
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:41,599
living out of care for the world for the benefit and happiness of gods and humans

344
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:47,839
so this is a powerful statement i think where he's talking about this is what he discovered

345
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:53,280
i'm going to tell you what i discovered and you should take this in and learn this well

346
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:59,680
but not only for your own sake but for the welfare and happiness of others just going to be kind of a universal benefit

347
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:05,599
for the world what a wonderful thing to be dedicated to so here's going to tell you what he

348
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:10,720
discovered and what he says

349
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:15,839
are practices and he gives a list of practices that he discovered

350
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:21,440
so again practice is what's important for him so the list is the four foundations of

351
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:27,119
mindfulness the four right efforts the four roads are to power the five spiritual faculties the five mental

352
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:33,440
powers the seven factors of enlightenment and the noble eightfold path

353
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:39,440
so this is uh so that's quite a you know list but you know that what i wanted to emphasize here at the

354
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:45,760
end of his life he's emphasizing practice and you'll see he comes back to that again a little bit later as it goes

355
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:51,200
along here so he's going along walking north slowly

356
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:56,480
resting along the way and at some point he

357
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:03,280
is invited to meal by a local blacksmith who provides him with some

358
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:08,319
local food that we don't know exactly what it was there's a lot of you can't believe all the scholarship around

359
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:14,720
trying to figure out what food this is but it's either some kind of mushroom

360
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:20,880
it's called pigs the light so it's either the mushrooms that pigs like or it's some

361
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:26,839
pork dish but we don't you know we don't know but probably the most likely thing is some kind of

362
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:34,079
mushroom and uh that apparently is uh maybe maybe even poisonous or something

363
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:41,200
so um after having a meal with a blacksmith the buddha was attacked by a severe

364
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:46,480
sickness with bloody diarrhea and with sharp pains as if he were about

365
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:54,880
to die but he endured all this mindfully and clearly aware and without complaint

366
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:59,920
so again here we have you know sometimes we you know the image we have on the altar here of the buddha which is quite

367
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:05,520
common is you know the buddha is always well poised and healthy and young and

368
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:12,319
embodiment of the ideal and sometimes we kind of project this uh ideal spiritual

369
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:19,520
perfection to the buddha like him certainly he just kind of floated in a cloud and was easy and light and nice and comfortable

370
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:24,799
and you know all the way to his death but you know his description you know he

371
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:31,440
old his body creaking and held together with straps and he had a bad back and

372
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:37,280
somewhere else he described himself as hunched over you know we think it's upright and dignified but he himself

373
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:42,400
described himself as hunched over in his old age and uh

374
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:48,559
and uh so it's very human so you know it's kind of like the idea it's almost like we can feel ourselves see ourselves

375
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:54,880
in here and and the world's falling around his disciples are dying he's sick and old

376
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:59,920
and he and he's the he's the heavenly messenger for

377
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:07,839
peace he's calm he's mindful he's steady he has a practice he's still teaching he's still motivated

378
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:15,839
and he keeps walking known as pilgrimage going north and uh he keeps going

379
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:23,359
and uh and then at some point he crosses a river and comes to a salgrove saul groves the

380
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:30,000
salt trees are kind of majestic trees of northern india they're kind of like the redwood trees of india it's apparently

381
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:36,640
quite beautiful and tall and uh and he came to this grove

382
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:44,000
and he said prepare a bed between two psalteries

383
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:52,240
with my head to the north i saying one more time he's saying i'm tired and want to lie down

384
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:59,920
so they did and he lied down there placing one foot from the other and then he laid down mindful and clearly

385
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:06,319
aware it's always self-possessed it's always present in a nice way for what he's doing

386
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:11,599
and uh and then that's kind of like the last time he got he laid down he didn't think

387
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:17,440
he was there i don't know for a day or two and this the story goes and different people came to visit him and he had

388
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:23,839
final teachings for people and the very last person who came to the buddha asking questions wanting to be

389
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:29,200
taught came to the buddha and said you know there's lots of people lots of spiritual

390
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:36,319
teachers around all teaching the truth who's teaching the real truth how do we know what the real truth is

391
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:41,920
it's a reasonable question and uh and as he does other times people ask that

392
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:47,359
kind of point of question he doesn't answer it directly what he answers is

393
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:53,599
he says i'm not going to answer that but wherever the eightfold path is

394
01:03:53,599 --> 01:04:01,760
that's where you find people who become free so wherever there's the practice

395
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:06,799
this is what i'm interested in not truth is not so important what i'm interested is the practice

396
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:11,960
and here is pointing to the eightfold path is the practice

397
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:18,720
and so that's the last thing he said to his uh in terms of someone who came to him for for teaching

398
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:22,880
and then um he

399
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:30,960
he gathered his monks around him this monastic community and uh

400
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:37,440
asked them you know i'm about to die this is it and uh

401
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:42,880
and but you have any last questions this is your chance

402
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:49,039
and i think he asked them three times and no one had any questions for him which i think maybe it was very

403
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:56,000
satisfying right i mean he's he was very concerned about setting this leaving behind a legacy

404
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:01,119
of people who were enough people who had tasted the fruit of the dharma

405
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:07,920
both monastic and lay so that somehow the momentum could keep going and he was he had ascertained in

406
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:14,079
his own mind that in fact now in his old age there were enough people who had tasted the fruit of the practice

407
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:19,920
that he was not needed anymore and uh but he gave the monk still one

408
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:26,240
last chance to get clarify something and when none of them answered then he asked a question

409
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:31,039
then he said

410
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:41,119
now i'll tell you this all conditioned things are of a nature

411
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:47,119
to decay practice

412
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:55,039
tirelessly all things will pass all things will change disappear

413
01:05:55,039 --> 01:06:00,160
and then the last words you said was practice tired tirelessly

414
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:07,440
so again practice practice practice that's what he that's what he was most about keep practicing

415
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:15,200
and then we come to the very end then the buddha entered meditation

416
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:22,160
entered the first jhana leaving that he entered the second the third and the fourth

417
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:28,240
and leaving the fourth jhana he entered the sphere of infinite space then the sphere of infinite

418
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:34,960
consciousness and the sphere of nothingness in the sphere of neither perception or non-perception

419
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:41,440
and then into the cessation of feeling and perception it's kind of like

420
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:47,359
he's do this is this was his meditation life going through these states of meditation

421
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:53,440
and here just as he was dying he went on one last tour he could be visiting them one last

422
01:06:53,440 --> 01:07:00,640
pilgrimage going through these deep states of meditation and then um

423
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:07,039
and then we reach this very high state called cessation of feeling and perception ananda asked another monk named

424
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:13,280
anuruddha has the buddha passed away and anuroda who was a

425
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:18,720
highly skilled meditator himself could read or see

426
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:24,319
not yet and and so then the buddha

427
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:30,079
left the attainment of the cessation of feeling and perception enter it goes backwards through them enter the sphere

428
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:35,359
of neither perception or non-perception then into the sphere no no thingness the

429
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:41,680
sphere of infinite consciousness the sphere of finite space and then back to the fourth jhana the

430
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:48,720
third the second and the first so he's going up and down the ladder and then he goes up again

431
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:54,480
to the fourth jhana and the fourth jhana is

432
01:07:55,280 --> 01:08:01,599
considered to be the place where it's easiest to let go fully

433
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:07,359
either to let go into enlightenment or let go into passing away

434
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:12,480
so here's some person who so this is not a this is a he was

435
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:18,238
fully in a master of himself this last time last period of his life

436
01:08:18,239 --> 01:08:23,520
he wasn't he knew how to die he engaged in a practice that brought

437
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:31,600
him into a very wonderful space where the mind is very peaceful very equanimous very still

438
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:36,960
where it just in that state it just feels like the most wonderful

439
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:43,679
thing you can do is to just continue that process of letting go

440
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:49,679
to enter those deep states of meditation you have to do a lot of letting go to get there and things become very thin

441
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:54,880
there's very little left to hold on to and whatever is left to hold on to maybe

442
01:08:54,880 --> 01:09:00,560
the life force or something they just feel so good to let go of that

443
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:06,400
as well so rather than death being like this drag

444
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:12,318
remember he said earlier don't concern yourself of what's in the future don't concern yourself in the past

445
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:18,960
just practice and here he was practicing as he was dying

446
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:25,440
and it's a practice that involves a letting go that feels so healthy and so good like one of the best things it feels you can

447
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:30,560
do he was ready to die

448
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:36,318
he died an old sick man it was it was his time

449
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:43,199
and he died with one of the most wonderful things the most peaceful most wondrous most luminous thing you can do

450
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:48,798
that letting final letting go so uh

451
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:55,840
and then you know then he died so this is a story of a man old man

452
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:00,880
who had found his peace the world was falling around

453
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:08,159
falling apart around him the world that he knew and he was at peace anyway

454
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:14,640
he was calm he was wise he was caring for his the world around him

455
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:21,840
he stopped and talked to people and lots of people came to see him and he would continue to talk and teach

456
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:28,880
and he did the slow non-hurried walk some people think he was trying to walk back to his home country

457
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:34,000
and if that's the case um the world is falling around falling apart

458
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:41,040
and one form that was he he wasn't able to reach his home and uh you know going back to back to

459
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:47,760
his home country and he died in the kind of in the woods with his people around him

460
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:52,800
but uh you know nothing too ceremonious nothing too

461
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:57,840
nothing really special about the place in fact ananda kind of complained kind of like what are you doing dying here

462
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:04,159
this is like not a special place it's the middle of nowhere and uh

463
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:07,600
and uh so

464
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:16,239
so then the heavenly messenger the messenger of that it's possible to

465
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:23,199
live in this world with a profound peace and to die with a profound peace

466
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:28,239
and what a fantastically positive helpful message

467
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:33,920
it is possible to be in this world and find our peace to have pulled that

468
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:39,040
that's the story to pull out the arrow in the heart

469
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:45,840
the the metaphor of an arrow and a heart means that some of the deepest sufferings and wounds and that we carry

470
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:52,840
with us is something that's been it doesn't belong in there it's

471
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:59,760
external and it can be pulled out our suffering is not inherent

472
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:05,360
it's not innate like it's just there and it's always there and it has to always be there

473
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:11,520
it's in some ways a foreign object and so to practice

474
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:18,719
to pull that arrow out and when you do then you're at peace

475
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:26,320
so the buddha's life the buddha end of his life

476
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:32,080
and so we live in a time of change we live in time of strife

477
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:37,280
we live in a time where families are riven we don't have

478
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:44,719
sons yet i think you know killing their parents to take over the throne

479
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:50,000
but we have all kinds of challenges and i think for the message from the

480
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:55,760
buddha is yes this is what happens in this life

481
01:12:55,760 --> 01:13:02,640
don't let that distract you from your ability to practice

482
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:09,920
keep your confidence and your courage and your dedication

483
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:15,679
to practice no matter what in all this so that you can be a person

484
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:21,679
who is at peace with it not at peace you know kind of kind of a naive acceptance

485
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:27,760
of it but the kind of a peace where you're at peace so that you can make a difference in

486
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:35,920
this world so you could be a messenger for the happiness and welfare of this world you can be a peacemaker

487
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:42,960
in this world wherever you go to whatever degree that you can do this

488
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:50,320
maybe you can be a heavenly messenger you will be as i said but maybe you can be

489
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:57,120
the heavenly messenger that demonstrates peace and i knew i knew i knew one person i've

490
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:03,040
known a few people actually but one person particular who's uh probably

491
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:08,400
became the heavenly messenger when she was dying

492
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:15,199
and they're more so and if you practice then you can know that's when you need to practice you're

493
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:21,440
preparing to die and the other practice to support you

494
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:27,199
so take out take out your arrow and

495
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:33,840
then you can live unhurriedly peacefully in this life taking care of your life that you should live and what

496
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:39,520
you need to take care of like the buddha was taking care of everything before he died

497
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:45,440
don't die too soon but do practice

498
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:50,640
soon so thank you

499
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:56,400
