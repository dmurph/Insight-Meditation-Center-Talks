things and they happen in a different way sometimes

00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,180
causes and conditions they arise due to causes and conditions

47
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:07,380
not necessarily our intentions are our control so letting it go

48
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:15,379
and arriving in the body arriving the sensations of the body

nowhere to go nothing to do and to just be with this

58
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:39,680
the gift that has been given to us this opportunity

59
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:51,319
not taking it for granted not wasting but being fully present in this moment

62
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:16,040
letting pain breath and out breath be calming soothing collecting the light

63
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,200
electing

64
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:16,220
allowing the body to be relaxed and for the mind to know

65
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:24,600
the objects that come through the sphere of knowing

66
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:32,640
it's turned towards of all these objects what I mean is whatever you are knowing In This Moment

67
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:39,540

70
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:02,220
like Pleasant unpleasant to neither whatever it is being known now it clears

71
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,459

73
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:02,899
clear saying as they fear your mind

74
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,220
just turned on the lights or put on its glasses there is this sharpness this

75
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:15,260
Clarity of seeing not effortful

76
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:21,019
but bright relaxed and bright

77
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,220

know that you know we're shifting

85
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:06,000
turning The Stance of our knowing just a little bit from the object of knowing to

86
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,820

134
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:20,700
so as we've been exploring the five

135
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:29,520
Aggregates and today we have come to the last one vignana or consciousness

136
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:35,820
so God meditation for

137
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:42,779
um I I invited us first as a way and this is one way that we can practice

138
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:48,960
with tuning into this aspect of the five aggregates

139
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,779
first we tuned we turned towards the body the sensations of the body Rupa the

140
00:32:54,779 --> 00:33:01,260
first aggregate and of course I invited you if you wanted to open up to some other

141
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:07,860
Aggregates if the mind is stable enough it is possible to also open up to the same time this flow of experience not

142
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:13,740
just sensations of the body but but also weight in a feeling tone evolutional

143
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:19,559
formations thoughts maybe even perceptions how things are being perceived and known

144
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:26,340
foreign video again oh my what is going on I

145
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:32,159
think that's my internet um yeah I'm on ethernet so there is

146
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:37,380
nothing more I can do as long as the audio is okay if the audio goes let me

147
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:43,500
know but uh the video there's not nothing more I can do about it dear once

148
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:49,320
yeah it's probably my provider um

149
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:55,260
bummer hmm so I will continue hoping that it will

150
00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:02,220
adjust it so let's see if there's anything else I can do here hold on uh

151
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:07,860
uh let's see I'm going to um audio is okay my voice is clear okay

152
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:14,700
let's let's hope and trust that that is fine

153
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:21,780
um everything else I can do hold on I'm

154
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:27,240
gonna take a moment and see if there's anything else that

155
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:32,780
could be done here there

156
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:37,580
okay let's try that

157
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:43,679
see if that's better okay

158
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:50,099
all right it's still a little choppy but maybe better okay all right okay we're

159
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:55,919
just going to go with this now exactly more opportunities for practice

160
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:01,080
as Cynthia yeah okay all right

161
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:07,859
so where were we yes yes I was recounting what um one way that we can

162
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:14,640
practice with perhaps tuning more into awareness renyana Consciousness as we

163
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:20,520
start we can start by looking at an object that we're aware of so the mind

164
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:26,280
can become stable knowing an object that we are aware of in this case I invited

165
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:33,480
you today to to tune into um the breath the other uh uh and maybe

166
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:39,780
sounds and then and then after the mind is stable and really become turning on

167
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:46,380
the light remember this analogy that um the analogy of turning on the light

168
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:53,040
you know this grocking really brightening this really really brightening this sense of knowing

169
00:35:53,040 --> 00:36:01,260
knowing an object connecting with an object connecting with the sensations of the breath really brightened

170
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:07,440
so so and then so if this is knowing if my right hand is knowing

171
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,020
my light making the outfit brighter making

172
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:20,339
the object brighter so that or the knowing of the object and kind of happening together no no getting this

173
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:25,740
brighter and then we turn towards oh knowing that we know knowing that we

174
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:31,200
know we kind of turn awareness onto itself knowing that we know and then for

175
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,540
some it's it's uh if the mind is stable enough then you can rest in the sense of

176
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:42,900
awareness and then knowing that this stream of experience is being known and

177
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:50,820
then in the guided meditation we turn towards seeing impermanence impermanence of all these Aggregates arising and

178
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:57,540
passing again this is [Music] um five Aggregates are so rich so many

179
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:04,800
aspects and and this week primarily um we have spent time to tune to tune

180
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:11,280
into them um and of course and um they so so we have tried to kind of

181
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,859
tune into them to recognize them as these constituents of experience and to

182
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:23,760
say that that's usually the first step we want to tune into them and then we want to see that they are impermanent

183
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:30,300
that's really what's um so important about oh I just got a

184
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:36,060
note that my uh internet connection is unstable so it is my internet oh boy

185
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:41,099
yeah I see the videos topping I hope the audio is okay dear

186
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:46,200
once anyway I'll just continue to teach trusting that at least this will be

187
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:51,720
recorded and it will be available in Audio Dharma this part so here we go

188
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:56,820
um so it's it's also a very important part of this teaching after we have

189
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:04,859
tuned to these constituents of our experience to see their arising and passing to see

190
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:11,339
uh their impermanence and also to see how they dependently

191
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:18,720
arise how they're dependently arising how for example a perhaps evolutional

192
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:25,740
formation a thought arises from a perception from a particular perception which has given rise to say a pleasant

193
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:30,839
or unpleasant feeling tone and that brings a whole bunch of thoughts and

194
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:38,579
volitional formations so so so the um so seeing the dependent arising in our

195
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:47,520
experience these are all conditioned it's all conditioned none of this is fixed uh and and and to see the empty

196
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:54,540
nature of a phenomena and an empty now this word sunyata emptiness

197
00:38:54,540 --> 00:39:00,480
um I I preferred relational as a better translation of emptiness empty seems

198
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:07,859
kind of hollow and kind of dangerous and scary but sunyatta we get to see everything is relative everything is

199
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:15,180
relative is relational everything arises related to everything else so we see the

200
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:21,420
relationality and the relativity the relativity in in the sphere of our

201
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:27,540
experience in in in the way we experience the whole world through the five Aggregates this is such an

202
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:36,599
important teaching a couple of other things I want to say um one is that these five Aggregates

203
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:44,640
um are not things unto themselves they are processes they are processes that so

204
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,460
it's for example it's not just a vignan not as as a cognition or as

205
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:56,820
Consciousness but it's cognizing it's cognizing or it's perceiving it's this

206
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:04,380
process of perceiving that keeps happening that keeps um uh it's it's it's a flow of

207
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:12,660
experience it's it's a flow so so appreciating um tuning into that sense of flow

208
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:19,619
um a couple of other things one is that

209
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:26,720
um regarding this Consciousness or or cognizing and knowing

210
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:33,300
it tends to show up in different and different uh what's called in Buddhism

211
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:38,339
the The Sixth Sense stores the uh seeing

212
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:45,180
and and hearing and tasting and touching and and all the other aspects and

213
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:52,820
cognizing the the sixth uh door the sixth door uh being the Mind door so so

214
00:40:52,820 --> 00:41:00,540
vignana or cognizing can show up in all of these and it's it's uh it uh it's

215
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:05,940
there's a one Consciousness there's one Consciousness keeps moving shifting to

216
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:11,520
to these different aspects of of of perceiving our world

217
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:20,460
and and it is it in again as we practice as as I invited you to tune into

218
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:27,300
um both first object and then this this knowing this cognizing itself

219
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:34,440
um it can be quite interesting not that not to be so fixed on a particular object for example not to be fixed on

220
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:39,599
our thoughts but to the sense of openness of oh yes knowing just knowing

221
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:46,160
is happening knowing is happening it can bring a sense of uh freedom

222
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,480
and uh and especially um yes the one last thing I want to say

223
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:59,040
before give you I want to give a couple of references too um uh last thing I want to say is that

224
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:06,839
these five Aggregates again they're not separate they all happen together they're dependently Arisen so for

225
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:14,880
example cognizing and mental formations and and perception and feeling tone they

226
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,280
all happen together it feels like a cluster they're just yet you can see

227
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:26,579
them so they arise and and they're in a process of flow together but you can't tune to them to see them differently and

228
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:32,040
to see their impermanence and and their impersonal nature uh so a couple of

229
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:39,619
references I wanted to share with you one reference is um is for those of you who are

230
00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:45,780
psychologists there is an interesting paper the five aggregate model of the

231
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:52,920
Mind so you might uh you might oops I hope this comes through here we go so

232
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:58,619
it's it's uh five let's see if I can type this in real time they're five

233
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:04,800
aggregate yeah model

234
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,920
okay so here is the paper for you um it's an interesting paper that talks

235
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:17,280
about yeah the five accurate model of the mind and relating it to psychology and and

236
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:23,460
um might be of benefit to the non-psychologists as well and another

237
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:32,579
reference I also want to share and provide is to uh majima nikaya 28 to the

238
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:38,660
um uh in in the in um the this

239
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:45,800
Buddha talks about um it's a beautiful Satan the Buddha talks about the five Aggregates and

240
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:54,839
and um the you know how practicing with it really seeing the the conditionality

241
00:43:54,839 --> 00:44:00,240
um of all of them arising in the impermanence leads to Freedom oh yes one last thing one last important thing I

242
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:06,599
wanted to say ah one last thing I just remembered um so so I want to be sent the question

243
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:12,119
to me about the clinging aggregate so I wanted to to say that so the clean so

244
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:17,579
clinging Aggregates so so these five Aggregates are often also referred to as

245
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:25,079
clinging Aggregates and it's um so so it's because we cling to them

246
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:32,099
we cling to them we we take them to be me and mine um so all these five Aggregates they can

247
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:37,319
they are they can be clinging Aggregates but we don't have to cling to them so

248
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:42,839
when there is freedom when for the for the awakened mind and in the moments of

249
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:49,619
of Awakening and freedom there is no clinging to them there is no clinging to these Aggregates so so you might have

250
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:55,079
heard the clinging Aggregates that's what it is that can all be clinged we can be clinging to them or not clinging

251
00:44:55,079 --> 00:45:02,460
to them so clinging Aggregates or non-clinging Aggregates okay uh how do you spell that and majima nikaya it's

252
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:08,760
the middle length of discourses of the Buddha it's the it's that that book in

253
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:16,460
the corner that brown one it's the middle link discourses of the Buddha um so if you if you do a Google search for

254
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:23,099
mn28 it'll you know pull it up it's also it's a greater discourse on the simile

255
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:30,540
of the elephant's footprint so okay so it's been rich and there's so

256
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:36,540
much more I hope um your your interests in the five Aggregates and and practicing with them

257
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:42,900
has been kindled or rekindled this week and it's been such a delight be able to share and explore this with
