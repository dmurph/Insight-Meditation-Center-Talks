1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:09,139
so good morning everyone and um I'm very happy to be here with you all

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:16,020
and some of that happiness is being with all of you but some of it is um caring with me from my last three weeks thought

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:22,380
that I was at the tasahara's and Mountain Center

4
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:29,580
and uh it's uh probably the oldest Buddhist Monastery in the country

5
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,280
and when it started in 1967 it was kind of revolutionary because it was co-ed

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,820
which was a very very unusual to have men and women practicing together more or less as equals I think that

7
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:48,360
equality improved over there decades

8
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,538
and um the um

9
00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:00,360
and I trained there I began my training there and spent

10
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:06,060
about three years there and I started 43 years ago

11
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:12,720
in 1980 and um so I went back and really went back the

12
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,180
first time to be a zen teacher there more or less I've been back as a visitor

13
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:24,360
over these years but to go back into my original kind of Zen training Monastery

14
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,580
where I have some I was really formed in bit many ways in Buddhism in my training

15
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:36,600
at that monastery and to be back there not only to be back in the place and but to be back there

16
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,820
practicing and it was a it was a practice event for three weeks a practice period

17
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,100
and to be practicing there where you know these memories would come back well I was standing there when that happened

18
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:53,220
and that happened over here and and in the meditation Halls knowing these different spots that were so

19
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:58,380
significant for me when Ron visited them and bowed to them because oh yeah this is where I sat when this happened or

20
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:07,500
this and that was quite uh and um but I think one of the uh very

21
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,780
interesting at least for me occurrences of being there was to

22
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:19,739
realize how long I've been doing this Buddhist practice I've been involved now for 50 years

23
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:27,959
and um and that's long enough to have an overview of what happens to a

24
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:33,360
person doing Buddhist practice for 50 years not just what happens on one Retreat or

25
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:40,560
one meditation session but what happens over the decades in that decade in that decade and and it

26
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,280
felt kind of natural it's kind of spontaneous being there to kind of kind of have an overview of

27
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,220
this life that I've had in Buddhist practice and it might be interesting for to hear

28
00:02:53,220 --> 00:03:00,780
a little bit of it not so much because me but because to appreciate the way in which Buddhist

29
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:07,860
practice works on people because they're and the Highlight for me was not so much was about this is that

30
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:13,319
it works in ways that you don't see at the time that there's a way in which things

31
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:18,540
change gradually over years and then in retrospect you look

32
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:24,300
back and say oh yeah look at that I didn't I had no idea I thought I was doing X

33
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:29,519
but really the universe was doing why for me you know the Dharma the practice

34
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:36,360
was and why is wet flower not X I was distracted by my

35
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:43,019
what I thought was important in the moment what my plans were with my expectation what the agendas I have to

36
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:48,720
notice that something different was happening and I would say some of the profound ways that I've Been Changed by

37
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,360
the Dharma I didn't foresee I didn't see him coming

38
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,120
I didn't see them happening as they were happening they happen gradually and in retrospect

39
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,640
oh that's what happened so I wanted to that might be nice to me

40
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,860
to talk to you about this and I said part of this introduction also is to say that

41
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:16,639
um that the Dharma practice this Buddhist practice mindfulness practice

42
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:23,699
Works in three time frames it works in the immediate present

43
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:29,699
it works in the short term and it works in the long term it has ways in which it

44
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:36,120
unfolds and it's important to appreciate all three because if you only think it happens

45
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,180
over the long term you might mess up the long term because you're straining and

46
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:48,479
trying to working for some change that's going to happen in the Mythic future and you're missing the present

47
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:55,500
and if you're only seeing the benefits of the present you might not really allow yourself to

48
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:01,380
give yourself over fully to the practice so that the long-term benefits can

49
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:07,680
flower and develop over time to have some sense of the possibility of what this where we're going is also

50
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,740
important and so this combination of the cherishing and loving the practice in

51
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:20,180
the moment and valuing what happens and also evaluing what happens over time

52
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,560
the um and in the moment you know just as we're practicing it even sitting here

53
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:32,160
meditating with you it could feel sometimes at the moment of mindfulness it doesn't have to be more

54
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:39,240
than a moment is that when mindfulness is clear there's a kind of a lightening

55
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:45,060
up a kind of opening up a kind of calming or spaciousness I like to call

56
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:50,340
the breathing room certainly is a breathing room for this what's happening now

57
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:56,039
some people will talk a lot about mindfulness being kind of a pause and if

58
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:01,380
that's the case I like to think of it as a sacred pause and uh it's a pause that just long

59
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:08,100
enough to check in and feel no experience what's he what's the present moment

60
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:13,860
experience is like and uh and that that movement of

61
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:22,160
attention to the present moment that has some higher quality than ordinary distracted attention

62
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:29,520
is very different than most people live their lives we are many people are mostly distracted mostly running around

63
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,100
and um and uh my wife just told me she read a

64
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:40,620
newspaper article I think I said this morning or yesterday about why attendance and churches are

65
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:47,100
going down and uh and one reason many reasons I suppose but one is that among young

66
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:52,440
people is they're just so busy and uh so Sunday morning you're not

67
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:59,819
going to go to church on Sunday morning when you want to spend time finally with your friends because you've been working and overworking and doing all kinds of

68
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:08,520
things and so so this idea of of uh you know of taking taking time and I'm not to feel and

69
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:14,520
sense to stop to have a higher quality attention to what's happening in this moment

70
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:21,720
and they're discovering lo and behold it feels really good lo and behold it feels better than some

71
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:28,500
of the Alternatives and one of the Alternatives is to brush off and do things half-heartedly or distractedly or

72
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:36,840
one of the great things that's part of I think Modern Life is to do things efficiently

73
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:44,819
and uh and even better not only efficiently but do things multiple things at the same time efficiently

74
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:51,380
and just you know so you can do more and more and more things and one of the really big

75
00:07:51,380 --> 00:08:00,620
disappointments I have for you about mindfulness practice and Buddhist practice is that it is not efficient

76
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:10,460
and um so if that's what you're into upswept you this is probably not for you

77
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:19,440
and you know if it was efficient you would come to MC and say why are we sitting 35 minutes I can nail that

78
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,319
meditation in 10 minutes and then you go off and do the important

79
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:31,139
things and um so but they're really big and

80
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:37,339
appreciating something really precious and how in some ways the the

81
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:42,659
precious and wonderful experience of being alive even with the great

82
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:49,500
challenges of life even the tragedies of life there's something about really knowing how to be present for it in a

83
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:56,279
full way even present for a broken heart uh even present as we cried that there

84
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:03,000
is something that is invaluable and and kind of to be cherished or valued

85
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,080
and one of the ways to evaluate is to um is to realize

86
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:17,700
for yourself that just about all the alternatives to being really Mindful and present for

87
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:23,880
it go through life um it is not not a it's not

88
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,279
a better alternative than mindfulness if you know of a better alternative than

89
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:35,160
being mindful then probably to go ahead and do it did I say that with some confidence

90
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:41,640
because with time you realize this is the best alternative to really be here and present in a good

91
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:48,660
way and that the rewards of that can be instantaneous just right here it feels good and that's my hope for all of you

92
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:54,360
is that you will learn enough about mindfulness to feel the instantaneous

93
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,580
rewards the benefits of this is good I'm glad I had that moment to be present I

94
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:05,180
don't regret it as opposed to if I could have been on Amazon

95
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:14,339
and um so it so this practice works in the moment it also works in the short term

96
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:20,760
and some of you might have experienced this just in this meditation session we had that maybe you're a bit because you

97
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:27,720
sat there long enough maybe something settled in you maybe you're a little bit calmer maybe your mind slow down

98
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:34,440
maybe it took a while for the business of the mind to stop and quite I don't know so you can feel connected here and

99
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:40,740
feel like you're showing up here it could be that you carried a lot of attention with you that you didn't even

100
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:46,380
know stress of the week or the day and this was long enough to let that be

101
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:51,839
dissipate partly because not because necessarily you were brilliant at being mindful

102
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,000
uh but he just stopped you stopped running around stop checking your

103
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,820
devices stop kind of you know and just being still for a while there is a kind of progression of

104
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:08,899
Letting Go and relaxing that is invaluable for people and if you add to that recipe

105
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:15,540
mindfulness attention concentration compassion kindness there's all kinds of wonderful things

106
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:23,100
that can happen in in a period of meditation or it can happen in over a week of regular practice or going on our

107
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,860
meditation Retreats that's remarkable that most people who go on a week-long

108
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:36,120
retreat will see it as a journey this is it unfolds over time and not a few people want to leave after

109
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:42,000
the first day if we advertised what the which we was about based on what happens the first

110
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,360
day no one would come and uh the uh but it's a little bit like

111
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:56,220
you know when I when I had a running practice that I started up at the monastery and it was um the the police

112
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:01,980
who ride run was up this Five Mile Road eventually I got it to the top but we

113
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,820
just slowly over the long time kind of get better and better but I remember

114
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,360
I would start up the road and probably the first 300 yards it felt

115
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:24,180
like every cell in my body was screaming at me stop I hated it it was horrible

116
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:31,260
and um and then I um something kicked in and they got into the flow and after a

117
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:36,959
while it felt like you know after I did for a while trained for a while it just felt like it was just that light to run

118
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:44,339
and and kind of like the body ran itself and until I you know got winded or something but it was really nice so a

119
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:51,360
little bit like that happens on Retreats too that there's a transition acclimating getting attuned letting go

120
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,420
of the tensions of our life having to resolve some of being surprised by all the unresolved issues in our life that

121
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:03,540
suddenly appear that you've been overlooking or distracted from and having to work through them so the

122
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:10,639
transitions at first aid is really invaluable and important thing to go through

123
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:16,380
um and um and uh but it's often challenging for people and then things

124
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:21,720
settle down sometimes and

125
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,760
I don't want to make any promises and they settle down and usually by at

126
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:32,339
some point people feel so happy to be present and

127
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:38,220
alive and calm and there's a Clarity of vision people start to go outside we're

128
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:45,720
lovely to watch people go outside of the retreat center to be outdoors in the in the property after about day four and

129
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:52,980
they're just like marveling at the trees and the flowers and I'm just kind of just sitting having

130
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:58,920
a tea as if the cup of tea is there long lost friend they're so happy to see and

131
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:04,920
be with and they're they're just really there for that cup it sounds maybe a little silly to live

132
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:10,620
that way but it's just such a you know to have that level of calmness and that

133
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:17,579
level of presence and that level of undistractedness and that level of non-compulsion that we often live with

134
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:22,680
is phenomenal so this trend you know it takes some days and the sometimes the

135
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:28,200
longer the retreat the deeper the process goes the Fuller this transformation can happen

136
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,959
so there's there's this change that happens over time and on Retreats for example in a daily

137
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:39,060
meditation practice you might do there is a kind of change that happens in over

138
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:46,139
a day or over a particular session over a week or something but often some of the most obvious

139
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:51,240
benefits from that disappear once you get to work once you start up once you

140
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:58,860
get back to your usual life and sometimes it disappears in a few minutes sometimes in a few days but it and but

141
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:06,000
there's also the changes that happen there enduring but that those are tend to be incremental over time

142
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,139
and often they're so incremental we don't see them and the analogy that I've used

143
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:21,360
sometimes is that uh when I lived in Hawaii for two years when I first got there uh it'd be a nice

144
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,300
sunny day like no clouds in the sky and you know you wear t-shirts and shorts you know and and you certainly don't go

145
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:33,480
around with an umbrella there because it's sunny warm hot and then they would suddenly out of

146
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,760
nowhere there'd be this torrential downpour and so I did what

147
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:44,459
everywhere else I lived in the world you do is you Run for Cover

148
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:50,760
and I very quickly learned you don't have to do that in Hawaii you just let yourself get drenched

149
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:55,399
and then five minutes later you're all dried out again

150
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:03,540
Sons come out again and and um and so the drenching doesn't last very long

151
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:11,160
where I was born in Norway and the town is called Bergen it's surrounded by mountains on three

152
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,620
sides in the ocean on the fourth and the saying there this it rains 360 days of

153
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:23,220
the year and the other five days it's cloudy it isn't quite as bad as that but the

154
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:28,620
the local newspaper used to have on the front page a tally of how many sunny

155
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:34,620
days there's been every year every day of the year so you you're adding up over the course of the year started zero on

156
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,839
January 1st and so anyway so there there was a lot

157
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:45,360
of all kinds of rain but there was often a Misty Rain that you know light Mr rain

158
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,399
and I would walk through the town and and I wouldn't it was so light that you

159
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:58,320
didn't really feel you're getting wet at first but if you're walking far enough uh got totally soaked and drenched and

160
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:05,459
because it was cold it would be really cold so it snuck up on you so a little bit just to stretch you know

161
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:11,640
a little bit if you're generous to the analogies um the uh going on a week-long retreat

162
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:17,640
is like getting drenched and then um and then you know it dries out kind

163
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:24,720
of quickly but if you meditate every day or if you go on Retreats often or if you

164
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,360
live in a monastery and you're practicing kind of all the time it's a little bit like being in the fog or in

165
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:38,580
the mist and you're slowly getting wet and um and uh but you don't get cold and

166
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:45,600
you get your heart just warms more and more as you get this kind of Dharma Dharma Mist coming soaking it soaking up

167
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:52,400
and um and slowly something begins happening but you don't see it happening

168
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:58,320
and um and so over years over decades that I can speak now it's kind of

169
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:04,320
remarkable I can speak about decades it's kind of snuck up on me

170
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,980
and that I can see there there have been phases and changes that happen over you

171
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:16,980
know big chunks of time and um and it speaks to a little bit the

172
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:23,460
natural process of change that you put together the right conditions that there's something that begins happening

173
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:30,539
within that's kind of natural because I wasn't trying to do this or attempting to do these kinds of changes somehow the

174
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:36,419
psychophysical system that we are has capacities for changing in beneficial

175
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:43,620
ways growing in certain ways that sometimes we don't realize our society hasn't taught us that this

176
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:49,020
is a possibility perhaps so I want to share with you uh three

177
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:55,980
phases over this time that were very significant for me and the first phase was when I first

178
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:04,740
came to Zen practice kind of the Zen practice phase and that was new to practice then and as

179
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:11,039
is true for many people I came to the practice because I suffered and um

180
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:17,160
and I thought that's you know but I tried different things and I didn't know anything else to do for my suffering but

181
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:22,620
to try to you know I'd been introduced to Zen practice a little bit and I said okay this this is kind of what I thought

182
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:28,919
would maybe make a difference for me and in fact when I sat meditated and did

183
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:35,820
Retreats at the Zen Center that's one of the things that came to the Forefront was my suffering and some of the deeper

184
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:43,740
uh ways in which my mind my heart worked that accentuated or was the cause the

185
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:50,419
operating principles for my suffering so for example I had a lot of

186
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:58,200
self-criticism I had a lot of guilt I mean not just necessarily had done anything wrong I just be guilt I would

187
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:04,559
literally was I felt guilty how I walked across the meditation hall floor I was probably walking across the floor

188
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:11,460
the wrong way you know just so anything you know as I was doing it the wrong way and I was somehow inherently

189
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:17,640
wrong it was kind of a big burden and the fear of rejection and all my fears that I had

190
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:25,140
and so I would sit and meditate and these would part of the benefit and the horror of practice is you get to see

191
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:31,919
your mind well wow like look at that this is bad you know I had no idea

192
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:39,840
and uh but it's really good to see it because then we can take an honest assessment we can take an we can see it

193
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:46,440
clearly enough that we don't give into it we learn to find Alternatives we learn to heal it

194
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,960
and um so for me I I said so I because in Zen practice they get very little

195
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:59,220
instruction except sit sit still and be still and don't move

196
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:05,460
and just be with whatever's happening so that and so there was no they didn't tell me what to do about the suffering

197
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:12,780
except I I what I understood just be with it so I did add a little extra instructions to myself and that was to

198
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:20,100
unconditionally accept whatever was happening so I was practicing unconditional acceptance not of the suffering but of

199
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:26,640
being present for it just just being within being with it and that was a tenderizing process kind of like

200
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:33,539
tenderizing meat something began to soften in me and soften than me and I didn't see it happening I didn't

201
00:21:33,539 --> 00:21:39,120
recognize it as happening but and some of it when it began happening I was

202
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:45,240
projecting what my needs were into the world and the need I have in the contact with

203
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:53,820
my suffering this tenderizing of what's Happening was compassion and and I started first being very

204
00:21:53,820 --> 00:22:00,240
strongly drawn to images of compassion and one and some of them was the images

205
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:07,020
of the the Mahayana the Japanese images of the great bodhisattva the archetype

206
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:14,220
of compassion abulakateshvara and um and I started collecting

207
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:20,580
photographs and pictures of Kuan yin and putting it on my wall I started drawing

208
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:25,919
copies of them and I just thought it was a nice thing to do to have these I didn't think about what I was doing I

209
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:34,440
didn't think of wow you're really connecting collecting all these pictures of compassion and then I would Project Compassion onto

210
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,679
people that I saw and sometimes I would say well that person is so compassionate

211
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,960
and people would look at me you got to be kidding

212
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:52,080
but uh but for me they were it was you know and I know some of it was projection because at the Zen Center

213
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,299
they had a statue that for many years I didn't know what

214
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:04,500
that what the name this title of the statue was the artwork it was about five feet tall and you'd see it when you came

215
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,900
up in the meditation in the basement it would be you come up the steps and be directly in front of me back then

216
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:16,860
directly on top of the steps right in front of you you have to walk towards it and um it was kind of so I said are we

217
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:21,900
and it looked a little bit like a very a very abstract kind of person by the size

218
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:28,500
of a person and maybe kind of the narrowness of a person going up and and it was very very sin that's sensuous

219
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:37,740
but very flowing beautiful flowing almost like it had robes that were flowing and I thought that it was uh this this

220
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:42,840
archetype of compassion condom and I just would come up from meditation

221
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:48,000
it'd be so moved to see her standing there receiving me

222
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:55,700
many years later I found out that the artist thought he was carving a flame

223
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:02,340
and as a title The Flame fire and uh

224
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:08,280
and uh so you know I guess it was a projection that I had and so and also I

225
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:14,280
would feel that the wind is sometimes blowing against my cheek I was being stroked by compassion

226
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:19,520
probably was a projection you know so I was looking for needing to receive

227
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:26,460
compassion in all kinds of ways and I did I did encounter compassionate people at the Zen Center who in times of my

228
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:32,820
distress it was so impressed me and uh I mean so there's such a big difference on me to feel and be with

229
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:39,200
them and So eventually looking back over my time at Zen Center I saw that

230
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,460
I didn't become enlightened I became compassioned

231
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:51,059
and uh and my sense of my capacity for compassion grew and grew steadily until

232
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:56,520
near the end of my time at Zen Center I made a commitment about I was part of

233
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:02,880
the being ordained as a priest there's a monk there that I was going to dedicate my life to

234
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:09,360
the compassionate service to the world to the suffering of the world I wanted to somehow I'd met my own suffering and

235
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:15,960
now I wanted to meet and support others the world to not suffer so the compassion became like the

236
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:23,100
operating principle for how I was going to organize my life and live my life and that's kind of what brought me here you

237
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:28,860
know to IMC to you today that that momentum of that choice to live from

238
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:34,679
compassion and you know that was huge so after my phase at the San Francisco

239
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:41,100
Zen Center I found myself somewhat by coincidence by

240
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:46,820
bye not exactly by plan

241
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:52,620
in them in a monastery that taught to be passana inside meditation in Thailand

242
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:58,260
and that opened the door for me to continue with that this practice that we do here

243
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:04,620
and um and I was pretty happy doing the practice and I did the practice in Asia

244
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:10,080
first and then I came back to do here and I

245
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,900
did it at the Insight Meditation Society in in Massachusetts kind of the earliest

246
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:21,200
big Center in our tradition and I did a three-month Retreat there

247
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:28,020
and I was kind of shocked or stunned when I got there to practice the first

248
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:34,380
time with with the Western sightings with just Western teachers because and it's part of my surprise

249
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:42,059
because I came from Zen which is serious and just direct pointing to emptiness

250
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:48,020
the truth and you know and being kind of disciplined and stoic and you're like you know

251
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:54,240
you know you're supposed to go and in fact when I practice said I I had

252
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:01,440
an up up I would sit there I have this this classic I wasn't trying to do it but maybe because the attitude that that

253
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,480
comes along this upside down smile

254
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:13,919
so then I came to to you know this this what this the personality inside

255
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:20,640
teachers in Massachusetts and they did a surprising thing they did a guided meditation on loving

256
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,860
kindness oh my God I mean for a Zen student like at least

257
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:33,900
for this one it was like that's artificial that's too saccharine and you know this

258
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:39,419
can't be real and so so I did the reasonable thing I thought I just tuned

259
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:46,460
the teachers out when they were doing this guy's meditation and that worked pretty well for me

260
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,980
until because three months is a long time about halfway through the retreat I

261
00:27:52,980 --> 00:28:00,299
was just minding my own business meditating and lo and behold this very strange odd

262
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:07,020
feeling arose inside of me this I don't know about this

263
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:14,460
and it wasn't you know this is what they're talking about when they do this guided meditations this is love this is

264
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:20,460
loving kindness this is this beautiful feeling of Goodwill that is very different than the feeling

265
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:25,559
of compassion and oh that's what it is so then when

266
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:31,799
they did a guided meditation oh this is great and now I think it's fantastic to do it

267
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:38,520
and um and so I wasn't looking for loving kindness I didn't even want it I was maybe holding it at a distance

268
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:43,620
and it found me and why was that what is it about to be

269
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:50,279
part for a long time I thought it was because of a personal practice is somehow different but I think I now lately I think it's

270
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:56,159
because I'd gone through my phase of working with my suffering when I needed compassion

271
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:01,200
by the time I came to the opossum I was ready for a new phase in the phase for

272
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,919
me was a phase of a lot of well-being I had a lot of joy and well-being and

273
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:14,100
happiness peace in doing vipassana and not initially but as I went deeper and

274
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:19,620
deeper into it in a way that I never had in Zen I had degrees of it in times of

275
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:25,020
it but with vipassanide was extended periods of great feelings of joy and

276
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:31,020
delight and and uh you know and um and so one of the

277
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:37,440
byproducts of spending a lot of time feeling really happy and delighted in this practice

278
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:44,279
is um I think is delighting into people feeling kind of happy in people and

279
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:51,240
seeing the beauty of people or seeing the pressuredness of others and and in that kind of so not not viewing

280
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:57,000
people through the lens of through the lens of suffering and they're suffering but viewing people through the lens of

281
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,140
their of how wonderful people are and and how and feeling friendly and feeling

282
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:11,159
appreciative and feeling grateful and feeling a tremendous Goodwill for others

283
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:16,799
and so at that phase so so so then there was a whole phase where that was kind of

284
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:22,200
a character of kind of of kind of what motivated him and where

285
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:29,039
I found myself when I just love this idea of Goodwill and loved people and delighted in them and and felt you know

286
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:34,940
felt all this French friendliness or something that grew and developed and

287
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:43,260
and some of that is because of having this community here at IMC for the last 30 years or so that the opportunity to

288
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:49,559
get to know people here and know them in a in a nice way I just had this was so

289
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:56,880
many opportunities to just be so appreciative and grateful and and kind of see the beauty of people that I kept

290
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:03,299
kind of feeding this kind of Goodwill feeling that was growing in me and I wasn't trying to do it but it slowly

291
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:08,460
grew and grew and grew it was kind of wonderful to see it grow and develop

292
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:15,960
well let me look back and see how it developed so that was nice and then something different happened

293
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:22,140
and this is kind of the phase maybe that I'm in now or maybe I'm due to have this one end

294
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:27,299
and something new will happen I don't know the the spans of great spans of time

295
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:33,779
and that was that I started feeling something different and I still called it compassion

296
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:39,899
but it had a very different feeling than before and it started to have this enlighteness

297
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:46,740
and a sense of ease there's just in fact a sense of ease and lightness and and

298
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:53,039
peacefulness around this feeling of compassion um it could cause some problems for me

299
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:59,159
because I thought compassion was supposed to be a kind of empathic pain

300
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:05,039
with the suffering of others and uh and I felt like well I didn't

301
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:10,860
feel that I felt I I felt people's pain I was cared for it I was concerned for

302
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:17,100
it but I found myself feeling kind of at ease in the presence of it

303
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:24,720
and am I allowed to feel this at ease when people are suffering people come and tell me tragedies and I feel ease is

304
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,760
that okay am I shouldn't I be kind of distressed

305
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:35,340
and uh and then with the social justice movements that have kind of the occurred

306
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:40,559
the last 20 years or so the trends in that movement uh there was

307
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:47,520
kind of an expectation of uh there's you should be angry or and the climate change you should be

308
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:54,299
distressed you should be upset and and I certainly cared about all these things but I just couldn't find

309
00:32:54,299 --> 00:33:00,000
myself getting angry or being distressed about all this

310
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,399
um because of this place of kind of this lightness was kind of it wasn't like a

311
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:12,600
choice it was like why would I give it up why would I be in a good state

312
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,640
that feels healthy and whatever why would I give it up for something that

313
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:25,380
feels kind of a little bit like having a wound wounding myself or yeah wanting myself to do it

314
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:30,779
even though there may be there was an expectation or I had some idea that was supposed to be different

315
00:33:30,779 --> 00:33:37,740
and so it was actually it wasn't so conscious that I was struggling with this but in retrospect I saw that I was

316
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:43,919
constantly kind of up against this and working this and and kind of trying to navigate this Territory between this

317
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:50,279
ease and lightness and peacefulness that I found inside and how that was supposed

318
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:55,799
to be in the interactions with the people and suffering and the Injustice

319
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:01,980
that we find around us in our society and um and then what kind of finally

320
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:09,060
clarified for me what I was doing was I was reading the teachings ancient teachings of the Buddha and I discovered

321
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:15,358
there that that um there's discussion about karuna which is

322
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:22,260
compassion but there's a whole other kind of emotion or attitude or motivation that has gotten very little

323
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:28,378
press in the West that is actually more important for the Buddha's way in which he cared for the

324
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:35,878
world taught the world and that is the term Anu kampa and an accompa in some ways is a more

325
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:41,419
humble or simpler or more basic ordinary

326
00:34:41,419 --> 00:34:46,800
caregiving instinct to caregiving attitude that clearly in the ancient

327
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,280
texts is like how parents care for their kids so

328
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:57,359
teachers care for their students uh

329
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:03,000
people who care for children have this under comfort for the their kids in

330
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,420
their care so anacampa was the ordinary just offering care to people caring for

331
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:16,380
people but this was the common way that Buddha operated in the world was through this under kampa

332
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:22,320
and it's defined as a wanting working for the welfare and happiness of others

333
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:29,660
not not working to and alleviate suffering for others but the welfare and happiness I understand that that's that

334
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:35,339
compassion is a subset of that when they're suffering we want to bring

335
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:41,520
that suffering to an end but a wider scope of care includes also for people

336
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:47,400
who aren't suffering want them to be well and happy but more important what I saw when I

337
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,560
started reading about this that this was a common way in which people had

338
00:35:52,560 --> 00:36:00,180
beginning letting go of her clinging letting go of their attachments operating the world in the ancient texts

339
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:06,839
they operated from this anukampa this care and it was an expression of their

340
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:12,660
non-clinging and I said oh I'm no longer centered on

341
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:19,160
compassion I thought it was but now I have this other thing called care

342
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:27,240
anacampa because now I'm I'm constantly being informed by or Guided by the

343
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:34,079
experience of non-clinging the experience of non-attachment this is such an important reference point for me

344
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:40,200
and it's so clear that I'm better off not clinging better off not being attached

345
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:46,619
than I am being attached and why would I give up the non-attachment when attachment is a

346
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:53,220
wound is a form of harm to myself and maybe sometimes a harm to the world

347
00:36:53,220 --> 00:37:00,060
so so I've come to really appreciate this kind of new phase of how to be in

348
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:06,540
the world and care for the world to care for the world with care with this you know character you know

349
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:12,960
supported by this non-clinging aspect and that also kind of uh you know

350
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:19,800
evolved slowly over time I didn't see it coming I didn't plan it it wasn't what I was expecting at all

351
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:27,560
so first I was compassioned then I was loving kinded

352
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:33,240
and now I've been cared so that was a you know so you know

353
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:39,480
there's all kinds of other things you could say I can I can report about these many years of change but those kind of

354
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:44,520
Stand Out stood out to me at the Sahara as I was kind of thinking about and

355
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:50,520
reviewing my life and how all in these 40 50 years in which I've been involved

356
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:56,640
in Buddhism and the practice so I hope that this gives you some

357
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:03,540
encouragement that how this practice can work for you

358
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:10,800
and one of the more some of the profound ways you don't measure the results by the moment or the week or

359
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,020
the month you don't feel like a kid in the back of the car says are we there yet

360
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:22,440
rather just just do the practice and in what we what I learned in Zen if you do

361
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:28,440
the practice then at some point the practice does you

362
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:34,740
and you and then you need to be available for the practice to do you the practice to practice you it isn't just

363
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:41,579
you doing it because it was only you doing it that wouldn't be enough you have to also get out of the way

364
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:47,820
and be available for something deeper in your heart in your inner life to kind of

365
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:56,220
begin working on you so I hope that was encouraging and that

366
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:02,820
for me it was been a spectacularly wonderful way of of living a life I'm very grateful for

367
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:09,480
the opportunity and I'm grateful to be here with you and to share it thank you

368
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:17,400
and be lovely to see all of you or some of you at the park

369
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,800
that's about probably about seven minutes away from here by car and um

370
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,740
the red Morton Park and there's a there's a small parking lot and a big parking lot at the park

371
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:34,200
and um and that big one I think is on Roosevelt

372
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:39,420
Rosa off Roosevelt which and so um you probably want to park

373
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:45,140
there so um thank you all
