1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:06,000
well good evening everyone welcome to

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:13,160
IMC Diana is not here this week so

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:20,119
she sent me a email on Saturday asking if I would give a talk

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:28,039
tonight I looked at my calendar book I have a paper book that I use to U keep

5
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:34,120
my appointments in and I noticed today is actually it had three sort of

6
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:40,879
holidays printed on it uh the first one is Columbus Day

7
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:49,600
it's um marking the day that Christopher Columbus um found that indeed the edge

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,000
of the Earth wasn't somewhere out in the Atlantic Ocean but there was two

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,199
continents on the other side of the ocean which the Europeans didn't know

10
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:07,520
about um another day of today is

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:16,360
celebrating is indigenous people's day so something like somewhere between 14

12
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:26,039
and 25,000 years before Columbus people came to the uh North and South American

13
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:33,079
continent spread throughout it created um cities

14
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:39,680
cultures um and

15
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:46,439
uh so that's being celebrated today that that these people who had been here for

16
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:54,240
tens of thousands of years and then the other holiday today is Canadian

17
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,399
Thanksgiving so I thought I would talk about Canadian Thanksgiving I

18
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,640
was aware of it because I have several friends who are Canadian you know so

19
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,760
they um have had parties and um I've enjoyed

20
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,879
that um Canadian Thanksgiving I the the first

21
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:25,920
recorded one was like in 1579 so quite before Canada existed or

22
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:35,519
the United States existed and it was related to the Harvest festivals of France and

23
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:44,239
England so this idea of giving thanks for the Bounty of the Harvest each year

24
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:51,120
uh goes back a long ways I'm sure it goes back well before the

25
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:59,400
Europeans this notion of uh giving thanks uh for what we get what we

26
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,319
receive what what sustains

27
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,400
us I don't think the Buddhists have one particular day that they call

28
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,319
Thanksgiving Day

29
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:29,040
um so I started to think well what does what does Thanksgiving have to do with

30
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:36,640
Buddhism what what's the connection

31
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:45,080
and what came to me as I was uh contemplating This

32
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:53,319
was um that the practices that the Buddha taught the path that the Buddha um

33
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:59,040
pointed to is a path of Peace and

34
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,599
Freedom and primarily it's a path of inner peace

35
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:14,480
and inner freedom and the freedom is to be free

36
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,680
from greed delusion and hatred those

37
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,440
three uh forces you might say three habits of

38
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:33,479
mind that um we seem to be susceptible to as human

39
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:41,560
beings can keep us from having a sense of

40
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:48,280
Peace So it's important to be able to look at

41
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,680
what what Su what keeps us what keeps

42
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,560
greed delusion and hatred going and so how do we how do we um

43
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,960
work with them so that was one of the thoughts

44
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:14,080
that came to me was how how does Thanksgiving relate to becoming

45
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,000
free and then the other one uh so

46
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:27,240
peace what keeps us from being peaceful is

47
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:34,120
conflict and you might think of the conflict as being outer conflict conflict with other

48
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:40,400
people or groups of people

49
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,319
um governments societies

50
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:52,520
um conflict with reality um but also there's inner

51
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,680
conflict right I mean there's we have different

52
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,880
impulses um desire Ires uh

53
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:11,759
beliefs habits and they don't always align with each other so there can be inner

54
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,520
conflict uh yesterday there was a class on the eight-fold path which is a

55
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:31,240
description of what the Buddha taught the path that he taught um

56
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:39,880
um and it occurred to me as as I was in that that one of the parts of the eight-fold

57
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:45,599
path is about right action and in that

58
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:51,400
is a willingness to be honest to be

59
00:06:51,400 --> 00:07:00,120
truthful so if you want to address conflict both inner and outer

60
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,280
it's important that you're honest right you know that you that you're honest at

61
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:15,440
least at least with yourself but also with others as to how you see

62
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:23,199
things um you know without honesty um it seems pretty unlikely that

63
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:30,199
you're going to be able to resolve any kind of conflict um

64
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:37,479
you know and even internally you know you need to be honest

65
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:42,639
with uh what's going on with you what's going

66
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:50,199
on inside the thoughts the uh physical Sensations the

67
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,240
emotions and if you want to be free from greed delusion and

68
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:05,639
hatred um this honesty is also required you know you need to be honest about

69
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:11,680
what is it that you're trying to get and how can you get it and how can

70
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,360
you get more of it or what is it that you hate and what are you trying to push

71
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:25,000
away or with delusion what what are you deluded about what

72
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,479
what is it that you're not seeing clearly

73
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:39,440
so I think at the the one of the the really important parts of this

74
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,040
path is a willingness to be

75
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:53,720
honest to be honest with yourself to be honest with others to see things clearly

76
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,720
as clearly as you can

77
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,680
and so I think that's what brings me

78
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:15,440
to uh Thanksgiving that if you're really

79
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:22,680
honest that if I'm really honest with myself about what supports me in this

80
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,640
life um how did I get

81
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,360
here that

82
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:40,600
the notion that I'm a self-made man that I've got here strictly through

83
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,040
my own efforts strictly through my own uh

84
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:51,720
doing isn't really the

85
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,720
truth the truth is there's many people that have supported me throughout my

86
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,720
life

87
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:11,120
and so I thought that I would talk a little bit

88
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:21,600
about the people that supported me and the the thankfulness that I feel for

89
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:31,240
them and I have to admit right away when I as a child when I was first growing up

90
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:37,680
I don't think thankfulness was really on my radar at

91
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,720
all thankfulness was something that my parents told me that I had to

92
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:51,320
express I had to thank my aunt for that dress shirt that was Itchy and Scratchy

93
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,360
and uh I didn't you know I'd much rather have a t-shirt than this dress shirt

94
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:03,200
that she gave me but I was told no no no you you need to be thankful you you have you have to

95
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,480
thank you know thank Aunt Betty thank thank grandpa thank

96
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:17,519
Grandma um so it wasn't you know it didn't come to me uh naturally to to

97
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:24,600
want to to thank or or feel grateful

98
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:30,680
um mostly what I noticed was what I didn't get

99
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,880
uh in the mid-50s my grandparents were I think the first people that I knew that

100
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,320
to have a color television that was a big deal back in the the

101
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:50,399
mid-50s and so every Sunday night we'd go to their house and they we would watch the wonderful world of Disney

102
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,279
followed by bonanza in

103
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,079
color and I really really wanted to go to Disneyland I mean it just you know

104
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:07,200
watching it on the television and it just looked like it was so much

105
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,399
fun and I would plead with my parents you know can't we go can't we go well we

106
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:19,040
lived about so several thousand miles away from Disneyland so going there

107
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,920
wasn't just a day trip I mean it would have been you know quite

108
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:32,240
a you know quite inexpensive and uh arduous

109
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:43,800
Journey but that's what I remembered you know like I remembered what I didn't get I didn't get to go to

110
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,959
Disneyland

111
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,279
um and the other thing was at the end of Sunday night when Bonanza was over that

112
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:03,360
meant going home going to bed and facing a whole week of school so that was like

113
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:11,279
the end of ananza meant the end of the weekend and going back to school and

114
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,800
uh which I was at best sort of um neutral

115
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:28,199
about as I got older um

116
00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:36,160
it began to dawn on me all of the ways in which my parents had supported me that I

117
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,800
didn't didn't really recognize or uh

118
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:49,320
acknowledge uh growing up they made sure that I I was in school

119
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:56,199
I I started at the age of three and ended coming out of graduate school at

120
00:13:56,199 --> 00:14:03,959
age 29 so I got a lot of Education and the first part I'd say

121
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:10,920
wasn't so interesting to me um but they made sure that I went

122
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:18,040
they made sure I you know did my homework and then uh by high

123
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,160
school I think it became more interesting to

124
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:30,880
me so they took they took care of making sure that I got an academic

125
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,720
education uh they also took me to church I don't go to that church anymore

126
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:43,440
but um I think two things that I remember

127
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,839
about that number one is there was teaching of Ethics you know that you

128
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,959
know the basic Ten Commandments that should not kill and steal

129
00:14:55,959 --> 00:15:02,639
lie and so I think even though I really didn't like going to

130
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:09,160
church that was not that was not fun um again with the stiff dress shirts and

131
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,199
everything else but

132
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:21,160
um but it taught me ethics you know

133
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:27,079
non-harming being um

134
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:35,199
you know living a life that didn't involve

135
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:42,000
um any kind of antisocial

136
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,800
behavior um the church we went to there was you know no drinking or any anything

137
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,120
like

138
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:59,279
that which I clearly ignored once I turned 18 but um

139
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:04,839
um but I think it it it it really gave me a a solid

140
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:12,240
basis uh in ethics the church also taught about

141
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:20,399
love and in a different way than I would get

142
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:27,839
through watching television or movies you know like you watch television and movies love love is about romance right

143
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:34,879
it's about two people you know kind of getting

144
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:42,600
uh into some you know state of

145
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:49,880
infatuation but the church also taught me about loving each other you know more

146
00:16:49,880 --> 00:17:00,040
than just loving one other person but love is a important part of being a human being

147
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:09,079
so I'm I'm thankful for my parents for having sent me to school getting an

148
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:14,839
education um getting a

149
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:20,558
spiritual uh education

150
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:30,319
um you know providing food clothing shelter

151
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,360
uh Medical Care

152
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:46,640
um so I think it it took decades before I could really feel the the gratitude

153
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,440
for my parents for how they they raised me you know to to forget about the

154
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:58,360
things that I wanted that I didn't get and just recognize all of the things

155
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,840
that I did

156
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:14,240
get I'm also thankful for my grandparents my extended

157
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:22,679
family and then going forward from that the um the teachers that I

158
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:25,679
had

159
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,600
um I've often heard stories of of people that had teachers that were you know

160
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,159
strict disciplinarians and you know kind of wrap people on the knuckles with

161
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:47,240
rulers and things like that for the most part my teachers were much more

162
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,039
um uh I'd say kind or

163
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:59,679
skillful in providing discipline particularly when I got to

164
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:05,360
high school um I had science teachers that

165
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,240
got me interested in science they were not only provided you know talked

166
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:21,480
about the the knowledge you know the what was in the books but they also brought their

167
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:29,960
um their love of science you know their you know a sense of Vitality

168
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,880
what uh a sense of

169
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:43,400
excitement and so I had a you know biology teacher that

170
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:51,280
um loved to tell jokes and really brought an enthusiasm

171
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:59,840
that made at the very least kept me from falling asleep in in class

172
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:05,520
and then my High School uh chemistry teacher

173
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:13,960
um really inspired me to become a chemist you know he you know he was middle-age and still

174
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:19,039
working on his PhD you know he wasn't sure whether he he'd ever get it he said

175
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:25,480
his committee was right on the border about whether they would award it or not but that didn't seem to distract or that

176
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:30,799
didn't seem to deter him at all he just loved what he was doing he he was

177
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:37,880
excited about it he shared us shared it with us

178
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:52,679
um he even demonstrated it you know he he demonstrated a a type of explosive

179
00:20:52,679 --> 00:21:00,600
that you could set off with just a feather on a long stick and uh

180
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:07,559
um you know he he brought in some of the things that he was doing for his own research and

181
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:13,559
just you know just made me realize that

182
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:23,240
um science isn't just about knowledge there's also some in some

183
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:30,279
excitement and some curiosity and so

184
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:35,640
um so I'm I'm thankful for those the particularly for the science teachers

185
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:41,880
that I had in high school um you know they really imparted

186
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:49,000
they they really brought science to life for me that it wasn't just book

187
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:53,279
learning

188
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:04,279
um when I was in graduate school I had a a thesis advisor who was very hands-off

189
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:09,240
let me kind of try all sorts of different

190
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,720
things uh you know in addition to learning about chemistry I learned you

191
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:22,880
know electronics and glass blowing and machining and working on

192
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,600
supercomputers um

193
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:36,279
in some ways it might have been better if he wasn't quite so hands off but but I'm thankful for all the latitude that

194
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:42,480
he gave me and all of the resources that he afforded

195
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,080
me um my research

196
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:56,640
Group by and large were people that all got along well and uh we supported each

197
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,440
other so

198
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:07,960
I'm thankful for that while I was in graduate school I got

199
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:18,200
married and although it didn't last forever

200
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:29,120
um she my ex-wife brought a lot into my life her her social um ecosystem system

201
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,880
like her family her friends uh provided a sense of

202
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,880
belonging

203
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:49,480
connection um which I think I didn't even realize

204
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:57,000
how much I appreciated it until we split up and then suddenly I was no longer

205
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:04,120
part of that ecosystem more somewhat peripheral to it

206
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,880
um and then I'll and then finally I'll talk about coming to the Dharma you know

207
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:24,559
that I um came to IMC when we were back at in

208
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:32,360
paloalto and Gil gave a talk about the four noble

209
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:38,200
truths and it was so eye openening for me

210
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:45,679
because I had never heard anybody talk so

211
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:51,799
um I don't know I won't say seriously but so

212
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,279
um matter of factly about the import importance of paying

213
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:07,120
attention to suffering paying attention to what to that sense of uh disease or

214
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:14,039
unease or dissatisfaction

215
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:23,520
um I thought living a skillful life was avoiding suffering at all cost you

216
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:30,919
know I don't know either running from it or uh numbing yourself from it or

217
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:39,279
something um but he was the one that really that really pointed

218
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:46,840
out that this um dissatisfaction the sense of

219
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:54,240
suffering is really a teacher it's really if you want a good teacher pay

220
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:01,480
attention to your suffering and that that was not the message that I gotten anywhere

221
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:06,880
else um you know and that there was not only

222
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,279
that paying attention to it but there was also a cause for it and there was

223
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:18,200
the possibility of release from it and that there was a path so there wasn't

224
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:24,080
just some kind of existential despair that there's suffering in life and

225
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:30,600
you're stuck with it that that there's something to do so I felt very thankful

226
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:39,440
for uh finding my way to uh IMC and to Gil in

227
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,679
particular and then

228
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:56,399
to the example of the Buddha to the Buddhist teachings and

229
00:26:56,399 --> 00:27:02,320
then also to the s to the I found when I first talked with

230
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,559
Gil after maybe six months I told him you know this this is great stuff I I

231
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:15,880
want to talk to you one on-one once a week and he didn't say no well I guess

232
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,960
he did say no he said I've got a lot going so the most I

233
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:29,360
can see you is once a month so if you want to make an appointment you know I can talk I'll talk to you once a month

234
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,559
but he said but most of what you're going to learn you're going to learn from your

235
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:39,880
peers you're going to learn by talking to other people like other people in

236
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:47,799
this room um and so I started getting into Cita

237
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:54,600
groups groups of people that uh are interested in this in this

238
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:02,440
path as well and can share both their struggles and their

239
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:08,440
successes you know what what are you struggling with what you know what

240
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,440
uh what don't you

241
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:23,600
understand and so I think I've been in Cita group since I think it's what uh

242
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:31,320
the year 2000 and um uh I'm thankful for

243
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:42,360
them so I've led a very I'll say fortunate

244
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:48,880
life and only more recently I'd say probably somewhere starting in my middle

245
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,559
age did I really recognize the importance

246
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:04,679
of being thankful for everything that I received and I think thankfulness is a

247
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:12,320
um like for me it wasn't something that I was born with that I you know

248
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:20,200
automatically um acknowledged the ways that people were helping me and

249
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:30,039
so I found that it's it's for me it's been a practice a practice of um

250
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:36,960
recognizing how you're being supported how you're being benefited how you're

251
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:44,000
being helped and then thanking the people that are doing that

252
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,320
um I started very simply by just um every time I'd go into a Starbucks I'd

253
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:57,399
always not only give them some tip but I'd always make to the best of my

254
00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:02,919
ability make eye contact with the Barista and thank them for my drink you

255
00:30:02,919 --> 00:30:08,399
know that it isn't just some transaction where

256
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:14,480
um you go in and say I need a soand so

257
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:20,120
uh you know cafe latte or something like that but to really acknowledge that

258
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:26,200
they're um that there's something Beyond just

259
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,960
the exchange of money going on here

260
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:40,000
here I think over time it's gotten easier but it's but it still

261
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:48,120
takes it still takes reminding myself the importance of thanking others for

262
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:56,880
what they do for me um and so I would encourage you all

263
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:03,039
to think about way in which you're supported by

264
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:10,200
others you know throughout the day you know whether it's

265
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:19,960
um you know cashier at the at the supermarket or uh Barista or

266
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:26,760
um somebody in a medical office

267
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:32,679
um that that it's quite a practice it's not that hard the hardest part of it is

268
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:40,919
remembering to do it um and even if it feels awkward over

269
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:46,679
time it can get easier so um on

270
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:54,159
this Canadian Thanksgiving I encourage you all to

271
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,159
consider um

272
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:08,200
you're your Bountiful Harvest so thank

273
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:16,840
you and if anyone has questions or would like to share something about um what

274
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:22,039
they're thankful for or what they struggle

275
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:28,360
with um we have U microphones

276
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:50,120
yeah thanks for the talk Jim it was uh really inspiring to hear all the

277
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:56,279
different ways we can be thankful and have this reminder to do

278
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:02,200
it um so that's something I'm going to take away and want to do more of and I think

279
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:09,200
it's in the line of loving kindness uh practice as well um to be

280
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:16,080
thankful um I was also interested in uh hearing maybe a bit more about the

281
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:24,240
types of SAS like I think you mentioned K on a groups as one and like to hear

282
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:31,080
more about maybe like how you came across that one or you know are there ways of looking at other SAS as someone

283
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:36,200
that's new to this practice sure sure

284
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:43,000
well there is a a signup list for neighborhood groups uh over on the side so you can

285
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,799
you can do that um that's one

286
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:54,039
way uh I was fortunate enough to start

287
00:33:54,039 --> 00:34:00,880
doing uh residential retreats in the I think my second first or second

288
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,919
year and so I met other people uh Andrea Fel was one of them she

289
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:14,440
invited me to a uh to join a group back I I think it was in

290
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:21,560
2000 um yeah so the neighborhood groups are one option

291
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:28,440
um what kind of neighborhood groups Oh there's uh neighborhood groups

292
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:36,839
for um meeting to talk about uh

293
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:46,398
practice I I think there's a signup sheet and it it's usually kind of goes by ZIP code you know so

294
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:53,679
that um I'm in one group that's spread out all over the Bay Area and it's a great

295
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:59,960
group but it's also really helpful to have a group that

296
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:07,400
um you can meet with locally that' be nice yeah there something in par yeah

297
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:14,640
yeah I think I I think there's probably probably one um I've met people

298
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:24,720
through uh volunteering here at IMC so you meet other people that

299
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:29,079
way and

300
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:36,280
there's also things like the IMC book group that meets I think once a once a

301
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:44,200
month on Fridays so those are some of the ways to do it also there's um once a month

302
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:50,280
there's a potluck here so you can meet people at the

303
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:58,960
potluck and then once a month there's a tea after the Sunday morning sit so

304
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:06,640
those are some of the possibilities of um connecting last Sunday of the month I

305
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:15,160
think yeah the the last Sunday of the month is the potluck and then just this last Sunday

306
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:24,119
was the tea I think so like the second Sunday of the month I think is the tea

307
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,480
well if there's no other comments thank you all for

308
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:43,920
coming and I wish you a

309
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,480
happy Canadian Thanksgiving
