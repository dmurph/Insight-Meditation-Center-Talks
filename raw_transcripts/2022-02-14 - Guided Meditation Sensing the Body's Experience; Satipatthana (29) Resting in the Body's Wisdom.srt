1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:13,519
so hello everyone and

2
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:21,520
beginning of the week for some of us and some places in the world it's

3
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,400
already tomorrow

4
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:34,320
so um happy to be here and i want to start right in with um

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,520
the teaching to get oriented around this practice of

6
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,640
mindfulness of the elements or the physical properties

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,480
such an important part of vipassana practice

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,120
no sound is it other people not having sound

9
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,878
let's see let's take a moment to see if there's uh people hearing

10
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:11,760
usually there's a whole stream of no no sounds if that's the case okay great thank you

11
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,760
so i wanted to start right in with

12
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:29,040
this important area of mindfulness mindfulness of the physical properties or sensations that we have

13
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,680
they're so fundamental to our experience and there's something very valuable about

14
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,280
being attentive to the fundamental layer of our experience where consensual begins

15
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,840
and so here's an example that i could be sitting here

16
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:55,680
and i could feel there's tension in my shoulders that's an ordinary thing to experience

17
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,600
but then i start wondering why am i tense in my shoulders

18
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,799
oh it's left over from yesterday yesterday i was waiting to for a car to

19
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,840
pull out of a parking space and when it pulled out someone else

20
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,959
zipped their car into that space and i felt indignant and angry and how

21
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,000
could they and and i got all tense and since then my shoulder has been

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,920
tense and um why is the world it's a such a an unjust place and

23
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,440
there's been so much injustice and and now it's with the cars and

24
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,120
and maybe i should really do is buy a small car or even buy a bicycle they don't have to deal with this

25
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:48,400
problem and where do i get a good bicycle and on and on it goes and in the meantime i have departed very

26
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:55,680
far from the tension in my shoulder and no in a sense no longer in touch with it

27
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,239
an alternative way of not going into stories and interpretations about our sensations

28
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:08,879
is to just feel the sensation of tension and let it be just tension

29
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,080
and no past no future just tension no cause there might have been a cause

30
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:21,360
but we're not concerned with that no resolution of the tension just tension

31
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,120
just to offer mindful attention to what is as if what is is allowed to stay there

32
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,879
forever this is okay but what that does

33
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:41,200
it creates a kind of a mental space or room the attention to something gives it room

34
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,959
and something like tension then has room to relax there's like space

35
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:53,280
that there's almost an instinct in the muscles themselves to relax

36
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,480
if we're not feeding feeding it more and more stories and ideas

37
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,640
and and so this idea of just holding the tension and awareness keeps it

38
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,159
gives it space to begin to not be reinforced by the stories and

39
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:17,040
and make space for it to relax some things at this elemental level

40
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,240
that are pleasant sometimes actually get stronger if we hold it in awareness

41
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,800
but if we bounce off of it into the world of stories and ideas we might lose touch with even the what

42
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,840
feels wholesome and good so the this four element meditation

43
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:43,840
is to drop down to the elemental or the fundamental sense layer sensation layer

44
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,440
of experience and then give lots of room for it and not kind of

45
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,880
get pulled up into stories interpretations past and futures and this allows for a very important

46
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,960
process and so the art of this is whatever happens

47
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,400
during this meditation whether it's physical sensations themselves

48
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,879
whether it is emotions or even if it's a lot of thinking

49
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:22,000
locate the way it's being manifested in physical sensations

50
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,759
and keep it so simple that you just stay with the sensations that are part of it

51
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:34,160
and letting this physical sensation the body compost it letting the body process it

52
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,919
not your mind not your heart just the body just the sensations themselves

53
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:46,320
and to help with that to keep focused on some sensation which

54
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,000
is predominant is that you can breathe with it breathe through it

55
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,199
if there is no predominant something that grabs your attention

56
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:03,280
that then you refer to the body to feel it just stay with your breathing

57
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:10,160
and there's something profound that happens when we give this kind of breathing room to the sensations of breathing

58
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:18,240
just the sensations each in-breath has its own sensation seat algebraic breath has a sensation

59
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,639
and that's the focus of meditation just whatever is happening

60
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,639
how is it felt and experienced in the body as sensations

61
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:37,198
so sitting assuming your meditation posture

62
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,199
and to settle in taking a few long slow deep breaths

63
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,880
letting your breath return to normal and continue on the exhale to relax your

64
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:22,960
body settle in your body will be the meditation hall

65
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,560
for this meditation

66
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,280
and then check in with yourself and what is the predominant

67
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,039
experience of the moment for you within you

68
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,680
and how is that felt in the body

69
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:35,360
what sensations in your body are most pronounced

70
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:42,240
that feel like it would be good to just hold it in awareness and noticing

71
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,279
what sensations are there tightness

72
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:53,880
looseness pressure

73
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,160
weight softness

74
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,200
warmth coolness

75
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,519
movement expansion contraction

76
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,440
hardness pulling

77
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,440
twisting

78
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,480
opening

79
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:51,519
keep coming back to this fundamental elemental level of experience before stories and

80
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,839
interpretations just the sensations for now

81
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:05,320
breathing with it being with the sensations

82
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,399
making room for the sensations

83
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:53,440
if you're in your thinking you're probably not feeling the sensations

84
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,760
but if you're thinking a lot are there any physical sensations

85
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,279
associated with that and if so

86
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:18,040
let those sensations be the place of mindfulness

87
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,840
whatever's happening refer it back to the body

88
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:01,520
see how simple you can be with it simply feeling the sensations

89
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,520
associated

90
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:48,480
to be able to step away from the incessant thinking mind

91
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,000
to relax and to be settled in

92
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:02,000
the body in the body breathing the body sensing

93
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,840
can be a place where we can find

94
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:17,440
some peace peace from the incessant thinking

95
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:26,520
from time to time it might feel like a vacation like a place of safety

96
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:42,880
and may it be that all of us find a way

97
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:50,240
find our way to be at ease and safety resting in her own physical

98
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:57,840
experience and her body so the body becomes a home

99
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:05,840
a place of rest and ease even if the pain the body is difficult

100
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,880
it's possible to find place within

101
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:19,200
to be at ease and at peace may it be that all of us

102
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:26,640
each individual one of us and all the people we know and out into the world

103
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:34,398
may everyone find peace with their body

104
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:40,960
rest in an ease and comfort in their body

105
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,880
may there be a freedom

106
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:55,360
from incessant thinking and reactivity and meaning making

107
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:04,080
just breathing simply just being alive is enough

108
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,120
may all beings be happy

109
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,640
may all beings be safe

110
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:24,240
may all beings be peaceful

111
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:29,120
may all beings be free

112
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,720
and on this valentine's day may it be for all of us

113
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,480
a meta day maybe there's a way that everyone can be

114
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,640
our valentine

115
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,880
who we look upon with kind regard

116
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,320
may we have meta for all beings

117
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:34,559
so this part of the discourse on the foundations for awareness

118
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:40,320
is the simplest of them all it's a simple description

119
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,679
instruction it simply says in this body

120
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,880
there is the property of earth the property of

121
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:57,679
water the property of fire and the property of air wind

122
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:05,919
and that's it uh it does give an analogy i'll mention the analogy the simile tomorrow

123
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,960
but the instruction that's all it says so there's a recognition of each of

124
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:18,080
these properties as they appear within us and and so it so simple that it might be

125
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:23,440
overlooked it might not be understood how profound it is that it's actually one of the central

126
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:29,600
ways that vipassana practice is practiced is a really delving deep into the level

127
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:36,559
of the sensations of our experience so it's easy to not be in the sensations

128
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:43,120
to certainly it's possible to have sensations of some kind or other and then start interpreting it have

129
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:50,720
stories around it reactions to it it's possible to not be connected to our sensations and all at all and be living

130
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:57,840
in the abstract world of thoughts and ideas and feelings that are disconnected from our body

131
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:03,279
part of mindfulness practice is to awaken the body there is one

132
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:10,799
mahayana sutra that says that we are awakening and light enlightenment happens through the body

133
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:16,159
the buddha himself said that there is no awakening without mindfulness of the

134
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:21,679
body what we're doing and partly this dropping into the sensations just

135
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:28,399
feeling the sensations that they appear is that we're beginning to expand our awareness throughout our body

136
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:35,360
so more and more of our body starts uh being we feel connect really connected to it

137
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:41,279
start feeling embodied it does a lot of wonderful things for us to do this

138
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:48,640
one is that the body to the body itself can process so much

139
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:54,720
of our life so much of our difficulties and our emotions and our thoughts and our

140
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:00,640
concerns our tensions partly because when we're not in the body

141
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:06,399
we're often in the reactivity in the thoughts the interpretations the stressful ways of thinking

142
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:13,040
that are reinforcing the tension in the body if we drop down into the body

143
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:19,679
then there's room for things to unfold there's breathing room for things and even things which and some things

144
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:26,720
will just naturally unfold and resolve themselves like tension for example oftentimes

145
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,720
some things don't resolve themselves maybe there's chronic physical tension in the body

146
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:39,040
but there's an art to just feeling the tension without adding any second arrows to it

147
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:46,720
without adding any tension extra attention to it and um and then delving even deeper into

148
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,760
the pain so we're no longer experiencing at the conceptual level

149
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:56,960
and what i mean with that is we'll take pain as an example

150
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:03,040
the word pain is an abstraction it's a umbrella term

151
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,480
for sensations which are quite intense and those sensations can be varied

152
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:14,400
there can be intense burning stabbing there can be intense twisting

153
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:20,640
there can be intense um um you know stretch pulling and tightening

154
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:26,560
going on there can be intense exhaustion of the muscles it's really aching

155
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:32,560
and so the um those are those are the particular sensations

156
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:39,520
that what we call pain and two people can say they have pain and they have very different sensations

157
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:45,760
sometimes when we call things pain we react to all the ideas and notions we

158
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:51,680
have about pain rather than uh and and it's the abstraction we're

159
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:58,160
reacting to what it means where it's going what's going to happen in the future rather than just dropping into the pain

160
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:04,960
itself and feeling that particularities of the sensation it's possible at the level of calling it

161
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:11,760
pain it just feels like it's constant when we drop into the level of sensations we can discover if we're

162
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,960
really focused that the sensations are not constant they're

163
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:23,040
inconstant they come and they go they appear and they disappear um you know there might be i've had you

164
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:29,200
know when i was first a new zen student i used to bring my attention to feel

165
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:36,400
the pain in my knees which i had a lot of and it would be sometimes just to be reduced to a little square centimeter

166
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:42,960
and in that centimeter there would be this dancing of of intense sensations sparking

167
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:49,119
sensations of stabbing and tightening and different things and it was kind of fascinating to watch

168
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:54,160
the dance and flicking around that there was no one sensation to hold on to or

169
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,440
react to because they are constantly moving in this little square centimeter

170
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,520
for some things the that ability to just feel at the

171
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:13,520
sensation level gives breathing room for it to resolve itself to unwind to dissolve

172
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:20,560
and for other things which are pleasant and enjoyable there's breathing room for it to grow and expand

173
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,839
and some of the great uh feelings of well-being that come with practice that

174
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:32,560
we want to have come with practice are much more accessible if we can feel it more fully in the body

175
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:38,400
the more we're awake in the body the more the body body's is a field of sensations that we can

176
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:46,400
feel so much of the happiness and joy and well-being it can be felt in embodied way it's more

177
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:53,040
stable it's more fuller it's more coursing through us if we can really feel it through the

178
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:58,800
body so this ability to drop down and feel the sensations increases our capacity

179
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:05,280
for experiencing joy and happiness dropping down and feeling being embodied

180
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,320
with our experience referring everything back in the body and let the body hold it

181
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:18,000
and the body wakes up and becomes more expansive in a sense with sensations not that we're living from the neck up it

182
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,760
also turns out we have a lot more capacity for being with difficulties

183
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:29,920
that the mind doesn't have actually sometimes a lot of capacity

184
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:36,240
in its stories ideas reactions beliefs memories projections in the future it can get

185
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,440
very claustrophobic but if we can be centered and grounded and

186
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:48,079
stable in our body making room to feel the sensations letting the sensations come and making

187
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:54,240
room for them then we have a much bigger capacity to deal with challenges

188
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:00,800
much bigger a much bigger ability to be uncomfortable so that we're not knocked over or pushed

189
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:07,440
around or we become reactive or we get tense or we get we feel like our boundaries are being

190
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:14,160
pushed because we we have all this capacity to hold it and be aware of it

191
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,680
kind of like um the analogy i like that if you put put a pyramid

192
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,760
on its head on the point it's not very stable and maybe it can maybe get just perfectly

193
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:32,720
balanced for a moment but someone just taps it then it just falls over but if you turn the the um

194
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:39,440
the pyramid upside down i mean right side up and so it's not sitting on its base

195
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:46,160
then you push it and it's not going to tip over so easily and or at all

196
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,200
and uh so there's something about being stably centered inner physicality of our

197
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:57,599
body sensations of body that we don't easily get pushed over or

198
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:05,040
thrown off balance by events of the world so this simple exercise

199
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,240
i mean not maybe the exercise is not simple but to do but always but the

200
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:16,560
simple instructions opens up to a vast world of possibility

201
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:22,000
the world of our body being centered ground in our body embodied in our body

202
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:29,119
letting the body process our life letting the body be the place we just compost things into our body

203
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:35,040
when i have difficult emotions uh i just find it so valuable to sit and meditate

204
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:42,240
and just feel those emotions in my body just let them trust the body cut like the body's composting them and

205
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,280
then i just kind of put put them back into my body in my body and feel it in the body

206
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,480
and it's so relieving to realize that the

207
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,760
the wisdom of the body knows how to take care of things sometimes much better than the mind

208
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,200
that's trying to figure it out or trying to navigate negotiate

209
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,480
mediate bargain with reality

210
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:17,119
so um so [Music] to begin increasing your vocabulary

211
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:24,000
for sensations you might want to draw up a list and maybe ask friends to add words to

212
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,079
them and of all the ways that direct sensory experiences is

213
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:35,359
felt and the greater that vocabulary list the great maybe the

214
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:41,280
the more you have to enter into this world of sensations and feeling them

215
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:48,880
entering in so fully that at some point you start feeling the dynamism of it the dynamic nature in

216
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:55,280
which it changes and moves and flows and comes alive more and more as we rest in

217
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:03,280
the body as way that awareness is embodied so i would i offer you that one

218
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:10,960
as an exercise to do supporting this sensation meditation

219
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:20,800
is to draw up some a list a long list of all the words in your language that

220
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:27,119
describe sensations twisting pulling heat

221
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:32,240
hot cold heavy light you know just go on and on

222
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:40,400
um itching and whatever it might be and uh and they and maybe um

223
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:46,720
get your friends involved with it and maybe they have different words than you do and you get your vocabulary increases

224
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:53,680
and as the vocabulary increases perhaps your sensitivity also increases you're able to identify the differences between

225
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,920
some of them that otherwise would have been missed

226
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:04,720
so thank you and i hope that you'll come to a day

227
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:10,000
maybe today that you come to love your body

228
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:17,520
much meta to your body may your body be one of your valentines

229
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,760
thank you
