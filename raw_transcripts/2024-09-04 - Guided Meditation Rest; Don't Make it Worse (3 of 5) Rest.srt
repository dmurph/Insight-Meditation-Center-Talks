1
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,000
so hello and welcome

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,960
to this Wednesday morning at IMC meditation

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,400
time and one of the very significant and

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,240
maybe underappreciated teachings and instructions of the

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,120
Buddha has to do with the word don't have to remember this poly word but

6
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:42,960
bharati which means to um abide and I I love this word abide uh to

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:51,000
dwell uh it's very closely connected for me to the idea of um uh resting in the

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,399
middle of what's happening and um and it the Buddha you

9
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:03,119
in terms of meditation the Buddha uses this word abide to rest

10
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:10,600
within uh as a as something that happens when meditation becomes mature that we

11
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,600
have the ability to no matter what's happening to find a place of rest a

12
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:22,280
place to abide in what's happening not away from

13
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:29,200
what's Happening not to turn away and go someplace where we can relax deeply and

14
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,680
forget about our issues in our life but the deepest thing is when we can find a

15
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,960
place of Prof of profound rest uh that is not conventional rest

16
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,719
but something that is deep within maybe you know at the center of

17
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:55,159
all things there's a place of rest a place of

18
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:03,640
delightful vital Dynamic Stillness a place of rich

19
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:09,560
rich intelligent silence

20
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:16,840
here so maybe today the theme of The Meditation is

21
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,920
rest and that the emphasis on relaxation which the Buddha also

22
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:29,160
does uh uh is to not just relax and then

23
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:37,040
relax again and then relax again but to relax and then in the relaxation as to

24
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,200
the whatever degree of softening quieting relaxing we can have

25
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,319
to appreciate the sense of abiding the sense of

26
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:55,840
rest the sense of quiet or Stillness that's found in the

27
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:03,680
relaxing and then to begin to maybe have that as a Cornerstone or the

28
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,319
foundation for how we breathe how we are

29
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:17,360
embodied how we're present for our inner life of thoughts and emotions and

30
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,680
feelings from a vantage point of a place of rest quiet

31
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,439
Peace So to

32
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,400
take a assume a meditation

33
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:45,760
posture and not to assume it not to enter into a meditation posture

34
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,159
forcefully or aggressively or but to do so

35
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:56,959
kindly to do so as if you're welcomed into the

36
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,319
posture or you're welcoming yourself into to the

37
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:06,720
posture as if it's meeting a

38
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:15,480
friend the posture of meeting this friend that's here your body

39
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:26,520
yourself a posture that for you whatever posture you've taken you can adjust in

40
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:35,199
such a way that it feels like it's the balance between between relaxation and being

41
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:45,840
alert between rest and Clarity with this present

42
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:56,400
moment and then to take a few long slow deep breaths

43
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,720
and to relax on the

44
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,840
exhale maybe the relaxation Can Be Imagined as a

45
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:26,520
wave walking through washing through the whole body

46
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:56,520
and letting your breathing return to normal and again maybe the image of

47
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:06,919
gentle waves as you exhale exh Alee relaxing softening in your

48
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,800
face around your

49
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,440
eyes

50
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,400
cheeks Jaws

51
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:55,000
and to relax around the [Music] shoulders the upper chest

52
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,360
the upper back around the shoulder

53
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,319
blades and as the shoulders in the upper torso soften

54
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:24,400
relax sometimes it can be natural to readjust the

55
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,520
hands the position of where how your arms and hands

56
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,919
reside softening in the

57
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:01,360
belly relaxing so the belly begin touching

58
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:08,840
into a sense of being at rest even if it's just momentary ah

59
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,360
there it is that place of rest

60
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:43,440
as you exhale allow yourself to relax into the

61
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,560
support your body is receiving from

62
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:57,000
chair floor a cushion a bed

63
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:31,320
feeling the maybe solid support of where your body is resting

64
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:44,760
where the weight of your body and the pull of gravity kind of

65
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:51,320
meet on some solid surface that holds up your

66
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:02,279
weight this is the place to rest this is the place to abide here and

67
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:12,120
now in this place at this time and as you exhale few more

68
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,440
times let all let whatever tension that can soften

69
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:25,440
relax be felt like a falling away

70
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:45,639
any tension or pressure in the thinking mind as you

71
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:53,560
exhale let it soften maybe Fall

72
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:58,240
Away washing off

73
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:25,839
and then to feel yourself feel the body breathing

74
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:39,240
with patience allowance

75
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:46,639
opening as if breathing is the

76
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,200
doorway to a deep inner

77
00:11:53,519 --> 00:12:01,240
connection relax into the body's experience of breathing

78
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,160
for e

79
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:11,000
and is there in the body's experience of breathing or close to

80
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,440
it a place within where there's

81
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,839
some sense of being at

82
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,480
rest maybe the end of the exhale

83
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,399
maybe at the be the end of the

84
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,040
inhale maybe with the

85
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,959
exhale relaxing the breathing

86
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:59,160
body and being sensitive to whatever subtle momentary

87
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:06,839
very sense of their being being at

88
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:21,240
rest of abiding within what's

89
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
happening

90
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040

on the exhale relaxing wherever you can relax

94
00:16:51,959 --> 00:17:00,000
that's easy and at the end of the relaxation

95
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:07,038
can you feel something that's more at

96
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:18,199
rest stay sensitive to where inside their sense of

97
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:21,558
rest being at

98
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:29,039
ease and let the breathing

99
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:36,960
arise out of that return to that move through

for

113
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:44,640
if you allow yourself a deeper

114
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:54,360
sensitivity or a sensitivity to your depths of your being to whatever degree that that's

115
00:24:54,399 --> 00:25:00,200
available can you find a place of rest

116
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,960
or

117
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,679
ease or softness

118
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,559
Stillness a place where things are at

119
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:33,000
rest and if you do maybe that can be the center of all

120
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,880
things there the center around which everything

121
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:45,440
else is organized or is referenced

122
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:52,120
or from where you're aware

123
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:06,120
and what is it like to gaze upon

124
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:14,960
yourself gaze upon the world from somewhere within that's at

125
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:23,720
rest that abides within the field of

126

and as we come to the end of this

130
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,840
sitting letting yourself be at

131
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,640
rest and gaze upon the world

132
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:56,399
kindly gaze upon the world of your people who are close to

133
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:04,480
you not so close CL far away friends and family and

134
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,360
strangers colleagues

135
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,279
and gaze upon them

136
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:24,000
kindly and is there some way that this practice of mindfulness of

137
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,640
attention of finding a place of rest Within

138
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:36,480
can support seeing the world in a friendly way kind

139
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:44,640
way a kindness which wishes others

140

peaceful May others be

144
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:18,960
free and may I live in this world to support this

145
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,679
possibility and if I

146
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,320
can't at least not Mak good

[Music]

148
00:29:53,360 --> 00:30:01,039
worse thank you e

149
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:59,440
so hello and welcome to this third talk in a five part part series

150
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:05,720
where I'm discussing the practice of not making

151
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:11,960
things worse not making it worse and

152
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:18,519
um this can seem very simplistic it could seem kind of U

153
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:25,440
maybe not profound Buddhism is a profound religion profound experiences

154
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:35,080
of Awakening and Enlightenment and and this Simple Thing ordinary thing just don't make it worse can be easy maybe to

155
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:42,799
dismiss I'd like to propose that all of Buddhism can be found through this

156
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:49,000
practice of don't make it worse that it's certainly valuable for

157
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,360
beginner for ordinary life and you know everyday

158
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:59,440
circumstances but to live this way with my mindfulness attention to don't make

159
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:06,840
it worse um it's a path that opens to all of what Buddhism has to offer even

160
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:13,200
full Awakening and um one of the ways to describe this is

161
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,600
that say we're um we're fuming with

162
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:26,720
anger around some computer device that's not working

163
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,799
the way we want it to work and it's been trying to fix it and make it work for

164
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:39,120
way too long and and um and you can feel the impact in the impact is you want to

165
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:46,000
throw that device across the floor maybe through the window and then you hear remember this little teaching don't make

166
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:53,360
it worse and so you stop and you don't throw the

167
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:59,840
device but then you hear again don't make it worse and then you feel

168
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:06,120
oh uh I'm so impatient because I really want to

169
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:11,880
go and you know get an ice cream today it's

170
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:18,799
a hot day and the ice cream would be so good and I really want that I'm so impatient and this computer is causing

171
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:25,000
me problems don't make it worse oh

172
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,159
impatience strong clinging into some idea oh maybe I can relax

173
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:37,440
that and then you hear that don't make it worse and then you see that oh what's

174
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,760
left is a feeling of maybe feeling a little bit lonely from having been too

175
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:49,919
much on a computer and away from people and friends and uh and you feel loneliness

176
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:55,200
is kind of a contraction and tightening and and a kind of pressure inside of

177
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,880
feeling a little bit insecure or a little bit worried about the future and future

178
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,720
without any people don't make it worse and so you find yourself relaxing that

179
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:14,158
pressure relaxing that sense of the future and the anxiety and thinking a lot what it means to have spent too many

180
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,240
hours on alone in a computer and then you feel look now I'm

181
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:24,280
breathing now it's okay I'm here it's nice but actually I feel that my

182
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:30,520
breathing is contracted don't make it worse oh I can relax that

183
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:36,118
breathing and then the breathing relaxes and then you see you what is don't make

184
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:41,839
it worse mean now oh it means to quiet the mind and not be thinking so much

185
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:50,280
about the future just be here with the breathing and then don't make it worse

186
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:57,040
oh uh let me not kind of be straining or pushing or uh being aggressive around

187
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:02,160
being with my breath that's making it worse let me be soft and relaxed and

188
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:08,680
receptive around breathing they'll make it worse and then you feel this and you

189
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:15,800
feel oh this feels good and then there's a complacency sense in oh this is good I'll just rest back and just not have to

190
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,880
work so hard and then you feel like that actually feels a little bit off there's

191
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,359
a loss of some kind of Vitality and Clarity don't make it worse open up to

192
00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:31,440
the clarity of being with the breath and then start seeing some deeper

193
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:39,480
places of attachment and those soften and so the whole process goes deeper and deeper and deeper so this idea of uh

194
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,680
don't making it worse is not a not a

195
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:50,520
simplistic kind of everyday kind of little teaching inherent in it is

196
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:57,079
something very profound in Buddhism so we turn towards we want to

197
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:02,560
understand how we make it worse so we can learn not to make it worse and what

198
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:07,760
I'm offering today this week is there's five different ways of not making it

199
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:16,319
worse and U and today the idea is to rest so the First first day with the w

200
00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:21,480
is wait so if you if you you feel like you're going to make it worse maybe you

201
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,720
can restrain yourself from acting or speaking and so the idea of wait wait

202
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:34,800
don't give into the impulses that are going to make it worse wait and then uh as you wait

203
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:41,359
organize yourself bring your B put yourself back together uh when

204
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:50,040
they often when we're going to make something worse out of anger frustration fear strong desire uh we're actually

205
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:56,280
becoming partial we're not fully present for all of who we are we got of narrowed in some kind of concern and

206
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:03,640
preoccupation and so take time to wait and bring ourselves together get all connected

207
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:09,119
settled here with ourselves and that allows us then to

208
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:14,280
begin to be here and be at at rest find

209
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:20,640
certainly relaxing is important and um but uh relaxing is only

210
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:26,000
half of what's possible is at the end of relaxation find a place where there's

211
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,480
some kind of um uh rest find a rest

212
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:38,160
here and uh that's a challenge in trying situations where there's a lot of

213
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:46,079
emphasis something has to be done I have to figure something else this is dangerous for me I better have the right to rejoin her in this conversation and

214
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:55,200
what but um and so the lawyers of the mind can really insist how important it is to act impulsively or do something

215
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,640
but no rest and part of the value of resting waiting

216
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:07,720
getting organized resting is that we're now becoming um we now have a chance to

217
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:13,560
respond when it's time to respond from a deeper more healthy place from our

218
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:19,280
wisdom from our Good Will from our peace from our sense of wholeness not our

219
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,920
sense of inadequacy or sense of uh insufficiency or

220
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:31,839
something and so to be able to find find a place of rest and um not to kind of become a

221
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:38,720
couch potato and just not do anything but uh the the emphasis in Buddhism of

222
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:45,200
abiding in our experience finding a place of rest is that it's possible to

223
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:53,880
have a place of rest from which we operate even in the busyness of life

224
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:59,160
that we can have a sense kind of like being if you're ever done it taking your

225
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:05,800
car through a car wash and is chaos of these big brushes and water and suds all

226
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:11,119
the outside of the windows but uh inside the car it's quiet

227
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:18,400
it's peaceful it's safe it's uh cozy even and now you can watch this all this

228
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:25,079
excitement and just watch it in a peaceful way in a way you couldn't if there was no car but you were being

229
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:31,400
taken through the conveyor belt and all that stuff was spraying on you and brushing against you so it's possible to

230
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:37,079
find a place of rest inside that's like being in the car inside the car during

231
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:42,200
the car wash and if we're not being disconnected from the world it actually

232
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:52,839
allows for a deeper connection a deeper participation in the world so um so to find a place of rest

233
00:39:52,839 --> 00:40:00,119
not always easy but uh the stepping stone to it is the other R which is to

234
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:07,839
relax uh relax find and relaxing is such a profound thing just as I said that uh

235
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:13,160
don't make it worse can be a very profound practice relaxing can be a very

236
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:18,960
profound practice for the same reasons that any kind of anything that's in the

237
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:26,319
way of profound peace profound Awakening Liberation is something which is tense

238
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:31,880
is something which is contracted tight and uh and one way of describing the

239
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:38,160
whole path of Buddhist practice is to describe uh a a deeper and deeper and

240
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:44,960
deeper relaxation some people might say a deeper and deeper Letting Go a deeper

241
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,119
deeper release but if there's need for release there's the opposite of it

242
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:56,839
there's tightness there's holding and so relaxing is not a a a lightweight things

243
00:40:56,839 --> 00:41:03,520
to do but then in the relaxing then see do you relax into at

244
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:11,040
the end of the relaxation is there a little bit of Peace a little bit of rest a little bit of ease a little bit of

245
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:16,400
release appreciate that feel that be attuned to

246
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,880
it it's very easy in going through daily life to be so caught up in the world of

247
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:29,240
aboutness the things what's happening what I need to do the ideas the fears the projections

248
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:37,400
and we Overlook maybe the some of the most important things that we can be in touch

249
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:45,079
with our own sense of inner well-being our own sense of being at ease at peace

250
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:52,200
our own deep sense that yes I don't have to make it worse at least I can stay

251
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:58,160
close to this place where it's possible for the what's most healthy most

252
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:05,920
wonderful about being alive has a chance to surface and flow through and the

253
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:12,920
being at rest in the middle of all experience doesn't mean being passive doesn't mean that we don't put effort

254
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:18,280
into doing things it means that somehow our hearts somehow deep in our belly

255
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:25,200
somehow deep in the in the at the heart of awareness of

256
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:32,079
knowing that knowing is at rest there's no need for awareness to be

257
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:40,640
in a hurry no need for awareness to be assertive and

258
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:47,760
aggressive the awareness the knowing the mindfulness can be at ease while we

259
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,960
engage fully and healthfully with what needs to

260
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,440
be done in our life so

261
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:06,160
to rest wait organize your body your sense of

262
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:11,319
self your experience in the psychophysical being and then rest and

263
00:43:11,319 --> 00:43:17,200
so maybe for these next 24 hours until tomorrow uh you want to uh maybe explore

264
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:23,880
this concept of inner rest and how how do you understand it how do you tap into

265
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:30,359
it and touch into it how do you protest around being at rest what are your

266
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:35,880
lawyers saying and how can you allow some deep

267
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:43,760
sense of inner rest to be something that you have as you do things in your daily

268
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,559
life and you might begin with things which are easy simple things like maybe

269
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:54,880
sweeping your kitchen floor or cleaning the dishes or doing some cooking or

270
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:59,960
something that for you is relatively easy and see what it's like to to do it

271
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:06,519
in reference point to a place of inner

272
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:12,000
rest so thank you and um I look forward to

273
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,720
continuing uh worse tomorrow
