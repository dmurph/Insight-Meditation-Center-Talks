1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,839
it's a [Music] quite a lovely place to sit and practice and

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,760
in this very powerful contemplative environment of the retreat center

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,920
so a gentle background like the wind

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:25,279
the uh you might be hearing the traffic we uh in the morning sometimes we hear the traffic of highway 17 not

5
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:32,320
over the hill and uh some of the windows are open because uh

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,879
having uh we have about 37 40 people living together here during covet time so

7
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,600
we're having windows open and so um so uh it's probably you're hearing

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,920
that uh so

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:59,199
the camera is out of focus no sound suddenly static stop when you started talking

10
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,239
uh so the camera out of focus

11
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,798
well we'll look at that tomorrow but hopefully

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,119
okay so one of the things i wanted to say about this

13
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,920
sati patana the knowing quality is that

14
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,320
one of the things where what supporting our mindfulness is having a very simple reference point

15
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,920
so for example if you are if the classic example

16
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:45,119
um is um is that of um

17
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,360
a white piece of cloth that uh or canvas or something

18
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,799
that if it's full of stains one more stain you wouldn't notice

19
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:03,680
but if that white cloth is completely clean and you put one more stain on it you will notice it

20
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:11,440
and or if you have a chalkboard that is uh full of

21
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,280
writing on it you might not packed full of writing you might not notice uh

22
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,800
that someone writes something else on it but if it's completely clear the blackboard then

23
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,920
you'll see clearly you know if someone scribbles something on

24
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,599
so if a person is really agitated

25
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,040
they might not notice that their mind is now agitated with something new it's just all the same

26
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,239
but if the mind is calm then they might notice that

27
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,480
that the agitation begins so to have a reference point we see ourselves better

28
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,080
and this is what this imp one of the benefits of this simplicity of knowing

29
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,480
um the um

30
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,959
so some simplicity of knowing and

31
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:14,879
and so just to know that you're sitting just to know that there is a body

32
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,720
which is one of the statements in the sativatan sutta they have knowledge just enough to know

33
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:27,760
that there is a body to know that you're sitting might not seem very profound

34
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,879
but it highlights when we can't do that when we can't sit still and we're agitated

35
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:39,920
and fidgeting we can't we it we notice that we don't just see the body we're caught up in our

36
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,040
preoccupations so this simple knowing of breathing

37
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,720
works the same way that we might not be successful at staying very long with the breathing

38
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,400
but we can if the mind we're more likely because of this reference point of breathing

39
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,799
we're more likely to notice if the mind wanders off and and then

40
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:09,760
we practice simple knowing of that and oh and when you and the simple

41
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,000
knowing is a reference point for when we have complex knowing

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,880
when we know something with judgments and evaluations and a lot of thinking commentary

43
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:32,080
so assuming a meditation posture

44
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,800
and gently closing your eyes

45
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,759
and just a simplicity of sitting here quietly your eyes closed

46
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:54,000
does that highlight something about how you are that you may not might not have noticed

47
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,639
if you hadn't stopped

48
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:24,120
noticing how you are in your body and your mind and your heart

49
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,599
and how simple or how complex is your knowing of that

50
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:39,360
chances are the more complicated the knowing the more you're caught up in it caught

51
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,960
in thoughts and preoccupations the simpler the knowing

52
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,320
the more freedom there is

53
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,560
and then settling down into the experience of your body breathing

54
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,840
breathing in and breathing out

55
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:24,800
and if anything makes it difficult just be resting in the simplicity of the body breathing

56
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,680
know that

57
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:36,919
experiment with this to see how simple you can know it

58
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,639
and then whenever you're ready return to your breathing

59
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:11,120
or allow the experience of breathing to return to a simplicity of knowing

60
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:17,840
settling in relaxing into the experience of breathing

61
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,000
on one hand you can notice when it gets complicated

62
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:39,520
on the other hand as you simply know it the experience of breathing becomes more

63
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:47,039
intimate more embodied in awareness

64
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,520
with this as awareness gets simpler our perceptions can become clear

65
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,479
here in the present moment

66
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,959
how simple are you with what is

67
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:44,040
how complicated are you with what is

68
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,240
and can your knowing be simple

69
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:08,800
even if things are complicated can you in a sense step back

70
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,320
and just know complication

71
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,720
always returning to simple knowing

72
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:16,960
how can the simplicity of breathing highlight

73
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,279
ways that you're not simple

74
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:30,400
highlight how you enter into more complex worlds of thoughts ideas feelings

75
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,200
and when you see that you've gotten complicated

76
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,880
can you take refuge in a kind of simple knowing

77
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:55,840
knowing of the complexity that's all

78
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,760
knowing thinking feeling

79
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:10,840
whatever it might be how simply can you know it

80
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,960
and as we come to the end of this sitting

81
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:10,159
the simplicity of being simplicity of knowing can be a refuge

82
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,200
a refuge of safety

83
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:26,640
and when the knowing is calm and peaceful it's a refuge of calm and peace

84
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,880
there might be other things happening which are agitated even within us

85
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,039
but to take refuge in the simplicity of calm knowing

86
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:50,320
and then when we live in a world of agitation

87
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:56,400
a world of complexity where people are spinning out and

88
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:01,399
not really present for themselves

89
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:11,440
may our refuge and simplicity simple knowing simplicity of presence

90
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,880
be a support for others may we make ourselves a refuge for this

91
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:25,760
world as we found a refined refuge in ourselves

92
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,159
may we somehow be a refuge

93
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,360
a place of safety for those who meet us

94
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,000
encounter us

95
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:52,240
may we be a refuge that supports the happiness of all beings

96
00:25:52,960 --> 00:26:00,158
maybe may we be a refuge that provides safety to everyone

97
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,399
may we be a refuge

98
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,559
that offers the world of peace a peaceful

99
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:19,679
presence and may we be a refuge

100
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:26,159
that supports the freedoms of others if nothing else

101
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:33,200
people feel that they're free from us when we're present with them

102
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:40,158
may all beings may all people be happy

103
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,799
and once again being in a new place

104
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:56,640
all the preparations i set this up i didn't get a bell close enough to hit

105
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:05,000
to ring so i will bow and end the sitting

106
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,720
thank you

107
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:58,799
so we've started the discussions of the second exercise of the satipatana sutta

108
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:04,159
the one that goes very simply instead when walking

109
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:12,320
one knows one is walking when standing knowing one is standing

110
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:17,840
sitting one nose one is sitting lying down one nose

111
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:25,039
one is lying down in whatever way the body is positioned one knows that

112
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:33,760
and so it's uh very easy to just skim over this because

113
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:39,279
most people can master this one very quickly to know they're standing when they're standing

114
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:44,640
and they're ready to go off to do something else but

115
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,760
to really center oneself in this knowing

116
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,880
has all kinds of benefits but the one i'm going to focus on today

117
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:01,600
is that how it can be a reference point for uh we don't want to be there in just the

118
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:09,039
simplicity of that where the momentum where the impulses are where the life force is going for us

119
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:14,320
in a way that maybe is not always healthy for us or doesn't

120
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:21,279
express a lot of our freedom so for example standing in the

121
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,279
in the market in line for the cashier to

122
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:32,480
just center oneself standing i know i'm standing

123
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,760
and to really know that and not only know it with words

124
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:43,760
but know it feeling wise know it and embody it knowing just just stand there and then breathe with that and be with

125
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:49,679
the standing and it could just be for a few seconds

126
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:55,760
and then you might notice that there's this really strong pull desire impulse

127
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:01,520
to read the front covers of the magazines that are standing that are there

128
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:09,760
for you and or maybe you're a very strong impulse to

129
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:16,480
look and see what other people are buying and comment on it in your mind or maybe you notice then only then how

130
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:23,440
impatient you are and you're actually crowding the person in front of you a little bit so because you're somehow you know eager

131
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:30,320
to get on with it and without the reference point of a simple way of just

132
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:35,360
i know that i'm standing we see that we can't just stand

133
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:41,440
we want to do more we're engaged we're this impulse is there walking

134
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,880
to just walk and know you're walking and that's the all you're doing

135
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:53,279
it might highlight how you're walking in a hurry you're leaning forward or you're tense

136
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:58,480
or you're you know it might highlight how you're walking or you might highlight the fact

137
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,600
that you're hardly noticing your surroundings or noticing yourself walking because you're in some kind of

138
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:09,360
reverie or in some kind of preoccupation or anxiety

139
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:15,840
and um and none of these things is wrong that we're doing

140
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:22,799
that takes us away from the simplicity of what we're doing in the moment but the prac the path of mindfulness is

141
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:29,600
to know it to be mindful of it so to really know

142
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:35,440
oh there's a desire to look at the magazine covers there's a desire to move forward

143
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:42,320
i'm impatient and to know that with the simplest clearest freest kind of

144
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:47,440
knowing you can and that becomes one of the kind of

145
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:55,039
premier reference points is a simple knowing can we allow ourselves a calm simple

146
00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:01,039
knowing of what's happening or is the mind racing ahead wanting to do things wanting to pick things up want

147
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:07,120
to get involved it can't just stay centered and settled

148
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,880
and standing in line in a market you know it's not the end of the world to just

149
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,000
stand there and breathe and be present and so you can feel how that's not

150
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,840
there's lack of freedom and how we're kind of maybe crowding the other person

151
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:29,840
looking at that cashier trying to calculate how quickly they'll be done not going to change anything probably

152
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:35,600
for you to do that but but you can see the way we've been caught in it and

153
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:42,159
it has us in its grip that kind of concern walking the same way we can see what's

154
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:48,559
the complexity of it and the and that beautiful art of this is that no matter how complicated the

155
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:56,080
mind's preoccupation is no matter how complicated the situation we're in there is always some capacity to know it

156
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,360
in a simple way and one of the

157
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:06,960
labels and ways of knowing that i have is that covers it all no matter how

158
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,960
complicated it is i'll just tell myself knowing chaos

159
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:20,720
this moment i know that it's chaotic and i don't know the details of the chaos necessarily understand all of it

160
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,760
i'm not trying to evaluate or study it or fix it i just oh chaos

161
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:32,799
and that knowing of that keeps it really simple and then there are times when i've used

162
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:38,559
that knowing of chaos and then i then i take the moment then to because

163
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:43,919
i know it now i can take it in and perceive it more fully as chaos

164
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:49,120
and then i start seeing almost naturally without losing that simplicity

165
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:57,279
i notice some of the details of it i notice that the chaos is primarily physical agitation in my body

166
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:04,960
and so now it's knowing simply knowing physical agitation and as i'm with that in a simple way

167
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,320
then at some point it becomes clear that there's anxiety

168
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,358
and the anxiety is this and so it kind of begins to be more specific but not

169
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:21,520
because i'm investigating and questioning and wondering what's happening it's just that i'm relying on the

170
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:27,679
simplicity of knowing for things to become clear and if we have a simple knowing where we

171
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:37,359
just allow ourselves to be with what's happening then clarity begins to appear on its own

172
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,800
so um it becomes a refuge the simple knowing it's a way it's a reference point for

173
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:51,358
freedom because in the simplest knowing the knowing happens in a very free way

174
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:56,960
the knowing is independent of what is known

175
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,320
so you know if i see the magazine covers on the rack at the market

176
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,240
i can recognize some exotic

177
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,040
title of an article and and i can just know it look at that

178
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:19,200
there's a title and as opposed to being horrified or fascinated or

179
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,960
eager to kind of get involved or start judging and how could they um

180
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:31,119
and when i start getting that complicated i can notice oh i'm i've lost myself in the complexity

181
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:39,200
i've lost myself in the feelings the desires the drives that i have there's not freedom there

182
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:46,400
but to have the knowing be free then is a reference point so this teachings about

183
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:53,040
when walking no you're walking standing know where you're standing sitting no you're sitting

184
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,560
lying down no you're lying down can function this way that it helps bring

185
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,960
more mindfulness more attention to what's going on for us beyond the simplicity of it

186
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:12,000
of just standing and walking and if nothing more is going on if it's really easy just to stay close to

187
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,320
walking when you're walking sitting when you're sitting standing when you're standing and lying

188
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:24,079
down when you're lying down then just enjoy yourself just sit there and breathe and be there

189
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:29,599
breathing and walking and feeling and being connected to the experience it's a fantastic

190
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:35,599
pleasure to do so and and if you make it more complicated than

191
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:40,720
that know it that's the case and then with that knowing perhaps

192
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,920
there's also some wisdom where you realize i don't have to spend my

193
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,760
time looking at the covers of magazines when i have something better to do

194
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:58,320
i can just sit stand here and breathe and be present or maybe you realize

195
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:04,160
maybe i should get a magazine a friend of mine is ill i know my friend likes

196
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:10,720
that particular kind of magazine it's a nature magazine and maybe i'll buy it okay for my friend

197
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:16,079
that's a little more complicated but it comes from a very different place

198
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,240
so in the refrain that we covered the very end of it it said

199
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:27,280
one has one is mindful there is a body

200
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,880
just to the what's necessary for knowledge and lucid or clear

201
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:39,119
awareness and now here we have again this very simple thing there is a body

202
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:45,520
and the the text the suit goes from that refrain to the the second exercise where

203
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:52,079
it remains that simple and uh it'll get as we develop this then

204
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:58,079
um this simplicity of practice it opens up and we become aware of a little bit more

205
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:04,160
complexity but we hopefully have learning how to be aware of more and more complexity or

206
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:12,800
more and more kind of richness of the moment we know it in this simple way

207
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:18,160
and in this simple way maybe is not so cognitive always it

208
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:25,200
might not be a label or a word that we say like chaos or sound or something but it might be a

209
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:33,119
quieter knowing that is closer to kind of a just experiencing it

210
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:35,838
so um

211
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,440
i think that's my words for today and um

212
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:53,200
i'm enjoying going through this saturday slowly step by step and and um

213
00:38:53,200 --> 00:39:00,079
so we'll continue and uh and take refuge in your knowing

214
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,520
experiment and explore what it's like to be simple a simplistic simplicity of

215
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,560
being with whatever is happening a simplicity of knowing with whatever is happening

216
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:16,800
and see what what shows itself see what clarity there comes and the reason to experiment with that

217
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,000
and explore that in the next day or day or two is that

218
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,599
the mindfulness will get a little bit more complicated a little bit more involved slightly

219
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:34,400
and and so having this ability to have a refuge and knowing and keep it simple always to keep back

220
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:40,240
to the simplest knowing simplest awareness of it all is such a powerful support as we go

221
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:45,680
through the entire satipatana so

222
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,400
thank you very much
