9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,640
so so for practice today and happy hour we

10
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,640
we engage with exploring meta and compassion and joy and

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,240
and equanimity in these various practices of the heart and one practice i want to invite us is

12
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:23,600
something that actually i invited folks to explore this morning and it felt so juicy i thought oh i want to

13
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,799
bring into the happy hour sangha also for us to explore

14
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,520
and whether you showed up this morning and this will be you can explore it again and deepen it or whether this is

15
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,640
new for you so so

16
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:48,880
so [Music] the idea of joy taking joy delight gladness gladdening

17
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,720
our hearts so one thing that happens often when we

18
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,280
are new in our practice especially when we are newer in our

19
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,600
practice but it can happen if we've been practicing for a while too is

20
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,959
is um and and then one you know the light bulb goes off one

21
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:20,000
realizes this pattern which is not a very helpful pattern and the pattern is see if you recognize

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,120
it in your own practice or from the past or present it doesn't matter no judgment

23
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,959
many of us do as all of us do it when we start practicing actually let's put it this way

24
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,800
and for a long time so the pattern is we're sitting

25
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,920
we're bringing our mind to the breath to the body to the object of our awareness

26
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,040
maybe it's mental we bring kind awareness and then

27
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,480
the mind like a little puppy like mark's puppy

28
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,519
wanders away wanders away that's what puppies do that's what minds do they

29
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:04,000
wonders away and in the little bit we find our mind resting on the thought on a memory on

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,040
the plan what to have for dinner and what we're gonna have for breakfast

31
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:17,040
it's off and then when we notice we often go bad bad mind bad puppy you

32
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,599
were away you were thinking come back ouch ouch

33
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,519
so that moment of hitting that moment of self-judgment judging our minds it takes

34
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:36,480
a while to see that it often takes a while to see that we keep doing it habitually and if we keep

35
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,920
doing that it actually can make the practice of meditation um

36
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:50,159
contractive can make it seem like a chore like i just don't want to meditate anymore meditation is hard and it's not

37
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:56,319
meditation that's hard it's because we keep hitting ourselves with a big stick

38
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:04,080
every time we see our mind has wandered so if you keep hitting a puppy the puppy becomes traumatized and scared like oh

39
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,599
so that's what happens to our mind oh i don't want to meditate anymore you keep hitting me every time

40
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:17,040
you know i wander off so so so the thing to notice every time the

41
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,120
mind wanders let let there be a release let there be

42
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,280
first of all a delight that yay yay there's a moment of wakefulness yay

43
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,600
yes one moment of being alert awake mindful is better

44
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,120
infinitely better than zero moments so yay celebrating that moment of

45
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,840
realizing that the mind has wandered great now i realize that the mind isn't here anymore yay

46
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,160
so it can be a moment of joy a moment of celebration that's one moment that one

47
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,560
that's one hit of joy and celebration and then there can be a second one and

48
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:07,360
here's the nuance the nuance is as we

49
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,400
let go as we gently release gently release and

50
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:19,759
let go kindly let that release that letting go

51
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:26,000
let that feel like an offering it's a letting go it's

52
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,039
it's an act of generosity it's an act of release

53
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:38,400
and celebrate that release yay as if you're offering a gift of your

54
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,720
release your release your letting go is a gift that you're putting on the

55
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,080
altar of humanity hey i let go i let go of

56
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,840
something that wasn't helpful in this moment yay here offering you can see it

57
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,600
as an art making and offering to the altar of humanity alter of your practice

58
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,680
it's just this gift of generosity your practice becomes an act of generosity

59
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:14,479
in that way with each release it's so each release letting go becomes a celebration a double

60
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:22,000
celebration once realizing that oh yes i'm awake yes i'm here i'm here in the second

61
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,600
celebration of letting go so is that clear

62
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,520
i'm gonna before we actually start meditating i'm just gonna pause and make sure the instructions are clear actually

63
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:40,000
you know i will say it again during the guided meditation so so in this way

64
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,880
the invitation is to explore delight joy

65
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:54,240
of the heart of the heart releasing of the heart letting go the first time

66
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:01,280
mind heart awakening to that oh yes yes i'm awake i'm here i'm mindful i

67
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,479
know that the mind is thinking about something yes yay

68
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,599
one moment of wakefulness is better than being lost the whole time so celebrating

69
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:17,360
taking join that number two that release that letting go is to be

70
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,720
celebrated it's an act of generosity of letting go of what is not helpful in

71
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:30,880
this moment so as much as this makes sense try it on for size and if it doesn't

72
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,560
it's okay too you can just simply be with the breath and the body and

73
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,759
take delight in being present as much as you are present with

74
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:50,639
in in this moments in this moment being here so

75
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:57,360
so all of that let's practice together let's try this on for size

76
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,680
so landing arriving arriving in your chair

77
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,160

with gentleness turned

83
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,319
to the contact points of this body and the earth

84
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,839
letting your bottom

85
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,160
feel the cushion

86
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,879

taking time to feel this body all the contact points all the sensations that

90
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,920
draw your attention in your own time

91
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:47,120
all the nooks and crannies let the breath visit all the tight nooks and

92
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,760
crannies from your feet from your toes up to the

93
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,399
top of your head

94

as if you're a pop-up balloon or a pop-up doll that's out of air

95
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:20,959
breath coming in the breath with awareness inflating

and release to rejoice in to celebrate in my

146
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,520
training

147
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,960
with the mind is calm spacious delighting and rejoicing

148
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:27,200
feeling of awareness and presence in this moment if the mind wanders off

149
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,799
rejoicing and delighting becoming aware

150
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:39,520
whenever you do delighting in the release

151
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,080
noticing how you feel lighter the heart feels lighter

152
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:54,720
the mind feels lighter with each release each letting go

153
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,120
to be celebrated

154
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:12,039

so if you were tuning a radio can you tune into the joy the delight

158
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:07,919
of sitting being breathed perhaps there is a level of peace

159
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:15,520
available that's joyous comforting

160
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,840
delightful or if the mind gets

161
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:29,279
carried away here and there tune into the release the joy of letting go

162
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:34,480
oh and how much lighter the heart the mind feels every time you let go how

163
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:43,200
delightful that is tuning into the delight the joy

164
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:51,398
the pleasantness of this of different aspects of this practice

165
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,919
you

166
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:29,039
remember to stay embodied feeling the sensations of the body

167
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:34,080
not to get too top heavy center of gravity being

168
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:41,960
down in your lower abdomen or sit bones not in your head

169
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:58,599
notice the delight and the release the lightness

170
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:09,079
the happiness of letting go

171
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,880
especially if there are judgments you can't do this you're distracted this

172
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:47,760
is terrible i'm bored if you gently notice these

173
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,440
delight that you've seen them then release

174
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,800
ah just let go

175
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:07,480
if you're releasing a balloon see how much lighter you feel releasing

176
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,079
releasing unkind

177
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:23,079
contracted entanglements

178
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,039
and for the last moment of this practice

179
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:46,000
appreciating yourself delighting that you showed up

180
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:53,119
if there are any judgments releasing them releasing

181
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:59,839
letting go seeing how much lighter the heart and mind can feel and delighting in this

182
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:06,960
release let's release this letting go

183
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,760
is a generosity to yourself and offering

184
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,599
the altar of your practice may our practice be of service of

185
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:29,160
benefit to all beings everywhere including ourselves may all beings be free may all beings be happy

186
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,079
thank you for your practice everyone

187
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,160
so so much here

188
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:06,400
so today we began with settling arriving [Music]

189
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:13,520
slightly differently embodiment bringing in a sense of embodiment

190
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:19,680
with as if we were breathing as if we're being breathed

191
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,119
this as if loving awareness is a breath kind of bringing those two ideas

192
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:30,240
together breathing into our bodies i brought up the image of a pop-up doll

193
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:36,000
that's deflated and little by little areas of the body get get inflated

194
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,880
um with the breath with loving awareness

195
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:47,839
and um and so that was the first part and

196
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:53,040
and finding the delight the joy that ease of just feeling

197
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,400
oh this energetically this body that's full of breath and

198
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:04,240
life energy so i'm curious how that was for you if you'd like to share about that part

199
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:10,560
also um there then we transitioned if there was

200
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:17,200
thoughts distractions entanglements in the mind to number one

201
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,800
notice them and take delight in noticing not judge yourself for having been lost

202
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,079
but yay i'm noticing now celebrating that moment of awakeness

203
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:33,920
and number two when you release noticing the

204
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,760
lightness the delight the joy of release it's just this act of generosity to

205
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:46,720
yourself this this gift of practice feeling lighter so

206
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:55,359
so i can say more but i'd love to hear from you especially if you haven't spoken for a while please file it

207
00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:02,000
hey nikki hi um i had

208
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,280
very strong very challenging emotions come up during this set

209
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,880
i think a lot because just sitting down and being quiet a lot

210
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:18,640
of stuff that had accumulated over the day over the week over the months came up

211
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:24,160
and the perspective of like

212
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:30,960
finding joy or delight in it it's like there was joy in just having

213
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,079
an emotion or having a sensation like in and of itself was like

214
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:43,040
wow i'm able to feel sad like i have a body that feels this emotion like

215
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:48,960
that's nice like that's a nice thing it's preferable to feel something than to not

216
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:56,640
feel anything um it's it feels nice to have a big feeling as opposed to like

217
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:03,760
most of my life which is having small feelings and then a lot of like tension and contraction and holding

218
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:10,000
to keep it small and to not let it get big um [Music] and then

219
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,119
even just like crying i mean crying is kind of physically

220
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:22,079
pleasurable in some ways like tears in eyes on cheeks like it kind of feels nice like

221
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,119
there's some there's some joy and physical pleasure in that too so

222
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:32,960
i liked that sort of permission and container of joy

223
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:40,240
for fear and sadness and range and the other stuff so thank you

224
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:46,079
thank you violet thank you so much for sharing such beautiful

225
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:53,119
touching profound report of your practice and it's absolutely profound i hope you

226
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:58,160

227
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:03,680
cultivated holding your practice holding what arises

228
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:10,560
with appreciation oh yes it's it's lovely to feel it's it's defining

229
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:18,880
the delight the pleasure in the tears all of that is is just profound to make space for all of it to

230
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,920
be as it is the challenging emotions and all you're not pushing anything aside i

231
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:32,240
didn't hear that holding it all and tuning into the delight the the gift that it is to feel

232
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:37,520
and i am so touched inspired with with the beautiful

233
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:42,800
profound profound profundity of what you're sharing in your practice violet thank

234
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:50,920
you it's beautiful thank you

235
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:12,400
any other reflections please especially if you haven't shared for a

236
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:20,240
while you can also type in chat or raise your hand kneel please

237
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:27,359
so you said all right that when you become aware you should you know

238
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:35,359
take joy that you're awake first not being awake and then i think you said something about offering making an offering

239
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:41,599
um could you yeah i'm not quite sure what you meant by that

240
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:47,119
yeah yeah so so two parts of this practice i'm suggesting

241
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:54,960
so the first is as you named taking delight that yes you're awake now yay that's part one

242
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:02,000
and part two is as the mind releases as the mind lets go

243
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:09,280
right there's a movement internal movement that you're familiar with like okay this is not profitable not helpful

244
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:15,920
ah release release ah notice in that release

245
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:22,319
right in that release there's there is an open-handedness there is this aspect

246
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:28,000
of generosity opening up letting go in the let's say in that letting go

247
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,599
there is a delight there is a lightness the mind feels lighter heart feels

248
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:39,839
lighter okay and in that release when you really when you let go of something that's not

249
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:47,520
helpful that letting go is is an offering it's a gift it's like yay here i am cultivating

250
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:54,640
that cultivating my heart my mind in goodness so that's the offering that release that

251
00:45:54,640 --> 00:46:02,079
letting go is the offering is the act of generosity for yourself for others

252
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:08,800
and i was imagining putting that on the altar of of humanity or practice here it is my

253
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:14,880
gift of releasing yay does that make sense think so

254
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:21,040
great yeah thank you thank you lovely i'm so glad you asked though that

255
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:26,640
i get the chance to clarify even more it's it can be very profound practice

256
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:32,720
there are lots of pieces to it little pieces to it but it's it can be so much fun

257
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:39,200
both the lightness the lightness of the heart when the release happens and yay this delight

258
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:45,119
like wow celebrating that so

259
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:51,119
so dear ones the time has come for us to

290
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:13,440
