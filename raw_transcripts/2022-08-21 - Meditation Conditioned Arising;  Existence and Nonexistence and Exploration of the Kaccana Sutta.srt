1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:07,200
well good morning everybody good day and i'm aware that this is um being

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,719
webcasted as well and so there may be folks joining online so

3
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:19,279
we have to ima and kind of stretch our imagination to feel the

4
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,320
sense of kind of practicing together

5
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,000
english multiple forms

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,680
so we'll start um with a meditation

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,760
and this morning and i wanted to invite

8
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:50,559
in our meditation paying particular attention to the conditioned nature of our experience

9
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,600
so our offer some guidance and maybe particularly at the beginning

10
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,640
of the meditation maybe towards the end

11
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:08,960
and hopefully those pointers will offer something for you to explore in our meditation

12
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:17,040
so we'll begin our meditation by maybe just begin to pay attention to our sitting

13
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,119
position and sitting postures and if you like to close your eyes

14
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,560
feel free to gently close your eyes or if you like to keep it open that's fine

15
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,040
also

16
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:42,880
the first few moments arriving at our seats and our cushions

17
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,079
allow this arriving to be

18
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,640
just taking its time letting it take its time

19
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:04,840
maybe having some generosity towards this process of arriving

20
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:18,480
sometimes and there is a sense for me as if the flights are landing

21
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:26,160
i'm not completely stopped just yet and coming to our seats

22
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,200
arriving may feel a little bit like that

23
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:40,640
maybe our minds are still moving about thinking this and that

24
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,239
our bodily energy

25
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,000
can feel a bit bubbly

26
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,800
just by noticing that the arriving is happening

27
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,480
mindfulness is already here

28
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:37,079
become available to this process however it's unfolding

29
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,560
taking a few long deep breaths

30
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:04,000
maybe as you breathe out allow that sense of arriving

31
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,439
to settle even deeper

32
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,600
become aware of this whole body sitting

33
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,040
right here and right now

34
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:14,240
that's the first few moments of our sitting i invite you to rest your awareness

35
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,000
in the lower half of the body

36
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:30,160
what's the felt sense of sitting against the chairs the floor

37
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,840
pressure a weight

38
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,720
underside

39
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,600
maybe some sense of energetic settling downwards

40
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:13,319
supported by earth grounded

41
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,919
we can tune in to the stability aspect of the body

42
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,720
by resting in the felt sense of earth element

43
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,599
firmness of the bones

44
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,840
the stability of the pelvic floor

45
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,680
supporting the rest of the body

46
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,919
he's sitting like a mountain

47
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:57,840
you can expand to include the earthy

48
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,319
earthy feeling of the rest of the body

49
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,800
maybe the strength of the spine the weight

50
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,599
of the limbs

51
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,440
and steady

52
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,800
maybe you already noticed with the

53
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,160
steadiness as the backdrop

54
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:09,839
there is a movement in the body movements of the breath

55
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,120
dancing sensations of the body

56
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:45,440
receiving both the steadiness

57
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,160
and the movements

58
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,279
we can expand our awareness even further

59
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:06,320
to receive the movements in the mind the emotions of our

60
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:11,560
our dancing emotions in our experience

61
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,920
thoughts memories

62
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,800
so waves of emotions are ripples

63
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:05,120
including in our field of awareness

64
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:13,279
all experiences coming through our senses sound

65
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,680
smell

66
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:40,160
today i would like to invite you if you like

67
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:47,600
to pay particular attention [Music] on how experiences

68
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:55,360
arise and pass as a conditioned phenomenon

69
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:05,879
maybe the sound of my voice coming you hear the words

70
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,160
having some perceptions of it

71
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,959
and noticing what arises right after that

72
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:27,600
curiosity aversion too much too little

73
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,639
and there may be stories about it about yourself others

74
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:49,399
this comes through a conditioned

75
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,320
process

76
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,600
with a sense contact of hearing

77
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,560
evaluation and judging and

78
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,399
storytelling arises

79
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,040
and noticing how they pass away

80
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:38,720
i'm becoming really interested in the unfolding of your lived experience

81
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:45,800
right here and now not to think about it

82
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,810
trying to figure it out just sitting here

83
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:58,320
[Music] becoming available

84
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,480
to the unfolding of our experiences

85
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,639
so

86
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:23,200
if you find yourself a wandered away from here and now

87
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:31,440
it's never too late to simply return to the simplicity

88
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,320
of this experience right now right here

89
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:34,519
[Music] so

90
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:43,869
[Music]

91
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:07,840
hmm so good to see you all to be with you all

92
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:16,000
uh what's on my mind today to share as a dharma talk um

93
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,118
i'll continue to invite you on a kind of simplicity of a being as you listen to

94
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:29,040
this dharma talk and just you know bring your body along bring

95
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:34,878
your mind along and checking how you are periodic periodically

96
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:40,960
what i'm offering is not separate from it

97
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:49,919
so i want to start by sharing on a story and i recently read an article by

98
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:56,960
lama rod owens called do you do you know your true face

99
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:03,280
and in this article he wrote about after

100
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:10,800
his three-year dharma teacher training training program and he had a period of

101
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,560
his life that he felt quite uninspired and even used the word

102
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:24,560
breakdown you know it was challenging and so

103
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:32,000
he turned towards it and very quickly he had an insight into what was

104
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,359
happening and so this is those are the words um

105
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:44,480
that he wrote he said that my identity as a llama and a

106
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,599
resident teacher had somehow choked my identity as a

107
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:56,640
queer black man i was privileging the llama over rod

108
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:05,280
and rot this being and have many different needs different roles and different identities

109
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:13,680
and the rod got subsumed by lama and the resident teacher

110
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,880
when i read this i immediately resonated with it deeply

111
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,079
and and found much humility and

112
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:29,440
wisdom in what he said i think all of us probably have seen and

113
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:36,400
this version affecting ourselves um so in the pursuit of

114
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:43,440
our own ambition our hobby our passion or simply wanting to be who we wanted to

115
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,960
be you know really wanted to be very inspired for being this person

116
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,450
and um we may have joked

117
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:59,760
[Music] word or suffocated

118
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:06,079
as other aspects of our beings and so i want to share

119
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:14,880
a story of my own i remember some years ago in my work life i

120
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:22,240
was very busy and was doing very well and i got caught up

121
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:29,599
by the momentum of it and i remember there was one morning and that i had to get up to do a

122
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:36,400
presentation that happened at 5 30 in the morning to a very important client

123
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,839
and i had hoped that my baby boy won't wake up 5 30 in the

124
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:47,280
morning and he was very young and but you know what the moment i started

125
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:53,440
my presentation he was sitting upstairs mommy mommy

126
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:59,040
and so um but i ignored him because i got very

127
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,480
important presentation right now and i gotta go do that and i finished my

128
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,400
presentation and went up uh stairs to check him

129
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:17,440
and he was sitting by the stairs very quietly holding a piece of paper in his hands

130
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:23,839
and i looked at the paper and he barely was able to write anything at that time

131
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:33,560
and it said you are the baddest mom i ever knew

132
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:40,560
so that was a wake up moment so

133
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:47,520
just like llama rod owens and i was privileging

134
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:54,960
a scientist a career woman um over a mother a spouse and

135
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,880
in the rest rest of me

136
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:07,040
and so it's uh worthwhile to notice that uh in each of us

137
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:13,119
there's a whole community within us and there's a whole community community around us

138
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:19,040
um our dharma practice in what invites us to become aware there's a whole

139
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,880
dynamic of the different aspects of our being when we're not aware

140
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:32,160
it's very easy that we create favorites the ones that we really want to be

141
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,280
and the ones that you know rather they don't exist

142
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:45,920
and so this brings me to a short suta that i want to share with you today

143
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:52,800
called kachana this this is in samyata nikaya and

144
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,920
in the chapter around dependent origination

145
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,920
and so in the sutta venerable khachanon is asking the buddha

146
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:09,520
a question about how to define right view [Applause]

147
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,720
well many of you might be very familiar with the notion of a right view which is

148
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:21,119
the first path factor of the noble eightfold path and in this suture

149
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:28,880
and the buddha had a very specific definition for it which i want to share

150
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:34,880
but in answering this question the buddha first made a few quite

151
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:41,440
dramatic statements so he began by saying

152
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,720
this world mostly relies on the dual notions of existence

153
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:53,680
and the non-existence so this world mostly relies on the new

154
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,680
notions of existence and non-existence

155
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:06,960
then i'll unpack this a little bit and first by maybe unpacking the word and the word

156
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,079
world the world often

157
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:20,000
when the buddha spoke speaks about a spoke about the world the world is not necessarily something

158
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,240
kind of out there but the world is often defined as

159
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:32,640
our direct experiences through our sense context you know and our sixth senses

160
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:39,119
cite hearing smelling tasting touching and mental activities

161
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:45,599
and through this our subjective experience come about right we make contacts with

162
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:52,319
the sound with the smell and we can directly experience what's happening

163
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:58,000
and the broader world is kind of experienced through our senses as well

164
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:05,280
so there is in a way there is no world out there but through our direct experience with the

165
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,560
senses [Applause] so the world mostly

166
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:15,599
or by and large relies on the notions of existence and non-existence so what does

167
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:21,440
this mean and so existence non-exis existence um

168
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:26,640
in the chinese parallel i use the word becoming

169
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:31,680
and non-becoming some of you might be familiar with this and it's

170
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:36,640
often present in the suttas

171
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:43,040
but if we go back to the stories i told early on

172
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:49,359
we can see that sometimes we get stuck um the idea of

173
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:54,800
who we are our identity identities our roles

174
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:00,560
uh you know i am so and so and so i must do so and so

175
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:07,520
and when we have this kind of

176
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:13,680
ideas sometimes they're very deep and subtle we don't even know they exist

177
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:20,960
sometimes there may be very visible momentarily but when they really are in the core of

178
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:28,079
our being what happens is that we can orient and organize our whole

179
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:37,200
life around these ideas right and if you want want to be or you are a great poet

180
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:45,040
then your whole life activities could be centered around that notion

181
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:51,200
you know six o'clock in the evening you might forget about putting dinner on the table

182
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:57,760
or you know your child is asking to go out and play in the backyard no i'm busy you

183
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:04,880
know i gotta write this poem and and so this ideas can

184
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:11,200
become a basis or in this notion of we rely on those ideas

185
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:17,760
to live our lives and the opposite could be true also you know if some of

186
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:25,760
us may have parts of ourselves we would rather them not be there we have certain ideas that

187
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,680
maybe i'm just not this material you know i'm just not an artist and

188
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:38,079
and maybe that's something that happened very early on in our life

189
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:43,119
very young we had this ideas i'm not good enough for a certain thing

190
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:49,359
and that get reinforced by culture around us or

191
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:56,160
environment that we're in and then we have a deep seated ideas this is and then this is who we are and

192
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:01,920
and no we're just not that so um

193
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:07,599
and then with this kind of ideas what can happen is that

194
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:13,520
we also organize our lives around this ideas or maybe

195
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:19,440
organizing activities around this kind of activities

196
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:27,359
maybe we don't care about this part of us at all we may even be violent against them

197
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:33,359
when these parts of us show up and so there is can be this

198
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:40,800
sense of what the buddha is pointing to relying on non-existence kind of really denying

199
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,839
that and

200
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:52,319
and nama rod owens in this article uh spoke a bit about this and he said

201
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:59,280
to resist naming our identity locations is to commit a kind of aggression toward

202
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:05,680
ourselves and to further obscure blind spots that hurt others

203
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:12,800
others are hurt when they're not seen invisibility is another form of violence

204
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:21,280
and oppression and so this is not an existence in a way it's also pointing at

205
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:27,240
the invisibility that can happen

206
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:38,480
but because of this ideas [Applause] are not the reality of our direct

207
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:45,040
experience in our direct experience you know maybe we are

208
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:51,040
working on poems or doing some activities for a while

209
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:58,240
um being a poet but the other situation comes up

210
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:03,599
for caring for others and caring for themselves happens

211
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:08,960
then the situation change so can we

212
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:14,960
in the situational transitions can we recognize that is

213
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:22,000
happening and honor that that is how that is happening in our experience right now

214
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:28,319
when we don't we hand on to that idea of i am so and so

215
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:33,839
we rub against the reality of the situation and that

216
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:41,200
rubbing against began to create a lot of stress in ourselves and for others right this this

217
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:46,640
rubbing against so these are not mistakes that we blame

218
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:52,640
for ourselves but it's pointing to the fact that

219
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:58,559
when we're not aware um what is happening we can live our huge

220
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:05,660
part of our lives based on this kind of ideas and without us knowing it

221
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:11,359
[Applause] and we can also see that those are the ideas and that

222
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:17,440
can play at a societal level right certain categories of people may have

223
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:24,870
certain ideas about being more worthy of their existence

224
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:32,000
[Music] and others may have the opposite and you can see you know a lot of the inequality

225
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,680
and conflicts and injustice began to kind of bubble up from this

226
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:44,720
kind of ideas and they often can trace down to the notions of existence and on existence of

227
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:50,240
becoming a non-becoming so it's quite humbling to see those

228
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:56,480
ideas live and operate in us in quite deep ways

229
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:04,559
the buddha continues to point out the deeper phenomenon that exists behind

230
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:11,280
this notions i wanted to just point out for some of you who might be very geeky about this

231
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:17,040
the way that i'm i'm choosing to kind of express the unfolding of the

232
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:23,680
suta is based on the chinese parallel version they have a different order in

233
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:29,280
terms of how the teaching is presented in the poly canon

234
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:36,640
it doesn't it makes not a whole lot of a difference in um what i'm presenting here

235
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:44,000
but for me that ordering seems to make a little more sense in my own mind

236
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:50,079
the buddha continues to say that the world is for the most part shackled

237
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:54,960
by attraction grasping and existing

238
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:01,760
but if when it comes to this attraction grasping mental fixation existence and

239
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:09,280
underlying tendency you don't get attracted grasped and committed to the notion

240
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:14,720
myself you will have no doubt or uncertainty

241
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:21,119
that what arises is just suffering arising and what ceases is just

242
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:27,200
suffering seizing your knowledge about this is independent of others

243
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,800
and this is how right view is defined

244
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:39,440
so the first thing the buddha is pointing out and after he spoke about

245
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,720
the world in the world mostly by and large relies on the notions of

246
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:50,880
existence non-existence is that he's pointing out a deeper force

247
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:57,680
that keeps those ideas alive in this and that is the forces of grasping

248
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:02,800
cleaning craving attachments

249
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:08,880
it's through the grasping and attachments that this ideas are kept

250
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:14,240
alive in us i know um this is something for us to

251
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:21,280
see in our direct experience without grasping

252
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:27,359
you know the idea i am a scientist i'm a courier woman it's just momentary and

253
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:34,160
it's a thought comes from time to time and it goes just a thought

254
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:39,680
but when there is a craving to continue to establish this

255
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:46,800
i like those the translation word commit we commit to it again and again

256
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:53,520
now this idea becomes hardened in us more and more and can almost become a core of

257
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:58,800
ourselves because i am this person right i am

258
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:05,520
and so it's um what the buddha is pointing at is to begin to see

259
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:11,599
this underlying force of grasping and clinging and craving

260
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:19,440
in our meditation i also offered to maybe see this conditioned nature of

261
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:25,599
our experience directly you know those are some things that we can see

262
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:30,720
so we can even do a little experiment right now and then see

263
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:36,800
how the condition the phenomenon of existence comes to be

264
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:43,040
so i'm going to tell you all a little secret about yourself that you don't

265
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:48,960
know maybe you know but pay attention to what i had to say

266
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:57,599
and see what happens in your experience so i'm going to to say this

267
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:03,440
you are all such wonderful yogis

268
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:09,359
have anybody told you about this you are all

269
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:15,040
wonderful brilliant yogis see what happens in your lived

270
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:20,319
experience maybe there's some pleasantness in you

271
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:25,520
pleasant feelings in you some recognition

272
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:31,040
maybe sometimes there is that kind of a huff and puff kind of leaning in you know

273
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:37,440
boy wow i am a great yogi or some of you might say but it can't be

274
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,800
me you know that can't be me and so you can see

275
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:49,839
just by hearing something i said that can be different responses coming

276
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:55,520
out of it and sometimes the sense of itself is very obvious

277
00:53:55,520 --> 00:54:02,319
and sometimes that sense of a denial is very obvious right and so this is the

278
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:09,520
um the direction that the the buddha was pointing at began to notice

279
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:16,079
that the leaning in or pushing against and you can see you know now if the

280
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:21,359
whole room is telling you the same thing and then watching this process happening

281
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:26,640
again and again no doubt i am a great yugi

282
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:32,240
there's no doubt and here it is you know a great set up before a

283
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:37,920
failure right somebody just shows up and mildly criticizes boom the whole bubble

284
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:44,960
bursts and so this commitment to this notion

285
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:53,000
keeps this ideas um kind of held up held up there

286
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:56,319
um

287
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:05,119
so you know the the notion of existence and non-existence can feel quite

288
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:12,160
abstract and high level and philosophical but this right view the definition of

289
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:17,920
the right view that the buddha is appointing to is really inviting us to see this

290
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:24,640
directly in our lived experience and i like that the chinese translation for

291
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:31,760
right view some of you may know this and also has a literal meaning of

292
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:39,200
directly see direct seeing the second half of the sutta the buddha

293
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:46,240
explained how this right view can be established through seeing

294
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:52,319
and so this here it goes but when you truly see the origin of the

295
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:59,440
world or with the right understanding you won't have the notion of non-existence regarding the world

296
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:05,920
so when you see how things comes to be you won't have this idea of

297
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:12,160
non-existence regarding the world and when you truly see the cessation of

298
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:20,319
the world with the right understanding you won't have the notion of existence regarding the world

299
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:27,080
so there are two things happening here and let's unpack this a little bit one by one

300
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:32,799
[Applause] a few key words here

301
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:40,480
when you truly see with right understanding right understanding here the pali term is sama

302
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:47,200
panya right wisdom a clear wisdom

303
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:54,640
when you see with a wisdom what do you see seeing the origin of the world

304
00:56:54,640 --> 00:57:01,599
seeing how the world how the phenomenon arises seeing the condition the nature of

305
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:08,960
arising so for example we are all here in the situ situation or

306
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:14,880
in you know listening to a dharma talk and practicing together

307
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:23,359
and this isn't the arising of the situation but it comes with a whole host of causes

308
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:28,799
and conditions you all probably drove walked and

309
00:57:28,799 --> 00:57:34,079
the schedule happened to be like this and you and i are all present here and

310
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:41,440
there's a whole host of conditional conditions that led to the situation we're in right now

311
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:47,599
right here and we can't just say this doesn't exist

312
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:53,200
we can't just deny no this doesn't exist you know this is all just a fantasy no

313
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:59,520
in our direct experience we experience this truthfully

314
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:05,920
there's a truth to this existence so when we know this the notion of

315
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:11,200
nothing truly exists all doesn't exist

316
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:16,640
that makes no sense right and so that's what the buddha was pointing at

317
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:22,880
when we see the conditioned arising of our phenomenon

318
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:28,000
non-ex nothing exists makes no sense

319
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:34,799
you know and then when we truly see the cessation of the world

320
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:40,079
when we truly see the ending of our experiences

321
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:45,280
and the notion of a permanent existence long-lasting existence

322
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:52,558
makes no sense and we see that the meeting ends um

323
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:58,480
you know the situation ends let the things

324
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:03,760
stop we can't just say oh this is going to go on forever you know that makes no

325
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:11,200
sense and so what the voodoo is pointing at is

326
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:18,640
in our lived experience when we begin to clearly see the arising and passing

327
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:23,839
and the conditions leads to arising and passing

328
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:30,960
we began to see for ourselves that hang on to this notions of

329
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:37,599
existence non-existence totally makes no sense

330
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:44,000
and we know this for ourselves and what that entails

331
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,680
is very simple direct awareness

332
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:56,559
and really being present for this arising and passing because what can happen oftentimes is that we

333
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:02,559
don't quite see so we just hold on to that notion in our head most of the time

334
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:09,040
in a way our meeting ended but we're still thinking oh you know this this would happen again and you know we just

335
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:14,480
kind of have ideas to keep things going so in this article

336
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:20,799
um lamar rod owens speak about this radical presence

337
01:00:20,799 --> 01:00:26,640
that points to this particular dimension of being aware

338
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:33,280
it says radical speaks to a sense of remembering and returning to a simple

339
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:40,400
and a basic way of being in the world when we choose this way of being in the

340
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:47,760
world we feel at home in our own body with no desire to live it

341
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:53,599
because we feel at home in the body we feel at home in the world

342
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:57,839
this is a radical presence

343
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:05,119
and when we know this conditioned arising and the passing of our

344
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:11,040
our experiences what can happen is that

345
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:18,079
we grant fluidity to our identities it can float depending on the situation

346
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:25,920
we're in you know this moment we can be students and teachers next moment we might be buddies

347
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:32,880
and we can become fluid and we don't have to carry all these ideas along with us

348
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:40,480
and um and the llama rod owens had this sentence which

349
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:46,079
spoke to me deeply he said practice grants us as a space to allow this

350
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:51,680
shifting to happen and to call that shifting our home

351
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:57,839
so instead of relying on the notions that seems to be quite permanent and

352
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:04,640
persistent making that at your home and ground here

353
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:11,280
we rely on the ever-shifting changing of our direct experience and

354
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,720
calling that our home

355
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:24,319
and so i want to end by

356
01:02:24,319 --> 01:02:30,799
um sharing the next piece of the buddha's teaching

357
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:39,039
which probably really need another dharma talk but i think we will just end with that um

358
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:44,480
and i'll do a quick summary after that and so the buddha went on

359
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:51,119
to give the teachings on the middle way and he says o exists katyana this is one

360
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:56,160
extreme o does not exist this is the second

361
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:03,520
extreme without a veering towards either of the six dreams the tatakata teaches the

362
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:09,280
dharma by the middle and this teaching by the middle

363
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:14,400
is not in between existence or non-existence but the teaching

364
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:19,440
by the middle is the 12 dependent origination

365
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:25,280
of the dukkha of the suffering and the dependent association of the

366
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:32,960
dukkha and usually this link starts with with ignorance as conditioned relational

367
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:39,920
formations comes to be with the volitional formations as conditioned consciousness comes to be

368
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:45,839
and then all 12 links all the way to how the whole mass of the suffering

369
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:51,599
comes to be and so that's you know there are 12 links of this

370
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:58,160
and then the cessation also follows a similar pattern but it says

371
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:05,599
something like this with the reminder list fading away and the cessation of ignorance comes the

372
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:11,839
cessation of relational formations with the cessation of relational

373
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:18,559
formations cessation of a consciousness and all the way to the cessation of the whole mass

374
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:22,720
of dukkha or suffering

375
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:32,079
maybe what's more important is not necessarily to kind of

376
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:37,839
remembering this 12 links but to begin to really pay attention

377
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:43,119
to our lived experience how the dukkha comes about

378
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:48,960
and how they cease began to see the underlying

379
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:56,799
conditionality in our direct experience because when we know this for ourselves and this

380
01:04:56,799 --> 01:05:02,480
said that your this knowledge is independent of others

381
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:09,359
no one else can talk you out of it because you know this for yourself

382
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:14,400
and that began to offer a potential to shift

383
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:19,359
shift the perspective shift our behaviors

384
01:05:21,359 --> 01:05:26,640
i want to end with this quote from

385
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:31,760
the activist um james botwin

386
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:38,400
and he said i am what time circumstances in history

387
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:45,520
have made of me certainly but i am also much more than that

388
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:52,240
so are we all and so when we see the conditioned

389
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:59,280
natures of our experience we can acknowledge

390
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:04,880
what is here what is here right now what is true

391
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:10,079
for ourselves not denying not indulging

392
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:19,799
but when we see this we also let go of the limitations of notions of who we are

393
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:27,920
and what this uh last line that he said point out to is i am much more than that

394
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:34,079
all of us are so there is a vastness of all of our beings

395
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:39,520
that is not defined by the limited notions and ideas and beliefs that we

396
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:45,440
have for that is done through our direct

397
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:51,280
knowing of what is happening what is here

398
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:59,839
so thank you everybody for being here and we we have a few minutes for any

399
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:07,119
comments and questions or sharing you have reflections you may have

400
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:15,838
and the floor is open

401
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:25,280
here we go just one second thank you

402
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:31,200
i appreciated and feel like

403
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:38,880
i got what you just said yet i don't i haven't studied and i don't understand

404
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:44,720
independent origination do i need to understand that to have

405
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:52,720
understood your main points today well you seem to have answered the question to yourself

406
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:58,640
yeah so you have a sense you know in your own being and so

407
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:05,280
this uh talk is pointing at really begin to pay attention to what is happening

408
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:11,119
and maybe when there is a chance to study we don't have to resist that also and

409
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:16,960
come along and that's good but it's not dependent on that

410
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:22,318
i think what is more dependent on is to begin to pay attention to what is happening

411
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:28,318
yeah do you have any recommendations for reading for

412
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:36,120
understanding [Laughter] there's so many

413
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:44,719
i'm sure even on audio dharma if you search on some talks on dependent

414
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:51,960
origination i'm pretty sure you'll find talks on this thank you yeah

415
01:08:57,120 --> 01:09:02,719
um i have a personal question i heard that you started

416
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:08,480
your i guess path with buddha dharma it was mahayana buddhism but then you

417
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:14,480
got drawn to the theravada buddhist this is actually my first time ever in uh theravada

418
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:20,560
type of you know monastery but it's monastery so can you elaborate on like what uh

419
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:25,679
the difference maybe for also others seem like would be useful what the difference between mahayana and

420
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:31,040
theravada and why did you get get drawn to tiravada

421
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:37,120
yeah i um i feel a little hesitant to kind of um

422
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:43,199
i i don't feel i'm qualified to kind of do a real broader perspective i can talk

423
01:09:43,199 --> 01:09:48,719
about my personal perspective and what happened to myself

424
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:55,920
and i've continued to hold both of the lineages with high regards and

425
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:01,040
deep respect and i happened to start with mahayana

426
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:06,480
first because i met mahayana sanghas

427
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:12,080
and i resonated with a lot of teachings there a lot of

428
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:17,440
the community that i really enjoyed and

429
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:24,480
but the particular community i was part of we didn't have a lot of

430
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:31,920
meditative opportunities and i was very caught up by all the

431
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:37,840
teachings in my head and i just i felt like my head was about to explode if i

432
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:44,800
keep on doing the studying and i really needed to know this in my own experience and so

433
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:50,800
when i began my meditative practice it was in the theravada tradition and

434
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:58,560
that's when i began to meditate and that spoke so much to me and so

435
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:04,800
today i continue to maybe

436
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:10,640
study and learn in different ways in some different

437
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:18,719
traditions but now i i kind of um i bring along kind of my lived

438
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:26,159
experience and the direct experience driven practice with me and

439
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:32,480
so that helps me understand a lot of mahayana teachings

440
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:38,239
i wouldn't say a lot but i understand the certain dimensions of a mahayana teaching

441
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:45,520
and this particular suit i coated it was sometimes recognized as a seed of

442
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:52,320
the mahayana tradition because the scholar and the practitioner on

443
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:57,760
nagarjuna um had this um

444
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:03,600
profound teaching around the middle way and this was the kota he uh this was the

445
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:09,520
suta he coated yeah so there is a maybe a deep roots uh

446
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:15,840
deep common roots yeah thank you yeah thank you

447
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:22,400
oh no just a little follow-up so you mentioned uh direct experience do you mean like

448
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:28,880
direct insight or direct to you i guess to clarify um

449
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:36,320
direct yeah you said like direct experience i guess meditate direct meditative experience direct uh or

450
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:43,520
direct insight like this is inside meditation i guess right that's yeah the the practice that i'm uh mostly engaged

451
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:49,600
in is the inside meditation process like noting or the on the mindful meditation

452
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:54,640
what's uh yeah that also changed and gifted quite a lot you know over the

453
01:12:54,640 --> 01:13:02,320
years of the practice and i did a start with um amahasi sayadaw's tradition

454
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:08,480
and um and that kind of continued to evolve and this shift and change yeah

455
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:12,920
okay all right thank you yeah

456
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:23,920
i just wanted to appreciate your talk and your being here and to loop back to the beginning of

457
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:30,320
your talk with the experience of your child i i'm remembering

458
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:35,360
that my own young youngest child at one point said i'm going to go

459
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:39,440
on craigslist and find a better mom

460
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:48,159
i think all parents have been told this one we are another running their lives

461
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:54,719
yeah they're very honest untruthful it was great

462
01:13:54,719 --> 01:14:01,560
to have a mirror coming back yeah they all

463
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:08,400
you mentioned the chinese parallel um uh scriptures um

464
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:13,520
this is just a kind of a technical point because i kind of interested in this

465
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:19,040
but what i've heard

466
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:25,199
is that since the poly canon is

467
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:30,239
in a language that's close to what the buddha originally

468
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:35,840
spoke that it must be primary or primal

469
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:44,080
and that the chinese versions of the polycannon must therefore be a later translation

470
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:49,360
and so we can just stick with the polycanon right because it's closer

471
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:55,040
to the original and and yet i've also heard that there are a number

472
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:59,040
of places in the chinese

473
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:07,679
versions that are clearer or make a little bit more sense

474
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:13,920
and that perhaps therefore the polycanon might be

475
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:19,360
a later translation from the chinese that didn't get the translation very done

476
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:25,199
very well so in other words it's just not entirely clear uh

477
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:30,320
if the poly canon is always closer to the original teachings

478
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:37,520
whatever they were does does that make sense or is this something you yeah i don't know about yeah yeah my

479
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:44,560
understanding is this is an ongoing kind of scholarly study a topic for sure

480
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:50,880
there is no definitive statement to say that the parallels are

481
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:56,400
later than the poly canon there may be certain collections that

482
01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:02,239
one can make a little more definitive answer a statement than others

483
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:10,080
and so the chinese parallel comes from sanskrit collection so that's translated through

484
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:17,920
the sanskrit version but it's it's not totally uh clear

485
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:22,960
actually that there is a such definitive answer about which one is first and

486
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:29,600
which one is later and so um this you know this is ongoing

487
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:34,610
ongoing research still in this domain when i um

488
01:16:34,610 --> 01:16:40,880
[Music] for me personally looking at the different versions

489
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:46,880
um not encouraged for those who have a different

490
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:52,400
maybe either mother towns or different language capacities

491
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:58,800
to do look at different translations and they do have um they can be quite

492
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:04,560
meaningful for me because i'm not i wasn't born uh here and and

493
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:11,199
i didn't grow up here i came when i became a young adult i had a very little

494
01:17:11,199 --> 01:17:17,040
emotional association with english language and on

495
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:23,600
so the so is the translations you know and kind of like a lot of words as a

496
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:31,440
the emotional resonance with them is kind of learned you know a taste but what the chinese translations i have an

497
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:39,360
immediate sense uh oftentimes with what they are and in kind of in almost a somatic way

498
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:45,199
and so this is you know something for each of us to explore i mean looking at the different words

499
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:50,719
even the english translations there are different words um different

500
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:56,719
english words that translate on the same poly and poly term

501
01:17:56,719 --> 01:18:03,600
and so um they may be helpful you know that's a helpful aspect of studying and learning

502
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:09,600
so yeah so thank you for bringing that up it's just a technical note but but

503
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:15,760
sometimes you know the question does come up and and maybe it's just best to

504
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:22,800
look at all the translations if you have access to more than one version and and just sort out for yourself what

505
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:28,719
what makes most sense to you yeah yeah yeah and i know that that may change

506
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:36,320
over time [Laughter] yeah i think we're almost time so

507
