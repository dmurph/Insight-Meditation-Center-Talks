1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,759
okay let's go ahead and get started for those that I don't know my name is May

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,719
Elliot and this week we'll be exploring the Buddha's five daily

3
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:18,840
Recollections sometimes called the five remembrances or five Reflections and uh these are a series of

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,400
Reflections that the Buddha recommended that we we actively bring to mind daily

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,439
and when I learned that there was a practice that the Buddha actually recommended daily it really caught my

6
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:35,719
attention I was like oh well this must be important um however when I learned

7
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:41,079
what they were I realized they really weren't easy Reflections but I could see

8
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:46,239
how tremendously beneficial they could be um and when I actually practiced them

9
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,960
that's what I found so hopefully you'll think so as well so here are the five um

10
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,160
and to and we'll start with the first one today so the first is I am subject

11
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:04,559
to aging I have not gone beyond aging the second I am subject to illness

12
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:10,320
I've not gone beyond illness I am subject to death I've not gone beyond

13
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,920
death the fourth is I must be parted and separated from everyone and everything

14
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:24,240
dear and agreeable to me and the fourth I am the owner of my deeds and heir to

15
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,680
my Deeds Deeds are my womb my my relative my refuge I shall be the heir

16
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:37,360
of whatever Deeds I do whether good or bad so these are the five we'll do one

17
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,680
each day um and uh during the meditation period we'll actually practice with the

18
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,759
remembrances so today I'll provide a slightly longer uh premeditation intro

19
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:56,640
just to share about how we'll actually practice with them so we'll begin with just some quiet breath meditation so

20
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,200
that your minds can settle a bit become a little more calm and then I'll offer two ways to practice

21
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,959
with the recollection we'll start with um uh just dropping the phrase into the

22
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:14,680
meditation kind of like dropping a pebble into a pond uh without conceptualizing a response just seeing

23
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,120
what naturally ripples through the mind and heart uh so that's the first method and

24
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:26,120
then after that and maybe I should say that could be complete in and of itself that can be a complete practice but just

25
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:33,360
to offer you a variety of ways to practice with these teachings um we we'll do a second method and during the

26
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,319
second method we'll actually do an Engaged contemplation so a word on contemplation

27
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:45,480
um uh in these sorts of uh meditations we're actually we're we're intentionally

28
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,080
inviting thinking to occur um around a specific theme um but given that the

29
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,519
mind can be very discursive and one thought can easily lead to another and another and another um we're going to

30
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:01,800
keep a short leash on the thinking so so that um keep that in mind as we do the

31
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:09,040
contemplation and I'll remind you of that during the meditation um so that might sound like a lot um but

32
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,640
we'll keep it very simple just these two different practices um so uh returning to our

33
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:22,560
phrases um again today I am subject to aging I have not gone beyond aging and

34
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,360
while we all know this the purpose of this reflection is to help it sink more deeply into the heart to help us realize

35
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,040
it more fully so so let's see what happens during the meditation so go

36
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,879
ahead and find your meditation posture a position that allows you to be

37
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,560
both alert and

38
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:54,400
relaxed maybe Beginning by taking a few deep breaths

39
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:14,480
connecting with your meditation anchor that might be the breath maybe listening to the

40
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,759
soundscape may be a global sense of the body sitting or lying down in whatever

41
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,400
posture you're

42
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,280
in inviting the mind to rest

43
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,160
to settle on your

44
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,160
inchor so we'll have some time in silence now just to to

45
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:54,560
land to connect with the here and [Music] now to

46
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,639
settle

47
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,639
e

48
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639
e

49
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
e

50
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
e

51
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
e

52
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
e

53
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
e

54
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
e

55
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
e

56
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,360
e e

57
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,639
you notice that the mind is wandering gently and kindly bring your

58
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:52,000
attention back you might slide your attention back to the

59
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:01,240
Anchor especially if you're noticing that you're jerking the Mind back or tugging the Mind back to the present

60
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,680
just a smooth non-reactive slide back to the

61
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
now

62
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
e

63
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,160
e e

64
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,399
shift now to introduce our

65
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:34,439
contemplation just like dropping a pebble in a pond we'll drop in our

66
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:41,199
reflection just allowing the words to move through the mind and heart and body

67
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:50,160
and seeing what ripples out no effort to make anything happen or to squint to look too

68
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:59,440
hard here's the phrase dropping this in I am subject to aging

69
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,079
I have not gone beyond

70
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:20,680
aging just seeing what happens maybe nothing maybe

71
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:28,560
something I am subject to aging I have not gone beyond aging

72
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:39,560
or sometimes translated old age I am subject to old age I have not gone

73
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,519
beyond old

74
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:53,680
age taking a minute or two to play with this on your own at your own pace

75
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,920
maybe there's Sensations in the body maybe certain thoughts come to mind

76
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:31,199
and if they do you can include them you don't need to push them away you can see what sorts of images or

77
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:38,720
words arise in the mind it's part of the Ripple

78
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:26,000
and when you're ready letting go of the phrase and coming back to your anchor

79
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,639
allowing the mind to collect and settle once

80
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,880
again e

81
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,600
introduce our second form of

82
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,960
contemplation that'll include a little more

83
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:54,600
thinking this is our engaged contemplation we'll offer the phrase

84
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,840
again and this time with some questions to allow you to think about the

85
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,919
phrase see what comes up for you and I'll offer several several questions and

86
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:11,919
you don't need to reflect on each one uh just pick up whatever stands out to

87
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,919
you I am subject to aging have not gone beyond

88
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:29,200
aging so How Deeply do you know this do you know it conceptually only or

89
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,240
do you know it in your

90
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:55,000
core when you visually see that aging is happening how is it for

91
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,880
you maybe wrinkling skin sunspot graying

92
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,440
hair maybe a change in ability [Music]

93
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,240
levels how is that for

94
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:33,039
you it might be thinking that arises out of these of course but don't forget to

95
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:41,200
include the body so there may be some thoughts and there maybe physical Sensations emotions that arise so we're

96
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,840
including it all

97
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:11,440
when you feel Aging in the body how is that for you maybe less strength less

98
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,520
functionality i' had mentioned less ability

99
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:55,679
maybe memories come to mind a tenderness in the heart just

100
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,600
holding all of this with gentleness and kindness

101
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:21,519
when you consider old age is there fear if so what are you afraid of

102
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:57,600
what are you looking forward to what are you looking forward to as

103
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:05,360
you AG some of you of course May identify already being in deep old

104
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,840
age we we're all getting older we're

105
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,919
lucky so as you get even

106
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:22,360
older is there anything you're afraid of or looking forward

107
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,480
to e

108
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:17,840
imagine yourself in your ideal old age what does that look like what does

109
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:25,640
that feel like reflecting on this what does it feel like in the

110
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:31,919
body your ideal old age

111
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:16,480
coming back to the breath the body letting go of the

112
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,759
inquiry settling back into silence

113
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,880
if there's any tenderness in the heart whatever may be reverberating from the

114
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:57,000
contemplations including those including nose in these moments of Silence

115
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,440
together making space for them holding them with kindness and

116
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,440
compassion

117
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
gentleness

118
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

119
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

120
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

121
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

122
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,158
e e

123
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:48,559
knowing that all beings are subject to

124
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:54,559
aging may all beings be joyful and

125
00:28:54,559 --> 00:29:00,000
happy may all beings be strong and healthy

126
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:08,200
be may they be safe and protected and may they live peaceful and

127
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,518
at ease

128
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,919
thank you for your

129
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,240
meditation welcome

130
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:54,840
back so for those who are just arriving welcome to you my name is May

131
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:04,640
Elliot and I'd like to start with a poem po by K Ryan it's called the Niagara

132
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:13,080
River as though the river were a floor we position our table and chairs

133
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:20,200
upon it eat and have conversation as it moves along we

134
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:26,080
notice as calmly as though dining room paintings were being replaced the

135
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:34,480
changing scenes along the Shore we do know we do know this is the Niagara

136
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:40,120
River but it is hard to remember what that

137
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:49,080
means so here we are all floating down the Niagara

138
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,919
River we're all on this boat calmly rearranging the furniture watching the

139
00:30:54,919 --> 00:31:02,519
passing scenery and as K Ryan it we do know that we're all on the Niagara River

140
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:08,440
but it's hard to remember what that means so it's hard for us to remember

141
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:14,279
that as we live our lives we're all making our way to Niagara Falls we all

142
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:24,080
have an expiration date in other words we just don't know what it is yet so it's it's not news to any of you

143
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:31,240
that there's aging sickness and death and yet we don't often live with this

144
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:36,320
understanding so the Buddha provided us with a teaching so we could remember you

145
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:45,559
could remember what's hard to remember and what he offered us are these these five phrases five daily

146
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:51,480
Recollections um for daily reflection and for those just tuning in

147
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:58,360
I'll share them again I am subject to aging have not gone beyond aging

148
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:04,799
I am subject to illness have not gone beyond illness I am subject to death have not

149
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:10,480
gone beyond death I must be parted and separated

150
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:18,960
from everyone and everything dear and agreeable to me and lastly I am the owner of my Deeds

151
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,279
which sometimes translated as actions I'm the owner of my deeds and heir to my

152
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:30,279
Deeds Deeds are my womb my relative and my Refuge I shall be the heir of

153
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:38,320
whatever Deeds I do whether good or bad so these are the five and

154
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:44,399
clearly they're not easy they're uh they're not easy Reflections so we'll be

155
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:49,600
talking about that over the next couple days um and these come from um from the

156
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:55,519
angut nikaya 557 upana Su and they appear elsewhere

157
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:01,639
in the sutas as well so this this first phrase today I am subject to aging have

158
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:07,240
not gone beyond aging so we're all growing older and yet

159
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:13,200
we forget or actively deny aging um and you know this is common trying to look

160
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,960
young forever with products and surgery and all number of things I had an an

161
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:27,039
elderly Aunt who was very into making herself look young and she went to Great Lengths and great expense to do so and

162
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:33,080
um she wasn't married and she was she was dating well into her 80s and so here

163
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:40,919
she is she's in her 80s and when she'd go on a date and a man would ask her how old she was she would say I'm closer to

164
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:47,480
60 than 50 but she'd say this when she was in her 80s and technically it was true she

165
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:53,039
was closer to 60 than 50 but it was also a little misleading so people do all

166
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:59,480
sorts of crazy things to keep aging away and it makes sense because Western culture Rejects aging you know that

167
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:05,440
further amplifies our tendency to forget uh but something I find

168
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,800
intriguing is that this uh this tendency isn't just a present moment phenomenon

169
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:18,358
2600 years ago during the time of the Buddha people were also forgetting forgetting that aging sickness and death

170
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:24,599
are coming um that I am of the nature to grow old to get sick to

171
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:31,079
die uh so the Buddha must have realized that for most people these truths had not fully penetrated the psyche that the

172
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:36,760
the conceptual mind knows this but the heart doesn't so these these uh these

173
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:42,839
phrases they function to move move this truth these truths from the head to the

174
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:49,200
heart so through Daily Reflection uh we uh we can learn to live more in harmony

175
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,320
with aging not go to war with aging with these different experiences of life so

176
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,960
in a lot of ways we might say this is uh an acceptance practice we're coming to

177
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:05,079
terms with the way things are um because so much of our suffering

178
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:13,440
actually comes from being in contention with the way things are with the way things have come to be and part of learning to accept the

179
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:19,760
truth of Aging sickness death loss um is really it's a shift in our expectations

180
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:26,560
such that we're no longer surprised when they come for us so that's part of the way this functions the shift in expect

181
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:32,880
expectations um the former abis at Green Gulch F shider used to

182
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:40,359
say when firemen get to a fire they don't scream oh my God it's a

183
00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:45,400
fire no they've expected that's where they're going of course there's a fire

184
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:52,040
there no surprise so one way we suffer with aging sickness and death is that somehow we're

185
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:59,000
surprised by it it's like oh no what's happen happening something has gone terribly wrong

186
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,599
Frank ostaseski the co-founder of Zen hospice um he tells a story about a very

187
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,800
elderly woman on her deathbed and I don't recall exactly um she could have

188
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,839
been in her late 90s 100 something like that and from her

189
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:24,440
deathbed she whispered why me why

190
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:30,520
me so how can we shift our expect patients such that we don't take aging

191
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:37,319
and death as a personal affront on the contrary when we age it's

192
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:44,079
actually things are going right this is actually how it's supposed to happen and will happen and has been happening since

193
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:50,560
humans existed so one way these Recollections function is in in remembering them daily

194
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:59,800
is we become much less surprised um and and with it less fearful Charlotte Bronte quote to see

195
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:05,640
and know the worst is to take from Fear her main

196
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:13,359
advantage to see and know the worst is to take from Fear her main

197
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:20,160
advantage so when we've come to terms with the worst case scenario I am going

198
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:25,680
to get old I am going to get sick I'm going to die I'm going to lose everything I

199
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:31,200
love when we've come to terms with this here has lost its power over us in a lot

200
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,920
of ways and with it of course aversion has a whole lot less power over us because

201
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:44,359
this practice invites acceptance so uh at one point I was

202
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:49,480
exploring this practice um more rigorously and I

203
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:56,720
discovered an app a phone app called Aging booth and so you put a photo in you

204
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:02,880
press a button and it will age you by about 40 years or so so depending on how

205
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:09,720
old you are um some of you are already in your elderly Years and may not feel like you need any help visualizing what

206
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:15,839
you'll look like in old age um but for those who don't look so old yet Um this

207
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:22,119
can be a striking experience and to to face the reality of what's to

208
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:27,319
come and remember there's only one thing that can prevent aging and that's death

209
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:32,640
um so with this in mind maybe we should be delighted to

210
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:40,880
age and of course that's not the typical response so so by realizing these

211
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:48,240
truths um aging sickness death loss um the effect one of the effects is that we

212
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:55,720
actually can learn to live differently you know how does remembering these things affect what you

213
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:02,839
prioritize how does it affect uh what you allow yourself to become entangled

214
00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:09,599
in or uh get upset over does it bring

215
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:17,319
perspective how would you spend your time if you really knew that death could happen at any moment that you won't um

216
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:24,040
have your faculties Forever how does it impact your

217
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:29,079
relationships your willingness to forgive

218
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,599
so this is one of the fruits of this practice is that it um it changes our

219
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:43,800
priorities and it changes how we engage in the present moment so another function of this

220
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:49,640
practice um each of these these these phrases has a different function so the

221
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:57,720
the Buddha named a different function for each phrase so um so I am of the nature to age has the function of quote

222
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:03,119
overcoming the conceit of Youth overcoming the conceit of Youth so in

223
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:09,560
other words the the sense of immortality the sense um that this energy this

224
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:15,960
Vitality will be here forever um and instead uh realizing that Vitality is a

225
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:23,799
temporary resource can we appreciate any Vitality that we currently have any Vitality that

226
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:32,560
remains so as I mentioned earlier um as we do this practice it can be

227
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:40,920
difficult and I'm I'm not sure these phrases can be treated lightly on the contract contrary um and especially as

228
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:49,160
they progress they seem to get a little hard one through the first through the fourth and to get a little harder and a little harder as as they go for people

229
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:55,720
not for everyone but um with this in mind um please be be gentle with

230
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:00,880
yourself uh with when engaging in this practice I am of the natured age may may

231
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:06,079
not push any buttons for you um but some of the next ones

232
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:11,720
might so um yeah so please be gentle with yourselves titrate this practice um

233
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:19,119
little by little in small ways we really don't want to weaponize these phrases um

234
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:26,280
and use them in a way that that takes us out of our bandwidth of tolerance or that provokes grief in any way that

235
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:31,920
overwhelms our capacity to be mindful and if difficult emotions do

236
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,520
arise can just practice by recognizing them allowing them and remembering that

237
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:42,640
that these feelings are the same that move through all human hearts this

238
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:49,839
is this is uh the natural purification process um that humans experience when

239
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:55,640
they come to terms with these truths now not my grief but the great grief that

240
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:00,000
belongs to no one and visits visits us

241
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:07,640
all uh so if if it's uh supportive as you do these practices um you might you

242
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:14,119
might close with some meta or self self-compassion practice you something to sooe the heart if it's become

243
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:22,119
agitated um so let's close together in that way may all beings be happy may all

244
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:28,000
beings be healthy may all beings be safe and may

245
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,920
all beings be at ease thank you so much for your kind

246
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:40,160
attention today it's so nice to be back with you and I look forward to seeing

247
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:45,240
