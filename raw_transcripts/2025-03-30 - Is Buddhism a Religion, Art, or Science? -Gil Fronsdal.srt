1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:09,880
so good morning everyone can you hear me all right loud enough speak up if it gets to soft my

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,120
voice or wave your

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,039
hands so

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:29,400
um there was a time when I was in conversations where the question was is

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,800
Buddhism religion or not and it made some sense to have those questions

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:43,480
because uh oddly enough for me who my background is um I have a PhD in

7
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,800
religion so and that that's the area where you know that question comes up

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,960
you know and I was there studying Buddhist study so was I in the right

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,079
place and um oddly for me because I did not grow up religious and uh and oddly

10
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:07,439
enough being you know maybe now you're all abandoned IMC but um I in some ways

11
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,479
I don't not so interested in religion in some ways maybe maybe it doesn't look like

12
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:19,040
that and um but uh uh so is Buddhism a religion

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,840
or not so there's all kinds of question debates about that and the the the

14
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,360
funnest way of referring to that kind of humorous way I think it may be is that

15
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:39,119
um uh definitely is United States because uh then you get all kinds of tax

16
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:48,159
benefits whereas I was told in the Soviet Union it was definitely not a religion because there were benefits

17
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:55,439
because they were back then kind of anti-religion so B Buddhism is quite flexible that

18
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,079
way and um but I think uh another what's

19
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,360
more interesting for me uh as I've navigated my own practice in Buddhism

20
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,160
and practiced in different schools of Buddhism and had different kind of

21
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,280
philosophies in a sense of what Buddhist practice is what the bud Buddhism

22
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:28,200
is is um is um Buddhism more an art form of

23
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,920
art or is is it more a form of medical

24
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,920
research is it more Medical Science and um and the reason for that

25
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,080
distinction is that there are forms of Buddhism where the emphasis

26
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,720
predominantly the rhetoric predominantly is about just being in the present

27
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:58,000
moment and allowing some deep expression to come out of us and some people when

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,200
people have this will often refer to some something like the Buddha nature something profound within us that gets

29
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:10,040
freed and can move through us and respond to the world and uh and it's

30
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:15,360
more like the response more like the expression of an artist like someone who's a

31
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,400
dancer who who dances just to dance to express something in the dancing and

32
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,920
they're allowing something from inside to come forth or a singer maybe just singing for the singing um not singing

33
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,840
in order to do something else um maybe some painters are that way

34
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,000
maybe some painters are not some painters are painting to have a perfect picture you know for the con for the

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:48,239
results but some people are painting just for the expression that's there and in uh in uh uh in kind of

36
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,640
close to Buddhism in Japan the representation of this sometimes is in Te

37
00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:00,760
ceremony uh and and Associated Arts where it's really the the the the Beauty

38
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:07,079
and the art or the the what what gets born what arises in the care the love

39
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:15,000
the attention to detail the quieting of the mind and the heart to be really there for the activity itself that is

40
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,799
the purpose of it and it's more of more of an art than it is in order

41
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:28,160
to uh medical research or medical science um has a bias or maybe we call

42
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,520
it a preference um it's doing it for a purpose to have a

43
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:40,680
result when people are unhealthy the purpose is to find a way to help people become

44
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:47,919
healthy and um and uh there might be some deep upwelling of compassion that

45
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:54,360
Wells up from the Buddha nature of the researcher that inspires it but still uh

46
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,240
the research is all about looking for understanding something in order to

47
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,800
um bring Health to someone so is Buddhism more an art or is it more a

48
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:15,199
kind of uh personal Research into yourself to understand how you live

49
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:23,039
unhealthily may maybe if you prefer a spiritual way but uh you know uh I once

50
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:29,880
got criticized when I was a Zen priest for never using the word spiritual now I do it use it more often

51
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:36,319
and I don't know if that's better or worse but um but it it kind of touches something I think in the hearts to use

52
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:41,560
that word uh and so uh is it um you know

53
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:48,680
is it some kind of some spiritual Heth uh some people have uh become have an un

54
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,880
unhealthy relationship to spirituality because they've been betray maybe been betrayed by their

55
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:00,280
religion there are uh spiritual or ethical wounds that people carry because

56
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:06,919
of you know how they Liv their life or how people associated with them have live lived their life that they carry

57
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:14,080
for a long time so you know sometimes there's deep psychological healing

58
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:21,280
repair Corrections free uh that people are involved in and to Simply say just

59
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:28,160
kind of express your Buddha nature just sit here and just be um sometimes with

60
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,960
the School of Art uh often has the the the wonderful and challenging

61
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,599
instruction just be and that's a wonderful antidote to people who are

62
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:46,280
overd doers who are always straining and working and doing but um but you don't

63
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:52,199
tell a medical researcher just be it's okay just sit there and you're

64
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:57,400
you know in your office and just just just be and everything will

65
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:04,919
work out fine the researcher needs to be in the lab needs to engage there's something they have to

66
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:10,520
do and uh and sometimes the the just being school is a wonderful correction

67
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:17,199
for some people they finally relax and settle and then at some point when they really settle into the being then

68
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,599
they're ready to do in a beneficial way to to be you know to find the right

69
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:29,039
doing that moves along but sometimes the over emphasising of being I've seen the

70
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:36,319
emphasis then becomes um well it's completely okay just to be neurotic I just I'm so glad I found Buddhism

71
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,680
because now I can just go along and just keep thinking and fantasy think a lot oh just be okay that

72
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,680
for me that means just you know Daydream and think and plan and worry and that's

73
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:56,199
what I'm supposed to do because that's what being is for me and that's a little bit unfortunate it's kind of like saying

74
00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:02,080
um you know that um if you have a scab just be with picking the

75
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,599
scab you know and just and then uh and you know everything will be great but

76
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:15,039
this scab just gets the wound just gets bigger and bigger the more you pick it so so there's something about um but

77
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:21,599
then the people who are the medical research side of Buddhism some of them just research all the time and some

78
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,639
people they never get around taking the medicine or they are just you know

79
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:34,959
there's never any real healing from Being Human you know it just comes with its

80
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:41,760
challenges it comes with its tensions it comes with difficulties and um you know

81
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,399
I mean the classic difficulties of Buddhism highlights is that a few people

82
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,920
will eventually experience sickness old age and

83
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,079
death and um and so uh that's a challenge and so how do we live with

84
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:06,839
that and find our way with it and so if we're constantly looking for the cure for those things uh then you never

85
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:13,720
really get to the heart of the matter which maybe has more to do with the metaphorical

86
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:21,440
heart and so both both directions can be problematic but also in both approaches

87
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:28,240
I've seen in Buddhism can be at odds with each other we're the better way you're the lousy way you know but I

88
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:35,360
think maybe they need each other other maybe they they really should go together and uh and that's really the

89
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,920
best of all possible World worlds I love that I didn't think about it before when I did it but the fact that I put my

90
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,680
hands together when I said that in this uh Angel you know that's kind of

91
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:52,640
symbolic of how I see these two coming together and uh maybe in a reverent way

92
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,959
or respectful way they both need each other in some way the school of terad and Buddhism

93
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:06,040
that we teach here at IMC is more on the medical

94
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:13,600
research uh Direction and The Core teaching of the TR of this tradition goes way back to

95
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:20,160
the Buddha is very simple so simple that this is where someone people would look

96
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,560
and say is this really religion really this can't be enough this can't be the

97
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:31,240
core and that is um to not cause harm a

98
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:37,120
radical life of non-harming and uh and the Buddha

99
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:44,800
defined a um a wise person is someone who doesn't harm themselves doesn't harm

100
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,360
others doesn't harm self or others doesn't harm the whole

101
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:57,320
world uh that's an unwise person a wise person is someone who does the opposite

102
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,519
a wise person is someone who benefits themselves brings about the welfare of

103
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:08,240
oneself is involved with the welfare of others involved in the welfare both self

104
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,160
and others and Welfare of the whole world is that

105
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,600
religious that's that's what is that um maybe it's maybe Buddhism is

106
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:27,760
form of therapy medical therapy psychological therapy maybe that's what it is it shouldn't be a religion because

107
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:35,240
that if that's the heart of it everything follows from that the core principle ethical principle in Buddhism

108
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:43,680
is don't cause harm and uh this is a beautiful way that this is expressed I believe for

109
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:55,480
me abandoning The Taking of life one abstains from taking

110
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:02,880
life this gives freedom from danger hostility and oppression to Limitless

111
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,079
numbers of living beings in giving others freedom from

112
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:16,199
danger hostility and oppression one gains a share of unlimited freedom from

113
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:21,519
danger hostility and oppression this is a great

114
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,720
gift so number of things that this is the first ethical principle all the

115
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:37,839
Buddhism in a sense follows from this one principle one ethical principle and um and uh uh don't cause

116
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:43,839
harm and we learn in meditation how not to cause harm to

117
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:50,639
ourselves and in some ways the four noble truths are often held up as the Buddhist primary

118
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:58,800
teaching and uh usually they have this very big complicated confusing word suffering

119
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:05,720
that it's worded but maybe if it's word the the first Noble Truth is a truth of

120
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:12,800
harm the second Noble truth is the truth of how harm harm appears how it

121
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:20,079
arises the second is that it's possible to stop harming and the third is this is the way

122
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:26,959
to to not harm faithful path and so we learn not to

123
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:34,199
harm uh we learn and meditation is a a phenomenal place to learn how not to

124
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:40,399
harm ourselves one of the things that I learned uh uh primarily I think through

125
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:47,880
vasna practice when I was first started doing it in Thailand was that

126
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:53,959
um if I wanted to harm others I was harming

127
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:59,720
myself and became so glaringly obvious as the mind got quieter and Stiller

128
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:05,440
as I started sensing and more feeling of being more embodied in my body sensing

129
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,680
what was going on in deeper quieter or more peaceful ways that uh if there was a thought of

130
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,959
causing you know being angry with someone or being lustful for someone or

131
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:24,920
being you know resentful to someone or all kinds of things that I could feel

132
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:32,560
that I was harming myself directly I hadn't been able to to feel that earlier in my life because my whole

133
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:39,480
sense of I was so activated with all my preoccupations concerns desires feelings

134
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:46,040
busy busy mind that I didn't I wasn't that sensitive but meditation taught this

135
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:51,160
deep sensitivity that sometimes I like to call ethical

136
00:14:51,160 --> 00:15:00,279
sensitivity because you feel so deeply the impact of certain kind of ways of

137
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:07,680
being that if there's greed or hatred delusion it limits us it harms ourselves

138
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,199
to do that uh not to speak of if we do act it out and harm

139
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:19,839
others and also with this deep ethical sensitivity deep sensitivity we're much more attuned to

140
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:25,160
others we much more closely feel uh their

141
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:32,560
pain you know how they are it kind of harms ourselves kind of feel the pain in a certain kind of way when we harm other

142
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:39,880
people or we around people who have been harmed who suffer and to care for

143
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,959
that and um and so one of the things I discovered through this kind of deep

144
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:51,160
subtleness and meditation was that uh in a sense this place of just being that

145
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:59,519
from that was this deep sensitivity and from this deep sensitivity there came compassion

146
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,399
and uh and to my surprise that um that started to

147
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:12,040
become who I am more than any other way I ever had

148
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:17,600
thought of who I was as a human being before that that if someone had asked me

149
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:29,079
no I think nobody's ever really asked me this maybe but if if one of you asked me gil who are you I could sincerely say

150
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:36,440
maybe I don't want to say it because it sounds a little bit conceited or too much so so I'll kind of whisper

151
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,959
[Laughter] it I'm

152
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:49,120
compassion the compassionate response or if I want to kind of make it a little bit more simple I would say I'm the

153
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:56,199
appropriate response I'm the beneficial response and uh when I was at the Zen

154
00:16:56,199 --> 00:17:03,040
Monastery I found myself spontan iously saying to my zen teacher when we passed

155
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,720
each other on the trail one day on the path one day and I said I'm becoming a

156
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,400
response machine and so you have to forgive the word machine because that doesn't sound

157
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:21,240
so human or something but it was just what came out that was just expressing how I be you know this change that had

158
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:28,319
come over me so that was just the language I used but I was becoming just a a response and that response is very

159
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:36,440
much sent thir in compassion but that response of

160
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:42,640
compassion uh care is

161
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,720
both something that just is it's a beingness it's the art it's the dance

162
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,520
it's the song that we sing of course but built into

163
00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:00,640
it is is the medical researcher the medical

164
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,240
scientist built into it is well if there is harm here if there is hurt here if

165
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:15,559
there is suffering here let's understand it let's see how it can come to an end we don't just say

166
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:20,720
oh you're suffering just be

167
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,559
suffering just suffer better something you know that's kind of

168
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:34,400
what we don't say even though I do tell people that sometimes I'll explain why in a minute but um but

169
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,559
you know the idea is not just to continue perpetuating the suffering the idea is what what does it take to end it

170
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,960
what's the medicine what's the cure and there are things that Buddhism

171
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:54,320
teaches there are things that therapists can do there are things lots of people can help with and um and the Buddhism is

172
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,720
to really and the reason I chose Buddhism is in my youth

173
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,120
uh I knew nothing that went as deep into the human heart as Buddhism I knew

174
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:13,480
nothing that addressed the issues of being attached to self as Buddhism addresses that self attachment and I saw

175
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:19,840
that when I was young it kind of the deepest attachment we have so I wanted to be able to kind of come with that

176
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:26,679
medicine to the world or have that medicine for myself and um so we want to bring

177
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:33,200
suffering to the end so it do it's not just you know just be as you are be as

178
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,760
you are but there is a way that that being as we are has within it the

179
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:45,200
movement the desire to the end of suffering the end of harm causing it and experiencing it

180
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,440
and living with it and that's phenomenal is that

181
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:56,559
religion if it is that's my religion Dal Lama said my religion is

182
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:03,919
kindness so if he could say that I can say that my religion is the end of

183
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,039
harm the U and the reason sometimes I say you know to tell people you know you

184
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:14,840
you need to just suffer better it's kind of outrageous right but the reason is

185
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:22,039
sometimes we actually need to understand and feel and experience our suffering to really understand it to really be

186
00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:28,240
motivated to bring it to an end and they usually I say this to people if they're struggling with something and they know

187
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:34,280
that it's not healthy for them and they're trying to find a way um when I get a sense that they're actually have

188
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:40,480
never stopped to look at it they're always kind of recoiling from it or trying to find a solution from it but

189
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,520
the solution is by going through it rather than avoiding it or finding a

190
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,799
cure and so if the idea is to go through it I say you need to suffer better you

191
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:57,760
have to really experience it fully then I usually explain what I mean I don't just it's it's kind of cruel just say

192
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:05,280
suffer better but uh Buddhist teachers have certain permission to say certain things one of

193
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:11,960
the thing one of the things I feel like I permission to say this is also done very with in context you know and

194
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:18,880
usually people are willing to go along with it when I say this sometimes it's kind of a wonderful job because some of

195
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,200
the things you can say in order to help people you know

196
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:31,039
that's that's that's the that's the that's the whole purpose right so it makes me glad that I can help people but

197
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:36,799
occasionally I told people you know you're conceited where do you get away with

198
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:42,240
that you know that's kind of insulting to some people but usually it's in

199
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:48,400
context I prepare people for it and and usually they appreciate it

200
00:21:48,400 --> 00:22:00,360
because it's [Laughter] true and um so is Buddhism a religion or

201
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:07,600
not is it a art or is it a form of medical research

202
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:14,400
is it more like that and I kind of like to think of it as both an art and medical research and

203
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,840
the way I said that if we understand it as art if

204
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,360
you really do it well if you really become a dancer or singer well I think

205
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:31,720
it requires a deep deep sensitivity to oneself to one's emotionality to

206
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:38,400
one's expressivity a deep ability to let go of the inhibitions and the preoccupations

207
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,159
and the hindrances that get in the way of really being the art which hopefully

208
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:53,000
provides this deep sensitivity that what lives in US is compassion is care is the

209
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:00,559
desire for health is a desire for wholesomeness is a desire ire for our

210
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:06,039
goodness it's a desire for freedom and then it

211
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:11,520
becomes more the little bit more the medical research side of Buddhism okay

212
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,559
now let's let's work for that conversely or you know if you you

213
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,760
start with it being medical research and you do that really well then you start

214
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:30,000
finding the cure for your hindrances the five hindrances you start finding the cure for preoccupied mind and start

215
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,000
finding a cure from all kinds of things and you settle and relax and get

216
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,679
distressed and that reveals this place of deep inner

217
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:50,240
sensitivity that's the birthplace of you know this deep uh you know deep healthy wholesome

218
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,400
Source within us that we in our school we don't call Buddha nature um but

219
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:03,720
sometimes we can call it the literal word for it sometimes in our school which uh is is the

220
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:10,080
womb so that's kind of nice maybe uh that this that there's this profound place within us that's something

221
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:16,640
beautiful and wonderful can be born that can be expressed so we have these two areas two

222
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,039
two approaches and um and it's interesting I've been involved with different Buddhist

223
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:28,760
traditions and um and it seems like the rhetoric can be one or the other

224
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:35,600
but in practice they both kind of come together they both contain both within them these are not in practice are not

225
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,840
so separate from each other but it's kind of nice to know both and to and to

226
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:47,880
appreciate both so that um uh you don't become overly

227
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:54,000
complacent and you don't become overly striving and you find the middle way

228
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,240
between complacency and striving and so the over striving is the

229
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:05,559
medical approach the complacency can be the art approach but so they you have

230
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:11,520
either one they come together so that's my hope for how we

231
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:18,240
practice so um so it might be interesting

232
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:25,440
now for either the art approach or the medical research approach for you to

233
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:32,679
have a chance to say a few words words about where you fit in this

234
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:39,520
spectrum where do you fit how do you understand yourself if there if there is a spectrum between art and research

235
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,799
medical research where are you in this spectrum in your practice or your life

236
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:51,000
and your engagement or what struck you about this talk and um so you're welcome to sit

237
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,120
quietly and not participate in a conversation with someone you're welcome to leave if you're more comfortable with

238
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:03,120
that but the idea is to take about 10 minutes minutes for a conversation with um maybe a couple of people next to you

239
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:12,760
groups of three perhaps and um and uh and have a little conversation the idea is not for any one person to tell a long

240
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:18,120
story you know a 10-minute story to make your point no one has any chance but

241
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:24,720
actually the the art of this kind of conversing is to say just one and don't say all that you could say just make one

242
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:32,880
point make it well but somewhat succinct because the fascinating things about these conversations is not what you say

243
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,200
but what you hear so you have to give a chance for them others to hear

244
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:44,679
something but uh but you you want to you don't to speak too long because you want to be impacted by what you hear from

245
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:51,520
others and then you might learn more about yourself and you might find yourself when it's your turn again to uh

246
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:58,760
to say things you've never would have dreamt you would say new something new arises so um

247
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:03,880
so that's uh you know and then we'll come back to the whole group for a few minutes and maybe have a little more

248
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:12,600
discussion as a to group and then at at um 10:45 we'll um we'll um stop for the

249
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,919
potluck or the formal ending so if you don't mind if you're up

250
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:23,600
up for it to turn to someone near you and look around make sure no one some sometimes people one person's in the

251
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:31,080
middle and people turn away just because coincidentally just look around make sure everyone's

252
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:42,880
included well that felt like a lot of energy in here it felt like happy energy for the

253
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:50,799
most part I hope that was nice for you maybe given all the energy maybe we take 30 seconds to sit

254
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,158
quietly for

255
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:47,158
so in the silence I'll read two quotes from the

256
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:54,080
Buddha if Desiring

257
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,559
happiness you use violence on others Desiring

258
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:05,720
happiness then you won't find

259
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:16,919
happiness one who neither kills or makes others

260
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:29,679
kill who neither steals nor makes others steal is one who has love for all beings

261
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:38,200
so it's a religion of love a religion

262
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:44,720
of nonharming of

263
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,398
happiness or it's not a

264
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:59,320
religion it's about love and happiness and non-harming whatever that is it's good

265
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:04,799
so we have a couple of minutes before we we any last words any questions or

266
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:11,320
comments that you anyone wants to briefly make before we break for the

267
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,320
potluck

268
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:23,960
yes what's the poly word for womb oh it's uh

269
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:31,519
Yoni thank you and yeah Yi and it it doesn't literally mean

270
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:39,440
womb it just means Womb for humans it's uh it's the source for where

271
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,960
life comes from so like the egg is the Yoni for a chicken so there's you know

272
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:51,360
so so um so there are different different living beings come out of some

273
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:59,600
other various various things but uh for humans it's Yoni happens to be the womb

274
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:08,639
there's a wonderful story of but I've told this maybe too many times but the Buddha said something like if a

275
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:15,360
chicken sits on its eggs and properly and incubates them just like they're supposed to even if

276
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,480
the chicken does not want the eggs to hatch the eggs will

277
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:28,639
hatch and the same way if you live properly with the eighth fold path

278
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:36,480
even if you don't want to be enlightened you will become

279
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:43,279
enlightened so maybe like so so in that metaphor it's not a womb it's your eggs

280
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:49,360
sit on your eggs incubate you incubate let something gestate let something kind of be

281
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,120
nourished and

282
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:02,799
supported um uh thank you Gil um could you say a little bit about how you think

283
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:09,320
about or how you would recommend we think about so often times we're trying to not do harm but we feels that we're

284
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:15,360
embedded in a system that is either intent or designed to do harm so how do

285
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:22,880
you think about not doing harm when embedded in a system that feels like it wants to push us towards doing harm or

286
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,440
is built to do harm many years ago I was at a

287
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:35,440
uh kind of a panelist on a on a in a conference about uh Buddhism and ethics

288
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:41,320
and uh the panelists were all asked a question about um what's your biggest

289
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:49,039
ethical challenge as a Buddhist teacher and there was a Burmese monk who lived

290
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:54,480
in Bay area for a long time named Yanda until he died lovely

291
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,679
man and uh he was there and he said yes that my biggest ethical challenge is

292
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:07,880
that um um when the Burmese immigrants come to United States it's hard for them to

293
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:14,120
find work to take care of their family and some of them only can find work in the military

294
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:20,279
industrial uh industry and they come to me and ask me is this ethical or not

295
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:26,840
that I do this and I know it's unethical but I can't I don't I I can't I don't want to

296
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:33,679
I know how hard it is find work and take care of their family so I don't know what to say to them so I mean this is a

297
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,840
challenge many people have and so I just want to appreciate the challenge I don't know if I have a good

298
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:44,960
answer um and um but that's a kind of question that's really important to keep

299
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,440
and reflect and analyze and think about and certainly a small solution would be

300
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:57,919
can I make a difference can I make a difference within it many years ago there was a

301
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:03,399
I was teaching a class on Buddhism I think it was an academic class and uh

302
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:10,240
one of the students was a police officer and he said my department is kind of

303
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:16,158
corrupt and uh and I said well why don't you leave and he said uh no I feel like

304
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:23,118
I have to be there in order to try to make a difference make it better so that's one one answer and the other

305
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:29,440
answer that's one end of the extreme I guess the other end is to leave it

306
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:37,000
find another way to to have a life and then everything in

307
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:47,040
between I want to thank you for that question I appreciate very much that s
