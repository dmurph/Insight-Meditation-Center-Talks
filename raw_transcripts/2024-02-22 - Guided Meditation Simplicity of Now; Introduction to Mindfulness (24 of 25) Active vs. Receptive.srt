1
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:10,280
so hello and welcome

2
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:18,039
and if you I'll find a little amazing that this is the

3
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:24,840
24th talk of these 25 on introduction to mindfulness

4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,000
meditation I feel fortunate to be able to spend this time on these the basic

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,680
take instructions and develop it this way so thank you for the

6
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,200
opportunity and um so

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:51,840
today one of the Hallmarks of mindfulness practice is its

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,039
Simplicity there's a lot of instructions that can be given but those instructions should be

9
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:05,239
considered more descriptive than prescriptive in the sense that they

10
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:14,040
describe what we come across as we're present attentive attuned to our

11
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:22,200
experience the instructions in a sense are a map of your the range of important

12
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,479
range ranges of your experience that you then bring the Simplicity of mindfulness

13
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,520
to or say it differently you allow experience to come

14
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,360
to you and then you have the Simplicity of

15
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,799
recognition oh this is how it is this is how it

16
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:53,560
is it's this way now and you might try this little

17
00:01:53,560 --> 00:02:00,560
sentence as you practice either saying it in your mind or just

18
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:06,360
recognizing it silently that this is the way it is

19
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,319
now this is the experience now keep it that

20
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:18,800
simple but the word now at the end it kind of reminds you that it's

21
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,680
just the experience of now it's not forever it'll change in some way it'll

22
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,280
shift and change become something else become an appear in a different

23
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:39,599
way this is the experience now in the course of this now sometimes we experience breathing

24
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,280
sometimes the Body Sensations sometimes emotions sometimes thoughts sometimes

25
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,959
sounds and what I'll introduce today is attitude the general mood or attitude

26
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,599
with which we're being mindful mindful often is not so simple

27
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:05,159
we come along with subtle AG subtle or big agendas like we want something to happen we want something to go away we

28
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:13,080
want to attain something we want to hold on to something an attitude of this is

29
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,840
difficult or attitude of um you know this is too easy and I'm

30
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,920
I'm a sophisticated person an attitude of being for what's happening or being

31
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,680
against it and as an attitude what it means it's not really articulated

32
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:37,840
it's not exactly you know a thought or even a belief or you wouldn't if you just rely on what

33
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:45,200
you're thinking you might not even recognize this but it's the background mood with which you're being

34
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,760
aware and it's a little bit of a windrag to mindfulness it keeps it from being

35
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:58,680
simple it gives it weight it gives it tension strain uh

36
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,640
hesitation and it isn't that we have to fix this

37
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:12,159
attitude it's just one more thing that's recognized it's like this now this is

38
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:18,840
how it is now and to see it clearly recognize it

39
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,199
clearly and keep it simple so simple that in the

40
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:31,000
recognition there's a freedom or a in the simplicity

41
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,440
there's a peace in the Simplicity and if it seems boring that's

42
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:46,320
just one more attitude oh this is how it is now so we'll sit this way for the rest

43
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:54,360
of the sitting silently you can settle in on your own relaxing and

44
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,600
settling and then um maybe if you'd like you could use this phrase

45
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:08,280
it's like this now or this is how it is now but keep an eye

46
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:14,280
out from the beginning middle and end of the sitting for the

47
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:20,360
attitude with which you're being mindful if it's not obvious don't worry

48
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:26,319
about it but you might keep an eye out and see what it is and see what happens

49
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:32,039
if you simply recognize it oh this is how it is

50
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,039
now hold it in awareness and then maybe continue with

51
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:49,440
your breathing so so we'll start quietly silently this

52
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
time

53
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
for

54
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
for

55
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
for

56
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
for

57
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
for

58
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
for

59
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
for

60
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
for

61
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
for

62
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
for

63
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
for

64
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
for

65
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
for

66
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
for

67
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
for

68
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
for

69
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:02,680
whatever is happening recognize it as simple as you

70
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:12,040
can recognize what's obvious in the moment and if what you're aware of is

71
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:18,880
vague just know it as now I'm experiencing

72
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:29,839
vagueness if the mind is drifting off a lot this this is what a drifting off

73
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:38,199
mind is like any

74
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:46,040
attitude any feeling of being for or against

75
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:53,480
something any background desire

76
00:16:54,199 --> 00:17:00,480
aversion this is what's happening now

77
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,040
no need to go

78
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,600
searching and if you are searching recognize that you're

79
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:22,959
searching simple mindfulness of what comes into

80
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:30,400
awareness now

81
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
for

82
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
for

83
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
for

84
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
for

85
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
for

86
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
for

87
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:59,159
with the reference point of keeping it simple

88
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:08,080
with a reference point of just now you might feel or

89
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:16,159
recognize the pull away from that the drive to do other things

90
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:22,840
besides just the Simplicity of now this

91
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:30,760
experience and it's possible to know and recognize this is the drive away

92
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:37,440
from the present moment this is a drive away from

93
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
mindfulness

94
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
for

95
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
for

96
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
for

97
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
for

98
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
for

99
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:20,480
and then as we come to the end of this sitting take a few moments to

100
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:26,600
recognize whatever sense of Simplicity is

101
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,640
available if you're a little bit calmer or more

102
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:38,230
settled or if the awareness is a little bit more [Music]

103
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:46,880
clear or if there's a little more acceptance of the challenges that are

104
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:57,360
here and in this Simplicity to be still and gaze upon

105
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,120
what's what happening

106
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:15,200
kindly and then to bring into mind that you're going to come out of

107
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:22,279
meditation soon and maybe return to what is your

108
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:28,120
normal life or more complicated life

109
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:34,880
and from the vantage point of the meditation to be simple for a few

110
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,440
moments and gaze upon it

111
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,919
kindly considering the people you'll

112
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:54,279
encounter both people you know and people you might don't

113
00:27:54,279 --> 00:28:03,039
know you'll pass in the streets meet and in stores or work

114
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:11,240
anywhere and imagine yourself with kind

115
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:21,559
eyes a kind friendly disposition to everyone you pass or see

116
00:28:21,559 --> 00:28:29,440
or encounter

117
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:36,320
and is there any attitudes that get in the way of that Simplicity of

118
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:48,440
kindness and if there is recognize it this is what's happening

119
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:04,120
now and then returning to whatever degree of kindness good will you can

120
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:10,679
have and Aspire even if you can't do it aspire to be able

121
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:18,279
to wish everyone well-being may all

122
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:24,360
beings be happy may all [Music]

123
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:32,360
beings be safe may all beings be

124
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:37,840
peaceful may all beings be

125
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:48,320
free May kindness be carried in my gaze of the

126
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:54,729
suffering [Music]

127
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,089
world [Music]

128
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:09,439
thank [Music]

129
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
you

130
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:07,039
so hello and welcome to this pen

131
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:12,679
altimate teaching on introduction to mindfulness

132
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:21,480
meditation and one of the useful distinctions to

133
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:27,799
make is instructions in meditation which are prescriptive

134
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:34,760
and those that are descriptive and uh same instructions can be offered in both

135
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:42,200
ways and in uh prescriptive means this is what you do and so you apply yourself

136
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:47,519
to do something and descriptive means um it

137
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:52,720
describes what you'll be aware of the first is a little bit more

138
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:59,360
active and some people find it very helpful to engage actively with meditation it's kind of like play for

139
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:05,279
them and or it's they just naturally kind of enter into the world of doing

140
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:10,720
something um and so it's really nice for them to kind of engage in the

141
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:17,440
instructions like this is what you do and and uh and one way to do that is to

142
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,480
have a checklist to go through and you can do the what have the the the core

143
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:30,000
elements of this these five weeks mindfulness of breathing mindfulness of

144
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,559
body mindfulness of emotions mindfulness of thinking you can almost kind of go through and do a kind of little bit on

145
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:45,440
each one uh start with the breathing then recognize what's happening in the body then emotions and then uh

146
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:52,399
thinking or you can do the other way backwards and some people find you know to just have a very clear program like

147
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:57,799
that keeps them engaged keeps them focused and you know it's becomes an uh

148
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:05,120
you know prescriptive of what they do other people find that that's not helpful and other people find it's more

149
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,840
helpful to kind of sit back and not be so much in the active mode of practice

150
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:19,039
directive mode of practice but be more in receptive mode and uh and there the instructions

151
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:25,679
then become more descriptive that if you are present with an open available

152
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:31,519
awareness to the present moment experience then different things will come at different times whatever is

153
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:40,120
loudest in the sense maybe and um and so um and so sometimes you're aware

154
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:47,200
maybe the sound of a neighbor making and that's what's most predominant uh or maybe it's uh you know

155
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:53,679
sometimes it's the breathing sometimes it's an emotion sometimes thinking and it varies what comes into awareness

156
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:58,799
maybe it feels almost random but it feels so so relaxing and nice to not to

157
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:07,039
be the doer and just be in this kind of available present moment with this now

158
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:12,638
here this and um and sometimes it's useful to

159
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:18,398
know both ways and that there are times when we're more active in the practice

160
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:24,839
more prescriptive which is what we're doing and other times it's more descriptive we're just describing what

161
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:30,398
we're what comes and arrives in awareness so for example when we start practice

162
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:35,520
it's usually a little bit more active but as we settle and get

163
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,919
concentrated um still there's less and less that we want to be doing and we

164
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:49,000
more and more enter into a more uh maybe a receptive mode or um and

165
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:56,480
if if you go further even receptive is too much doing we're just there here and

166
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:03,760
phenom PHA experiences arise and um without receiving them or going to them

167
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:13,119
to experience them they're there and um so um so to be aware that

168
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:19,560
there's there's different modes in which we're being mindful sometimes a little more active sometimes more directed

169
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:24,920
directed to the breathing sometimes more I don't know if the word passive is

170
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:29,960
the right word but uh less doing and more being

171
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:36,440
aware and rather than directing the attention it's um there's there's no

172
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:43,480
choice or direction for what we're aware of except what comes and arises and uh and then there's a

173
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:51,240
combination of the two which is a little bit more what I like to teach and that is that um we all the default is always

174
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:56,839
to have the attention somehow directed or available or receptive to the

175
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:02,079
breathing the rhythm of breathing the experience of breathing um so there's a

176
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:08,760
steadiness and a subtleness and a as we go along and so the Rhythm the beat of

177
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:15,440
the breathing is a bit of a protection from mind wandering off uh

178
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:21,480
unknowingly and we spend a long time just drifting off in thought because we're kind of keeping breath at the

179
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:29,000
center we kind of more likely notice when we start drifting off if the mind is just receptive and

180
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,960
quiet and available to everything then kind of in a certain way everything seems okay and the mind drifts off and

181
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:41,079
we hardly notice it and uh and there isn't a Clarity of knowing oh the mind

182
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:46,920
is now thinking and um so the the com combined

183
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:52,359
to this kind of active and more receptive modes is to use the breath as

184
00:36:52,359 --> 00:37:00,520
a default but then whatever arises in any any direction any place that is more

185
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:07,880
predominant uh that becomes the focus of meditation so if it's a sound outside

186
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:14,119
then we do listening meditation if it's a sensation in the body we do sensation

187
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:20,160
mindfulness of sensation if it's uh thinking mindfulness of thinking if it's

188
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:28,079
um you know and it's an emotion mindfulness of emotion and it might seem random and it just as it as it works

189
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,480
out sometimes as the mind gets quieter Stiller more concentrated sometimes it's

190
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:38,520
like we go through layers within us and the different layers different parts of

191
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:44,960
this stand out sometimes more body sometimes more emotion sometimes more the cognitive

192
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:52,359
um um aspects of the mind and all along we want to kind of be

193
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:58,800
attentive to is there an attitude being cared buried in the mind is there some

194
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,319
subtle kind of mood that the it's in the awareness in the mindfulness maybe

195
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:09,440
there's a subtle or maybe not so subtle striving trying to get something maybe

196
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:15,240
there's subtle sense of of um in the Buddhist use of the word conceit some

197
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:22,400
idea that I am and it's I have to do it I have to be successful and I'm the

198
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:30,640
controller the agent the doer that is a little bit extra it's kind of like a mood or a flavor that's there that adds

199
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:36,119
a little bit of uh weight or a little bit of wind drag to the mindfulness it

200
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:45,720
does it it keeps the mindfulness to being really clear or just kind of open in a in a relaxed way

201
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:51,400
simple uh there might be attitudes of being uh background attitudes we carry

202
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:57,240
with us of being little bit aversive to everything that happens or every or it's

203
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:02,680
always an orientation to what we want wanting something and so this Le

204
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:08,520
slightest little Movement we become aware of something and we immediately it's like I want that

205
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:13,960
or I don't want that it's kind of in the in the way that we're aware where the

206
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:19,240
aware the awareness is selective to see where can I where's that button I push

207
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:24,720
to make it go away or something and

208
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:30,319
um but in terms of the Hallmark of meditation of mindfulness meditation being

209
00:39:30,319 --> 00:39:36,119
Simplicity the um the uh mindfulness is being Des mindfulness practice

210
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:41,319
instructions being descriptive that it just describes what comes into awareness

211
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:46,520
sometimes is a really good reference point for remembering to keep it simple

212
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:52,640
learning how to keep it simple that uh trying to not have agendas and trying to

213
00:39:52,640 --> 00:40:01,280
in the active mode it's a little bit too easy to have agendas that are coming along with that purposes values desires

214
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,800
that we have that are more complicated than things need to be and um and so

215
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:14,440
sometimes going back and forth between a little more active and a little more uh receptive kind of mode can help us kind

216
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:22,160
of work through some of the attitudes some of the extra baggage we carry so that the basic practice becomes simpler

217
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:29,319
and simpler just being here just showing up just being present with

218
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:35,319
this this is what I'm experiencing now this is the sound this is listening this

219
00:40:35,319 --> 00:40:40,520
is a sound now this is an in breath now

220
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:48,319
this is a sensation now and and then with each each movement

221
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:56,000
of now like this it's like the doors have been open the windows are open and then we allow

222
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,880
ourselves to feel that experience more fully so that cognitive part that's

223
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:10,280
something like this is my experience now is kind of like a Prelude to okay

224
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:15,560
this and experience it for a moment or two or just allow yourself to really

225
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:22,400
feel and experience the experience of the moment and as I've said earlier in this series

226
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:27,680
sometimes it's even nice to take three breaths just be with some that's Arisen

227
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:33,599
this is the experience now and then breathe with it three times and then

228
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:40,839
return to the breathing so um I hope that uh what I

229
00:41:40,839 --> 00:41:48,359
said today doesn't uh promote your more complicated meditation for you but uh

230
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:55,240
maybe gives you some options or some understanding of some choices you can make to try to keep your meditation

231
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:01,760
simple and do it in a way that's appropriate for you your way now what's

232
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:08,359
needed for you and um

233
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,720
so final thing I'll say is that um a

234
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:22,359
good reflection to do maybe near the end of the meditation when the meditation is over is to think back about through the

235
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:28,480
meditation what happened in the meditation and uh uh could you have been

236
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:35,440
simpler could you have been more Mindful and what would it have taken so

237
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:41,559
at the end of The Meditation to reflect how it went to learn from how it went so

238
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:47,559
for example it's easy to drift off in thought and think about something that's

239
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:53,920
really unnecessary and not really know it that you're doing how much time you're spending that way but when you go

240
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,520
do the review so wow I just spent 15 minutes

241
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:04,960
thinking about I don't know the Great American novel I'm going

242
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:12,280
to write but I I don't even know how to write but I'm just kind of in the fantasy um I think I could have woken up

243
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:18,920
earlier I think I could have been a little bit more diligent in being present let's try let's try to do a

244
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:26,400
little bit better tomorrow so that review of meditation and seeing what you can learn and where the traps were where

245
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:32,040
you got off track can be very helpful so you become your own teacher how to find

246
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:40,680
your way with this practice so um so we'll continue tomorrow and uh the

247
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:47,520
last in these 20 25 talk series and uh also tomorrow at uh when

248
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:53,599
we finish at 7:45 in California in 24 hours from now uh we'll switch over to

249
00:43:53,599 --> 00:44:01,240
zoom you can stay on YouTube if you want but then you won't be able to participate in a zoom kind of way and um

250
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:06,760
and uh we'll have a community meeting which means that uh uh I might have some

251
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:12,079
things to say that I would like to say maybe about our YouTube and community

252
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:18,319
and what's happening at IMC um I can take some questions from you uh and I'll

253
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:24,839
offer the responses I have we'll do a breakout group where some of you can meet each other and say hello and maybe

254
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:32,319
see some of them meet some of people who've chatted over this time and um and so it'll probably be

255
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:37,599
about um you know uh 45 minutes we'll do

256
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:44,880
