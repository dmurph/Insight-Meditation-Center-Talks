00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,560
warm greetings from the Insight Meditation

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:11,639
Center and it's wonderful to come

3
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:19,240
down from my home to sit here and share the Dharma share the

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,840
meditation thank you warm greetings thank you for being

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,560
here and there's a

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,280
short saying Buddhist saying the shortest version of it in

7
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:43,039
English could be um for wisdom be

8
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:48,760
tranquil if if you want to become wise cultivate

9
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:57,120
Tranquility in fact the terad path of meditation is sometimes called samata

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:04,360
viasa in p and in English that would be tranquility and

11
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:10,560
insight and part of the function of developing concentration is to have a

12
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:19,320
good amount of Tranquility so that awareness can do some deep inner work

13
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:26,680
that's hard for awareness to do if the awareness is hijacked by our reactivity by our

14
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:34,360
emotions by our preferences and likes and dislikes by the stories that the Mind spins

15
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:42,600
out and so uh Tranquility is important and there are three different

16
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:50,280
kinds of Tranquility there's Tranquility of the body Tranquility of the

17
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:57,039
mind and then separate from those two there's Tranquility of mindfulness

18
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:01,600
Tranquility of awareness itself

19
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:08,599
and sometimes if there's can cultivate some degree of Tranquility of body it

20
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:15,239
supports Tranquility of the mind some Tranquility of the Mind supports Tranquility of

21
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:22,319
awareness but sometimes that's not possible sometimes the body is agitated

22
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:29,280
and and uh on fire in some way sometimes it's the mind which is

23
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,599
agitated and maybe on fire for some

24
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,400
reason but awareness can doesn't have to be tied to

25
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:48,920
the body or the mind and this is the great power and magic of

26
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,879
mindfulness that is possible to know in a tranquil

27
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,360
way the body in any state that's in

28
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:07,560
it's possible to know tranquil calmly the Mind any state that's in and if the

29
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,319
awareness is tranquil knowing these different things then it's clear that

30
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:21,799
awareness is not under is not reacting to the body or the mind it's not pulled

31
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:27,640
into the mood and and agitation of the body and

32
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,239
mind that there's this peaceful quiet

33
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:39,480
place of knowing of

34
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,080
awareness of observing our experience that

35
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,680
is distinct from what we are

36
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:58,079
experiencing and it's invaluable to have this tranquil awareness and today the focus is going

37
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:04,079
to be emotions and emotions drive us

38
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:13,079
emotions grab us emotions come with authority emotions come with urgency and

39
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:18,840
desires of in some ways most emotions maybe can be

40
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,960
understood as involving some kind of Desire wanting

41
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:30,039
something directly or indirectly and so we can get pulled into

42
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:36,120
them we can identify ourselves with them we can Define ourselves by our

43
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:43,960
emotions we can judge ourselves by our emotions we can struggling with our

44
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,240
emotions rejecting our emotions trying to hold on to

45
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:56,120
them and we can know them

46
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,280
tranquil which I propose is very respectful

47
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:08,720
it allows emotions to be themselves and to do what's inherent to

48
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:17,800
the emotion that is that it's in motion all emotions are

49
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:26,199
processes that are unfolding and moving and shifting and changing and passing

50
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,160
through and we get stuck in them we stick to

51
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,960
them and we interfere with the motion of

52
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,680
emotions so to assume a meditation

53
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:54,720
posture that posture that for you will support you to be alert in a

54
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:02,280
relaxed way and calm in an an alert

55
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:09,440
way it could be standing it could be walking slowly

56
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,639
quietly back and forth it could be

57
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,560
sitting it could be lying

58
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:30,120
down and to gently close the eyes or lower the Gaze

59
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,000
half open eyes not looking at anything in

60
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:50,720
particular and just sitting this way how would you

61
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,800
characterize your attention the way that you're aware of

62
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,879
your present moment experience

63
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,240
is it more on the calm side or more in the agitated

64
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:26,759
side does your attention come with a mood an attitude

65
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:36,120
of wanting or not wanting something of

66
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,120
straining

67
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,879
resisting of reluctance or

68
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,240
eagerness noticing in a very simple

69
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:06,919
way the quality or mood or attitude in how you're

70
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,039
aware or your attitude about being

71
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:30,440
aware and then gently

72
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:37,880
as [Music] you're easing in quietly to a shy

73
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:44,279
cat ease in to the experience of your body

74
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:01,440
breathing and in a way that's nice for you satisfying

75
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:11,200
take a few deeper longer breaths and relax as you exhale

76
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,760
and then returning to our normal

77
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:56,399
breath let your attention be

78
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:05,079
open to the experience of the body breathing but some place in the

79
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:10,880
body where the attention is not straining or

80
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:18,839
working some place where there's some can be some sense of

81
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:29,880
ease with breathing itself and with awareness of breathing

82
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:42,360
maybe some place in the Torso that moves with each

83
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:52,279
breath but which is not doing the breathing it's a part of your body that

84
00:10:52,279 --> 00:11:00,000
is moved by the process of breathing

85
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,320
relaxing the body as you exhale

86
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:03,760
and as you exhale relax the mind the thinking

87
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:11,440
mind maybe with the idea that the thinking mind sits on top of the

88
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:19,880
body and as you relax the mind it settles into the

89
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,160
body for

90
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:18,160
and then settling into breathing being aware of the body's

91
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:26,800
experience of breathing the Rhythm breathing in and out

92
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:03,399
and then see as you're with the breathing if there's any Center within place

93
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:09,560
within from which you're aware the place of

94
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,120
knowing the place of directing

95
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:22,880
attention any place that's associated with doing

96
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,560
mindfulness doing awareness

97
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:51,480
and as you exhale relax this doing see if you can

98
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:57,160
shift awareness shift knowing to some other location in the

99
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:06,480
body in the head any anywhere where there's less doing less

100
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:13,639
force behind

101
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,759
awareness seeing if you can find a way to be aware

102
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:37,079
that's tranquil calm

103
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:10,360
and awareness that is

104
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,600
aware without being involved

105
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:22,839
with what you're aware of

106
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:49,199
awareness that has the Tranquility of The Opening space of a

107
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:54,399
door an Open Door people go

108
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:03,720
through but the opening is not that agitated doesn't

109
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,918
resist and so an open awareness

110
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,520
experiment with having a moment of

111
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,880
awareness that's tranquil

112
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,799
a lot of small moments brief periods of

113
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,960
time tranquil aware of

114
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:25,158
this maybe it helps to use a mental

115
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,480
note so you're clear about what it is you're

116
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:40,159
knowing and the mental note is done tranquil

117
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,760
peacefully e

118
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:46,799
and then gently slowly become becoming

119
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:55,480
aware of your emotional state the general mood that you're

120
00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:00,639
in the state of mind

121
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,799
how you're feeling

122
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:16,520
overall and see if you can know it with tranquil

123
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,120
awareness tranquil

124
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:32,880
knowing maybe even using a mental label for your emotional

125
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,000
state could be as simple as calling it an

126
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:54,400
emotion where the labeling is an opening the

127
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,600
door to a tranquil awareness

128
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,880
of your emotional

129
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,559
state for

130
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:08,278
each time you label name an emotional

131
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:16,639
state see if awareness can be tranquil for a few

132
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:23,919
moments until you use a mental note

133
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,520
again for

134
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,440
okay

135
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:46,120
a cat that goes through an open door doesn't get caught by the door

136
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:58,559
frame each moment of a of awareness can be like an Open Door

137
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:06,400
so that the movement of emotions can pass

138
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:14,320
through without sticking to anything passing

139
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:20,039
through some moments of tranquil

140
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
awareness

141
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
for

142
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
for

143
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,278
for for

144
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:48,200
and as we come to the end of this sitting to check in with yourself

145
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:55,679
again as we began what's your emotional

146
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:02,960
state your general attitude state of

147
00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:17,000
mind and how has it shifted from the beginning the meditation to coming to

148
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,200
the end

149
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:49,880
what difference does it make to you to allow all things to

150
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:55,600
be but to know them tranquil

151
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:25,120
and one difference that tranquil awareness could make it can allow us to be more

152
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:34,240
attentive to the wholeness of other people more attentive to be attuned be

153
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,320
connected to

154
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:45,679
others in a way that we care for their well-being and their

155
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:53,000
welfare we would like them to be happy

156
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:59,559
peaceful where we might

157
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:10,640
wish for the welfare of others may it be that all our

158
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,559
meditations lead us to Care more for the

159
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:23,559
people in our lives known and St

160
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:29,919
strangers may all beings be happy

161
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:36,640
may all beings be

162
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:41,320
safe may all beings be

163
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,640
peaceful may all beings be

164
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:56,120
free and what a difference we can make if all of us who are here today for this

165
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:01,960
meditation could contribute a small

166
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,080
piece to the well-being of

167
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,559
[Music]

168
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,000
others thank you

169
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:55,080
while I'm drinking my water and waiting for the recording to be ready for the next session um if

170
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:02,039
some of you would like to write uh the explanation or description of uh

171
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:08,519
what shifted for you in that meditation uh how your attitude your

172
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:17,039
mood shifted you could be as simple as from X to Y and if there was a

173
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:29,919
change

174
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,880
e e

175
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:39,000
wow that's quite impressive to see all these uh little comments and um they're going by so fast

176
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:46,840
now that I can't see them all but I I'm going to read them carefully when we finish here when I have more

177
00:32:51,240 --> 00:33:00,840
time so good morning good day to this third day of uh their talk on the four

178
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:07,279
noble truths and the after the first talk on that was

179
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:13,399
an introduction yesterday talking about suffering today the focus is the cause

180
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:20,360
of suffering and um when the Buddha talked about the first Noble

181
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:27,360
Truth uh the way that he described described it is it's uh a

182
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:33,440
suffering that arises or is constructed by the person who

183
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:40,960
suffers and um how he describes or defines it the the classic way he talks

184
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:47,240
about five different ways that we construct um our experience in such a

185
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:53,559
way that there's clinging and craving involved that we build up a kind of

186
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:58,720
Cathedral of self Cathedral or building

187
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:05,760
of of uh of reactivity that the accumulation ends up with one big ball

188
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:13,760
of suffering and so when we come to the second Noble Truth uh it's the the truth

189
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,919
of the cause of suffering and what one way before I tell you what it's what

190
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:25,118
that cause is that the Buddha offers but it's important to understand that here

191
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:33,839
the orientation is what is our contribution to suffering if someone uh walking down in

192
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:40,118
down the street or someplace steps on my foot maybe even hurts it a little

193
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:47,800
bit uh that might be uh painful but uh it might be I might get

194
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:53,358
irritated it might relate to all the different people lately who've been stepping on my feet and I'm just

195
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:58,960
frustrated and angry um and uh with now

196
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:06,520
humankind because of how thoughtless they are stepping in my foot and I start spinning out about all kinds of thoughts

197
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:14,920
about myself and people are doing to me and and how stepping my foot is an act of disrespect and and uh you know I'm

198
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:21,440
always invisible to people and it just seems like um I'm you know it must be

199
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:29,359
because I somehow have the wrong kind of glasses and people are I should really get new glasses but I don't know what I

200
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:35,359
can never make a good choice and I'm such a bad Chooser of glasses and the mind spins out and all these constructs

201
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:42,000
that can build and create you know huge edifices but it turned out that the

202
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,400
person was maybe blind and uh didn't see you and you actually stepped into their

203
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,240
path and uh you didn't see that they were blind they put a a walking stick

204
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,839
and um and so the whole spinning out was your addition to something that added

205
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:05,359
something that was not really present at all in that event itself so we can

206
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:13,200
contribute even though there might be some harm being done step my foot was stepped on we can contribute to whole

207
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:19,040
layers and sometimes other people are doing things which are uh hostile and

208
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:26,240
hurtful to us and uh and that should not be uh overlooked or not dealt with

209
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,000
appropriately but even even there we can contribute to the suffering ourselves

210
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,839
and some people see this I've known people who've seen it years later how that their resentment towards someone

211
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:45,079
was their way of constructing suffering for themselves that that long after the

212
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:51,200
person who orig the original person maybe even forgot that they existed or forgot the event but but somehow the

213
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:58,160
repetition the story The resentment is a something we contribute going on so the

214
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:04,160
particular focus of the Four Noble Truths is not all forms of emotional

215
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:11,480
pain but the kind of emotional pain that is our that we contribute to and so the

216
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:18,079
definition the Buddha offers for uh or the simple kind of um explanation for

217
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,280
the cause of suffering uh is called T in

218
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:31,240
poly t n ha it usually means in poly means thirst and so the idea it's a

219
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:37,920
metaphor but a metaphor of when we're thirsty there's a compulsion there's a reaching out there's a intensity of

220
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,920
wanting something wanting water and um that can grab us and push us and to do

221
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:50,119
things and so it's not just a simple desire that arises desires for me are

222
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:57,319
dime by dozen they can come and I just let them come and go um sometimes I smile when they come and and just shrug

223
00:37:57,319 --> 00:38:03,079
my shoulders and let them pass through and and occasionally they I get caught

224
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:10,560
in it and um and occasionally when I get caught too much I have uh what comes is

225
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:17,400
Disappointment or expectation or frustration or or or being upset by

226
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:22,640
whatever gets in the way of my desire and that but when the desire

227
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:27,800
becomes strong when the desire becomes strong enough to get in the way of our

228
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:34,400
ease or peace or calm uh when it takes us grabs Us by the by the nose and pulls

229
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:41,640
us around uh then what the Buddha this T is U rather than being translated as

230
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:47,079
thirst into English English translators uh to be more descriptive or more to the

231
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:52,240
point will translate it as craving and craving is a kind of

232
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:58,240
compulsive desire where if craving is strong uh we we kind of lose our

233
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,280
autonomy we lose our freedom to um to

234
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,839
the uh to the desire because it it now has Authority it now is in charge it's

235
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:14,920
now pushing us compelling us to do something uh or at least compelling us

236
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:22,520
giving us a feel even if we don't act on it it's so such a strong force in the mind in the heart that it churns it

237
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:30,160
pushes it brings tension it and um and uh and it gets can get so strong that

238
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:37,480
not only what craving constructs constructs the sense of self constructs ideas and stories about what something

239
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:43,040
means that but the craving itself is suffering itself there's something about

240
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:50,960
thirst which is uncomfortable uh when we're really thirsty it is a kind of pain or

241
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:57,839
discomfort and so the the the cause of suffering in this classic teachings of

242
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:05,359
the Four Noble Truths is uh a certain compulsive desire that is itself

243
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:12,599
unsatisfying to have we might be blinded by the object of Desire we might be

244
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:20,119
enamored with the object there wonderful fantasies about the object or that um or

245
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:26,280
if the desire is negative like wanting something to go away and there's hostility I want to push it away we

246
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:31,319
might be caught up not enamored but caught or mesmerized by the hostility

247
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:37,280
and really caught in the grip and the trance of the hostility so craving can

248
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,880
be for or against something but uh in and of itself

249
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,880
there's tension even there's pain or emotional pain in it when we're grabbed

250
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:55,960
and pushed like that so this is the definition that's offered by the tradition that uh the cause of emotional

251
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:01,880
pain that uh to the the our our contribution to the

252
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:08,920
cause is craving a certain kind of intensity of Desire wanting or not

253
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:20,000
wanting and and the um and uh and so um we can have a role

254
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,319
because our contribution we can make a difference uh that's where we can make a

255
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:32,000
difference we can't always change other people uh sometimes other people do do

256
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:39,160
mean things to us maybe uh say something that feels clearly uh offensive to us

257
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:45,880
and uh maybe it's something that ideally we should stand up for ourselves and say you shouldn't do that but we don't

258
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:52,599
always have that ability because of who we are because of situation all kinds of things and so we can't necessarily

259
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:58,520
change other people but we can change ourselves and and if we're contributing

260
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:05,400
to the suffering that that part that we're contributing is where we can have the greatest role take the greatest

261
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:12,240
responsibility take the greatest greatest uh uh uh have the greatest success in making a

262
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:18,160
difference and it makes a huge difference to be able to turn around and

263
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:25,119
see how what we're contributing what we're adding that's extra on top of something the way that

264
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:31,960
we are are tend ing up the way that we're pushing the way we're straining

265
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:39,240
the way that we're uh uh collapsing or tightening up all over in the heart and

266
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:46,119
the belly and the shoulders in the mind and um and that's where because

267
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:52,240
craving this cause of emotion you know of optional emotional

268
00:42:52,240 --> 00:43:00,640
pain is um Can is can be strong can be strong it's often is somatic as well and

269
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:06,440
that becomes a important way to find relief from it and then eventually

270
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:14,960
release from it and um by remembering to relax to calm to settle the body and

271
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:20,640
mind and we can't always settle and relax all aspects of the mind we can't

272
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:29,000
make pain go away but sometimes we can relax and um and open up and soften

273
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:35,079
around the edges uh those places that we can relax

274
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:40,160
we can relax and then eventually we might be

275
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:45,839
able to offer a presence an

276
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:53,640
attention uh to be attentive to whatever is going on where the attention has not

277
00:43:53,640 --> 00:44:01,200
been hijacked by craving where attention it hasn't been used in the construction

278
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:07,680
of suffering the construction of this edifice of of self and stories that we

279
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:15,720
have that attention has been extricated from all the attachments all

280
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:23,960
the identities that uh we are caught in so that the awareness itself at least

281
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:30,559
is not caught the awareness becomes tranquil peaceful still

282
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:36,000
quiet and in so doing becomes much more

283
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,400
creative much more intelligent much

284
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:49,280
wiser and uh rather than a tranquil awareness making less of who we are it

285
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,720
actually brings forth much more of who we are from our depths much more the

286
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:01,280
fullness of what's available and so we come to the the saying that I

287
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:07,319
mentioned at the beginning of the meditation simplest version is for

288
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:13,800
Wisdom be tranquil if you'd like to be a wise if

289
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:21,640
you like to be wise cultivate Tranquility a Tranquility that frees you

290
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:29,759
from the reactive craving that's seen as the cause of optional

291
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:36,200
suffering so may you

292
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:41,720
find the ways in which you get caught in

293
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:47,760
desires and rather than being identified and caught in

294
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:56,559
desire identify with something which can't really be the self but still

295
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:04,160
it's provisionally good to do so identify with tranquil awareness

296
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,400
itself thank you
