1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:12,799
so good day to everyone and good beginning

2
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,920
of the week and

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:27,119
here we are to sit quietly here we are to let the thinking mind

4
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,200
become quieter so that we're less involved in our

5
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,399
thinking then we are involved in our

6
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,600
um inner life involved with

7
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:53,280
subtleness and stillness involved with a place that it's peaceful a place of

8
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:00,800
inner happiness inner pleasure

9
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,840
that maybe is more available if we don't keep

10
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:13,200
flowing along in the all the rivers of thoughts the streams of thinking that we could

11
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,920
spin out on so to begin this

12
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:27,360
journey to a more settled place

13
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,880
to assume a posture that allows you to settle

14
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,159
whatever is works for you given your

15
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:46,399
situation and some people find it helpful to close the eyes

16
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:54,560
or if the eyes are open not really to look at anything almost as if the eyes are resting

17
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:01,280
in their sockets and the eyes are looking backwards

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and down and then taking a few long slow deep

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,560
breaths and these long slow deep breaths

20
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,280
can be done leisurely it can be done in a way where if

21
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,360
possible you enjoy it it feels pleasant

22
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,040
so doing it at a p at a speed

23
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:43,840
and to the extent that it's nice for you to breathe in fully

24
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:53,920
and to allow the diaphragm to do its full release

25
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:04,000
the work of breathing when the diaphragm the work is done on the inhale as a diaphragm

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,319
is pushed down and the exhale is a release letting go

27
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,360
of that pushing down and diaphragm

28
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,599
releases and pulls itself upward

29
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,319
and on the exhale

30
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,879
releasing other places in your body as well relaxing

31
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,840
maybe a global relaxation throughout the body

32
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,840
and then letting your breathing return to normal

33
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:13,200
and ever so slightly can you adjust the normal breathing

34
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,479
so that you are so it's a little bit more pleasant to

35
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:25,280
breathe so let yourself become attuned

36
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:32,400
sensitive to any form of pleasure or nice feeling

37
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:43,840
that comes with breathing

38
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,880
maybe there's a little section of the inhale it feels nice

39
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,840
or a certain section of the exhale

40
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:10,400
and if there is any pleasure or comforting feeling with breathing allow

41
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,400
yourself to feel that in such a way that your thinking mind

42
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:25,199
becomes quieter or allow the thinking mind to be quieter

43
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,120
so you can better sense and feel the physicality of breathing

44
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,080
in whatever physical sensations that are

45
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:53,840
enjoyable pleasant

46
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,400
breathing in breathing out

47
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:27,120
as you exhale relaxing more in your body

48
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:37,600
maybe almost as if you as you relax you settle into breathing more

49
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:49,840
breathing in and breathing out

50
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:21,520
relaxing the thinking mind and dropping into whatever is pleasant

51
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,360
in your body just a simple pleasantness

52
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:35,919
of being alive or the vibrating body

53
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:55,839
the hum of vitality in your body

54
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,320
and breathe with that pleasantness even if there's other places that are

55
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:09,839
painful breathe with a pleasantness of the physicality of your body

56
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,760
letting the thinking mind become quieter

57
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:25,440
so you're in the stream of sensations in your body

58
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,639
more than the three the stream of your

59
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,839
thinking

60
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:09,839
being careful not to flow in the stream of thinking

61
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:23,839
even this subtle background thinking that creeps in from the sides or from the back door

62
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:32,800
and if you are thinking very quietly think about your breathing

63
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:40,160
think about the pleasant experiences that are here and now in the experience

64
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,839
of breathing not so you get carried away in thought

65
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:52,480
but so your thinking becomes simpler and simpler

66
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:05,839
and your awareness more and more attuned with the body breathing

67
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,919
you

68
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,919
you

69
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:25,840
noticing if you are flowing in the stream of thinking

70
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:34,799
or if you're grounded in your body and you're

71
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:45,278
breathing with an awareness that might be aware that you're thinking

72
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:53,840
but the awareness is not flowing along in the thinking

73
00:26:54,559 --> 00:27:00,960
sometimes even the awareness present moment awareness gets lost submerged

74
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:07,840
in the river of thoughts

75
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:21,919
and as we come to the end of the sitting we can be submerged in the river of

76
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:27,919
thoughts when we're with other people so involved in thinking about what to

77
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:35,840
say or what they're saying or our concerns about the situation

78
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:48,399
or our awareness can be clear and present

79
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:55,200
so that we can really offer an attentive attention to our people we're

80
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,600
with so that our attention is more with the people we're with

81
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:08,398
then it is loss submerged in the flow of our thinking

82
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:19,039
and there's a way of offering attention

83
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:25,840
listening seeing to really

84
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:31,520
understand and be present for others in a fuller way

85
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:38,880
maybe sometimes offering quiet so the other person can has a chance to

86
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:45,840
express themselves and say what needs to be said

87
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,760
what we learn in meditation about not being swept away in thought

88
00:28:51,760 --> 00:29:00,720
can translate to be more present for others

89
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:10,240
and if we're more present it's easier to care for others

90
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:16,240
to feel their humanity their suffering their joys

91
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:22,159
and may it be that this practice that we do together

92
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:29,440
allows us to offer the gift of attention to others

93
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:37,679
and from that gift maybe other thing we provide other gifts kindness

94
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:43,919
friendliness care love

95
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:52,799
may the benefits of this practice spread from us out into the world

96
00:29:52,799 --> 00:30:00,960
for the welfare and happiness of all beings may all beings be happy

97
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:08,799
may all beings be safe may all beings

98
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:23,840
be peaceful may all beings be free

99
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:46,159
so on this monday we have a new topic for the week and in

100
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:53,679
some ways as a continuation from a couple of weeks ago when we did the first foundation of mindfulness

101
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,960
mindfulness of the body this week i'd like to

102
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:07,200
talk about that they're subject to the second foundation of mindfulness that of feelings the usual english

103
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,840
translation of feeling tones that the pali word is a

104
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:20,399
vedana sometimes they say and it's um

105
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:28,960
sometimes thought to be really one of these central practice topics for the teachings of the

106
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:36,399
buddha that it's phenomenally important it's kind of like the the some

107
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:42,880
people kind of the linchpin or the or the foundation

108
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:51,600
for so much of the buddha dharma or for practice so it's a very important topic and

109
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:58,399
this has a whole of the four foundations it gets a whole foundation to itself

110
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:05,120
now the word in pali is vedana v-e-d-a-n-a

111
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:12,720
and it's um i believe it's a cognate it's related to

112
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:19,120
the way indo-european languages relate to each other to the english word witness

113
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:26,480
or maybe say wit sometimes someone who's clever or something they have wit

114
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:34,000
and uh in norwegian the word vet the probably all similar means to know

115
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:41,120
and so the the pali version of this is vid the root word is vid vid

116
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:48,799
which means to know or to also mean in pali to experience so vedana

117
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:56,159
refers to what is known what is experienced uh what is felt

118
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:02,240
but felt uh you know as sensations as feelings and we're focusing here on

119
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:08,480
sensations in the body and so the sensations that are known

120
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:17,760
and that are felt and exactly where the line is between knowing something and feeling sensations is not very clear

121
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,878
because these arise together closely connected

122
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:27,919
but we are talking about a way of knowing and as a way of knowing it's a

123
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:34,398
subjective way of knowing it's what we know subjectively

124
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:41,520
and so i want to give a um analogy that maybe can highlight or

125
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:50,480
point out at the the way in which this is so important so maybe you're responsible for a

126
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:58,079
place of a workplace maybe a factory maybe a warehouse maybe a corporate building or

127
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:03,599
someplace where many people come to work and many visitors come to this place as

128
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:09,760
well and uh people come actually from all over the world

129
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,960
and it's uh cove at times so you want to make sure that you keep

130
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,880
people at your workplace healthy and people are coming from all over they're flying in

131
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:27,040
and and there's no way of controlling who shows up so how are you going to keep your your

132
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,839
employees people working with you uh safe

133
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:37,200
and and so then you realize that

134
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:43,839
the only way into the workplace is through the front door and so no matter where everyone's coming

135
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:50,480
from everyone has to go through that front door and um and so what you need to do is set

136
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:56,960
up a welcoming station where you take people's temperature give them a covet test whatever it takes

137
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:04,160
and to make sure that they're safe to come into the building and if they're safe and good you know then you allow them in if

138
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:10,000
they're not safe then they can't come in and that way you keep all the people

139
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,240
coveted safe in your building so so there's this kind of common place

140
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,280
it's like a funnel like a neck or a doorway a passageway through

141
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,960
which everything goes and now the wide range of human

142
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,000
experience all the different things we can experience in the world and things can happen to us

143
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:39,040
there's they go through and the passage as they come into our experience

144
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:46,240
everything goes through the doorway of feeling or feeling tones affective tone

145
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:53,200
and that is a particular tone or quality of the things that are

146
00:36:53,200 --> 00:37:02,000
known as we know things as we experience things they can be either pleasant

147
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,000
painful or neutral pleasant unpleasant and neutral

148
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,920
sometimes we say and um but the the middle word is

149
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:21,599
literally means pain but it's a there's anything from the mildest you know discomfort to intense pain

150
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,880
anything from the mildest pleasantness to intense pleasure are the

151
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,400
first two and then neutral is that which is neither pleasant or not pleasant in fact

152
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:39,200
that's the way it's worded in pauline neither pleasant nor unpleasant and for the uninitiated it can seem kind

153
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,200
of like what's the big deal it's kind of dull and boring just to talk to things to focus on things being pleasant

154
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:51,839
or unpleasant or neither but it turns out it's a common denominator or it's the door it's the

155
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:57,920
everything goes through that um every every experience we have has one of

156
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:06,320
those three qualities in it so if you can have if you can uh station yourself

157
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:12,720
at the door and you watch everything that comes in then you can only you could you don't

158
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,320
have to let in things which are not healthy for you you can let in things

159
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:24,720
which are healthy for you you can leave out what is unwholesome and bring in what is unwholesome

160
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:32,079
uh you leave out what is unwholesome bring in what is wholesome and and so it gives you a vantage point

161
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:37,280
tremendously important place to stay healthy to stay well

162
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:43,520
and it's easier to stay right there and notice the feeling tones than when things get

163
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:50,880
more complicated just like to go out into the world and analyze everything in the world all the complicated aspects of it and

164
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:57,440
think about it and figure it out you know can take a lifetime to figure out the world

165
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:04,160
or to go inward and really kind of discover the inner life it's it's also a kind of complicated

166
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:11,520
world of thoughts and memories and histories and experiences we've had and accumulated and how they'll come into play but

167
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,800
everything inner experiences and outer outer experiences in a sense

168
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,079
for us to know anything to feel anything

169
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:30,320
goes through this little door of it being either pleasant unpleasant or neither so what's the big

170
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:37,280
deal about that the big deal is that there's sometimes for the people who

171
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:45,280
don't practice or have a strong kind of mindfulness awareness practice

172
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,280
we often can act automatically on whether things are pleasant and

173
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:57,040
unpleasant neutral maybe not but so something is pleasant and there's

174
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,560
kind of an automatic desire for it for more of it things are unpleasant or

175
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:09,440
painful there's a desire to push it away or not have it there and they can be so automatic so quick

176
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:17,040
that we don't even see the two are separate we experience something that's pleasant and with that comes a feeling want that

177
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:22,400
feeling something unpleasant with that comes don't want that pushing it away but

178
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:28,400
these are actually two different movements and so when i was um

179
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:33,760
uh practicing the pasta in burma i sat a long retreat and there was a

180
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:40,240
particular moment that just that taught me this lesson in a very powerful way

181
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:47,520
and and that was i was every day i would go in to see my teacher most days six days a week for practice discussion

182
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:53,280
talk about my practice and um and he lived in a little kind of cabin and

183
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:59,359
there was kind of an entryway and just next to the entryway the door going in to the right there was a little altar

184
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:05,520
and usually were some buddhas on the altar and you know we didn't have to pay any attention to it which was

185
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:11,839
on the way in to see him and and one day because maybe it hadn't been

186
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:17,119
there before there was a new wooden buddha sitting on that little altar

187
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:22,720
so my mind was very you know fairly mindful at this point

188
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:31,760
so i was able to track things more closely than i usually can do and and so i noticed

189
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,640
there's a statue buddha statue

190
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:43,920
i noticed that it was beautiful and the first thing i noticed was really pleasant i felt this pleasantness the

191
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,200
pleasure of looking at it and then i saw there was desire to have

192
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:54,319
it but those things happen in clear

193
00:41:54,319 --> 00:42:02,000
distinction from each other sequentially seeing the buddha recognizing it

194
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,680
as such experiencing the pleasantness of it

195
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:14,240
and then wanting it and when i saw that the experience of pleasure and the wanting

196
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:20,319
were very distinct two different activities of the mind i said i could oh

197
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:25,520
there's possibility for freedom here it's possible i don't have to pick up

198
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:31,839
the desire i don't have to get involved in it it was just like oh it's just a fleeting desire comes

199
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:36,640
and it goes but that desire arose

200
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:45,839
influenced by that sense of pleasure but because it was so clear the distinction between them

201
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,920
the desire had very little authority over me it had a little influence on me just oh

202
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:57,599
it's a desire and i saw that these two are different and that was the beginning of

203
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:03,440
a lot of discoverer of a lot of his paws this gap in experience where there's a

204
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,560
possibility of freedom it's possible to leave the pleasant alone

205
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:14,240
it's impossible to leave that what's unpleasant alone and not get involved in the reactivity

206
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:22,240
to it and now or it's possible this automatic way in which the mind can work that yes

207
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:28,400
there might you see the pleasantness clearly and it's possible to see the desires or

208
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:35,680
the aversions that have come from pleasant or unpleasant and because it's so clear it might be

209
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,960
possible just not get involved it's just it's just desire it's just a version

210
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:47,920
just a blip in the mind and and you let it go but if these two are yoked

211
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:54,560
together the feeling tone the vedana and our reaction response to it our desires

212
00:43:54,560 --> 00:44:00,880
around it then we don't see them being two different things chances are we're already in the stream

213
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:08,880
of desire it already kind of we don't have enough strong attention to to to

214
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,920
you know not be pulled in and kind of automatic pilot into the desires

215
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:20,240
and now this can be quite intense you know in our lives like something very unpleasant happens and we immediately

216
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:25,520
bark at someone something very pleasant we see and immediately that's what we want and

217
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:31,200
you know it's the compulsions are so strong it isn't just simply an innocent desire

218
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:37,119
we have these desires sometimes come with tremendous compulsion and we say things and do things that

219
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:44,480
later we regret and realize that we were not free something inside of us which was not

220
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:50,319
in a sense not us or not our choice or our will our decision has taken over and

221
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:59,119
pushed us to do things maybe that we actually didn't want to do and and so to

222
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:05,760
to be able to slow down enough and notice the pleasant experiences are

223
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:11,760
pleasant the unpleasant experiences unpleasant can give us a tremendous amount of

224
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:17,359
choice freedom we can kind of stop the automatic ways in which the reactivity

225
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:24,240
arises and we have more choice that show one choice is to do nothing and just to let it be as it is

226
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:30,160
another choice is to change gears and and be careful and not automatically

227
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:36,079
give into the desires and compulsions are there and

228
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:43,040
so so for the buddha in his teachings

229
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:51,040
because vedana is at this kind of door like like like the narrow neck of the

230
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:59,680
funnel that everything goes through to start paying attention to feeling tone

231
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:07,520
is a powerful way to develop mindfulness but also to discover freedom feeling tone pleasant

232
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:13,520
unpleasantness is mostly independent of our desires it's just kind of just the nature of things

233
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:19,920
i'll talk more about that tomorrow but what but the consequence of them how

234
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,599
desires get evoked in response to them that's what we're trying to discover our

235
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:32,400
freedom so there's no compulsion there can be a wise desire appropriate desire

236
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:40,240
but uh no desire that we're compelled by and um compulsion is

237
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:47,200
uh you know is the um antithesis of freedom

238
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:52,480
so um that was the introduction and uh we'll talk more about this the next few

239
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:58,240
days and in the meantime you might want to see and study and reflect and have

240
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:04,319
conversations with people about what's the role or the impact or the influence

241
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:10,640
that pleasant and unpleasant experiences have on you what kind of gut reaction do you have to

242
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:16,319
them and um and uh what what kind of wisdom do you have to them

243
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:25,200
and how does it work in your life so thank you very much
