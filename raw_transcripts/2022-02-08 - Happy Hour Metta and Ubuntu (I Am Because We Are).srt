1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
okay so hello formerly hello and welcome

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,559
to happy hour lovely to see you lovely to be with you

3
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:18,400
i have missed you i'm delighted to see you all in the sangha

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:26,160
so for our practice for today i'd like to invite us to um

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:35,280
sit with and reflect on and of course as always i'll offer a few words and then a guided meditation

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,480
on the theme of inter-being

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:47,039
so inter-being is one word that the late take not han

8
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,640
used a lot um in his teachings the sense of

9
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,640
inter being that our being that my existence depends on you

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,920
depends on so many causes and conditions

11
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:12,320
so it's not as if i'm an independent being going around in the world as we as we perceive often or wrongly perceive it

12
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,759
to be it's an inter being an interconnectedness interdependence that

13
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,799
if we stop and pay attention we get to appreciate appreciate and really

14
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,640
be in off this concept of inter being is also

15
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,479
related to another concept that i want to bring in tonight which is

16
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,680
the teaching of the concept of ubuntu

17
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:48,399
which is um i am because we are i am because you are

18
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,920
and and the concept of ubuntu is one from africa it's a beautiful concept in

19
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,960
africa and in fact there are a series of articles that showed up recently

20
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,320
uh on lines or the leading buddhist magazine one of the

21
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,239
leading buddhist magazines and in fact tell you what i will um i will put the

22
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,680
pointer to the articles uh a little later tell you what yeah

23
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,080
when we come back from um you don't you don't have to look for them right now i'll provide them but but

24
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,280
the idea here is similarly is this sense of um

25
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,360
i am i am because you are and and also as as in

26
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:40,560
uh in many african countries it's part of the greeting part of the greeting which is how are

27
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:49,040
you for example the question to how are you is i am well if you are i am well if you

28
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:56,480
are and wow what a beautiful way of yes my well-being is interdependent

29
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:03,280
with yours and another greeting also as you'll see these articles beautifully talk about

30
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,879
the sense of ubuntu i am because we are

31
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,159
there's this greeting of when people greet each other um now i'm

32
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:20,720
escaping on which country it was but i'll remember later

33
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:27,519
the greeting is i see you and the answer to that is i am seen

34
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,760
i am seen what a beautiful greeting what a beautiful way to have this sense of oh

35
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:41,599
yes my using me is is dependent on me being seen is is

36
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:48,319
another consciousness that's holding me the sense of inter-being i am because we are sort of the sense of

37
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:55,439
independence that we all often have in the culture it's in the zulu culture thank you now

38
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:04,480
in the zulu culture so so with these as themes i am because

39
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,159
we are and let's actually think about it bring it home right now

40
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,439
i am because we are i wouldn't be here

41
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:21,040
if you were not here happy hour my being here is dependent on your being

42
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:28,720
here and your being here is dependent on me and others being here i am because we are

43
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,040
it's as simple as that it's not independent but it's dependently

44
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,479
co-arisen how we are is dependently co-arisen and

45
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,759
we often forget that it's this this um

46
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:54,240
perception that we have it's this delusion of independence this is delusion and what how beautiful

47
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,320
to lose this delusion now and then and realize how interdependent we truly

48
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,240
truly are there is a tenderness there's a beauty

49
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:13,440
to this interdependence of all beings not just all us humans but all animals

50
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:20,800
and the planet earth and beyond and when i say beyond it's like wow

51
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,479
blows my mind to think of all the galaxies and stars

52
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:33,039
and yet it is true i am because we are we this all all of

53
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:39,199
this all of this i am stardust i am because we are

54
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,520
because the big bang happened at some point so so many directions

55
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,880
this contemplation can go and yet there's a particular way that i would like to

56
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:58,080
invite us tonight to sit with it and let our heart to open to this interdependence with care with metta

57
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,520
with love with appreciation of holding because you are not alone even if you

58
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:11,120
think you're not alone you are not alone you are being because everything else and everyone else is so

59
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:18,720
to bring that in our consciousness to bring that so without further ado would like to

60
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:25,680
invite us now to uh start meditating together so

61
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:32,319
so let us let us land let us land in our bodies

62
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,520
ah let us land

63
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,880
in this body in this moment letting go of all the

64
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:53,120
words that have come for the purpose of arriving

65
00:06:53,120 --> 00:07:01,080
for the purpose of settling here

66
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,800
here

67
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,800
just simply here this breath

68
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,759
sensations of the body not complicated

69
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,840
just here

70
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:49,840
inviting the body to land to arrive to relax

71
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,520
to give its weight to the earth

72
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:02,680
filling the soil of awareness by arriving settling

73
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,560
connecting with the in-breath

74
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,199
ah connecting with the opera

75
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:33,140
[Music]

76
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:42,959

moment of refuge

79
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,920
do

80
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,920
and if thoughts arise as they will arise it's okay

81
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,640
no need to chastise yourself or yell at yourself

82
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:57,839
it's okay simply simply notice what the beloved puppy of the mind has

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:46,519
taking refuge is juiciest of all

90
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,160

91
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,720

95
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,880

96
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,320
now i would like to invite you

97
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:58,650
if you wish you can stay if it feels calming soothing

98
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:06,000
[Music] to stay with the breath and the body

99
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,760
and if you wish

100
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:30,240
consider to open your heart not so much your head

101
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,839
your thinking but drop in this contemplation

102
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,800
as if dropping a pebble in a pond

103
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:47,839
the person you are how you are

104
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,059
everything you have done and do [Music]

105
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,199
the past and let's say in this moment

106
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:08,160
it is co-dependently [Music] arising

107
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:15,360
with so many other factors other beings

108
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,399
so many other beings your life

109
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,839
in this moment

110
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,600
is intertwined

111
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:46,600
is completely intertwined

112
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:55,519
with so many other beings lives that it could boggle the mind

113
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:02,560
could be one of the imponderables as the buddha shared

114
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:09,800
you really contemplated it so we don't want

115
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,399
to get too lost in thought but just to touch into

116
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,759
touch into this contemplation

117
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,360
maybe bring one aspect maybe the fact that you're here right now

118
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,480
practicing listening

119
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:53,839
intertwined intertwined deeply embedded

120
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:06,160
so many other beings actions

121
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,678
you are you don't exist or feel or do independently

122
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,000
not possible

123
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:25,520
just letting your breath to breathe in this contemplation into your heart into your

124
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:32,640
heart center a few breaths with sense of awe without

125
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,640
words

126
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:19,039
it might help for a moment to step out of yourself

127
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:28,039
and see yourself [Music] from a third person perspective

128
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:35,840
this being who is you their life so intertwined

129
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,600
so many other beings in this moment let's start with this

130
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,280
moment the present moment

131
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,679
as if you're watching the movie of your life

132
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,600
yes you seem to be the protagonist the star of the movie

133
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,600
and yet there's so many plot lines so many

134
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,360
heroes is not an independent one

135
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:20,640
let yourself appreciate the richness of the tapestry the tapestry of all these threads

136
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:27,799
of all these threads interwoven yours is just one

137
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:35,000
interwoven see your thread deeply

138
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,200
interval with

139
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,400
each breath interwoven

140
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,640
each thought interwoven

141
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:29,080
each emotion each sensation too interwoven it's not independent

142
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:16,880
allowing your heart allowing there to be appreciation gratitude all meta

143
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,960
whatever flavor shows up for you good will for all these

144
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,360
threads all these threads interwoven with yours in this tapestry

145
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,919
of being human of life

146
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,159
as you wish well for your thread

147
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:53,600
may all the threads be well may all the threads travel in safety

148
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:01,919
and happiness in health and ease

149
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:14,080
knowing that as you wish well-being through all the threads your wishing well-being for

150
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,200
yourself it's inextricably connected your thread to

151
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,440
the others

152
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:33,760
so there is no difference really you

153
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,919
wishing well for others and wishing well for

154
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:44,640
yourself at the ultimate level they're one and the same

155
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:53,320
one and the same i am because we are

156
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,480
here

157
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,440
may all beings be well

158
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,799
i am because we are

159
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,520
may all beings be well

160
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:34,159
i even have a sense for the threads those you care about those near

161
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,760
and dear in this tapestry

162
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:44,640
and the threads of those you don't know

163
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:50,799
so many threats and the threats of those with whom you

164
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:56,960
have or have had challenges inter-being

165
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,240

00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:12,240
in an escapeable in an inescapable network of mutuality

210
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:19,040
tied in a single garment of destiny whatever affects one directly affects

211
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:25,359
all indirectly beautiful thanks for sharing that i'll read it one more time such a beautiful

quote from dr martin luther king jr we are caught

213
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:38,960
in an inescapable network of mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny the garment

214
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,800

all indirectly can i see your hand please

216
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,400
yeah hi nikki um i've i've noticed for a long time that when i

217
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:06,960
try to send loving kindness out to other beings that i end up sitting in a puddle of

218
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:14,240
love and kindness whereas this time having the connections out there

219
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:21,040
already just feeling loving kindness just automatically went out

220
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:27,200
those those strings to other beings so that was very nice thank you oh that's

221
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,960
lovely thank you for that report from the field ken that's lovely let me

222
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:39,040
reflect that back it's what you were saying in the past as you were sending loving-kindness to other beings

223
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:45,040
your heart yourself would be filled with loving-kindness and here what you noticed was

224
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,079
um with this practice automatically with bringing to mind

225
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:57,040
this um sense of interconnection with all beings already this this thread

226
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:05,040
the um bringing the sense of uh meta loving kindness already became became shared it

227
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,400
already went out through all these networks so it's just a different way of being and it's it's lovely right to

228
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:16,800
experience a practice in different ways right thank you beautiful thank you so much that's lovely

229
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:23,319
thank you thank you ken any other reflections please

230
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,410
kristen please hi um

231
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:41,440
[Music] so i think that so right now i'm in the

232
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,599
process of applying for jobs and like waiting to hear back um

233
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,880
and so it struck me as we were meditating um

234
00:39:52,880 --> 00:40:00,160
that part of what feels so hard is kind of just like this vulnerability that um

235
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,520
it's it's other people's decision like whether i'm gonna get a job and what my

236
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,680
life is gonna be like um

237
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,760
and i noticed that you said that this practice um

238
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:24,400
sort of brings like both humility and power um and i was able to feel the humility

239
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,680
with more ease so i really appreciated that um

240
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:35,440
and i wonder if you could talk just a little bit more about like the power

241
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:41,680
that that you see coming from this yeah yeah thank you so much for for sharing

242
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:47,520
kristen and um and also your question um

243
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,880
this and also where you are in your life right now with with uh looking for a job

244
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:59,920
applying which can feel vulnerable of course it is one it can feel vulnerable and yet

245
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:08,000
and yet to feel that actually the places you're applying they depend on you right there is a dependence on

246
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:14,160
your skills on your gift on what you give to the world

247
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:22,319
and um so the sense of humility comes from wow yes as you experience there is such a

248
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:28,800
sense of oh yes interdependence and then their sense of power is the sense of agency that you

249
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,160
are part of this cloth you're an important thread in this cloth

250
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:39,839
and everybody else is because you are because of what you offer and finding

251
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:47,200
giving your gift to the world in whatever ways might be appropriate and show up but you

252
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:52,960
may not know you may not see right now you might be attached to one idea but maybe life has another idea for you how

253
00:41:52,960 --> 00:42:00,000
to show up and share your gifts your agency your your beauty your goodness so that is the

254
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,880
sense of power i am part of this cloth yes i am part of this cloth of humanity i

255
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:13,359
i am i am wow

256
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,838

257
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:28,240
yes and you're welcome to comment or you can let it go as you wish yes yeah yeah yeah helpful

258
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:34,319
thank you thank you kristen and jamie please

259
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:40,079
let this be the last comment nikki um

260
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:45,920
um i think we all know that trauma can radiate out now you know lasting effects

261
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:52,400
on ourselves and others um you know i'm thinking especially about adverse childhood experiences where there's just really

262
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,560
great research that's been done on the long-term mental and physical health impacts

263
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:05,520
and you know there's growing research about those being transmitted down generations um

264
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:11,200
so i was just thinking about that so a lot of compassion during that exercise too yeah

265
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:18,400
yeah i appreciate you bringing that in yes there are so many causes and conditions and interdependence

266
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,839
and i also really appreciate how your mind

267
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:30,319
is holding all of that with compassion it's it's not a way to be distraught like oh so

268
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:35,680
much trauma it's interesting generational etc radiating out but yes

269
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:41,839
trusting in the power of goodness that is bigger um in humanity the power of

270
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:47,839
compassion and wisdom to hold um all the all the traumas

271
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:54,560
as as we navigate this human being human together

272
00:43:54,560 --> 00:44:01,119
towards towards more wisdom and compassion um

273
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:07,040
yeah i'm reminded of of the the book the um um [Music]

274
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:12,160
i think he's called the better angels of our nature uh it's and the author is

275
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:19,440
escaping if any of you know it's uh it'll come to me but the this research

276
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:25,440
this idea that actually humanity has become stephen pinker thank you melanie yes

277
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:34,800
that that humanity has become so much kinder and less cruel over over ages and

278
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:41,440
ages and that's the direction we're going so that gives me hope that gives me hope i share a couple of reflections

279
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:48,480
in chat before we turn ko says even donald is one of the threads in the tapestry of

280
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:55,680
my life now how to be matter of fact about this compassion compassion compassion

281
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:02,560
we are yes because we all are there's so many reasons why

282
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:08,160
every being is the way they are jerry says it was very helpful to see

283
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:15,599
your power and agency coming from everyone including yourself i am because you are yes power and

284
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:23,599
agency exactly beautiful so so we have time now to turn

285
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:30,800
and and have a sense of inter being in small groups with one another small groups and

286
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:38,160
and here's the greeting i'd like to invite us to to share with one another and the greeting when you get into

287
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:45,119
groups together tonight to share the greeting i see you and there will be three of you so you

288
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:52,319
can you know one person says it and the other or two people will say it back and then you maybe you

289
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:58,160
take turns so i see you and then i am seen or we are seen

290
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:05,040
i see you we are seen and let yourself actually be seen be held by the other

291
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:11,119
being and see how powerful it could be to see someone and let yourself be seen

292
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:18,560
by them and then take take turns and maybe the first person with uh alphabetically uh just to

293
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:24,800
make it simple first name closest to the beginning of the alphabet start and go around and do

294
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:30,560
this and do it as a practice see how it feels and then of course you can share as much

295
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:37,680
