1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
hello good day everyone

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,580
hope this is audible I'm sure the chat will let me know one way or another

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:21,900
so nice to be back with you yeah it's been a bit seeing all the smiles and vows and

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:29,359
hearts a fabulous way to start a Monday

5
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:39,780
so the uh the topic I have in mind for the week is the Buddha's teachings on social and

6
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,420
communal Harmony which I'm relating to is a sort of

7
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:53,180
compliment to make dollars teachings last week on the training and emptiness

8
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,980
so let's start with a sitting let's find our way into

9
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,680
our familiar upright steady

10
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,880
meditation posture

11
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,820
let's start with a few deep breaths

12
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:53,118
connecting deliberately with this body

13
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,960
a few deep breaths feeling our way

14
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,660
healing our way into alignment

15
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,739
and feeling our way into relaxation

16
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,000
and with this connection with the breathing

17
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,080
as our basis

18
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:34,879
let's begin this process of steadying our attention with the body Here and Now

19
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:17,419
Breath by breath with a steady attention

20
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,900
sensing the particulars

21
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:32,240
warmth and coolness

22
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:41,479
Stillness trembling

23
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:00,599
steadily moment after moment

24
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,919
breath after breath

25
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:14,300
tuning in to those inner senses

26
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,960
those inner senses that are knowing Moment by moment

27
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:24,800
what's happening in this body

28
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:59,660
now if it's available

29
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,339
within this field of the body and mind

30
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,620
staying sensitive

31
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:26,459
I'd invite you to give a little bit of attention to the arising of any impulse at all

32
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:29,660
any impulse

33
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:39,800
the intention arises to scratch a niche

34
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:46,500
move the body and deliberately take up a thought

35
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,899
pattern could be anything

36
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,040
foreign

37
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,720
mentally sensitive to this body

38
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:16,940
and gently monitoring or any impulse that arises

39
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,620
right there at the end pulse

40
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:34,860
is there a sense or feeling

41
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:42,020
of its quality is it moving us toward

42
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:49,760
wholesome beneficial action

43
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:58,039
or is there a quality to the impulse live on wholesomeness

44
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,740
not a judge but just to see

45
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:13,640
what's the quality of this impulse as it comes and inevitably goes

46
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,200
extentally sensitive

47
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,480
for this body and mind

48
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,200
ful as impulses arise

49
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:17,720
mindful as impulses pass away

50
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,700
sensing their quality

51
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:35,000
this is one way in to wise View

52
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:16,840
[Music]

53
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,840
so hello again whenever we do this by Monday morning

54
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:24,360
I sense this wonderful kind of coalescing of the group

55
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:29,880
the Sangha coming together and also this feeling of embarking on something

56
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:37,200
quite a feeling for a Monday so the the theme for today is is

57
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,840
um the Buddhist teaching on social and communal Harmony it's something I'd like

58
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:49,860
to explore this week with you these five sessions and

59
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:58,080
there's a way that ajan sumato talks about the qualities of the Dharma that I think is so apparent when we

60
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,419
consider the teachings on social and communal Harmony that not only is the Dharma well spoken

61
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:10,679
but that it's apparent Here and Now Timeless encouraging investigation

62
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:17,539
that it leads onward and it's to be experienced by each of us using wisdom

63
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:24,779
the Source I'm using for for the teaching is this book this Anthology the big body

64
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:31,440
put together called the Buddhist teachings on social and communal Harmony it has 10 sections but I've sort of

65
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:39,360
reorganized things and distilled them to some key points so that we can we can talk about this in five sessions

66
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:45,020
and my hope is that our our practice and discussion together will

67
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:50,220
reveal refine kind of remind us

68
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:56,000
of how we can apply the Dharma in our everyday lives

69
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:05,039
so uh one of the I've been thinking why this topic was so

70
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:12,000
up for me interesting to me and what's what's arising this morning is

71
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
that um gosh

72
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,419
you know it's it feels like a time of transition both personally and in the world and maybe there's something about

73
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:29,760
being in the United States and us being more or less perpetually in the election cycle

74
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:36,000
or I thought oh yes this is where I want to focus my attention social and communal Harmony I wonder

75
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,820
what the Buddha said about this like what there's so much wisdom he shares with us about the the inner life

76
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:48,000
also um yeah how how does he how does he talk about Community how does he talk about

77
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,659
Society what's available to us there the first thing that I that I want to

78
00:32:54,659 --> 00:33:00,059
propose is that um with an unclear view with a foggy view

79
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:06,539
despite all of our efforts and our best intentions that we end up not acting in accord with the world

80
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:12,659
not acting in accord with things as they are or with others or with ourselves

81
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:21,320
and in a very real way with wrong view unclear view Harmony is absent

82
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:28,220
so the point of this point of this morning the right view is the Forerunner of Harmony

83
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:33,360
an upright view the Buddha said that just as the dawn is the Forerunner of

84
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:39,480
the Sun rising so is Right View the Forerunner of the noble Eightfold Path

85
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:46,760
it's the it's the thing that precedes and leads into all of these wholesome qualities

86
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:54,480
and as we'll talk about this week right view is the Forerunner of Happiness Here and Now and of Social and communal Harmony so

87
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,700
what's right view what's the Buddha talking about here it can sound a little bit like

88
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:04,860
right opinion which is decidedly not what the Buddha

89
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:10,800
meant uh in fact the Buddha Mourns over and over against clinging to views

90
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,020
instead of right opinion and the sort of uh

91
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:22,440
oh fallible stability that can come from that I think of right view more as a

92
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:28,158
working hypothesis something we can test something we can try out

93
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,898
and in Magic

94
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:38,700
the Buddha talks about right view in a number of ways he says he says it can be

95
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:45,540
the knowing of wholesome and unwholesome it can be understanding

96
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:50,760
um the relationship with um

97
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:56,658
any of the factors of the 12-fold chain and how they arise and how they pass away

98
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:02,280
so bikubody with social and communal

99
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:10,160
Harmony in mind pulls out some particular aspects of Right View for our attention

100
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:15,780
and he points out something interesting that the Buddha formulated right view in

101
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:21,599
response to some uh prevailing ideas of the time about

102
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:27,420
conditionality about cause and effect three things in particular

103
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:33,119
he formulated Right View to say one our actions

104
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:39,780
now have an effect in the future our actions of the past

105
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:46,260
have an effect now and third and this is crucial that we can discern

106
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:52,740
The Beneficial from the unbeneficial so maybe maybe we can already hear some

107
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:58,920
of the connections to Social and communal Harmony and maybe even think think of how the

108
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:05,720
how opposites might interfere with our interactions with others harmonious

109
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:12,480
aligned interactions with others one way we can flesh this out a bit is

110
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:19,619
by by getting to know a little bit what the Buddha was talking about when he said wrong view what's wrong view meet

111
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:27,380
chaditi okay you might hear the word wrong and go wait what okay wrong

112
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:32,579
are we allowed in the Buddha Dharma to talk about Rights and Wrongs is that

113
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:38,220
okay but I think I think we can consider that when running a hypothesis if we're

114
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:44,280
running if we're thinking of right view as a working hypothesis and running an experiment we need to be able to Define

115
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:52,140
some terms and make some distinctions in fact in um majima 117 and the Buddha

116
00:36:52,140 --> 00:37:00,380
defines Right View as this capacity to distinguish right view from wrong View

117
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:06,599
so what view was um body pointing at that the Buddha was responding to again

118
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:12,839
it's in three parts one that there are no fruits of our Deeds

119
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:20,460
either in this life or Beyond that what we do now actually doesn't have an effect

120
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:25,619
in using the classic metaphor of karmic karmic seed and karmic fruit

121
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:32,640
this would be like saying if we plant seeds right now nothing will grow

122
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,920
and the quality of the the seed that we plant yeah nothing's going to come out

123
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,079
so no fruits of our Deeds was the the first

124
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:48,420
the first aspect of wrong view that the Buddha was was um

125
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:55,200
pointing away from and the second is that there's no way to distinguish

126
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:01,460
a wholesome Deed from an unwholesome deed can you imagine

127
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:06,960
in the in the karmic seed and karmic fruit analogy this might be like saying

128
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:13,980
that a kale seed which brings up something wholesome that can nourish our bodies is the same as a

129
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:19,380
poisonous castor bean seed that is toxic to the touch

130
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:24,420
that there's no difference between these two things we can't actually know that this is wholesome and this is

131
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:29,880
unwholesome so that's the second aspect and then the

132
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:37,260
third is that um with regard to the path that beings in the in the language of

133
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:42,780
the text are defiled and purified without cause

134
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:49,619
now what this actually means is that we we have no say in the quality of our life

135
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:55,440
that we have no moral agency and in the analogy this means that we we

136
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,740
can't plant any seeds and even if we did they wouldn't produce anything

137
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:09,240
wrong View the important upshot for for communal Harmony is that if we act in accord with

138
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:15,839
these three views actually there's no possibility for either growth in the path

139
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:24,260
and there's no point in conducting ourselves ethically because ethical conduct has no effect

140
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:31,859
so because voting extends the idea this way and he says that Harmony in any

141
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:38,339
community whether a small group or a whole society depends on a shared commitment to

142
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:45,960
ethical conduct and we might say that right view is what makes shared ethical conduct possible

143
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:51,300
it's the observation that our our Deeds now actually do have results in the future

144
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:59,040
that how how we've acted in the past is conditioning the mind of now the group of now

145
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:05,579
the scenario of now and that it's possible for us to distinguish a wholesome Deed from an

146
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:12,060
unwholesome deed the syllogism that bikubody is putting together here is pretty simple sort of

147
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:18,480
Right View is a condition for virtuous Behavior which is a condition for a harmonious

148
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:24,420
community we might say that the harmonious

149
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:30,540
community that the Buddha envisioned had as its basis a shared understanding

150
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:35,579
in wholesome conduct and a commitment to live according to

151
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:42,359
our observations this scope of Right View about cause and

152
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:48,660
effect is called mundane right view in contrast to what we what bikubody calls

153
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:53,820
Transcendent Right View which has more to do with um

154
00:40:53,820 --> 00:41:00,480
a matured Right View that supports the the path of Liberation

155
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:08,099
specifically and this mundane Right View is where we begin this is our working hypothesis

156
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:15,859
he puts it another way and calls it the the right view of one's personal responsibility for one's Deeds

157
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:24,660
it's worth repeating and reflecting on this this notion of karma of causality of karmic fruit karmic seed

158
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:30,900
and the effect of karmic seeds in fruiting it's worth reflecting on this and repeating it because it's so Central

159
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:37,020
to the path and as we'll see through the week is the basis for an understanding in Social and

160
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:42,240
communal Harmony now how we go about training in this is

161
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:49,560
something we'll unpack over the the next several sessions but I'll say right now and flesh this out a

162
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:56,160
bit more tomorrow that the basic beginning exercise similar to what we did in the meditation today is acting

163
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:01,940
reflectively observing for ourselves the effect of our actions

164
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:07,800
observing the quality the quality of our of our impulses

165
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:12,900
and making sure making sure that we are paying attention

166
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:19,020
are we are we doing things that are wholesome are we harming others

167
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:25,859
um are we working for their suffering are we working for welfare and happiness

168
00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:32,280
this is the practice in Right View and it shows up in all sorts of ways in the teaching

169
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:37,500
but it's worth saying again Harmony in any community

170
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:43,400
the small group or a whole society depends on this commitment

171
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:54,180
so in close I'll quote because body once more he says through mundane Right View

172
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:59,700
one understands that unwholesome Karma Deeds Arisen from impure motives

173
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:05,579
these eventually rebound upon oneself and bring suffering

174
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:10,859
a bad rebirth and spiritual deterioration conversely

175
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:17,760
one understands that wholesome Karma wholesome action Deeds are risen from virtuous motives lead to happiness

176
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:25,980
fortunate rebirth and spiritual progress so for us perhaps the centrality of

177
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:32,819
Right View it can be a powerful motivator to pursue the path with Clear Vision

178
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:38,940
clear seeing inspiring to think that we have agency

179
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:46,460
that our actions matter our actions have an effect on ourselves and others and we can distinguish

180
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:51,900
harmful from unharmful and then we have this practice of

181
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:57,359
refining our conduct iteratively because we understand that our Deeds

182
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:03,060
only not only Ripple out but they also rebound upon us

183
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:08,099
we take great care with our motives and observe the effect our actions have

184
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:14,099
and then as uh Reverend Angel likes to say it's a practice not a perfect

185
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:19,140
so we keep refining our skills it's not only us who benefits but the

186
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:24,599
entire community So Right View is the Forerunner of

187
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:30,960
communal Harmony tomorrow we'll continue with this theme of the Buddha's teachings on social and

188
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:39,200
communal Harmony and will turn specifically to the topic of uh personal training particularly as it relates to

189
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:45,240
Selah virtuous conduct best wishes

190
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:51,680
I I wish for you a fruitful day of practice take care
