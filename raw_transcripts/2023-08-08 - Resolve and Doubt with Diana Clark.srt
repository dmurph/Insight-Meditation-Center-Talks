1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:04,700
good evening welcome welcome

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,519
yeah oh thank you good evening

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,900
so tonight I'd like to share with you a little bit um although I like to start off a little

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:30,420
bit from a suta the Maha goslinger and uh it's very uh I don't know I think

5
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:37,020
it's kind of interesting and a little bit fun that the Buddha he's staying in this

6
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:43,200
maybe I should say most suitors Begin by saying like where is the Buddha they give like a location I shouldn't say

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:51,239
most certain genre of suit does too and he's staying in the gosinga which is

8
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:57,000
a Saul Forest Park with salt trees and my understanding is soul trees are

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,600
these really Majestic giant beautiful trees maybe like how we might think of

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:11,240
redwood trees you know they have the certain Majesty when you're in when you're amongst them

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,900
and so the Buddha is staying there and there's a number of his uh senior monastics who are also staying there and

12
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:25,080
they're during the day they go off and meditate which is you know not so uncommon so they go off to their own

13
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:31,619
different places in this Saul forest or these salt Woods

14
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:38,340
and then um at the end of the day or kind of like late afternoon early evening one of his

15
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:45,540
monastics mahamagalana he goes to somebody else mahakasapa

16
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:52,500
and says this is Diana's rendition hey let's go hear sorry puta give a talk so they're

17
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,200
going to go to one of their friends another one of those senior monastics to go give a Derma talk

18
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:07,099
so are going to here so I pretty give a tug and then

19
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:12,599
Ruda and says oh okay invites him too so now there's three people that are going

20
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:18,480
to see sorry put to give a talk and then Ananda sees these three in the distance

21
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:26,700
it says oh what are you guys doing oh I want to go and he fights revita so now there's all

22
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:33,420
these people for me this is kind of fun I like this idea that you know they're practicing they're in silence all during

23
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,760
the day but at the end of the day they're connecting and they're friends they want to spend time together and

24
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,819
they want to go hear a Derma talk from sorry puta who is probably the most

25
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:52,019
senior monastic at the time of the Buddha so all five of them go to see sorry puta

26
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:58,920
and sorry puta sees them approaching and welcomes them and he says

27
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:05,160
by this time actually by the time I get there it's now early evening or nighttime

28
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:11,459
or maybe it's dusk something like this says inside purchases the soul Forest is

29
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:18,420
lovely and the night is bright this word we could also even say day but

30
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:25,920
he's just commenting on how it's just lovely here and how the light is and he says the salt trees are in full

31
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,319
blossom so these magnificent trees with lots of flowers it says and there's

32
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:36,780
these Divine scent that seems to float on the air so it's this really magical

33
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,959
lovely place and sorry puta asks Ananda

34
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:50,099
Ananda what kind of practitioner could illuminate or beautify this park this

35
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:56,580
place where we're practicing even more so is there somebody or that by by the

36
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:02,099
way that they talk or the way that they show up that could just make this even better

37
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:07,680
and Ananda says and remember Ananda is the Buddha's attendant and he's the one

38
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,319
who the tradition holds was there when the Buddha gave all these talks and

39
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:19,799
remembered them and so after the Buddha died it was Ananda who taught all these discourses

40
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:25,860
to everybody else and this is how they got preserved Through the Ages before so

41
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,960
Ananda is known for his memory and known for knowing all the Buddha's talks being

42
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:37,020
familiar with them so sorry puta asks Ananda what kind of practitioner would make this or maybe we

43
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:42,240
might even say what kind of practice would make this even more beautiful

44
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,600
and Ananda says a person who has learned much who

45
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,479
remembers what he has learned and consolidates what he has learned and then gives teachings that are beautiful

46
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,759
in the beginning beautiful in the middle and beautiful in the end that is

47
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:06,720
somebody who would make it more beautiful so you know it's probably not a coincidence that Ananda who's known for

48
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,720
having learned everything and remembered it saying oh yeah somebody who has learned it and remembered it that's that

49
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:20,220
would be the best and then sorry puta says well Ananda has responded according to his

50
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:25,380
own ideal right recognizing that this is something maybe unique to Ananda

51
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:31,139
but then sorry puta says well what about you revita what kind of practitioner

52
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:36,600
could beautify or illuminate this park even more where we're practicing and

53
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:43,740
revita was this preeminent meditator he was he was known as somebody that would like to go off on a retreat and he would

54
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:49,259
just go off and practice on his own and he'd like to just spend time in meditation

55
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:55,020
so revita he says well a person who Delights in Retreat and takes Delight in

56
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:02,940
Retreat and who is devoted to internal Serenity of mind and does not neglect meditation a person

57
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:09,539
who possesses insight and dwells in empty huts dwell in an empty Hut some of

58
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:16,080
you may know the Buddha is often given instructions like oh go into an empty huts and meditate or go to a footed tree

59
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,199
and meditate so not surprisingly Sarah puta says well

60
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:29,220
Ravena has responded according to his own ideal what about you Anna Ruda who do you

61
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:34,500
think would be the most beautiful and Anna Ruda says well a person who

62
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:41,639
surveys the entire galaxy with a Clairvoyance that is purified and surpasses the human so you know Anna

63
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:48,000
Ruda is something that's saying something fantastic and

64
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,780
then sorry puto replies well according to his own ideal and then he goes and he asks

65
00:06:53,780 --> 00:07:00,539
and he goes asked sorry puta and so all of them are giving these ideas about

66
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:05,940
what they are known for so there's six different people they

67
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:12,300
give six different ideas I think they may be all delighting in this and then they go well let's go talk

68
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,759
to the Buddha let's see what he has to say

69
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:22,560
so they go to the Buddha and sorry puta recounts everything that happens

70
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:29,940
and then the Buddha replies good good after Ananda answered in the way that's

71
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:36,360
right for him revita uncertain the way that's right for him aniruda answered in the way that's right

72
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:42,780
for him right he says this for each person and then sorry put to us well venerable

73
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:49,699
sir who has spoken well like he kind of maybe wants to know

74
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:55,460
and the Buddha replies you have all spoken well

75
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:03,720
there's a little bit more to this but for me I would love this actually right the Buddha isn't saying no this one's

76
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:10,139
best or that's you know the worst or anything like this he's saying you've all spoken well

77
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:17,220
these are all the seniors these are all the Buddha's senior disciples and they all have different expertise or they all

78
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:25,919
have different Specialties or you know proclivities or things that ways in which they practice

79
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:32,000
six different people six different ways in the Buddha and you've all spoken well

80
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:39,599
which I feel touched by because it's not like there's only one way and it has to look a particular way

81
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:46,680
the Buddha is recognizing that different people bring different things to practice and the practice matures in

82
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:52,800
them differently and shows up in them differently whether it's exactly the same way is gets described here

83
00:08:52,800 --> 00:09:00,440
is not the point I'd like to say is more that it doesn't have to look one particular way

84
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:08,100
so I put to us the Buddha who has spoken well and he says you have all spoken

85
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:14,700
well each in his own way but let me also as to what kind of person would beautify

86
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:21,200
this Saul Forest echosinka so now the Buddha is going to give his answer

87
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,580
is a person who returns from alms round and after the mill sits down

88
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:32,399
cross-legged sets their body straight and establishes mindfulness

89
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,580
practices mindfulness and then and resolves I shall not break

90
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:45,180
this city in position until through not clinging my mind is liberated from the taints

91
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:51,420
so those of you who know the story of the Buddha this is Verbatim what the Buddha says himself before he becomes

92
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:58,320
awakened this resolve this determination to after so many years of practice that

93
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,420
he's going to sit and tell and not move until he's awakened

94
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:10,320
so for me here's a seventh person who has a seventh way to show up but I

95
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,380
appreciate that the Buddha he's not talking about these great fantastic Having learned lots of things having

96
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:21,779
clairvoyances concealed galaxies or going off and meditating a lot he's just

97
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:28,580
talking about bringing mindfulness sitting down and bringing mindfulness with some resolve

98
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:34,380
this is something all of us can do this is something that you know the

99
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:40,800
Buddha is holding up it's just something ordinary is this this mindfulness practice yes

100
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:47,700
when the Buddha did it he had this resolve that he wasn't going to move until he became awakened but

101
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:55,019
I would like to think just this idea of resolve so I would like to say that each of us

102
00:10:55,019 --> 00:11:02,820
have our own way of maybe like Illuminating or beautifying this kind of like a practice area with our own

103
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,980
practice this way of kind of embodying this path

104
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:13,500
of practice but resolve is something that we can

105
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:19,079
bring to whatever flavor or way in which we practice

106
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:24,720
so mindfulness as it matures may show up in all kinds of different ways

107
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,959
but with some resolve allows this mindfulness to Blossom and to unfold and

108
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,779
to bloom in a way in which can bring greater and greater freedom and peace

109
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:43,820
so what what does this mean to be have resolved with practice

110
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,399
so number of ways we can think about it but some of it is like just certain amount of tenacity or

111
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:57,180
determination or stick-to-itiveness or maybe overcoming resistance to

112
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:02,760
meditation all of us everybody has said I don't

113
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,800
feel like meditating I don't want to oh I'm not going to go

114
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:13,500
to the dharmatology oh I'm not going to sit yeah okay I see my cushion there and I usually meditate it this time but I

115
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,959
don't feel like it I mean all of us do this

116
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:24,660
it's part of the human's experience but maybe this resolve is maybe just like

117
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:30,000
putting aside alternatives instead of sleeping in or whatever it

118
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:38,279
may be or maybe it resolve means having enough trust or faith or confidence in

119
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:46,200
ourselves or in the practice that even though we might not feel like it that we still are willing to meditate practice

120
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:52,560
mindfulness and here's something that I think is really important

121
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:59,399
it's about this resolve I I wish I had a better uh word that I could translate

122
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:06,240
the poly word aritana with because sometimes when we hear about resolve we feel it can be like this

123
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,360
really like straining and striving and pushing

124
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,880
and it turns out that works for a little bit and then it doesn't

125
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:24,000
can take I don't think it'll ever work just to hear somebody say that I think we all have to have that experience

126
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,279
but there's a way in which there can be some real striving and straining and

127
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,380
this driving and straining itself is what is getting in the way of

128
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:39,540
practice because there's a way in which which

129
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:45,959
often fueling this training or this driving of this I gotta get it which of

130
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:52,019
course this works in our professional life it works in our educational life but it doesn't work in our meditation

131
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:58,320
life because what's fueling that is there's a big sense of

132
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,339
I have to make something happen

133
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,959
and as I said it works for a little bit and we need a little something amount of

134
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:19,260
that but so much about practice is having this trust that you don't have to

135
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:26,940
make everything happen at that moment and then negotiating or navigating like

136
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:33,240
and figuring out well what does that mean exactly because to be sure it certainly takes effort to get to the

137
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,060
cushion it takes resolve determination to keep on meditating even though you

138
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:46,019
don't feel like it or even to begin but there's a way in which it can kind

139
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:51,320
of like collapse and just turn into a

140
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:58,500
um there's a word that where you're just gonna I forget what the word is exactly but

141
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:04,519
you're just like you're slogging through snow and you're like going to just uh

142
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:12,660
bearing it out so resolve is letting go of the idea that

143
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:18,420
personal growth can just come quickly with minimal effort but also recognizing

144
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,579
that it needs some amount of effort and this is part of what the

145
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:30,300
art of practices is getting the sense of well what is the right amount of effort

146
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:36,180
and so resolve is also about recognizing that you know it's not always fun or

147
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:42,959
easy and that to recognize that difficulties are part of the path

148
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:48,360
that it's not necessarily always Pleasant or comfortable

149
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:54,480
and then when those times when we do give up just to begin again

150
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:01,620
as best we can like if even if we haven't meditated for a long time or we haven't done any of

151
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:07,079
these practices that we like to do and we just kind of gosh it's been

152
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:12,180
months just to begin again it doesn't have to be complicated we

153
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:17,699
don't have to add all these stories about what it means about us as a person or as a

154
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:25,019
meditator we just simply Begin Again and to be sure for some people this idea

155
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:30,300
of perseverance or resolve is a quality that they already have an abundance of

156
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:37,199
that they are those type of people they make a plan they do it and they just don't stop until it's done

157
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:42,240
maybe for those people working with resolve aditana

158
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,120
is a way that maybe the the edge of their practice is how to

159
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:54,959
have this resolve without getting too tight or too constricted or how to do it

160
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:01,860
that how to continue practice without it turning into drudgery is there a way

161
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:07,500
that there can be some lightness to it I know sometimes for me I sometimes can

162
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:13,380
fall into drudgery like oh my gosh I have to do this and I sometimes just uh

163
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:22,199
like will do it even though it's uh I could like make it more light or not

164
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:28,740
quite so heavy but I'm like oh my gosh I have to do this it doesn't have to be that way right but sometimes we

165
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:34,559
can slip into this sense of this drudgery or maybe for some people that's

166
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:41,940
not so hard to continue their practice or to stay with it but there can be a way maybe in which they disconnect from

167
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:48,600
people or Brusque with people like go away I'm meditating or no I can't do that I have to meditate or something

168
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,760
like this that their relationships get affected because they're going to

169
00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:00,120
finish this project whatever it is so for some people resolve or aritana is

170
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:05,820
not so much about keep on coming back but it's about to have this

171
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:11,220
stick-to-itiveness with some spaciousness and some openness and some

172
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:18,480
ease and this is so much about the art of practice is having this ease and

173
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:25,140
openness and stick-to-itiveness we so often kind of want to collapse

174
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:30,480
around the things that we're doing or need to do but is there a way that we

175
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,900
can do it with some Joy or some happiness

176
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:44,539
so I would say this what are these things that we resolve on

177
00:18:54,179 --> 00:19:00,179
I've been giving the examples of meditation practice but you know as part

178
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:06,660
of Buddhist practice we have this resolve to not harm not harm others not harm ourselves

179
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:13,140
this to be mindful of what's happening if whether it's on the formally on the cushion or whatever is happening in our

180
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:18,660
life and maybe this resolved to let go was

181
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:24,480
best we can this recognition that clinging is and holding on really tightly is

182
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,820
lever The Way Forward never the best way forward but it's more kind of like opening

183
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:34,460
letting go is the way forward

184
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:42,780
so what are some of the things that get in the way of resolve well it turns out

185
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:48,900
that that hindrances to meditation are also the same hindrances to resolve as same

186
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:58,140
hindrances to so many things in our life [Applause] so this idea that um

187
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:05,520
these five energies these five occupations of the mind that show up

188
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:12,360
in our formal meditation practice are also what's getting in the way so Central desire

189
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:18,120
ill will sloth and torpor restlessness and doubt

190
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:26,160
these are five obstacles to practice or five obstacles

191
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:34,140
to doing anything that we really want to do and so they can distract us from our

192
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:39,600
intentions our aspirations and they actually have a pretty powerful in our

193
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,600
life if we're not aware of them they can push us around in such an incredible way

194
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:54,559
and I I'd like to talk about one of them in particular and that is doubt

195
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:03,240
because this we might have this um might be way this might happen there's

196
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:09,539
so many different ways that doubt shows up but maybe there's uh we're meditating and everything's going along swimmingly

197
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:14,940
and then it becomes uncomfortable either because we have some emotions

198
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:21,480
memories or something or thoughts oh my gosh I forgot to do that thing and

199
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:29,220
and now this terrible thing is gonna happen and I gotta jump up and send that email or do this or do that

200
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:35,280
or maybe it's just pain in the knee or in the back or whatever it might be

201
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:41,100
so maybe the meditation's going along well then maybe there's a flash of uncomfortableness

202
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:47,880
with this flash of uncomfortableness maybe there's this inner critic that arises like

203
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:55,440
do this everybody else seems to be able to do it but I can't do it or maybe there's something about uh

204
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,400
I shouldn't have even started why who do I think that I am or I don't know there's so many ways that we can

205
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:10,380
undermine our capability start to doubt ourselves

206
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:17,880
or maybe we even start thinking why am I doing this meditation thing anyway I'm not even sure that it helps or it used

207
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:23,220
to help but it doesn't seem to be helping now or you know there's so many ways in which

208
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:30,720
the thinking we can cook up and dream up all these ways that practice seems to

209
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,900
not be helpful or we think this maybe isn't worthwhile anything except all the

210
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:44,460
opposite except resolve you might notice that you don't have

211
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:51,360
these types of thoughts when meditation is going well when we're feeling settled

212
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:59,100
when we feel like we have a certain amount of ease so it's only when there's a certain when

213
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:04,220
it's uncomfortable or there's a certain

214
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:10,440
feeling like well maybe I'd rather do something else and who knows maybe it's

215
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,780
because we want to avoid something or maybe it is the discomfort

216
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:22,080
but a consequence something that happens when this type of thinking starts like well maybe

217
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,539
I shouldn't do this I should be doing something else and I'm not even sure this is helpful anyway

218
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:32,580
as soon as we get lost or caught up in that type of thinking then we're no

219
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:40,100
longer actually with our experience said we're lost in our thoughts

220
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,480
and I love what Carolina Buddha was saying you know this person who sits

221
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:51,419
down in his mindfulness he was kind of like holding this up as a ideal practice

222
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:57,299
so not so much that we have to do it perfectly

223
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:03,120
but as soon as we're lost in thoughts then you know thoughts can go anywhere

224
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:10,140
and everywhere and they do so is there a way that we can just

225
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:15,840
bring awareness back to oh this is a lot of we could even use this

226
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:21,900
word doubt this is doubt about myself this is doubt about the practice or

227
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:26,840
doubt about the teachings or doubt about the teacher

228
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:33,539
so this sense of hesitation or vacillation or might getting lost in

229
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:40,679
papancha this like proliferation of thoughts and one way to think about conflict

230
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:47,340
doubt is that when I when I think about the experience right

231
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:54,720
this is a hindrance that shows up for everybody there's a certain amount of swirling like oh I'm not sure I'll do

232
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:01,519
this maybe I'll do that sort of has that kind of a little bit of an energetic feel

233
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:08,760
and so when we recognize either these thoughts I'm not sure I should do this or I want to do this or there's that

234
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:15,600
feeling this vacillation this hesitation we can just tune into that that

235
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:21,240
experience and maybe name it oh this is doubt

236
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:27,600
because doubt rarely shows up and announces itself oh this is doubt instead it's

237
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:34,080
trying to you know say like be wisdom you oh it'd be better if you should do self-care take care of

238
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:40,679
yourself and go do something else just sleep in or take a nap instead and to be

239
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:45,720
sure sometimes you should sleep in and take a nap but you know sometimes you know just

240
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:50,240
meditation practice is what's needed

241
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:59,400
so we could one way to practice with doubt is just to recognize it and name it it's really helpful

242
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:05,700
to bring it back to the body it's a really good way to feel like this sense of uncertainty I don't really know what

243
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:12,120
to do it can be helpful to like maybe like feel the foundation like what you're

244
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:18,480
sitting on feel the connectedness the settledness oh I'm here right now

245
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:25,799
when I'm doing this I'm doing this meditation practice so to get out of this abstract thinking

246
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:31,620
and the philosophizing sometimes we can just get lost and

247
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:38,640
abstract thinking of course we can there might be this restlessness or this

248
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:46,679
heaviness or the sense of unease so to tune into the bodily experience

249
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:54,860
mindfulness First Foundation of mindfulness you can also remind yourself that

250
00:26:54,860 --> 00:27:02,039
thoughts are just thoughts they're just thoughts thoughts feel like

251
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:07,080
right they're ephemeral they a whole other set of thoughts are

252
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:16,020
going to show up in another moment so you don't have to like grab these thoughts and hold them to be authoritative and have them be the like

253
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:23,580
this is the truth of the moment they're just thoughts this could say is mindfulness too is the

254
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:28,919
third Foundation mindfulness of the Mind and so somewhere to kind of like

255
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:35,039
undermine this idea that oh this is not a good thing to do or I'm not

256
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:42,179
even sure what I should do and then investigate get a little bit

257
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:47,460
curious as if you were a naturalist I like this

258
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:53,340
idea of being a naturalist so okay so I'm having all this doubt

259
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:59,039
and it feels like this and you might do a gentle inquiry was there something

260
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:05,100
that planted the seed for it it could be a particular question

261
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:12,900
could be a particular uncomfortable experience and with this uncomfortable experience then their inner critic shows

262
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:18,000
up and like you know likes to take over and maybe like undermine what you're doing

263
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,840
think like ah it's not gonna work so you can investigate

264
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:30,720
and then you something that might be helpful is like to if you

265
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:38,100
just have it inquiry is there a particular question that I have

266
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:43,679
is there something that I really do have doubt about

267
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,779
the teachings particular things that you're not so sure about

268
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:56,159
or maybe you're not so sure about the teacher or maybe you're not so sure about yourself but it can be helpful to

269
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:02,580
get a little bit more specific is there a specific question sometimes it could be helpful even to write this

270
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:10,080
down and that can really help clarify instead of this vacillation then once you have a

271
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,480
question you can maybe go find an answer listen to Dharma books talk to other

272
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:22,620
people talk to teachers do more practice either so Google it right these days

273
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:27,960
right there's a way in which you can like do something to maybe answer your

274
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:34,080
question or maybe you can just recognize okay it feels like this to have a question

275
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,919
that's different than doubt that type of a question that's welcome like that's

276
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:46,380
definitely part of the practice to have a question and maybe not know the answer

277
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:52,980
that's really part of the practice there's so much that we don't have the answers to and I'm going like this with

278
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:59,399
my hands because not knowing is a way that we're letting go of

279
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:05,100
knowing exactly what the next moment is going to bring always having the answer is a way in

280
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:10,980
which we're kind of like suddenly trying to control things and so that we feel more comfortable

281
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:16,380
but not knowing is uncomfortable but there's a way in which also not knowing

282
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:21,840
has that's where that freedom is if we always knew what's going to happen

283
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:28,679
next there's no Freedom there it's so it this having the question is a

284
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:37,260
big part of the way forward so when there's a doubt can you identify specific question and

285
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:43,980
maybe find the answer but maybe there isn't an answer and can you be okay with that practice with that

286
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:51,720
and that turns again away kind of the away from this vesselation and hesitation to oh yeah I have this

287
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:57,179
question and and not knowing that answer feels like this

288
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:03,299
that's mindfulness again and then maybe one less way to work with

289
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:11,340
doubt that I'll mention there's a number of ways but for tonight I'll end on this one to bring to mind well what do you have

290
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:17,460
confidence in what do you know about the practice or

291
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:23,940
about yourself sometimes it can be helpful to reflect like oh yeah before I had a meditation

292
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:28,980
practice I didn't realize how busy my mind was I didn't realize for example

293
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:35,220
what a planner I was or since I've been mindful I've not only

294
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:41,760
have I gained this greater understanding but I have a little bit more patience with other people because I see how

295
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:49,140
they're trying to just figure things out in the same way that I'm trying to figure things out or

296
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:55,380
maybe there's this way that we can bring to mind you know there have been times that my practice

297
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:00,600
have been really uplifting and meaningful or maybe transformative

298
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:06,960
and it wasn't always that way has been moments like that but maybe it

299
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:13,559
will be that way again so instead of like abandoning things when things get

300
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:19,919
difficult just remember that there have been times there have been some real fruits of

301
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:26,100
practice and then also to remind ourselves that when we sit down

302
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:31,200
chance to meditate chances are at the beginning however it is that feels the

303
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:38,039
meditation is is not how it is at the end right there's if the meditation shifts

304
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:44,460
and changes through the meditation period sometimes at the end it's worse and sometimes it's better but it's never

305
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:50,399
exactly the way that it is at the beginning so sometimes we might feel like oh this would be terrible there's

306
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:56,399
no way I can sit here for all this time but just this memory just that you know

307
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:03,080
there have been times when the mind has really settled and opened and there's been some ease

308
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:10,740
so the Buddha talked about you know so many different ways of practice I mean it

309
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:17,399
shows up in many different ways emphasize mindfulness and resolve

310
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:23,159
and then we can ask ourselves what is it that gets in the way of resolve and very

311
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:28,500
often it's doubt not exclusively but very often it's doubt and so we can

312
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:36,179
practice with doubt by being mindful of it by investigating it getting a little bit

313
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:42,059
curious about it and maybe tuning into or see if we can simplify it

314
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:49,019
into a particular question or we can also bring to mind what we have confidence in or what some of our

315
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:55,220
experience has been with meditation that has been uplifting

316
00:33:56,039 --> 00:34:01,080
so with that this is kind of like I like this I started with the gosinga

317
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:06,539
mahakosuta in which you know there's these people that come together and they practice

318
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:13,020
together and they appreciate each other and they also recognize that you know the practice doesn't look exactly the

319
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:21,300
same for everybody and sometimes something that can undermine our practice is the doubt that

320
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:27,118
takes the form of oh they look like they have it and I don't or clearly they're

321
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:33,839
doing something better than I am or something like that but just this recognition that practice looks

322
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:41,000
different for different people I think I'll end there so thank you

323
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:50,399
and I'll open it up if there are any questions or comments

324
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,839
hi I think when you're talking about the the doubt or the five hindrances it kind

325
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:07,740
of reminded me of how a lot of times we sort of separate ourselves or we we have a trouble finding common ground and I

326
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:15,780
was thinking we all have a lot of you know um share a lot of our own sort of doubt and and share that in common with

327
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:21,540
everyone else but I think we uh spend more time the things that probably separate us

328
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:27,119
instead of unite us but it was interesting to think about sharing some negative qualities

329
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:32,760
yeah it's true right it's uh surprising well I've talked about this number of

330
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,800
times how much I love like you know the Buddha talked about these thousands of years ago so there's countless people

331
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:43,859
that have been having doubts about practice you know through all these years and I think it's something that's

332
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:49,079
kind of it is definitely part of practice absolutely and not only about practice but

333
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:54,240
everything in our life right yeah thank you

334
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:00,119
the common humanity is what it means to be a human is to part of a staffed out

335
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:05,220
thank you anybody else have a comment or a

336
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,338
question

337
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:23,220
well I'll make a comment just the last couple weeks I watched a

338
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:29,460
documentary called the endurance about Sir Ernest Shackleton

339
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:35,220
and how dedicated he was once his ship once it

340
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:43,020
was clear that he wasn't going to be able to get to Antarctica to save all of his men and you know there was just a sense of

341
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:48,960
never giving up never exactly knowing what

342
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:55,380
was the right thing to do whether they were going to be able to get the land or to certain Islands

343
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:01,619
um but it was a very inspiring documentary

344
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:07,400
about that sense of um

345
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:14,220
just keeping investigating what you know what's what

346
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:20,040
are the possibilities now I mean as the ship got carried by the ice you know

347
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:25,260
what was going to be closest than what could they save and what couldn't they

348
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:31,440
So yeah thank you thank you Jim because that brings to mind something else that could help with doubt is if there's

349
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:37,079
something for us that's particularly inspiring or motivating like you're a type of North Star that's really

350
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:42,900
important to us just like Shackleton wanting to save all those men is there something maybe it's not the same as

351
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:49,800
saving our other people but maybe there's something that really you know drives us or motivates us or inspires us

352
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,720
so actually thank you thank you Jim

353
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,880
thank you

354
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:08,880
this is the half-page thought so maybe it'll finish as it comes out so I read that suit a couple years ago and I

355
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:15,420
really liked it and it seemed to me that Maybe

356
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:22,200
this was written down long after the Buddha because um all these characters in it

357
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:27,420
have got superpowers that are larger than life and it's almost like the X-Men or the

358
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:34,200
Legion of Superheroes um and they're very well defined as if they've got they're all wearing their

359
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:39,420
their different colored costumes um

360
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:44,700
is this game better and better and also it just seems

361
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:50,460
unlikely that they would all be in the same place at the same time and the Buddha would be there near there

362
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:56,339
too um and I'd also remember

363
00:38:56,339 --> 00:39:02,280
really loving about the story that I thought sure they were going to come to blows

364
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:10,079
because they also vigorously disagreed and you know the the guys with the elephant came to blows yes yes uh but

365
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:16,800
they were blind yes and these were all arahants yes and

366
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,140
this is a healthy way to have differences of opinion um and then I was really sure that the

367
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:28,380
Buddha was going to sculpt them and say why are you worried about which of you was even more right than the other one

368
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:34,500
that's not a wise thing to have your minds on so no you all you all spoke well and here's

369
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:40,440
what I have to say um think there was something really really gentle

370
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,900
about that so my thoughts on that thank you thank you

371
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:51,000
yeah I was in my mind I had kind of this idea that uh

372
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,660
sorry puto who's the one who's doing this speaking he just wants to hear from everybody and it doesn't matter so much what they

373
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:02,760
have to say or something like that uh I don't know and then going to see the

374
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:09,599
Buddha yeah it is curious like why did they go see the Buddha was it to resolve something or just to share like hey look

375
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:15,839
look what we did we just sat around and talked about this or something I don't know it's it's kind of there's I guess

376
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:21,540
there's a number of ways we can read between the lines but I think only uh one of them has these superpowers I

377
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:25,140
think it's only superpowers

378
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:34,560
yeah is wearing the costume if one of these I don't really know the

379
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,500
X-Men but I know the the premise so but I was thinking of you know the finger

380
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:47,040
quotes superpower yeah of asking the right question or being able to sit for

381
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:53,900
long long times that maybe not superpowers but characteristics yeah they're very finely

382
00:40:53,900 --> 00:41:00,000
distinguished yeah yeah you know I uh there's some other hints in here too

383
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,480
about um why actually it might be a leader suta just to have but you know I don't

384
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:14,160
know but I I pulled this together because I thought that I don't know it's kind of nice like how there's practice shows up

385
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,440
in different ways we don't all have to look the same

386
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:24,079
okay okay thank you all
