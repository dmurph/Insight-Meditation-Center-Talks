1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:08,879
so hello and to everyone

2
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:28,960
and so for this final meditation on the topic of the

3
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:36,360
week [Music] the the symptoms or the consequence of

4
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:44,200
letting go well consequence of non-

5
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:52,480
clinging that when we uh when we are able to let go of clinging to

6
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,519
something take the time to appreciate the after effect the results

7
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:05,640
of that and one of excuse me for a

8
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:17,439
minute and uh one of the consequences that is that we're able to

9
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,400
think better that when there's a lot of clinging a lot of attachments it isn't

10
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:30,400
just we're attach to one thing we're being propelled by um momentum of

11
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,280
wanting not wanting grasping resisting it's an accumulation it's a gathering

12
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:42,920
together it's a it becomes almost a way by which we are thinking we're

13
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:49,640
thinking motivated or driven by the very uh force of attachment force of

14
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,520
clinging force of preoccupation force of worry that we

15
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,640
have and thinking that comes from that kind of pressure

16
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:10,840
is not usually the best kind of thinking we can have uh it limits the the the fullness

17
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:19,280
or the full um um the full or the Deep capacity we have

18
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,640
to think to reflect we think much better wiser

19
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:33,160
Kinder more loving more wiser is probably the word I like to use the most

20
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:40,200
when we've let go when we've when we're not thinking is not being driven by

21
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:49,440
clinging and so one of the symptoms of non- clinging is feeling and sensing

22
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,120
experiencing a wiser more useful more connected way of

23
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,760
thinking and in meditation that plays out in that we're not so preoccupied

24
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:09,000
we're not preoccupied at all to think about things having not that have nothing to do with meditation or say it

25
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,560
more precisely that have nothing to do with connecting to what's happening as

26
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,440
present moment experience the Mind might be thinking about the the

27
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:27,280
future planning or worrying but the deep

28
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,879
thinking is uh is thinking that helps us to have an overview of that what's going

29
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:40,319
on for us to see clearly oh this is thinking about the future there's a deeper place from which

30
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:46,000
we observe we reflect we consider what's happening including considering the

31
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,239
surface thinking we have that is the thinking that comes from when there's

32
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:57,280
still some of this momentum of of grasping that might be

33
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:04,519
operating so it's not a matter of in meditation thinking or not

34
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:12,280
thinking it's a matter of thinking superficially or with blinders on or

35
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:20,199
with with thinking with agendas and thinking in a deeper

36
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:27,160
way holistic way a way that feels the thinking connects us to the present

37
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:34,080
moment as opposed to thinking that takes us away away from it and that thinking tends to be

38
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,600
quieter slower more peaceful and it's a thinking that

39
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:47,240
doesn't need to think it's a thinking that points

40
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:53,199
almost to that which is beyond

41
00:04:53,639 --> 00:05:00,560
thinking it's almost as if you can sense in that deep thinking

42
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,880
the quiet or the peace or the Stillness or the

43
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:12,840
well-being the expansiveness within which this deep

44
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,000
thinking is occurring and so as we let

45
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,759
go in this meditation you might want to see if there's that gives you an

46
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:31,639
opportunity to have this deep form of thinking

47
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:40,600
this more holistic quieter peaceful thinking that points you or keeps

48
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:47,720
you in this very rich and valuable connection to yourself to reality that's

49
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:54,720
all about what's Happening Here and Now and as I said you might your surface

50
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,560
mind might still be thinking about other things but the Deep Mind

51
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,759
sees it all clearly is not tricked to be pulled away from

52
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,479
here so assuming a meditation

53
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:24,360
posture and thinking of the posture a little bit like a temple or a sacred grove or

54
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:31,560
a peaceful spot that you've known nature or at home

55
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,440
that the the posture you take let it be somewhat

56
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,199
intentional so it can be the it can

57
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,680
house a deeper connection a deeper

58
00:06:52,680 --> 00:07:01,520
source for thinking and gently close your eyes

59
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:16,720
gently intentionally intentionally in a slow

60
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,960
way take a few long slow deep

61
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
breaths

62
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,000
relaxing as you

63
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,759
exhale and then letting your breathing return

64
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,000
to

65
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:20,960
normal and as you exhale to relax the muscles of your

66
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:29,080
face the tensions We Carry in our body are part of this accumulated

67
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:37,479
tension accumul that perpetuates the shallow thinking the

68
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:44,159
surface thinking the thinking which has a comp

69
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:51,600
compulsion behind it relaxing the body is a beginning of

70
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,279
softening that compulsive

71
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:05,160
thinking as you exhale relaxing the

72
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,160
shoulders

73
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
softening

74
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,639
then softening the

75
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,399
belly and then taking some time to feel and sense

76
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:11,040
the momentum or energy or pressure in the thinking

77
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:23,680
mind and as you exhale to soften relax quiet the

78
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:31,320
thinking mind

79
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
for

80
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:18,800
and then settling into your

81
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
breathing

82
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:48,120
and with every exhale let go of whatever you're

83
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:54,160
thinking about let go of preoccupation with what

84
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:01,240
you're thinking about

85
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:25,440
let go and while you exhale so you're able to receive the

86
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,160
inhale with a freshness or an openness

87
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
for

88
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
for

89
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
for

90
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
for

91
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,480
for a little bit longer with every exhale let go of your

92
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,480
thoughts any thoughts so so

93
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,920
that when you inhale you can be more connected to your

94
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:15,279
immediate experience here and now maybe through the sensations of

95
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,439
inhaling maybe through your body's

96
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,759
experience or maybe through a PR present moment

97
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:41,319
recognition of what is happening to you otherwise let go with the

98
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:51,560
exhale and then remember to be present Here and Now on the

99
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
inhale

100
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
for

101
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
for

102
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
for

103
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
for

104
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

105
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

106
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

107
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:43,600
continuing on the exhale to let go let go of any momentum any

108
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:52,559
preoccupation let go of even what you're not attached

109
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:59,960
to for these few moments as you exhale so it's clear here nothing you're

110
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,520
holding on

111
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:15,240
to if you can't let go relax

112
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:24,480
soften lessen the attachment to whatever degree you

113
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
can

114
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
for

115
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,880
and then as you inhale from the profoundest place you

116
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:17,840
know within or the most holistic way you

117
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:25,520
know use the simplest possible thought to connect you to What's

118
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,520
Happening Here and Now maybe the simple

119
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:38,240
thought this or

120
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,879
here or

121
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:53,520
now an upwelling of a more deeper way of

122
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:03,240
thinking that put you in a part partnership with the

123
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:11,240
deepest fullest place within a place of non- clinging

124
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
nonattachment

125
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

126
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

127
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
for

128
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
for

129
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
for

130
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,240
and then gently softly

131
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:06,320
take just a little bit deeper inhales than usual in

132
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:14,840
meditation so you can have a longer exhale in which to let

133
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:24,080
go relax settle in more deeply into

134
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
yourself

135
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:48,559
letting go of the tension or pressure agitation that might be

136
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:53,039
associated with thinking thinking

137
00:26:53,640 --> 00:27:00,240
mind a softening of the thinking mind

138
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
for

139
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:45,399
and from whatever degree of Letting Go relaxing being present you

140
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:50,320
have see if there can well up from

141
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:57,480
within some wisdom that you have some way of thinking about the

142
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,799
present moment about practicing in the present moment

143
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:08,240
that you have what Wise

144
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:15,518
Way can you think about being here and

145
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:27,200
now thinking about how it's valuable so that it connects you to that

146
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,120
very way of being

147
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,039
her

148
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:13,440
and then from this deeper source of thinking a quieter place a wiser place

149
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:19,720
within from that place turn your gaze outward into the

150
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:27,640
world to the people you'll meet today both people you know and strangers

151
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,039
on the

152
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:43,679
streets and from a deeper place of wisdom deeper place of non-

153
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:50,640
clinging what for you would be a

154
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:57,760
friendly respectful kind way of gazing upon the people in your

155
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,039
life

156
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,760
and maybe perh from this deep

157
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:30,159
place these following words will resonate for you May

158
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:38,919
others be happy May others be

159
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:45,000
safe may others be

160
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,278
peaceful May others be

161
00:30:54,120 --> 00:31:00,600
free and may I look upon the world without those

162
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:06,120
wishes may my thinking my way of being

163
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:12,799
support this way of seeing everyone may all

164
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,399
beings be

165
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:26,919

hello and welcome to this last talk

170
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:56,080
on the results or

171
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:04,480
the symptoms of of non- clinging now non- clinging letting go of

172
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:11,879
clinging dissolving clinging having clinging

173
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:20,279
somehow lesson and lesson until maybe it disappears The these are not easy to do

174
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:26,600
and it can't be done necessarily just sit down and just let go let go let go like we did in the last

175
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:32,320
meditation but but as we keep practicing every time we come back to

176
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:41,760
breathing every time we come back to mindfulness a Moment of clarity of knowing and seeing it is a kind of that's letting go

177
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:47,000
or maybe a different way of saying it is is a kind of kind of way of no

178
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,000
longer uh feeding the clinging we have the attachments we

179
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,600
have and it might not seem very significant one moment like that but the

180
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:06,720
accumulation of moments of not feeding or clinging not being involved in our clinging is has a dramatic results that

181
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,280
you can see and highlight if you remember or consider that for many of us

182
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:20,240
we have spent decades with a kind of thinking that's being propelled by some forms of

183
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:27,240
compulsion attachment clinging wanting not wanting and U and given that we've done

184
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:32,280
decades of that the amount of time it takes to begin softening and relaxing is

185
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:37,839
relatively short even though the process might be imperceptible in the moment

186
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:43,480
still uh can happen much faster than the opposite

187
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:51,440
happen so as we begin to lessen our attachments lessen that drive to be

188
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:58,560
attached to be clinging to be to be repressing to be resisting to be

189
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:05,880
the whatever that whatever form the attachment takes at some point something begins

190
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:12,359
shifting within us and it's not just a matter of clinging or not clinging but

191
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:18,240
it's beginning to appreciate something that's growing within us something a different way of being a different

192
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:24,880
sensibility and that's been the theme for this week so um there can grow a

193
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,680
sense of well-being a sense of spaciousness

194
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:38,560
expansiveness a sense of um Peace and ease there can grow a sense of feeling

195
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:47,440
more connected to our life and what's happening now there can also uh arise a deeper

196
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:53,319
deeper sense of creative thinking or deeper Wellspring of thinking in a new

197
00:35:53,319 --> 00:36:00,520
way a different way A Better Way um um if um there have been times

198
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:05,960
when I felt kind of overwhelmed by things in my life what was going on too

199
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:11,720
much happening and my mind is kind of spinning and actively you know running

200
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,800
and jumping around from one thing to the other and so I've learned when that

201
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,839
happens I'll go sit down meditate for a while but sometimes it doesn't take that

202
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:27,200
long for things to settle and relax enough that it changes the quality

203
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:35,560
character istics of my thinking and now my thinking is not jumping so much it's more relaxed and settle and able to

204
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:41,560
address uh in a kind of clear way one thing at a time whatever the issue is

205
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:47,119
rather than jumping around and hopping as we let

206
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:52,200
go uh the uh letting go is not just a

207
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:58,359
you know a surface thing we do it begins opening up and releasing the

208
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:06,280
the Wellspring of intelligence that's in the the whole of who we are whenever

209
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:14,359
there's attachment whenever there's clinging whenever we there's repression going on it's um we're limiting

210
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:21,240
ourselves we're restricting ourselves and the movement in this practice towards freedom is to uh have

211
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:28,040
an unrestricted feeling uh within doesn't mean we're unrestricted do whatever we feel like we

212
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:33,359
want to do but there's no sense of anything here being restricted at the

213
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:39,720
movements within us and so then there can be a very different way of

214
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:49,160
thinking and deep meditation sometimes has a certain kind of rudimentary simple very light very calm

215
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:55,560
almost silent way of thinking that um is about the present moment

216
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:00,839
experience this is the this deeper source of where wisdom can

217
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:07,480
arise and um and so one of when you have non-

218
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:13,200
clinging not easy to do but certainly possible for every single one of

219
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:19,079
you uh as you begin sensing that you're letting go or relaxing even

220
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:24,640
temporarily one of the things to appreciate is the different way that you

221
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,000
think maybe you know I I talk about it being more deeper or more profound way

222
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,400
of thinking some of you might have a different vocabulary for it it might be

223
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:45,359
that it feels the thinking is more holistic or simply that the thinking is more calm it's more settled settled

224
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:51,680
thinking but one way or the other uh it doesn't have to be any of these words it

225
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:57,480
can be your own your own discovery of for yourself of what the difference is

226
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:03,839
is between uh clinging U thinking that's driven by

227
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:09,200
clinging thinking that's compulsive thinking jumping

228
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:15,000
thinking agitated thinking scared thinking versus thinking when we're

229
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:22,480
settled at ease feeling safe feeling contented feeling here we're really here

230
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:30,119
in the moment in its fullness and then can you see how for you there are two different ways of

231
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:35,800
thinking and uh and maybe you'll have your own way of describing that

232
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:41,640
distinction I I'm particularly fond of these days about the idea of profound

233
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:46,960
contemplation a deep way of thinking from deep within from the belly almost

234
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,880
that um settled and connected a feeling of being really in the body holistic and

235
00:39:52,880 --> 00:40:00,160
here and that what wells up uh from within and then thinking can be there's

236
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:07,119
a different kind of intelligence there's a different form of creativity different form of of

237
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:13,079
um of um wisdom that can

238
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:20,119
come and um one manifestation of that when I first was living at a Buddhist

239
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:25,640
Monastery was um the creativity that started flowing through me that didn't

240
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:31,520
hadn't existed in my life before and I started writing poetry I started

241
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:37,599
doing art in a way and as a way of kind of giving voice in a sense to this

242
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:43,319
deeper Wellspring of um of uh emot emotions

243
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:50,000
even creativity that uh I had and certainly the art certainly the Poetry required

244
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,160
some kind of thinking but it was a very different kind of thinking sometimes there was a kind of spontaneity to it

245
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:05,280
and a con connectivity to it a a um freedom to it

246
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:11,680
where sometimes it feels like it's not me thinking uh I can't take ownership of

247
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:21,079
those thoughts I can't because they seem to be just coming from some place deep inside that um knows better knows

248
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:26,280
best and um not that I we should automatically believe everything that

249
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:31,319
comes from this deeper place place there's always a place for check and balances

250
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:37,960
to take a second look at whatever we're thinking and uh question everything but

251
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:44,160
it can feel be so satisfying to have have to think in some deeper deeper

252
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:50,160
Source within where kind of thinking flows in a very satisfying way um this

253
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:57,359
maybe even a sense of flow and and um with uh what emerges from us some people

254
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:03,280
find that that happens with uh when they think from that way um as they write

255
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:11,359
that they're writing it out and there can be a sense of flow and spontaneity and even Surprise by what might

256
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:16,520
come so um

257
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:22,680
so I'd like to repeat what I said that um the way I describe this doesn't have

258
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:28,839
to be how it actually is for you the important principle is that you might uh

259
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:35,200
as you begin to relax subtle get calmer less driven by attachments that you

260
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:42,319
might notice that your nature of your thinking changes and it's valuable to see that

261
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:48,520
change and it may be appreciated if it feels right then feels good um and um

262
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:56,119
because the appreciation of the consequences of non- clinging strengthens

263
00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:01,839
our the value strengthens our connection to non- clinging if it's just a matter

264
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:09,720
of non- clinging and like that's all it feels like I'm doing then why would we do it but we start feeling the benefits

265
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:15,880
from it and feel the feel a choice word here that to really

266
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:22,119
feel it to sense it to experience it then uh non- clinging is not the duty

267
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:28,160
then and it's not just simply to let go of something that's some suffering we

268
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:36,040
have we let go also to receive the benefits of this uh uh of a life of

269
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:42,520
Freedom a life of mindfulness and we coming home to these

270
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:50,280
benefits so um so thank you very much and I hope

271
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:57,480
that this week has uh given you a filled out and expanded the domain the realm of

272
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:03,559
mindfulness so this has been a long series now since the beginning of the year on the introduction to mindfulness

273
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:10,760
and in some ways this is the kind of a culmination of the basic mindfulness instruction that also includes being

274
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:16,000
mindful of the consequences of the practice The Good the benefits that come

275
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:22,160
from it so thank you all very much and uh I

276
