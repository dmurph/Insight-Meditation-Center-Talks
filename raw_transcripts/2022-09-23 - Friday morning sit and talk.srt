1
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:20,459
so to start introduce or start this meditation

2
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:26,580
there's a kind of a teaching story of a school

3
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:33,000
where on the wall in the classroom there's a sign that says in this school

4
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,000
we place the teachings on your heart

5
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,640
and so someone asked why do you put the teachings on

6
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:51,300
our hearts and the teacher said only uh

7
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:58,380
we only put it on your hearts only life can put it in your hearts

8
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:06,320
we put it on your hearts and when your heart breaks open then they fall in

9
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:14,160
so this idea that um to be receptive

10
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,100
or to have our hearts open not necessarily only break open but to open

11
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,140
to be receptive enough open enough transparent

12
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:31,560
enough wide enough so that we

13
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:39,240
something can touch it deeply something can fall into it and one of those things that uh

14
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:47,040
is awakened in that process as the life touches our deepest heart

15
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,980
is a sense of care a sense of

16
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:59,519
kindness Goodwill a sense of wanting to nurture and

17
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,920
nourish because what's deep inside of us

18
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:11,700
is both nourishing and nourishable and this wonderful reciprocity the very

19
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:17,880
same place that can nourish the world nourish ourselves

20
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:24,120
is also the place that can be nourished it's almost it can nourish itself this

21
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,180
wonderful reciprocity and one of those qualities that come

22
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:38,399
from this place is compassion a a and as I've been saying there's many

23
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,700
different forms of compassion different ways that different people experience it

24
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:51,300
so you have to when someone teaches about compassion you have to translate it into your own what into your own words

25
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,760
your own sense your own experience

26
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:02,519
but a place of tenderness tender that place that nourishes

27
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:07,220
and is nourished nourished

28
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:15,000
the place that wants to nourish care for a young child or a kitten or

29
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,060
even a plant when I was a gardener in the monastery

30
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:28,200
I had very strong parental feelings for the plants in the garden and how to walk

31
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:35,940
around the garden when the morning work period began and just kind of gaze

32
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:42,839
up on all the plants for quite a while just go around and look at them check them out as if they were kind of like my

33
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:50,040
children to see if they were all okay and how were they and I had a kind of tender feeling inside

34
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:56,120
this place of nourishing and being nourished

35
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:04,380
and so to um and to feel this nourishing and being

36
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:12,000
nourished surprisingly enough in the presence of suffering

37
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,800
the presence of knowing and the challenges that we have and other people have

38
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:27,360
knowing perhaps it accompanying people

39
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,700
being a companion and suffering and their challenge is sometimes one of

40
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:39,800
the greatest supports we can give someone as they want to find their own way through it

41
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,980
and a wonderful feeling of being available to help

42
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:54,240
wanting to help if the help is wanted in this feeling of being open and

43
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,180
available without a need to help

44
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:04,980
without forcing ourselves on of other people to help them

45
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:11,300
be available if the invitation is there if it's clearly wanted

46
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:18,899
so all this points to a place inside a sensibility a Feeling

47
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:26,120
and intention in idea and Imagination

48
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:32,300
thoughts of Good Will and compassion

49
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:40,819
so taking a posture assuming a posture

50
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:49,680
and as you assume a meditation posture do it kindly and compassionately

51
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:57,079
this body of ours is where there's a lot of challenges

52
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,820
and to dip into our bodily experience

53
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:09,120
with care and assume a posture for meditation that

54
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,380
is right for you

55
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,779
and gently closing your eyes

56
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:38,660
and perhaps if it's available to you

57
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:45,680
to connect to your way of

58
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:54,380
being tender or nourishing or caring

59
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:01,940
whether it's a feeling or thoughts an image

60
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:09,900
and with that sense of care tenderness to

61
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:16,860
gently take a few long slow deep breaths

62
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:24,260
as if these breaths are the most important valuable caring things you can do

63
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:36,080
and exhaling a long caring relaxing breath there

64
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:44,220
as if the exhale is emptying you of your difficulties

65
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:51,059
can as if the exhale is connecting you more fully solidly

66
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:54,380
to your body here

67
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:16,580
and if it's comfortable for you taking a deep breath in

68
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,340
exhaling a slow and long breath and then lingering at the end of the out

69
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:29,240
breath maybe releasing more fully

70
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:36,679
for a moment in the end of the out breath allow yourself just to be

71
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,539
maybe you can even feel the physiological

72
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:51,900
drive to care for yourself that is

73
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,520
to begin breathing in again

74
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,580
the process of breathing

75
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:12,120
is sustaining your life it's a way in which your body cares for

76
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,360
you

77
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,100
and then to

78
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,400
let your breathing return to normal

79
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:43,620
and on the exhale relax in different parts of your body

80
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:49,460
release the holding

81
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:56,539
but as you relax through whatever degree you can

82
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:03,419
maybe do it with a generosity of caring

83
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:08,600
not foreseeing not even expecting things to relax

84
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:16,740
but offering your body a chance to soften and relax

85
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:23,120
especially if you can do so with a caring attitude

86
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:09,200
and then simply being with your breathing

87
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:23,160
perhaps with a feeling of relaxing or softening all around the inhale

88
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:30,559
all around the sensations of your body they come into play as you inhale

89
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:38,480
as if receiving those Sensations around it is a field

90
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,299
of softness of caringness

91
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:58,020
and if as you exhale the sensations are returning

92
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:04,799
to a place that invites that's inviting the exhale

93
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:11,820
a place of tenderness place that is both nourished and

94
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,419
nourishing

95
00:22:51,179 --> 00:23:00,059
and to continue breathing and maybe you're breathing with

96
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:06,000
compassion with

97
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
care

98
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:18,240
The Compassion which includes the feeling of generosity

99
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:25,080
not expectation not anything required

100
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:35,059
this place of tenderness

101
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:41,179
in place of thoughts of well-wishing

102
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:07,940
as if the experience of the body breathing are like waves of compassion

103
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:24,720
the inhale it's like waves walking washing up across the sand

104
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,900
the exhale the waves returning to the ocean

105
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:35,780
waves of compassion washing over you

106
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:07,519
relaxing the thinking mind quieting your thinking

107
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:17,900
compassion a place of inner nourishment

108
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:21,559
inner nourishing

109
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:42,960
you might very gently as you exhale

110
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,059
say to yourself the word compassion

111
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:56,900
or care or tenderness

112
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:04,340
both to let their thinking mind become quieter

113
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:13,520
into be reminded of this place within

114
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:19,279
to touch in again to this place within of compassion

115
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:05,700
perhaps allowing a sense of generosity to come with the compassion

116
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:11,340
the generosity that allows you to do this just the way it is for you

117
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:17,880
how it works for you or that it should or needing to make it look like something

118
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:24,360
just whatever way is easy for you to touch into

119
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:29,419
your capacity for Compassion Care

120
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:51,840
saying the word compassion and saying it like you're dropping a

121
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,539
pebble into a lake middle of the lake

122
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:04,380
in the ripples concentric ripples radiate outward

123
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:12,440
across the lake so let your compassion be the pebble and

124
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:19,919
dropping into your heart and concentric circles of warmth of care

125
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:26,240
radiate out from you out into the world

126
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:33,740
maybe with each breath each exhale

127
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:41,898
dropping the pebble compassion each inhale

128
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:47,059
the radian spreads outward into the world

129
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:45,659
and as your compassion radiates beyond the edges of your body

130
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:53,120
Beyond those edges of your body your compassion is no longer about you

131
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:58,799
compassion becomes free from self and self-concern

132
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:07,340
and appreciate that freedom of compassion that simply radiates

133
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:13,500
in a way that's no longer about you it's free of self

134
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,760
just the radiance

135
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:06,660
and then to feel perhaps how

136
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:14,280
the radiance of compassion that sense of warmth or goodness

137
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:19,859
caringness that somehow spreads beyond the edges of

138
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:22,279
the body

139
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,838
is nourishing for you

140
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:36,980
because it comes from a place that's both nourishing and nourished

141
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:44,760
and how beyond the edges of your body it's not about you yourself

142
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:53,420
free of self and how preoccupation with self

143
00:38:53,420 --> 00:39:00,260
diminishes this nourishing place of tenderness of care

144
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:09,500
compassion as it radiates Beyond out into the world

145
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:16,079
can be a form of freedom from self freedom from

146
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,300
self rumination self preoccupation

147
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:28,740
freedom from self-criticism and self-belittlement

148
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,319
the simple generosity of compassion

149
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:45,420
the compassion for others is a freedom from what diminishes us

150
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:52,440
with self-preoccupation and to see if you can now turn your

151
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:59,579
attention out into the world of people who

152
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:08,599
struggle who suffer maybe the people struggling with covet 19.

153
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,060
the people who are sick some are dying

154
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:21,260
the medical staff and other caregivers

155
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:31,380
for those who have coveted and to allow your radiance

156
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:37,140
of Good Will of tenderness of care of compassion

157
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:45,680
spread out to all the people touched with covet 19.

158
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:50,599
and let your compassion touch them as well

159
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:01,680
as if all you need to do is to

160
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:08,400
know them and know their suffering and challenges

161
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,640
be a companion in a Ally

162
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:21,980
wishing them well

163
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:34,940
may all beings all people who have covid-19 and

164
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:40,260
all people who are caring for those with covet 19.

165
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:45,140
may they be free of suffering

166
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:53,780
may they be free of fear

167
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:08,780
may they be free of any hostility whatsoever

168
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:20,300
may they receive the care the best care available

169
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:30,240
and more so may they receive the best love and care compassion

170
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:35,000
that we're able to offer each other as human beings

171
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:49,820
may all beings be free of suffering

172
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:58,040
may all beings be free of Oppression

173
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:08,460
may all beings be free of hatred

174
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:12,380
from others and from themselves

175
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:22,880
may all beings be at peace at ease

176
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:29,040
may they be nourished by the goodness that exists in this

177
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,280
world

178
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:57,380
[Music] foreign

179
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,140
so this is the last talk on compassion

180
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,880
and

181
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:32,880
the Buddhist concept of karuna the word that often translated as

182
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,280
compassion in the early Buddhist tradition

183
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:46,680
the reference point for this karuna is meditation practice meditation

184
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:54,359
where we become free of the hindrances where we become free of clinging and

185
00:44:54,359 --> 00:45:00,740
hatred where we become free of preoccupation

186
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:08,160
and with that the free free of obligation free of idealism

187
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:13,380
free of all these things that keep us kind of locked in or limited or

188
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:19,140
or close down or agitated

189
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:25,680
and so what is it that gets born out of that that has to do with caring for the

190
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:31,619
suffering of oneself and the suffering of the world with that reference point what is the

191
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:38,640
flavor and the character of compassion that has a quality of Freedom within it

192
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:45,780
and certainly if we can have the X many of us can have the experience of being touched in a compassionate way in

193
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:51,599
a caring way for others and to feel in the very movement of

194
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:57,660
compassion a kind of something opens up something different than self-concern or

195
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:05,040
the usual reference points for me and you and yourself and other operate

196
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:12,240
and uh I don't know if this story touches this for you but it does for me

197
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,940
the story of I don't know if it's a true story but maybe that doesn't matter

198
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:25,920
it was in Washington DC on a very uh beautiful spring day with

199
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,960
some of the great trees flowering big white beautiful white flowers and

200
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,060
beautiful blue sky and crisp and clear air and

201
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:42,000
any kind of everyone kind of delighted by the freshness of it all

202
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:50,040
and a person uh who goes to work every day walked by walks by a man who sits on the

203
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:55,920
sidewalk with a begging with a cup a blind man

204
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:01,680
hoping for some change Spirit change and on that day the person that was

205
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:07,079
walking by noticed that there was no money in the person's cup

206
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:12,599
and so the passerby asks can I make a sign for you

207
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:17,700
and the blind man said yes so he wrote a sign and put it propped it

208
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:23,040
up against the cup and went on to work and coming back at

209
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:28,740
the end of the day the man was still sitting there and now there was money in the cup and

210
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:33,960
and he stopped and said How's it you know how's it going and the blind man said oh it's going great I've never

211
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:40,440
received so much before what did you write on the sign

212
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:45,960
and um Pastor by said I wrote

213
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:52,460
today is a beautiful day and I'm blind

214
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:59,640
and for some people our sense of common Humanity our sense

215
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:04,920
of empathy and understanding of what that means that here

216
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:11,460
many people who have sight are really enjoying something special and unique and vibrant and alive and something

217
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:17,220
which is a uplifting a beautiful day and the person who's blind maybe can

218
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:22,859
smell the freshness of the day but can't see the Blue Sky the flowers the

219
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:29,040
I can see it touches something in US and that and wanting to extend ourselves

220
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:34,859
for such a person to support such a person to write a sign to offer some support money maybe

221
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:41,280
something something in about that movement is not no longer about self

222
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:47,520
especially if we're coming out of meditation and we're not so busy and

223
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:56,220
self-preoccupied and caught up in ideas and thoughts what should be and shouldn't be there's something that that opens in US

224
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:01,920
oh of course you know I feel for this person or I

225
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:07,319
have compassion or I'm with this person I'm

226
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:13,200
and that movement I would like to propose and to care for this kind of situation

227
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:19,380
someone else like this for it to be karuna this coming out of

228
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:27,359
kind of like out of meditation or the similar places that way is nourishing for the person

229
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:32,460
that's offered to and it's nourishing for the person who gives it

230
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:38,520
that nourishing and being nourished are the same thing and to have that as the reference point

231
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:44,520
for compassion and so we're looking for that or we're being careful if it's not

232
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:49,980
that if we don't feel nourished then we're probably operating under

233
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:56,280
obligation Duty big should a kind of maybe even a harshness inside you Gil

234
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:04,619
you're supposed to be compassionate better do it now and otherwise you'll be you know somehow a bad person

235
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:11,099
but to but to feel to really recognize and know in oneself deeply what it's

236
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:17,160
like to be nourished and nourishing and that can be for oneself

237
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:22,319
but also in our relationship to the world around us to be generous and that

238
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:29,700
be a kind of a nourishment for ourselves to be have Good Will and have that be nourishing for ourselves and to have

239
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:36,240
compassion and not be nourishing for ourselves so this karuna then has a very close

240
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:43,500
relationship to Liberation or freedom in Buddhism the more free we become in

241
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:48,660
meditation or in other ways the the more we have a reference point

242
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:54,119
for understanding the Simplicity and the clarity the beauty of compassion

243
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:59,760
that helps us become happy a certain kind of happiness

244
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:05,520
when happiness is not really the appropriate or what because the

245
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:11,640
tragedies of the world are so big there is a response to that tragedy maybe we

246
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:19,680
don't feel happy but we there's a nourishment in it there's a Radiance of goodness that's there when we don't

247
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:28,260
get caught up in the thoughts of horror or dismay or or anger agitation or or it

248
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:36,660
lands on this place of self like oh I have to do something and I'm confused and what should I do it's simply this place that always

249
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:44,760
today is a beautiful day and I'm blind oh that's something in US opens oh oh

250
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:50,119
let me offer something here let me share something with this person

251
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:56,540
so um so compassion practices I think Diana

252
00:51:56,540 --> 00:52:02,400
guided you taught you yesterday can be a formal meditation practice as well

253
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,500
so we don't leave the cultivation or that our compassion to chance we can

254
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:14,400
actually cultivate and develop and let it grow and it's been one of the great gifts of my life is to watch and develop

255
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:21,480
my sense of compassion I had no idea when I started meditation that it was such a fantastic thing to have

256
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:28,380
compassion be awakened in in me so possible to do that intentionally and

257
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:34,740
develop it it's also then one of the great important parts of that is the way in

258
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:40,260
which compassion both is becomes a form of freedom

259
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:46,380
and it also it teaches us more about freedom freedom from self freedom from clinging

260
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:54,119
freedom from hatred freedom from essential desires and comfort freedom from our opinions and

261
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:59,700
stories freedom from self preoccupation self-attachment

262
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:04,859
and so this deeper we go with this meditation and compassion and being

263
00:53:04,859 --> 00:53:10,079
nourished by it we're experiencing a nourishing alternative

264
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:16,800
to the pursuit of central pleasure a nourishing alternative to being caught in stories of whatever

265
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:23,040
stories we have opinions we have an alternative to self-preoccupation

266
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:28,800
and it isn't that we let go of self-preoccupation and have nothing we have this place of tenderness and

267
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:34,260
nourishment Within so the deeper our compassion stronger it

268
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:40,460
becomes uh it and the more concentrated we become

269
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:46,319
it then itself sets the stage for the deepest Liberation that Buddhism offers

270
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:53,460
or points to and that is when the mind is really peaceful at ease settled on itself

271
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:58,500
then the experience that there can be insight into the nature of things

272
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:03,900
including the insight into the nature of compassion the insight into the even compassion is

273
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:09,599
impermanent and inconstant and changing even compassion is something that arises

274
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:17,099
out of the constructing forces of the mind and the Heart and there's something that is beyond the

275
00:54:17,099 --> 00:54:22,619
constructing forces of the heart and the mind something which Beyond um

276
00:54:22,619 --> 00:54:29,460
uh outside of you know kind of what's in constant and

277
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:34,680
impermanent and that which is beyond and outside of it is not a thing

278
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:41,400
but it's the absence of all clinging the absence of all self-preoccupation are

279
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:47,760
such a radical radical radical absence that it really gets her attention

280
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:55,680
and really wow it's possible it really is possible after all to experience to have to live

281
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:01,859
this life without any clinging attachment whatsoever

282
00:55:01,859 --> 00:55:10,619
it's a phenomenal thing to know that and that freedom from clinging itself

283
00:55:10,619 --> 00:55:17,640
clears the clears the dust in a sense from our hearts from the windows of our

284
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:23,460
hearts that now it's so much easier to have

285
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:28,559
compassion it's so much easier to have love because there's no there's no smudges

286
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:35,940
there's no there's no dust there's no nothing in the way of that tenderness

287
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:41,220
that warmth being touched by the world and the heart touching the world

288
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:46,980
and so we find that there's a whole new level of what compassion can be after

289
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:52,559
some really deep Letting Go it happens so compassion can be part of the path to

290
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:58,079
letting go because it really is supportive and helps us relax and and

291
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:04,260
can be very compelling to really kind of settle into a strong sense of compassion

292
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:10,200
and then it can also then be the the stepping stone for a deep releasing that

293
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:18,420
goes on and for the Buddha then once a person has experienced deep release

294
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:25,079
and then the heart is open and compassion is awoken in a greater way

295
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:33,180
then the Buddha's instructions is go forth for the go forth out into the world for the welfare of humans and gods

296
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:39,540
for the welfare and happiness of all beings in other words live

297
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:47,460
caring for this world live for the welfare of the world and not because we should

298
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:55,260
I feel it's because that's what the heart wants to do and that acting on the compassion is

299
00:56:55,260 --> 00:57:01,020
extremely important thing to do not act on our compassion impulses is a

300
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:07,079
kind of restriction is it kind of closing down is it kind of diminishing or even sometimes even a kind of a

301
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:14,160
wounding of ourselves that if we have an Impulse for compassion act on it

302
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:19,380
it's a it's a feedback loop there too that the more we act on compassion and

303
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:25,559
this is pure compassion as we can the more the compassion then feeds back to us and supports us

304
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:30,900
and um just the idea of compassion and the thought that I am compassionate

305
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:39,059
just that only the meditation and compassion it really short changes us it's in the enactment of compassion that

306
00:57:39,059 --> 00:57:44,059
compassion really comes to fulfillment to completion

307
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:50,160
so um and if you and sometimes the practice of

308
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:55,500
compassion is to practice acting as if you have compassion knowing very well

309
00:57:55,500 --> 00:58:02,040
you're acting as if but sometimes acting as if evokes and

310
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:10,380
awakens up and clears the space for an innate compassion capacity of compassion to grow and develop and and catch up

311
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:14,900
catch up to what we're actually acting out

312
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:21,140
so the Brahma vihara of compassion one of their great

313
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:28,140
gifts and Treasures of this tradition of practice of the Buddhism and may it

314
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:34,440
be that you treasure whatever capacity for compassion karuna

315
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:40,500
that you have hint so that you have touched into treasure it value it make

316
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:45,780
room for it may it take may it have a strong place in your life

317
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:52,200
