1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,599
so good morning good day everyone and

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,920
welcome to the meditation and

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:27,199
this is uh the week we're going to be looking at greed and one of the aspects of greed is the

4
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:33,840
way in which it takes us away from ourselves

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:41,280
now some people are so identified with intense desires and wants and cravings

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:49,280
that they feel that's this is who they are and they don't recognize how there's a kind of alienation or pulling away

7
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,840
from a deeper connection to our hearts our body our inner life a deeper place where

8
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,520
there's a settling at at-homeness a

9
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:09,600
and the buddha calls us doesn't talk about at-homeness but he talks about one's ancestral home

10
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:17,600
that the practice of mindfulness is to stay based on or grounded in

11
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,840
one's ancestral home and so it's not just one's immediate home which can be cozy and

12
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,119
nice for some people but a place where uh you know one has been

13
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:36,000
i don't know you know rooted for centuries and

14
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:43,360
and uh so that metaphor here is that we're here to meditate to really stay

15
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,479
closely connected from the inside out kind of and one of the interesting

16
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:55,600
things to notice is how when we get involved in thoughts especially if we get lost in thoughts

17
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,360
there is a pulling away getting lost from this groundedness and connectedness to something that's

18
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:08,560
more solid more connected more at home here and of course sometimes

19
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,040
uh there's good reason to go spinning out in thoughts and sometimes it's uncomfortable to be here

20
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,400
in our ancestral home there's conflict going on here and

21
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,000
difficulties and feelings but it turns out that uh for mindfulness

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,640
practice that there is a healing quality that comes from settling in and being present in the

23
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:40,400
body here so in this meditation you might want to just notice the difference between

24
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,879
when you kind of get pulled into the world of thoughts and if thoughts are about the external

25
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:53,599
world and past future and people how we're kind of leaving the present moment in a certain way

26
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:59,360
and that as we begin again with breathing with mindfulness see if

27
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:07,440
that can be a quality of coming home coming centered grounding here where there's a

28
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,560
a connectedness where we don't lose the some deeper fuller connection to

29
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:20,720
ourselves and then we notice that we lose that we get involved in thoughts or if we get involved in strong wants

30
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,480
or strong aversions there is a way in which that pulls us away from this deeper

31
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,159
place of groundedness and if get involved in strong ideas of self

32
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,200
and what's in it for me oh yeah there's a loss of something there

33
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,640
and and see experiment with and explore get to know this movement of a way

34
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,760
and coming back being disconnected and being connected

35
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,640
wandering off into distant lands and being at home

36
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:05,439
in your ancestral homeland here so assuming a meditation posture

37
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,959
and there is a way in which a long tradition of assuming a posture

38
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:22,320
that's dignified that is we're kind of expressing

39
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,400
our worthiness our value

40
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:33,199
we are not diminishing ourselves cowering or

41
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:40,080
or somehow discounting ourselves

42
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:48,479
and we're not puffed up by not asserting ourselves but a simple dignity simple

43
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:55,440
nobility so a posture that expresses that

44
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,800
and people who are sitting upright it might mean sitting a little bit straighter

45
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,639
maybe there's a way of pulling in the spine a little bit between the shoulder blades

46
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,280
so the chest is a little bit more open

47
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,160
feeling the weight on the sitting bones so your weight of your body seems

48
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:29,440
balanced on top of it not leaning forward too much or backwards

49
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,840
gently closing your eyes

50
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,320
and with a feeling that you have all the time in the world

51
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,520
in a loving way

52
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,680
take some slow deep breaths

53
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:07,840
maybe three quarters full the inhale

54
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,000
and as you inhale more fully to feel all the sensations that get

55
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,199
activated with the deeper breaths in the rib cage and the chest

56
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,720
and the shoulders belly

57
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,879
and as you exhale long relaxed exhale

58
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,758
just long enough to remain comfortable with it

59
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:49,840
relax settle in on the exhale

60
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:03,120
and letting your breaths return to normal

61
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,840
and with a kind of intimacy with your breathing

62
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:16,800
the physical sensations that come into play as you breathe

63
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:24,000
as you exhale soften in the face

64
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,479
and if the face doesn't soften be content just to feel and sense

65
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,360
the physicality of the muscles of the face

66
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:45,280
the sensations from the inside out

67
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,918
meaning not your thoughts and images of your face

68
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:59,840
but how the skin the muscles of your face feel for themselves

69
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:13,440
and then to

70
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:27,840
soften and relax the shoulders

71
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:41,839
and to soften the belly

72
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,040
and then to tenderly lovingly

73
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:58,959
experience how the feel how the body experiences breathing

74
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:12,560
a certain receptivity to feel how the body experiences the

75
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:23,839
rhythm of breathing

76
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:14,000
and then notice if and when you get pulled into the

77
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:23,760
world of thoughts or pulled into the worlds of world of wanting or not wanting how there might be a

78
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,720
loss of this deeper connection to the body

79
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,160
to the inner life here and now

80
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,160
maybe even a kind of alienation from oneself

81
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:50,240
and that mindfulness is to return to this ancestral home

82
00:10:50,240 --> 00:11:00,000
to this place here in ourselves

83
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,440
grounded connected and noticing the move the rhythm the

84
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,079
contrast between being pulled away

85
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,839
and returning connecting here to the body breathing

86
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:29,120
see what you can notice and learn about yourself in that contrast between being connected

87
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,760
and disconnected with our embodied existence

88
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:43,839
from the inside out

89
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:58,400
if you are involved in thinking can you feel how that pulls you away

90
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:04,160
from a deeper connection to breathing

91
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:17,120
and even if you feel connected to breathing perhaps there's a some thinking

92
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:25,840
that limits the fullness of the connection to breathing

93
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,120
see if the thinking mind can become quieter

94
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:42,240
and the connection to your body breathing

95
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,840
fuller

96
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,320
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

97
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:04,240
to be connected deeply to ourselves

98
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:13,519
to our hearts to our inner sensitivity to being at ease and calm and settled

99
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:21,760
might provide us with a heightened sensitivity

100
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,799
to others perhaps one that is

101
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,760
tender relaxed one that is not governed

102
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:43,679
by desire or craving or clinging or greed

103
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:51,200
or aversion hatred something simple

104
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:57,600
relaxed and to have that simple capacity

105
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,559
for gazing out upon the world

106
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:13,840
to gaze upon the world with kind eyes

107
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,398
and to wish well for this world

108
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:27,200
to have our well-wishing and care and our love

109
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:34,799
not confused or mixed up with distress or fear or desires or wanting

110
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:41,840
aversions resentments his simplicity

111
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:52,480
of looking upon the world kindly well wishing

112
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,559
and how wonderful it would be how meaningful it would be

113
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,480
how preferable it would be if

114
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:09,840
others could be happy safe

115
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:17,679
healthy peaceful and

116
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:24,158
free of all the forces within them that afflict them

117
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:30,799
all the forces around them in our societies that oppress them

118
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,600
it may it be that this practice that we do and how we live our lives

119
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,679
from this practice may it be for the welfare and happiness

120
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:53,120
of others may all beings be happy

121
00:30:53,279 --> 00:31:02,799
may all beings be safe may all beings find peace

122
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:10,399
and may all beings share mutually in a life

123
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:19,840
that's free

124
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,250
[Music]

125
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:47,840
so this is the going to be the second talk on greed and um

126
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:56,399
in this one i'll just try to talk a little bit about what this word greed is it's very important concept in

127
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:04,559
buddhism in buddhist practice least because freedom from greed is one of the

128
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:10,720
definitions of one of the aspects of the spiritual liberation that buddhism

129
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:17,600
points to it's a possibility for us and so to understand what this is so we

130
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:24,000
can work through it and get to the other side is important

131
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,840
but it's a little difficult maybe for me to talk about greed

132
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:35,279
maybe because associations i have with the word and maybe other people have it

133
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:40,320
or that it or say it more specifically that

134
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:47,120
in my history with terevan buddhism i sometimes felt that greed was disrespected

135
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:53,039
that greed was somehow just considered to be all bad and therefore kind of the goal was just

136
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:59,919
to get rid of it or or if it was there it was kind of a it was it was kind of a negative it was

137
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:05,919
something wrong with us it was like we were somehow there's almost like the closest thing maybe to

138
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:12,159
sin or something that was really where so there's an impurity that we have if we have greed in fact

139
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:17,919
the tradition talks about greed as being impure and

140
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:25,120
the way i think we have to be very careful to um to consider that this thing that we

141
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,159
translating as greed uh is multifaceted and it is

142
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:36,799
is kind of integrated or connected to so many different aspects of our lives some of them are very healthy and

143
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:41,840
important and some of them which are because of suffering and that

144
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:48,159
we don't want to throw away the baby with the bathwater we don't want to kind of just kind of have a simple idea

145
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,919
of greed as being bad therefore let's get rid of it it's important to kind of take a deeper

146
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:59,279
look and really get to understand whatever it is we under whatever we associate with the word

147
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:04,399
greed we don't want to judge it negatively

148
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:10,638
or disrespect it or condemn it or condemn ourselves because of it in

149
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,919
mindfulness practice we want to take a deep good look at it and really find out what

150
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:24,560
is it for us and how does this work and what is it connected to and what is it trying to do and and

151
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,599
and is there anything valuable underneath or is part of what we call

152
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:35,760
greed so um um

153
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:42,960
there's two words uh and then that are uh sometimes translated as greed uh

154
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:49,919
that belong in this uh triad of greed hatred and delusion and uh

155
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:57,920
and so with those three those three words others the set sometimes there's the word raga

156
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:06,880
that's used for greed and sometimes the word loba so r-a-g-a or loba-l-o-b-h-a

157
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:14,000
and raga means has more to do with sensual desires

158
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,720
and so the desire for uh sensual pleasures and

159
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:27,280
um and but it's a desire that's not just like you know dime a dozen like oh it'd be nice to have uh

160
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:33,040
you know uh pleasant food it would be nice to have a you know a soft bed to sleep in or it's

161
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:38,280
nice though all kinds of things would be nice to have something but there's a a compulsion a

162
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:45,440
compellingness to it so some people will translate this word raga as lust

163
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,280
some people will translate it as passion and maybe different people have

164
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,920
different associations with these two words that some of them don't work very well

165
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:04,480
for a translation uh be kind of a synonym of greed um and don't really work as something that

166
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,880
uh is generally seen as being negative so you know there's some variability and

167
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:18,560
choice you have about what words you use but this word raga has to do with sensual pleasures and we know that some

168
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,960
people have a tremendous intensity of desire around sensual pleasure there's addictions

169
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:31,520
there's cravings there's a strong compulsion to be involved in that world

170
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:36,880
and and some people lose themselves and make huge cause tremendous amount of suffering in

171
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:43,359
life because of it and and very quickly regret what they've done and um

172
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:49,680
because uh there was pleasure in the moment but uh it was pleasure that hurt other people

173
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:56,480
uh or hurt themselves in some deep way so for uh drinking alcohol and drugs

174
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:02,800
sometimes it can be sometimes a drive for pleasure and um and but it doesn't really provide

175
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,480
happiness it provides a little bit of alienation and um

176
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:15,440
and so this is strong so he for human beings sensual pleasure plays a huge role in

177
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:22,160
their lives and so how to be involved with that in a wise way in a liberating so we're free in

178
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:29,599
relationship to them but not to dismiss sensual pleasures not to feel like we're not allowed to experience them but how

179
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:35,359
do we experience them without the suffering and pain that comes with

180
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:42,720
being compelled to search for sensual pleasure to really kind of hold on or cling

181
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:50,320
and then the other end the other word is loba and loba has more to do with acquiring things getting

182
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:56,640
things obtaining things and um and so there's a whole slew of things which are

183
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,800
not necessarily involve central pleasure but uh you know directly but

184
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:11,119
you know just wanting money wanting material things wanting fame wanting praise

185
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:19,119
and the and so this loba is a strong desire for things

186
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:24,720
and and when these uh intense desires are strong we can get

187
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,160
caught in the realm in the web of them and and this idea of getting

188
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:37,520
caught is one that the buddha usually the buddha kind of emphasized

189
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:43,440
that he talked about the metaphor of catching monkeys that apparently hunters

190
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,800
in his time had a kind of pitch a kind of maybe a pine tar or something

191
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:55,359
sap or something that they used it was very very sticky and they'd put someone on a piece of

192
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:00,400
wood maybe a stick maybe with food attached to the stick so

193
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:06,079
the monkey would come along and maybe grab onto the stick maybe it's on

194
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:13,760
a pole and so it has to kind of get up to the top of the pole to get the food and it would put his hand on the pitch

195
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:21,760
and then it couldn't pull its hand really free so it would take the other hand and and to push itself off the pole

196
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:27,520
but the other hand would get stuck in the pitch so then we take a foot to try to get the two hands free and

197
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:33,040
that foot would get stuck on the pole then take the second foot to the same thing and get stuck again

198
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:40,079
and then that's the metaphor the buddha said the monkey then takes its nose and pushes against the

199
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:46,720
stick to push away but then the nose gets stuck and with all five uh kind of

200
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:53,040
body parts stuck to the pitch the hunter can just walk right up and pick up the monkey and the poor

201
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,079
monkey has now been caught and um and so

202
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:03,119
with uh so this greed this loba or this raga

203
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:10,240
when it's strong we get caught in the web in the pitch of what we want and sometimes you know

204
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:17,040
we're inflamed and desires and and we can't think of anything else but getting what we want

205
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:24,560
but the reason one of the reasons to respect greed is that greed sometimes has deeper roots

206
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:30,000
inside of us that if there's a reason for it sometimes the pursuit of

207
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:37,040
very strong desire comes from deep conditionality deep

208
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:44,160
sometimes hurt or suffering or fear or distress that is trying trying to find some way

209
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:49,839
to be healed or cared for or be distracted from or

210
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:55,359
compensated for and if we simply let go or throw away greed too

211
00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:01,599
quickly and dismiss it we don't understand that it's a symptom of some deeper desire

212
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:07,920
and not all desires are wrong some desires are attempts to move towards health and

213
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,960
to care for ourselves but sometimes they get misdirected and

214
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,839
they get directed in ways that can be harmful or disconnecting or

215
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:26,319
alienating and so if we stop and take a look at greed this intense desire to see what is what

216
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:32,480
more is going on here let's stop and not dismiss it not disrespect it

217
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:39,920
but think of it as something that really needs us to uh needs to be seen to be heard

218
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:47,359
to be connected to and so rather than having greed be a source of disconnection

219
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:53,440
we're disconnected from ourselves but network we're trapped or connected to the pitch

220
00:41:53,440 --> 00:42:00,560
to the spider's web and it can't get away but rather to find a connection to the

221
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:06,079
greed that allows us to have a deepening experience of ourselves

222
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:12,240
so and partly what that involves is turning the attention around 180 degrees

223
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:19,119
from the object of the greed to what it's like to to be greedy

224
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:26,079
to what it feels like here in the body so this movement from alienation that

225
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:34,079
greed can cause when we're so focused on the object can be turned around and

226
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:40,880
to create the opposite of alienation the connection connectedness here

227
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:47,359
so so one of the things to study in greed so we really know for

228
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:53,200
ourselves is the way that greed when we're involved in incontinent

229
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:58,560
it doesn't really feel like it's for our own welfare the way that it leads to alienation the

230
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:04,079
way it maybe causes suffering at least in the teachings of the buddha

231
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:09,440
greed always involves

232
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,480
suffering some kind of distress stress

233
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:21,200
some kind of uh ouch for ourselves in having the green

234
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:28,880
and part of the reason to discover how greed is stressful to have or

235
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:35,440
or the underlying suffering or problems with the experience of greed

236
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:42,800
is so that we can discover a different kind of desire a healthy desire that has no suffering

237
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:50,800
involved in it that has no distress that doesn't diminish us limit us doesn't trap us

238
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:59,839
but it does the opposite it nourishes us frees us opens us there are such desires

239
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:04,880
so um so the fact that we're looking here at

240
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:12,960
greed and we see that greed is problematic doesn't mean that we should just dismiss it we should respect it look at

241
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:20,480
it deeply discover what's really happening under the surface of it and and and

242
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:26,880
search for other forms of desires that can animate our life that are freeing that

243
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:32,400
are healthy to have that are appropriate to have this is the task with mindfulness

244
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:41,119
practice in relationship to greed so then tomorrow i'll talk more about

245
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:48,960
this turning the attention around 180 degrees and really practicing with great looking at it in a deeper way

246
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:56,480
and but for today you might uh for the next 24 hours um you might look and see uh

247
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:02,800
maybe not use the word greed if that doesn't really resonate or if that's you think of that

248
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:08,640
as only as you know intense desires but see if in small ways

249
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:13,920
in the small compulsions the small ways you're compelled by desire

250
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:20,880
study what are you compelled by where do you lose your freedom around desire it could be as simple as

251
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:28,800
going for seconds or going for a cookie or you know all kinds of things that you

252
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:36,000
do where you can't help yourself but to go and and be pushed by a desire

253
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:44,839
and in that losing your freedom so i hope you enjoy the exploration of

254
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:50,960
greed and and i hope that you're a better person

255
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:58,240
because of it thank you
