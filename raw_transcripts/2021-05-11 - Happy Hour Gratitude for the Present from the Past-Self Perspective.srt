2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,799
come together practice cultivate our hearts

3
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:21,199
our minds so [Music]

4
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:28,400
so for the theme for today um so many

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,480
themes it was hard to choose one for today but the one that i'd like to invite us to

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,600
practice with is is something actually that i've been

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,160
sitting within practicing with since our last time together um

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:53,920
i didn't teach on friday uh hillary substituted but on wednesday i shared um

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,120
forgiveness practices and and i wanted to do more forgiveness

10
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,760
which might still be coming up in part of the series and then that that evening um violet

11
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:13,600
shared something a quote that she had read which was a sense of gratitude looking

12
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,600
at uh what things that are available in your life that you

13
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:26,080
would have loved to have in the past and now now you have them they're they're part

14
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:35,680
of your life and the way that violet was breaking which was beautiful uh so giving her credit was um

15
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,920
i think with with the uh forgiveness practice we did a forgiveness for self and can be

16
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,360
challenging and yet what she was sharing was that it um she found it to

17
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,960
that she was much easier on herself there was less much less self-judgment than there would

18
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,640
have been a year ago now after a whole year of doing loving

19
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,000
kindness with happier these practices she realized wow there is so much more

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,160
kindness so much more care so much more ease for for herself and and this quote

21
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,760
something that you uh looking back something that you wish you had

22
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,920
or rather from the perspective of your past self you and looking saying oh i would love

23
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,200
to have the sometimes in the future and you realize oh actually you have it and there's a sense of gratitude for

24
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,640
for what arises so not just for uh cultivating meta but for so many other

25
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,000
ways so this is a great great tool you know great way of

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,760
shifting perspectives shifting perspectives because we tend to zero

27
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,239
in on what isn't going well what we don't have we

28
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,159
look at our lives from a perspective of oh i what i want to have in the

29
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:05,840
future the person i want to be and this is lacking this is not good enough whereas

30
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,959
one perspective here is looking at ourselves from the past perspective oh i would

31
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,120
have loved to have this for example this cultivation of the heart i would have loved to have

32
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:26,159
more this more that more whatever it is and realize oh that's actually here in my life i

33
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:33,519
would have more or a gift of covetous oh i wish i had more time to myself i wish i had more time to myself guess

34
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:40,799
what we've all had a lot more time to ourselves or maybe maybe not so much if you're a

35
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:47,519
caretaker but but so that would be one invitation that i like to work with tonight

36
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:55,439
um other invitations is with gratitude practice when we um think

37
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:03,920
of what actually the things that we take for granted today on the radio and npr i heard this

38
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:11,280
report of the very first experimental operation uh using gene editing

39
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,440
in the body so they're taking genes out it's actually in the body and the first couple of people who have volunteered

40
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,880
have are legally blind they have very very limited vision so they're able to

41
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,080
actually do the operation editing their genes

42
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:35,440
in their eyes in their eyes and this you know for

43
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:42,880
for those who have vision we take our vision for granted and and

44
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,000
yet hearing um the the people who had volunteered

45
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,080
with joy with hope uh who had very very limited vision

46
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:02,160
tunnel vision essentially no peripheral vision as they were describing um just made me today i

47
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,080
realized and i've been sitting in the space of gratitude in so many ways from the perspective of the past and

48
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:16,240
perspective of all the things we take for granted so so so much to to gladden the heart

49
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:23,360
so much to glide in the heart with to find support so i think i have said plenty

50
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:32,000
uh let's let's engage in this practice and see what comes up for us so so like to invite you to settle into

selves maybe when we were a kid

or a sense in yourself maybe more confidence

100

maybe a knowledge

101
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:49,679
something connecting with that young version of

102
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:55,600
yourself in fact as your embody inhabiting

103
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:01,600
inhabiting that desire of the younger version of yourselves

104
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:07,360
as if you were looking forward into the future as a kid

105

they are us for this gift

109
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:01,840
now after you've connected with that wish

110
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,840
from the version from the younger version of yourself that perspective

111
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:16,799
now traveling in time again to this present moment when that has been accomplished

112
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,840
it has been attained

113
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:34,880

114
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,559
with gratitude yes

115
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:50,480
but perhaps you take for granted is already here

116
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:58,880
seeing appreciated from the perspective of your past self

117
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:17,840
take some time relishing

118
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:49,200
and be mindful so that your thought your mind don't go on the

119
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,880
wild goose chase of things that you still want or you've

120
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:01,760
lost intent part of this practice is setting

121
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,799
intention intend

122
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:14,640
to bring back your mind your thoughts to this practice not lamenting not

123
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:23,360
self-judging choose not to do that you have a lot more choice

124
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:30,640
in this practice then you realize so exercise your choice stay

125
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:37,360
stay with the invitation for gratitude for what is here not what

126
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,840
is lacking

127
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:09,840
being fiercely compassionate with your own mind

128
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:23,600
not allowing it to go astray out of love and care for this training

129
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:37,840
for yourself

130
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:54,159

131
00:23:54,159 --> 00:24:05,440
it could be childhood could be any time any other time

132
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:14,480

this ability this cultivation

134
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,720
or perhaps i was free of this challenge only

135
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:47,840
a time that there was this wish

136
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:54,960
which now has been satisfied so going back and connecting to that wish

137
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,000

138
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
challenge

139
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:26,480

00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:58,240
in their lives know the goodness of their hearts

167
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:15,839
may all beings everywhere be free

168
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:29,839
thanks everyone thank you for your practice

169
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,440
so

170
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:46,400
so much can arise with this particular way of practicing not just

171
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:52,240
gratitude and fullness of the heart just noticing all this goodness but we wake

172
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:57,838
up to so many ways in which

173
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:05,359
these gifts accomplishments goodnesses in our lives are here

174
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:11,760
the cultivation that perhaps we wished at some point to

175
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:18,160
appreciate them more and also maybe another aspect could be we get to see oh yes there was this

176
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:24,960
intention setting there was an intention setting in the past and now oh it's come to fruition

177
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:32,000
and it gives us aspiration it aspires us inspires us for further intention

178
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:39,760
setting for goodness for for our future self

179
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:45,680
so a lot came up for me as i was practicing with you so

180
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:52,079
much goodness in my own life and cultivation things i was taking for granted and looking from the

181
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:58,640
telescope of the past like wow here it is for example i remember

182
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:04,560
years ago um before before i had i think i had started practice but

183
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:12,880
but uh after the first few years of my practice there was still a lot of existential angst for me

184
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:20,960
about meaning of life purpose of life and that's one of the reasons why i went into

185
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:30,240
intense practice [Music] and through months and years of silent

186
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:37,200
meditation and practice and and various teachings it just all

187
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,400
all resolved itself all the existential angst and the questioning the fire

188
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,520
got resolved so there's a sense of i appreciate that for this being there's

189
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:53,200
a sense of ease um with with living dying

190
00:41:53,200 --> 00:42:00,079
being not being that is a product that that a younger version of me would have loved to have it's like okay

191
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:05,280
it's it's been it's here so there's a sense of appreciation i hope that for you

192
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:12,319
also in this practice you discover different things so i'd love to open i'd love to open

193
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:18,800
um yeah for for comments nicholas says my heart lit

194
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:25,839
up when you said that we have more choice than we realize that's good and you can't end

195
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:32,480
it there's some symbols but that's so cute thanks nicholas that's lovely so appreciate your reflection

196
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:38,400
yeah and you have more choice than you realize exactly

197
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:45,839
it's the way that we choose to see it's a way of seeing the way we choose to see

198
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:52,560
way of saying so i'd love to invite you like to share in the reflections that came up for you

your interest other reflections other questions

215
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:48,160
maybe what came up for you with this practice through the lens of time did it

216
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:56,000
work for you did it not work for you would love to hear neil please

217
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:03,440
so i mean the biggest discovery was i really wish for the wrong things when

218
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,880
i was younger you know i i mean you know you know i

219
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:14,800
wish you know people would stop bothering me you know i mean that was like one of the things you know particularly my ex-wife

220
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:22,480
right and it never occurred to me that i should just look to not be bothered by her you know right

221
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:28,319
you know i have no say over what you know other people do and just a whole bunch of stuff you know

222
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:33,520
right but you know finding some way to like be at ease with myself

223
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:39,760
you know even if it's only partial you know is you know yeah it never occurred to me it

224
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,960
was possible yeah yeah well thanks for sharing that

225
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:52,560
neil and also what i'm really appreciating in what you're saying is that it didn't occur to you then and

226
00:45:52,560 --> 00:46:00,160
yet there was a wish not to be bothered and here an older version of you there is a

227
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:07,200
discovery you have discovered oh there is a way actually not to be bothered so i i take that as a yay

228
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:12,839
because the younger version didn't want to be but but didn't quite know but the older version has so much more

229
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:18,880
wisdom so yay here it is it's been accomplished

230
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:25,280
isn't that beautiful neil i take it as a yay too yay absolutely thanks so much for

231
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,720
sharing that beautiful i love this lens yeah

232
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:36,960
great stephanie says it was so beautiful to

233
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:44,000
see that even though my dreams have not come to fruition as i imagined as a younger person they are here in my life it was also

234
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,200
nice to have a sense of continuum of my dreams from then to now like my

235
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:54,720
life is not so fragmented as it sometimes feels thank you nikki oh thank you stephanie

236
00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:00,880
really appreciate that reflection so powerful um

237
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:06,079
i think that's something that can come up um

238
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:11,119
when we see yes maybe not everything is here but there's there is this continuum

239
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:17,920
there is this continuity there's the sense of aspiration seeds that were planted just it yeah

240
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:24,400
beautiful beautifully set stephanie thank you and ruth i'm gonna ask you to hold on so

reflections ruth please there you are kindly unmute yourself hi

251
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:35,040
um so the comment i wanted to make was sort of a little bit of um

252
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:42,000
during the meditation a little bit of an aha um so the the intentions that

253
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:48,800
that came to me during the meditation were the really big intentions that i

254
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:55,359
had when i was young intentions about having a family intentions about having

255
00:48:55,359 --> 00:49:02,160
work that i had passion for and i've i have cultivated gratitude but there

256
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:09,440
was a kind of a closing of the loop that i don't think i really had then the loop closing

257
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,559
the loop was oh i i had an intention and then i made it happen

258
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:20,720
and the gratitude you know it's like bringing that full circle um uh

259
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:27,599
so that's just what i i wanted uh to talk about it's bringing the whole

260
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:35,119
uh bringing the experience of setting these really long term like multiple year

261
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:41,280
intentions that you know yeah i i did make that happen so i feel like

262
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:48,640
that felt really really pretty good yeah beautiful thank you for sharing that beautiful

263
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:54,000
lovely aha moment it's a beautiful aha moment of aspiration just

264
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:00,400
this what you shared and somewhat i would say similar to um what stephanie shared the sense of

265
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:07,359
continuity and also it came up for me too oh yeah there's a sense of aspiration that can continue like oh yeah here is

266
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:13,440
this being sitting upright from the intentions of the past oh no i can carry that into the future too so

267
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:21,599
beautiful thank you ruth for the way you you shared your aha moment lovely so dear ones

268
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:29,520
um yeah jerry appreciates your your aha moment also ruthless lovely

269
