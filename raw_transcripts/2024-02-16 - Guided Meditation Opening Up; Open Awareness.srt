15
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,759
posture and this morning we're going to be working with flowing from directed

16
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:51,798
awareness to open awareness and back a little

17
00:01:52,280 --> 00:02:00,000
bit so perhaps first just noticing any response in your heart in your mind to

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,799
the chats the warm greetings the hearts the moving text if you see it the fact that

19
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:15,360
it's there and whatever those responses are just to feel in feel into your heart

20
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,720
feel into your body and

21
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,720
notice

22
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,080
notice and then more generally to

23
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:41,040
scan through your whole body and notice your posture level of

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,959
energy any feelings of pleasant and

25
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,760
unpleasant and noticing any responses to the way things are this morning just as they

26
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,760
are

27
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,560
and then more globally noticing an internal temperature check

28
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:16,799
weather check how is this body heart this mind

29
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:23,640
the general mood today in this moment for

30
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,599
you and with that perhaps taking a couple of longer slower

31
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:37,720
more intentional

32
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:46,439
breaths and allowing your body your heart your mind

33
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:52,120
to settle here in

34
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,680
meditation Shifting the attention inward

35
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,480
noticing if the breathing feels Pleasant or

36
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,560
otherwise and the invitation is to settle in either on the felt sensations

37
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:30,280
of the whole body or

38
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:37,960
to zoom in just a little bit the selective attention on the body

39
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:48,080
breathing allowing the breathing to be

40
00:04:52,320 --> 00:05:01,560
natural giving yourself over dedicating the attention

41
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,560
to these sensations of your

42
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,479
aliveness

43
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:42,919
perhaps noticing encouraging a little bit more relaxation on the out

44
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,160
breath noticing the aliveness of the in

45
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
breath

46
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,880
and a tuning tuning into the details the texture of

47
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:46,199
each arising sensation of breathing or in the

48
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:54,280
body the beginning of the breath the body of the inhale of the

49
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:01,400
breath the fullness of the full inhale

50
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:09,840
and the relaxation on the out

51
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,319
breath letting

52
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:36,400
go dedicating the attention directing the attention for

53
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,919
this little

54
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
while

55
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:40,959
now if the attention feels a bit settled the mindfulness feels a little

56
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:47,720
bit more present the

57
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:53,200
invitation is to open up into a

58
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:59,360
broader awareness for example including any

59
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:06,200
senses of vibrancy or aliveness throughout the

60
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:13,760
body perhaps an overall sense of the outline of the

61
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:20,480
body where it meets air skin meets air or

62
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:30,880
cloth sense of all the little pulsing and tingling

63
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:37,040
perhaps associated with the aliveness of being present

64
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,000
within this

65
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:51,320
body noticing weight lightness warmth

66
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,959
cool and opening still f

67
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,120
further to

68
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:21,320
hearing whatever might be in your visual field be your eyes downcast and soft or

69
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,399
closed the Darkness and Light of the visual

70
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
field

71
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:43,079
perhaps little blips of thought or emotion all of it

72
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:57,480
included bringing the attention to the full scope

73
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:04,959
wash of the moment as it flows by as it flows

74
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:22,560
through if a particular thing becomes

75
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:29,639
obvious hearing for example noticing that

76
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,040
for as long as it's most

77
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:43,360
predominant and then as that Fades allowing the attention to rest on

78
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:51,480
the next obvious thing whatever it is no need to go

79
00:13:52,880 --> 00:14:00,759
looking allowing the moment to come to you

80
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:55,480
allowing sound to be sound sensation to be

81
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:05,960
sensation emotion to be emotion thought to be

82
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:15,799
thought noticing feeling tone Pleasant unpleasant

83
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
neither

84
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:59,600
into the final moments of our meditation together

85
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:12,520
the invitation is to recollect these last moments of

86
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:21,760
practice intentionally bringing to mind any moments of

87
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:30,679

89
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:50,559
moments and then more broadly appreciating

90
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:59,360
yourself your fellow practitioners here for taking the time

91
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:05,720
it's a cultivated practice it's a beautiful thing to

92
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:16,159
do and from that place of appreciation allowing acknowledging anything that may

93
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:24,640
have not been so easy in these moments with kindness

94
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:31,440
compassion appreciation for the effort of showing

95
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:47,679
up and with that openhearted

96
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:57,000
attitude allowing in images or thoughts of the others in

97
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,120
your life the people the other

98
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:09,559
beings anyone who's life touches yours directly or

99
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:17,760
indirectly and if it feels right offering the wish that our practice here

110
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,240
practice

111
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,679
so good morning

112
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:04,559
special welcome to those of you who arrived a bit late into the

113
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:11,559
YouTube sit together delighted to be with you my

114
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:18,799
name is Da Neil if we haven't met yet and um this is the fifth of five days on

115
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:25,279
the Essential Elements some other essential element of mindfulness

116
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:30,399
practice kind of design to complement what Gil Fran's been doing for the last

117
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:35,679
number of weeks introducing mindfulness and today we've reached the

118
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:41,039
last of these talks and um it is on open

119
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:46,159
awareness otherwise known as choiceless

120
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:52,760
awareness though that's a little bit of a misnomer because the mind is always choosing to pay attention to something

121
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:58,120
we're not going out and intentionally directing our attention

122
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:04,440
so I'm going to start this morning as I did yesterday with a little

123
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:10,240
exercise and the exercise is to notice perhaps your

124
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:19,360
hand and notice your hand From the Inside Out

125
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:25,080
allowing awareness to fill your hand soak into it

126
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:29,440
the way water soaks into into a

127
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:44,399
field feeling it as if sponge like soil we're

128
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:55,600
absorbing it and then to expand expand your

129
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:01,000
attention to your arms

130
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,639
shoulders neck core whole

131
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:13,560
body allowing allowing awareness to fill your

132
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,280
body the way water fills a

133
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:23,919
sponge with fullness of

134
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:31,679
embodiment and

135
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:38,118
now allowing the capacity of seeing and

136
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:49,720
hearing emotion mood thought whatever space you're in all of

137
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:55,000
that to be included in present moment

138
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:58,879
awareness

139
00:35:02,359 --> 00:35:08,280
without choosing anything in particular

140
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:14,760
including the screen that you're looking at or the hearing through which you're taking

141
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:21,880
in this talk but not privileging

142
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:29,680
anything General presence in this moment of

143
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:40,520
now so that that's the process of opening to open

144
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:50,440
[Music] awareness I gave the analogy yesterday of directed awareness being like looking

145
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:55,800
for and finding a friend in a crowded place maybe at a distance in a plaza or

146
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:01,359
something and then honing in on that friend as you're walking towards them so

147
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:06,599
that you don't lose them in the crowd before you get to them and of course

148
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:13,319
everything else is there but the attention is primarily on this person as you're navigating

149
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:19,599
through so that's directed attention open attention is being open to the wash

150
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:26,960
of the whole crowd without looking for anyone maybe as if you're seeing a big

151
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:34,280
Stadium full of people and you're just taking in the fullness of the crowd maybe the music

152
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:41,079
the activity the light all of it it's noticing the forest not the

153
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:48,280
individual trees necessarily noticing the whole

154
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:54,319
ecology and it's a receptive kind of awareness that then allows anything to

155
00:36:54,319 --> 00:37:00,520
continue with this tree and Forest metaphor if a bird flies by the

156
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:06,000
attention can take that in but it's not like you're looking for the bird it's a

157
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,520
natural capacity so in open awareness attention

158
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:21,319
is relaxed you let things come to you and this allows the attention to for

159
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:29,560
a little time settle on notice whatever is most predom Min most

160
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:35,640
obvious I'll use one more example here those of you who practice Tai Chi or

161
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:40,960
Chiang may be already aware of this but this

162
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:48,640
[Music] um process of right now many of you are looking at a screen so the invitation is

163
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:55,800
to notice your peripheral vision around the screen or whatever you're looking at

164
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:02,880
and this can be done done by looking at your hands perhaps in andly or

165
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:11,040
gsho and then slowly bringing them apart maybe moving your fingers a little until they're further and further off to your

166
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,839
sides and noticing where the peripheral vision

167
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:24,960
loses the capacity to see the hands but staying in that broad wash of

168
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:32,319
seeing there's no one particular thing in Focus until something

169
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:38,800
moves so as someone mentioned in the chat open

170
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:44,240
awareness can naturally arise with a lot of practice of directed awareness and

171
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,280
for some people it doesn't feel natural at first other people it's how they

172
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:55,119
start it's the easiest way to start the point here isn't necessarily

173
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:00,359
to encourage you to do it instead of directed awareness it's to highlight

174
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:06,400
what meditation often includes anyway or what can develop what teachers teach

175
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,520
about and I'll talk a little bit about the why why it might be useful why it

176
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:19,960
might be interesting to experiment with now and then so open awareness the practice of

177
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:25,480
it the arising of it develops a capacity to stay present in a wide range of

178
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:34,800
situations meditation is the process of cultivating our minds and the cultivation of open

179
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,079
awareness begins to inculcate develop a broader

180
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:46,480
capacity to take in everything around us in all kinds of situations walking

181
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,839
down the street washing dishes talking to a friend whatever it

182
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:59,160
is and that's useful it's also so a way in formal sits

183
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:04,960
of including this full range of the different kinds of objects of attention

184
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:11,480
mindfulness of that Gil has brought in in the last weeks mindfulness of breath

185
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:16,520
of sensation and body of emotions of

186
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:22,560
thoughts includes Vena feeling tone the pleasant unpleasant and neutral all

187
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:29,880
kinds of reactions impulses and attitudes that emerge from that and that act back onto

188
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:37,720
it and what all of this can do the attending to this full spectrum

189
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:45,440
full range of what's arising now is it reveals more about

190
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:51,240
how our our inner ecology our inner Life

191
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:58,480
Works in the moment works in the moment so there

192
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,520
is this sense of using your Dharma

193
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:10,960
intelligence using your natural capacity to notice cause and

194
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,760
effect increasing wisdom noticing in the moment what's

195
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:23,640
easeful and what's helpful in what's not so easeful not so

196
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:29,160
helpful one way of staying aware is to

197
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:35,359
notice if there's tension or if there's stress or if there's

198
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:43,440
ease relaxation so noticing getting

199
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:52,240
interested in what's easeful and what's not what's easeful and what's

200
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:59,680
not and then noticing and allowing every everything to unfold for the

201
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:06,920
purpose of allowing things to come and go and noticing what things are helpful

202
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:14,280
to cultivate and what things are helpful to let go of maybe I can let go of

203
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:22,240
that analysis of thinking about that thing and relax more into my

204
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:31,200
body so how open awareness shows up it's like softening your eyes like

205
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:38,119
the exercise we did a few minutes ago and if you soften your eyes that can actually softening The Gaze can help to

206
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:47,119
soften the focus of the mind too and there's a gentle effort a light

207
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:53,760
persistence in noticing gentle presence gentle presence

208
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,839
noticing now and for most

209
00:42:58,839 --> 00:43:05,800
people it's really not possible to be aware without a specific any kind of

210
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:11,760
guidance or any kind of object but to start with noticing the

211
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:20,319
body and noticing as I talked about before seeing hearing sensing and then

212
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:27,599
allowing this comes easier for some people than others some people it's totally natural and other people find it

213
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:34,359
much more natural to start with directed attention on the breath and the body and stay there for a

214
00:43:34,359 --> 00:43:40,599
while as we did this morning until the attention opens up and then it's easier

215
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:46,359
to feel the flow of different objects of attention coming through and allow them

216
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:52,559
to come without looking for them so if you've only ever done one of

217
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:58,040
these you might play around with maybe listen to this recording again or watch

218
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:06,319
it again and play around with accessing a more open kind of awareness it's like a cross training it

219
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:11,359
can build a capacity for more

220
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:17,920
um ways of cultivating the goodness of awareness of

221
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:23,960
mindfulness so I hope that this was helpful this

222
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:29,800
week these days this 45 minutes in considering the difference between

223
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:37,400
directed awareness and open awareness and the way open awareness can open us to the full

224
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:44,680
range of human experience in the moment thank you so much it's been a
