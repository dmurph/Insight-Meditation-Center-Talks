1
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,799
so i think it's

2
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,880
fairly well known for many people that

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,920
one of the core

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,880
in the buddhist view one of the core

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,960
sources of

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,480
suffering has to do with clinging or

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,920
craving

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,359
and that clinging is described many ways

9
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,800
sometimes it's simply called a

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,360
stickiness that we there's a stickiness

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,079
a glue

12
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,840
that keeps us attached to things

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,800
sometimes it's called a knot you knot

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,879
nodded up in things

15
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,920
uh it's uh sometimes called the fetter

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,960
in the translation for the pali word but

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,039
it literally means a not to be knotted

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,640
up and we say that colloquially in

19
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,840
english i was all knotted up in

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,879
something

21
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,399
and um the uh

22
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,198
the uh expression from a japanese

23
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,320
teacher that i really liked was

24
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,119
the fist in the heart or the fist in the

25
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,080
mind

26
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,640
and that we're trying to open the fist

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,600
of the heart

28
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,240
so it's not all fisted up or closed up

29
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,159
tightened up

30
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,479
and so there's many many languages for

31
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,200
this

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,119
many many ways of talking about this way

33
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,759
we cling or crave

34
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,640
and part of the function of practice is

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,520
to

36
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,159
reveal the ways that we cling the ways

37
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,040
that we are

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,640
knotted up and sometimes it's pretty

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,159
evident right away

40
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,320
sometimes as we go further and further

41
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,680
along in the practice

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,720
we start seeing aspects of being knotted

43
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,880
up being caught by things

44
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,600
in ways that

45
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,079
we didn't know at all maybe he's more

46
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,439
subtle or deeper somehow inside

47
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,719
and in some ways the the the movement

48
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,640
through the path of practice

49
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,159
is a continual movement of encountering

50
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,520
and then uh releasing and countering and

51
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,200
untying

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,959
all the different ways that things are

53
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,800
sticky with things we hold on to things

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,400
or cling to things or resist things

55
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,280
and and so when we run into these things

56
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,720
in ourselves

57
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,680
it's you know some people have this

58
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,520
instinct to feel bad about themselves or

59
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,520
criticize themselves

60
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,640
it's also possible to see it as oh good

61
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,040
this is what it this is the path forward

62
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,480
knowing these things

63
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,080
is part of the path it's how we go

64
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,760
forward

65
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,840
and that's one interpretation i have for

66
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,239
why this practice of anapanasati

67
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,160
is so simple in its explanation

68
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,319
is that um it's not meant to avoid

69
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,480
or not recognize that we're attached or

70
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,519
clinging or

71
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,040
there's all these challenges we kind of

72
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,519
come along the way

73
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,080
but it's not supposed to avoid it but

74
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,519
it's offering us a very

75
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,760
simple way of moving through it

76
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,400
without making a big deal of it because

77
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,560
they're not mentioned

78
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,760
and rather than getting caught up in the

79
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,080
stories

80
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,560
or the idea of me myself and mine in

81
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,920
relationship to it

82
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,560
that he has to be really really simple

83
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,280
of course those things are there

84
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,560
and and uh and then

85
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,959
how simple can we be in a way that's

86
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,239
genuine

87
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,959
uh uh beneficial honest

88
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,200
and healing or freeing as we go through

89
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,239
and so i i see the simplicity of the way

90
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,799
this beginning of anapanasati works

91
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,200
as a way of really addressing all these

92
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,120
clinging all the challenges all the

93
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,200
strong feelings emotions we have all the

94
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,959
ways in which the mind

95
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,840
gets knotted up fisted up caught up in

96
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,879
things and

97
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:08,400
concerned with things and um and um

98
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,439
but without uh without kind of getting

99
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,000
involved

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,519
getting it entangled with it even

101
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,040
further

102
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,359
so to just simply stay breathing

103
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,120
through it all whatever's going on

104
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,520
breathe i think i said this yesterday

105
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,199
that there's something about hanging in

106
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,360
there with the rhythm of breathing

107
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,759
that keeps them i call it sometimes the

108
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,199
great lubricator

109
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,960
it keeps things lubricated so they don't

110
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,800
get rusted up or

111
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,199
or squeaky or or something frozen up

112
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,840
or it's a massage that we're massaging

113
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,880
stuff for

114
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,680
it's um it's a way of kind of by staying

115
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,000
with that gentle rhythm of breathing

116
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,240
it's a little bit easier for the mind

117
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,840
not to get caught by something

118
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,759
because if you're cut caught you've lost

119
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,360
touch with the breathing

120
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,120
but if you're touched with the breathing

121
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,800
then there's something we're taking

122
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,960
being with that's kind of this lubricant

123
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,639
or this massage

124
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,320
the concerns the feelings we have

125
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,560
haven't gone away necessarily

126
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,280
but it's the knotted up the stickiness

127
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,120
the preoccupation with them

128
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,759
that's loosened up and then something

129
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,080
else begins to happen

130
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,440
if we free our concerns our emotions our

131
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,080
challenges

132
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,600
even our suffering if we free it

133
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,919
from our preoccupation from our

134
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,120
resistance the stories the opinions the

135
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,039
predictions about it what it means that

136
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,600
it's there

137
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,840
are pushing it away or validating it or

138
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,240
justifying it or apologizing for it

139
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,800
all these complicated things we do all

140
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,440
those

141
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,720
perpetuate it somehow and if we just

142
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,280
could learn to leave it alone

143
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,520
but without denying it just leave it

144
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,759
alone let it be there

145
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,680
and leave it alone from all this extra

146
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,520
stuff we had

147
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,639
the heart knows how to heal the mind

148
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,280
knows

149
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,400
how to unfold in the same way that if

150
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,560
you cut your finger with a kitchen knife

151
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,319
for example

152
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,199
chopping vegetables it's a complicated

153
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,360
physiological process to heal

154
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,160
that cut but we don't have to worry

155
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,120
about that

156
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,440
the body heals itself if all we have to

157
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,759
do is keep the cut clean

158
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,039
so so much of the angst the suffering

159
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,240
the challenge the grief

160
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,560
that we have to respect it deeply

161
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,759
not to and really respect it

162
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,880
leave it alone without

163
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,479
stickiness without clinging without

164
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,000
being nodded to it

165
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,199
and this mindfulness of breathing the

166
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,080
implicit idea

167
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
in this practice is that actually that

168
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,759
mindfulness of breathing

169
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,319
allows that freedom leaves allows us to

170
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,039
leave things alone

171
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,360
and then as the practice goes along to

172
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,240
feel

173
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,599
the mental formations the the

174
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,000
bodily formations to feel the physical

175
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,840
activity expressions

176
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,440
manifestations of the mind

177
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,280
manifestations over responses or

178
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,360
thoughts or feelings

179
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,599
it's such a powerful thing it's a way

180
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,039
again of

181
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,800
being present for the all the

182
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,880
difficulties and joys of life

183
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,280
but to be present for it physically

184
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,039
without the stickiness without being

185
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,280
four against in the clinging

186
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,880
and it's a way of kind of begin to

187
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,120
loosen up the stickiness just to feel it

188
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,479
in your body

189
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,880
the body is not a story and so much of

190
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,720
the stickiness has to do with the story

191
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,919
making mind

192
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,080
the opinions the ideas predictions

193
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,319
and then on top of that the panasonic

194
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,479
says

195
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,680
relax or tranquilize make tranquil this

196
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,879
body

197
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,080
and for me this idea of relaxing calming

198
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,400
the body

199
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,440
is not really meant to avoid anything

200
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,240
but it's beginning to relax the ways in

201
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,680
which we hold things

202
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,639
the way we hold on or knotted up it's

203
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,720
the knots that we're

204
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,360
letting go of and as the knots get let

205
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,160
go

206
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,599
the entanglements let go then uh

207
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,000
what we're feeling inside the challenges

208
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,360
we have

209
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,879
can begin to move and resolve themselves

210
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,680
and relax

211
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,360
and it can be a very different

212
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,840
perspective

213
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,599
and sometimes we don't solve our

214
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,479
problems but we dissolve them

215
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,120
in this way some of the external

216
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,880
problems we have in life the real things

217
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,320
that we have to take care of

218
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,680
don't go away this way but we can put

219
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,320
ourselves in a much better position

220
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,720
more creative more intelligent more wise

221
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,839
more loving

222
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,080
to address them when we go through this

223
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,360
deep process of

224
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,519
letting go of the stickiness the craving

225
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,600
that we have

226
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,480
so i think it's kind of a radical thing

227
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,399
with this practice

228
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,480
that it actually doesn't talk about

229
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,959
these challenges directly

230
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,600
because we don't have to address them

231
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,880
directly

232
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,320
if we do this steps of anapanasati

233
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,240
they just kind of get taken care of on

234
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,440
the side or

235
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,839
get taken care of because we're making

236
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:18,880
space

237
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,320
to in releasing the stickiness the knots

238
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,839
that we have

239
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,160
and that process continues into the

240
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,600
second

241
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,040
set of four instructions where we become

242
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,920
aware

243
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,320
of the mental formations the mental

244
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,440
activities

245
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,920
the thoughts that we have and then we

246
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,680
calm those down

247
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,440
and calming means let go of the

248
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,839
stickiness like oh the tightness the

249
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,279
constrictions that are there the

250
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,959
pressure that's there

251
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,279
it can't be done all at once and all of

252
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,839
it but the beginning is process

253
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,600
of letting go of the stickiness of

254
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,519
settling the mind

255
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,080
and this also is not to avoid the mental

256
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,120
problems

257
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,600
but to but to let go of the stickiness

258
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,800
the fetters

259
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,640
that are there so

260
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,880
to repeat myself i think it's a radical

261
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,519
thing that this anapanasati does not

262
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,760
talk address directly the challenges we

263
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,680
have in practice

264
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,519
but it's not because they're being

265
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,959
ignored

266
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,920
it's i would like to propose is because

267
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,000
it's offering a very realistic very

268
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,519
effective

269
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,560
process by which they can be resolved or

270
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,839
dissolved or

271
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,079
we can find our way with them without

272
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,480
having to address them directly

273
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,959
uh when you know as in the usual ways

274
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,560
the mind wants to do that our heart

275
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,279
wants to do that

276
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,399
so um so as you practice and

277
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,079
when you find yourself with these

278
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,279
challenges that could happen

279
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,079
no the practice is a response to it this

280
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,360
ways of addressing it and perhaps being

281
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,720
content and willing to do so indirectly

282
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,680
and for some of us it's a radical thing

283
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,320
to not

284
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,560
feel like we have to fix and address

285
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,480
everything directly

286
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,279
but we can just relax settle back and

287
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,800
trust the process

288
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,040
as we go move along on this path

289
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,399
so thank you and i look forward to

290
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,839
being again with you tomorrow
