1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:07,838
good day to you all greetings and uh

2
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:18,480
nice to be here so um

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:27,359
an expression from the ancient language pali that it's translated as here and now

4
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:36,079
sometimes here and now literally the literal words are um

5
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:46,079
the the seen dharma the dharma that is seen

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,239
and sometimes those two words are reversed rather than ditty dhamma it says

7
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:01,359
which is the the um that uh seeing the dharma

8
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:07,520
so the dharma that seeing or seeing the dharma and this points to the experiential

9
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,880
quality of this practice here and now refers to really seeing the truth seeing

10
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,159
the dharma seeing phenomena experience directly here

11
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,960
whether it's through the eyesight for those who can see through hearing those who can hear

12
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:34,000
through smelling through tasting through the tactile sensations of the body

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,520
it's this direct contact direct seeing correct experiencing that that is where

14
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,560
the dharma unfolds that's where we see the dharma it's not complicated

15
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:56,479
it's not in a sense it's not found in books or in dharma talks it's found in the direct

16
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:02,240
perception direct experience that we have if we can make that direct experience

17
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,280
direct in a sense unmediated by the projections

18
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,200
we put on top of it uh so that we see experience

19
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,760
and it's kind of kind of in its rawness without identifying with it or

20
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:28,800
being for or against it or interpreting in all kinds of ways just a raw basic sense experience

21
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:36,879
there's something powerful about finding ourselves at peace in our direct experience

22
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,160
so that's partly what we're here to do and be passed in our practice is to

23
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:50,319
settle in become centered and grounded here

24
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,080
in our direct experience

25
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:02,879
so to begin by taking a meditative posture a posture

26
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:10,239
that maybe supports your ability to be

27
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,599
aware at all at your scent stores

28
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,800
the heightened awareness

29
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:30,959
and even though we use this language of seeing a lot it's the inner mind's eye

30
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,959
and so we sometimes close the eyes

31
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,000
to simplify our experience

32
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,760
and taking a few long slow deep breaths

33
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,720
where the exhale is particularly useful

34
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,840
for returning here where you are

35
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:10,319
long slow steady exhale where you consciously center yourself

36
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,400
in your body in this place where you are

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,040
and then to let your breathing return to normal

38
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:43,840
and to continue the centering grounding settling into here and now

39
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:57,520
as you exhale might relax the muscles of the face

40
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:04,720
softening around the eyes sometimes there's a strong habit to be

41
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:11,840
always looking even when the eyes are closed searching

42
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:21,520
wanting fearing and to allow the eyes to soften

43
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,280
sometimes softens the wanting

44
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:38,479
the fear

45
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,600
and as you exhale to soften the shoulders

46
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:52,080
let them relax and

47
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,199
shoulders can feel the gentle pull of gravity

48
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:07,840
maybe in feeling the weight of your shoulders

49
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:32,639
and then softening your belly maybe his belly relaxes maybe the whole

50
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:41,840
belly area can settle and down into you so your center of gravity

51
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:49,840
gets it goes lower in your torso

52
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:20,560
that is seen the experience that's experienced

53
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:30,240
the sensations that are sensed

54
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,400
an interpretation not a story

55
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,800
not being involved in a prediction or fear what will happen

56
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,840
not lingering with what has happened thinking about it

57
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:58,560
but seeing if your body and mind

58
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,520
can be ready moment by moment to be fresh

59
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:13,759
almost like renewed as if there is no past just this moment

60
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:23,520
to experience and to know the direct experience here and now

61
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,840
free of past and future

62
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,719
experiencing the experience of the moment

63
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,279
feeling the feelings that are here

64
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:55,839
breathing with the breathing that is happening

65
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,240
sensing the experience of breathing

66
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,839
one breath at a time

67
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,920
you

68
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,920
you

69
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:46,960
staying close to the experiences that are direct immediate the experiences that are

70
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,799
intimate with your five senses

71
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
and with the present moment unfolding

72
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,559
of your life your inner life and mind

73
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:14,159
the river of life that's seen

74
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:25,840
in the present moment

75
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,919
you

76
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,919
you

77
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,760
and then as we come to the end of the

78
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:51,200
sitting to turn your

79
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:01,840
inner eye sight on the world around you

80
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:09,679
people in your home or in your neighborhood your communities

81
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:16,320
friends family strangers the people that you're aware of through

82
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,840
the news or other means

83
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,559
and they become

84
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:33,679
the dharma that is seen the seen dharma and to gaze

85
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:43,279
upon others with soft and kind and easeful eyes

86
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:53,039
to gaze upon others without fear or anxiety without desires or aversion

87
00:32:54,080 --> 00:33:00,880
so that some of the best qualities of your heart

88
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:08,080
have space to come forth and meet those people as you

89
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,840
consider them

90
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,320
may it be that this practice we've done together

91
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:28,159
benefits the lives of people we encounter this week

92
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:36,720
may the practice of mindfulness help us the best qualities friendliness

93
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:43,279
of kindness love compassion respect

94
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,360
flow out of us in our connection with other people

95
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:55,120
may all beings be peaceful

96
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,080
may all beings be safe

97
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:06,559
may all beings be free

98
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:12,800
and thereby may all beings also be filled with happiness

99
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:21,760
may we delight in the shared happiness

100
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:35,838
that we might experience as a result may all beings be free

101
00:34:49,119 --> 00:35:03,838
thank you

102
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:14,720
so before i begin with the dharma talk a few announcements so when we finish

103
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,200
this talk at 10 30 or so

104
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:26,000
those of you who like will switch over to a zoom meeting and it's going

105
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,000
to be a community meeting for imc and everyone of course is welcome but

106
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,839
the topic is the reopening of imc uh being able to come here in person and

107
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:44,000
practice together and of course that has some effect on the people who are far away who are

108
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,640
participating through youtube or zoom but the topic mostly is about beginning to

109
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:56,720
open here in august and maybe take questions hear about concerns

110
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:03,440
people have and some of the plans we have for that and anything else so um

111
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:09,839
the the the zoom link is in a few places it's on the imc

112
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:14,880
account calendar i think you have to cut and paste it from there it's also

113
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,800
on the imc what's new page on the home page of imc

114
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,880
and uh if you can't just click on it you might have to uh you know again cut and paste uh copy and

115
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,079
paste the uh the zoom link and um if you

116
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:39,280
if you need to use a password to get in the password is mehta m-e-t-t-a it's a

117
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:45,760
poly word for loving-kindness and um and also i'm going to put it here in the chat now it's at the top of the chat as

118
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,960
well and it'll be at the chat um

119
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,720
when we finished today i'll put it at the end of the chat as well so just so easy to find and i don't i think you can

120
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:04,160
click on it from the chat and um so um

121
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:11,440
the other announcement is that in a couple of weeks maybe three weeks um the

122
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:16,839
this very innovative and creative dharma teacher named gregory

123
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:23,359
kramer who will be teaching for us on zoom kind of a modified or a

124
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:30,240
kind of a kind of creative way of having a weekend retreat where there's a lot of time for practicing in daily life

125
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:36,480
and and gregory is very focused on relational

126
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:42,000
practice how we practice in our lives in relationship to each other and he has this a wonderful new book on

127
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,079
the whole the whole life path which is um

128
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:53,359
uh taking the eightfold path and applying it to our whole life not just meditation or some

129
00:38:53,359 --> 00:39:00,000
segment of our life and it's a nice very nice book and and so he's gonna present on that in a creative way and

130
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,760
and support you through a weekend of practice and reflection and information about that is

131
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,960
also in the what's new uh on imc's homepage and also on the

132
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:18,079
on the account on the calendar you have to register for it so i think part of the creativity is that

133
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:23,760
uh in the times during the weekend when you're not not actually on zoom which is not all

134
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,040
time he's going to periodically send people text messages

135
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:34,720
with some dharma teaching or practice or something so to kind of keep us practicing and

136
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:43,839
engaged outside of the zoom session itself

137
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,480
so

138
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:59,760
as many of you know the word vipassana is the word that

139
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,760
the pali word the ancient world word for the that's used for our meditation practice

140
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,880
sometimes which we say we do the passana practice

141
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:18,240
and now what i want to highlight is that vipassana the root of the word pasana

142
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:24,640
means to see and the v is an emphatic prefix so it's kind of

143
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:31,359
like to see in some special way or an important way and so some of us like to translate it

144
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:36,400
as clear seeing and then as you know it's often translated

145
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:43,359
almost like the brand uh that you know the our brand of buddhism uh insight

146
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:49,119
um translates insight so insight meditation and it has the word you know sight or

147
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:55,200
seeing in it and this ability to see is uh

148
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:02,800
and here we're not talking about that only the physical seeing some people can't see but uh it's the

149
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:09,760
kind of the ability to perceive through any of the senses or to be able to see through the mind's

150
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:16,560
eye the wisdom eye the dharma eye which is the the place in the mind where

151
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:21,599
we are really present for what's happening and there's a wisdom about it there's a

152
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:26,640
penetrating understanding about what is happening here

153
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:32,880
and in fact uh the experience of it's a real

154
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:38,560
penetration of what's happening in our lives uh in the dharma as we mature

155
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:48,160
is called opening the dharma eye uh and uh so opening the dharma eye

156
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:54,560
the um and so the idea of seeing clearly is also

157
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:59,599
when we open the dharma eye we see the dharma

158
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:04,960
the dharma which is visible here and now is clearly seen

159
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,720
the and then sometimes they even talk about it with a dharma eye open there's knowledge

160
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:18,000
and vision and for those of you know a little bit about hinduism or some of the yoga traditions in the um

161
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:25,839
the word for uh vision is dasana which in sanskrit is darshan darshana and which is a very

162
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:31,440
powerful word and darshan is often used for sitting in the presence of a

163
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,960
of a guru where you the guru is in sight as if seeing the teacher is really

164
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:42,160
powerful and here in this tradition is seeing the truth seeing the real dharma the

165
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:47,760
experience directly is very powerful so knowledge and the

166
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,800
seeing this vision is over and over again emphasizing this tradition

167
00:42:52,800 --> 00:43:00,000
so imagine that you leave town on a hike and leave

168
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,960
city you're living in a maybe metropolitan area but there's a mountain on the edges of it and you go for a nice

169
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:12,400
long hike up in the mountains higher and higher and higher and and if you don't like to hike maybe

170
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,839
there's a a gondola that carries you up to the

171
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:23,359
heights but you're up to the top and uh there's a kind of a

172
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:28,960
get to get near the top and there's a tunnel that goes in and you go through you go through or

173
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:36,400
there's a there's a big kind of say that you get close to the top and there's a big

174
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:46,400
door two doors double doors and uh you open these double doors

175
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:53,280
and you step forward onto this little bit wide ledge on the other side of the mountain and

176
00:43:53,280 --> 00:44:01,280
there on that ledge is this vast panorama of mountain

177
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,480
after mountain after mountain mountain ranges

178
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:12,720
rivers forests birds flying eagles flying around

179
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:18,400
hawks um clouds you know that you're up and tie

180
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:25,040
up in the mouth and so it's a vast sky that is so clear and broad and wide

181
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:30,319
and it can be take your breath away it's so beautiful this natural world and

182
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:35,599
maybe in a healthy wonderful way you feel very small or you feel like

183
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:41,520
you're part of this amazing natural world that we live in

184
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:48,880
and uh but you're on this ledge looking out at it and it's just a sense of awe

185
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:54,480
but this isn't that you want anything you're not like leaning forward try to i

186
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:00,800
want that i want that mountain on that mountain and it isn't that you're identifying yourself with the scenery there the

187
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:07,599
rivers and the forests and the trees and say well that's mine or that's how i want to be or it's just

188
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:15,440
like it's just almost like the sense of self and self concern drop away in a way that back in the city

189
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:20,960
when you knew people and they were concerned all kinds of social concerns are operating and

190
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:29,200
but here in this ledge looking out at this amazing scene um self-concern drops away and in fact

191
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:35,359
it was kind of self-forgetting and we look across the scene and some of this what we see seems

192
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:41,119
dangerous some of the mountaintops indifference there's a storm brewing and there's snow up there and

193
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:48,480
you're glad you're not there because that looks like it could be quite dangerous to be caught in that storm but it's far away or you see these

194
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,599
rushing rivers and of course it's pastoral and wonderful from a distance but you know if you were

195
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:58,839
to come across that river we treacherous to cross it it's roaring

196
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:04,560
down and um and so you can see that some of the paths on the

197
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:10,880
side of the cliff going down to the valley below are treacherous little thin little paths and

198
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:16,160
it'd be dangerous to walk down there but you're not going down there so the danger

199
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:22,160
has no fear for you and it's like wow this the beauty the pastoral nature of it the

200
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:28,000
peacefulness setting the danger that's there standing on a ledge and looking out

201
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,800
and just taking it all in in a peaceful open comfortable way feeling secure on

202
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,839
the ledge not being for or against anything just at ease

203
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:47,040
taking it all in then you turn around to go back and

204
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:53,599
when you turn around you find out that you're actually on another ledge that's facing the city

205
00:46:53,599 --> 00:47:00,079
and you look down the city and some of it is quite inspiring and beautiful and some of it

206
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:05,839
is um these beautiful buildings tall buildings and some of it clearly is treacherous and

207
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:13,040
dangerous and um there's a smog and fires in places in the in the city there

208
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:20,400
are clearly uh poor places that people are in squalor and places of excessive

209
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:26,400
wealth and and um and then you know but there's also the edges of the city

210
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:34,000
and beyond the edges there's this vast uh green plains uh grasslands

211
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:40,720
and beyond that other mountains and oceans and rivers and then the city is just part of this wider

212
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:45,760
big circle and you see it all but you're high on this ledge

213
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:52,240
and again you are there's right now there's no inclination

214
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:59,200
to be judging it to be for or against it it just all seems to be in the context of this

215
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:06,559
vastness of the natural unfolding of this universe and you sitting on the ledge just watching it

216
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:14,800
and again even though you go back down to it defining yourself by it being caught by

217
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:20,000
desires and this and that doesn't exist you just kind of take in this wide

218
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:26,400
field and there's a stillness and a quiet within you as you gaze out

219
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:34,480
upon the scene so maybe this this analogy

220
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:41,760
is pointing to the ability to be gazing out of the ledge of your eyes if you can

221
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:47,599
see uh physically see you know there's kind of like that's your mountain top

222
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:54,400
on your head and and the ledge is your is your you know maybe the bottom rim of

223
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:02,160
your eye socket and you're looking out and how do you look when you look out into the world do you

224
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:07,440
look with an agenda does your looking sir

225
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:13,599
serve as the servant of your fear and anxiety darting around

226
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:18,640
looking how to make yourself safe does your looking is it a servant of

227
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:24,880
your desires looking what you can get to the next thing and next things i think that some of us you know we

228
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:30,720
sometimes get pulled into web surfing and there's the eyes are looking and looking and getting and

229
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:37,280
going to the next thing and they're busy they're not at rest and at ease just looking at the scene

230
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:47,359
or do they is a seeing in the surface of what's wrong the aversion we have or is the seeing

231
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:52,559
you know how does how is that seeing or is it just like settling on that

232
00:49:52,559 --> 00:50:00,000
ledge in the mountain looking out on a scene a natural scene that we don't have to identify with

233
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:09,040
we don't have to judge we don't have to have any agendas with we just gaze peacefully with a calm eyes

234
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:15,520
with the relaxed eyes soft eyes taking it all in without it in a nice

235
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:21,599
way when i first went to practice in thailand

236
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:28,720
i practiced in a small monastery meditation center outside of bangkok and

237
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:34,079
there was an interesting place with a variety of things but there was a man there a monk

238
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:41,040
who it was explained that he was an extremely mature practitioner and a deep deep

239
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:47,839
meditator in fact i was told that he could um he had attained something called

240
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:54,960
niroda samapati that he could sit in a state of suspended

241
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:02,880
animation a certain kind of state of cessation unmoving for seven days

242
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:09,040
he can just drop into this deep deep state and and so i don't know about he could

243
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:15,599
actually do that but that's what i was told but uh so so that i met him and i talked to him

244
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:22,240
and the thing that was so remarkable about him was looking into his eyes

245
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:29,119
and it wasn't like his eyes were deeply receded exactly like physically receded but there was

246
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:34,480
something about looking in his eyes they felt like looking into this amazing

247
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:39,680
depths kind of like being on that ledge in the mountains looking out at this huge natural scene

248
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:45,839
or looking out at the night sky and just so deep and vast there was something about looking at his

249
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:52,800
eyes that i thought wow this man is deep there's depth there or spaciousness there

250
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:59,280
and some of it was that his eyes were not darting around

251
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:05,920
his eyes were kind of at rest and at ease and it wasn't like he was staring at me

252
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:12,640
but he wasn't not looking at me his eyes were not bulging out his eyes

253
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:18,800
were not pulling back he was just there and it kind of there was a feeling inside i had that this man's

254
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:26,559
mind is not really it's not agitated it's at ease and in that ease he's just

255
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:32,319
looking and uh kind of like looking and there's no one i mean

256
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:37,440
one thing then one way it's talked about sometimes in terrible buddhism which some of you might not like this kind of

257
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:46,079
description but is is that all the lights were on he was

258
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:53,920
fully conscious and awake it was like a house where all the lights were on but no one's home so everything was

259
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:59,440
firing everything was clearly there and but there was no place of self no center

260
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:06,720
he was holding on to no contraction around self me myself and mine it was kind of this vast emptiness

261
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:13,839
that they experienced so to see to be able to see

262
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:20,800
and become free is a phenomenal thing because as we begin practicing as we

263
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:26,160
practice and we start seeing understanding feeling

264
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:33,520
that our the way we see is uh all these things are

265
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:42,400
sticky things are kind of stuck themselves onto the seeing and we don't just see clearly

266
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:49,440
we see with desire we see with fear we see with judgment

267
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:54,640
we see with interpretations we see with bias

268
00:53:54,640 --> 00:54:00,319
we see with bias about who we are we see about projections and ideas and

269
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:05,760
identities i'm this way i'm not the way i have to do this i'm supposed to do that

270
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,960
and all these ideas are sticky and they stick onto

271
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:17,359
the eyesight or the perception that we have and uh and sometimes it's really clear

272
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:24,000
that they're agitating and with an agenda the mind is the eyes or the perception the hearing whatever

273
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:32,400
it is is darting around and moving and wanting and but when there's no another sticky

274
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:39,839
stuff then there's just seeing

275
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:47,200
and it's kind of like if the smog clears and the or the fog clears

276
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:55,119
and we see after a long time not seeing it how clear the ear is and we see the

277
00:54:55,119 --> 00:55:01,200
mountains in the distance we don't normally see it isn't so much that we're seeing

278
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:07,280
anything but the absence of smog we see the clarity

279
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:14,000
is clarity a thing it's not exactly a thing but the clarity is there the same thing

280
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:20,559
can happen with the mind the mind can become clear and uh

281
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:28,798
and there's no self-preoccupation self-assertion there's no

282
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:35,599
self-criticism or self-belittling we don't have to know self-apology

283
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:42,720
the self is not in the seeing and the perception

284
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:49,760
and the same thing we turn inward we stand on the ledge of the eyes and we look inside

285
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:55,760
and we see all kinds of things in there as we go along in practice and sometimes it said that

286
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:02,160
self-knowledge is seldom good news because some of what we see is we see our bias and our projections and our

287
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:08,559
fears and our interpretations and our shortcomings and all kinds of things operating in there

288
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:15,920
and they can be that can be a source of agitation that can be fuel for continued

289
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:21,440
identification ideas interpretations of ourselves i'm a bad person i'm wrong because i'm doing

290
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:27,440
this and i'm an embarrassment to the buddhist world because i had an attachment

291
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:33,440
and but to be able to sit on the metaphoric ledge of our

292
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:39,680
eyesight and look back into ourselves just like we would look out into the

293
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:45,520
natural world with this unmoving mind with this peaceful

294
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:52,559
eyesight not darting around not wanting and not wanting not

295
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:58,240
interpreting just looking and of course some of the things that you might see is

296
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:03,760
maybe not not your best qualities but maybe you don't have to identify with it

297
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:09,200
or do anything with it and in fact if you do nothing just see it maybe

298
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:17,359
something inside will be slightly amused or slightly kind of liberated

299
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:22,078
oh it's just it's just a natural phenomenon

300
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:28,960
and so we're seeing what's there and this ability to see

301
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:36,640
with a kind of unmoving mind or the mind that's at peace and at rest that clearly sees but it's not darting around

302
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:42,559
not straining trying no strain no trying to understand

303
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:49,760
no searching j no stickiness of self me myself and mine

304
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:55,040
no self in the seeing just seeing

305
00:57:55,040 --> 00:58:03,040
and there's something about the eyesight maybe that can maybe a hearing as well where in the seeing and in the hearing

306
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:09,200
that itself there's no added we don't the seeing itself doesn't

307
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:15,520
add so much but so we can see at some point all the stuff that we add

308
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:23,200
the judgments the interpretations and the desires we have those are all extra and to see them as

309
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:28,240
extra but to see with this quiet still

310
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:33,440
soft easy eyesight to see

311
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,359
the dharma eye that is opened that the buddhism talks about the buddha talk about

312
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:46,880
opening the dharma eye happens when there's a clear seeing

313
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:52,799
undisturbed seeing when the mind the heart the eyesight or the

314
00:58:52,799 --> 00:59:00,240
inner eye is not agitated it's at peace we just we can just quietly gaze out

315
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:07,520
on the world to quietly gaze on what's inside to see the direct experience as things

316
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:15,040
are and we start seeing how things arise and disappear how they come and go

317
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:22,960
how experiences are transient and they move and flux and change

318
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:32,480
and there's something about seeing in this still peaceful clear seeing

319
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:38,880
how things are in flux and changing that frees us from

320
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:46,240
the identifications the attachments the stickiness of all these ideas and night desires and feelings that go along with

321
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:51,760
seeing there's a kind of just allowing this the flow the stream of things

322
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:58,839
experiences to happen through and to appreciate how they everything is just coming and

323
00:59:58,839 --> 01:00:04,319
going and in the going of it

324
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:13,200
allowing things to come and go and the going of it then there also is this freedom from

325
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:21,119
attachments from clinging there also is this clarity and simplicity

326
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:28,079
of clear seeing of just being at rest at ease

327
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:34,240
on a ledge overlooking a vast natural world on an edge

328
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:40,160
ledge looking at the vast natural world that includes all the things that humans

329
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:47,040
create and are part of it and maybe be inspired maybe be free

330
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:52,400
maybe have compassion maybe have the heartbreak at some of the

331
01:00:52,400 --> 01:01:00,318
things we see but there's only seeing

332
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:08,839
or say it maybe a little bit more accurately there is clear seeing without

333
01:01:08,839 --> 01:01:14,240
self caught up in the seeing

334
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:22,000
and that clear seeing makes room and space for the heart for all other things to

335
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,720
operate in a kind of natural way

336
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:36,799
so both literally you might be mindful of your eyes and seeing

337
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:44,559
and see if you how much how you use your physical eyes do you use how often do you strain how

338
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:51,359
often are they darting around how often are they at rest how often are they just gazing quietly and peacefully

339
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:58,640
like you're watching a river sitting on the back of a river watching the river go down or looking at the sky at the clouds

340
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:04,839
floating just kind of very relaxed and open peaceful and how much are they agitated

341
01:02:04,839 --> 01:02:11,359
and the service of desires and fears and aversions

342
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:17,039
and and and then also more deeply in the mind

343
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:23,280
is there stuff your mind does that is sticky that sticks itself onto your site and so

344
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:29,359
your site is not so clear it's

345
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:35,440
and what experience have you had of clear seeing

346
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:41,440
can this can this idea of an unmoving mind

347
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:48,160
in a certain kind of way an unmoving eyes that just sees

348
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:55,440
without getting agitated by anything be a reference point for you to

349
01:02:55,440 --> 01:03:01,280
understand and to gaze upon the inner world

350
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:07,680
of how we do get caught and how we do get sticky and then in all these complicated ways

351
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:14,319
that you see when you look inward can you discover how to look upon it

352
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:22,160
with also with an unagitated mind with unagitated sight it's all nature

353
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:27,038
it's all natural phenomena coming and going

354
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:33,920
and to switch the paradigm of how we see from we see through the lens of

355
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:42,720
me myself and mine and self and i and identity to the other paradigm

356
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:49,359
where we just see it as nature as natural phenomena coming and

357
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:58,000
going certainly things that we respond to and care for and we take care of when it's appropriate

358
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:05,920
but without this huge heavy filter of self gazing upon the world inward and outward

359
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:12,799
with mine with eyes that are cool not feverish

360
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:22,078
eyes that are peaceful not agitated eyes that are caring and not hostile

361
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:27,839
may your dharma eye open and it

362
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:33,440
so thank you
