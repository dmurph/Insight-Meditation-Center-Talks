1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:09,200
so um thinking about what to talk about today uh just seemed like somehow to

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,640
maybe for my sake just to say something that's uh touches on my

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:23,240
heart's ache around uh the war in Israel and Israel and Hamas that started

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,439
yesterday and um and I was not going to talk about it directly talk about

5
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:36,480
something else but that I associate with a response to it but um um but that's kind of you know

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,760
sitting on my heart not least because

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,120
uh I have distant relatives who live in Israel I have friends who have relatives

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,600
in Palestine and so this idea that it affects you know people in all

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,199
directions is a kind of a big thing in the way that these things kind of Ripple out into the world out into Generations

10
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:05,880
to come it's very painful to consider the consequence of these kinds of fights

11
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:12,360
and wars and then there's so much these wars in in the world I mean there's it's

12
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:20,880
been going on for a very long time Wars around the around the world but we have big ones we have Ukraine and Syria and

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,920
Myanmar and one of the considered one of the big uh armed conflicts is um the the

14
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,479
drug wars in Colombia in uh in Mexico U many many people are dying

15
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:41,159
there every year and um and the way that uh such conflicts uh

16
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:48,280
trigger rage in people anger that just perpetuates the very thing that U maybe

17
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:55,039
they're trying to stop perpetuates conflict perpetuates the justification of

18
00:01:55,039 --> 00:02:01,280
violence and so um you know and so to sit in a in the

19
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,880
mid Buddhism we talk about the middle way uh and then often we kind of find

20
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:13,280
the middle way meaning between extremes of all kinds of things and um and so in

21
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:20,160
terms of conflict a very impactful kind of a middle way that uh

22
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,599
happened many years ago now at IMC when we were used to be in poo Alto

23
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:34,560
there was a um horrific murder of a young girl and the murderer was

24
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,440
sentenced to death in California and so we had a discussion about death penalty

25
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:47,480
and there there were different sides maybe he talked but it just an open discussion around it and when we got

26
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,440
near the end of the discussion this person stood up and said well uh I find

27
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,760
myself on both sides because uh both my parents were

28
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,560
murdered and it was by one of my close

29
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,799
relatives so for him for that person who was like oh no what I think he was maybe

30
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:17,720
in in favor of the death penalty but that meant for his relative so he was kind of stuck in the

31
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:23,080
middle of this and for me that that kind of middle way of holding both in one

32
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:30,080
person both sides and the pain of that and so how do we find a way in the

33
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:37,439
middle way how do we find a way that doesn't continue divisions how do we find a way that that

34
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:43,400
um uh that creates peace more than more

35
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:51,080
war so um it starts I think in simple ways it's one of the ways that it starts

36
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:58,000
is by uh living a life where you we don't lie and this is one of the first uh

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,480
spiritual teachings that we think that the Buddha taught to his son rahula and so I was thinking about this teaching

38
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:12,360
last night and this morning so I thought I I would share it with you and um so what what uh many people

39
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,199
don't know is that Buddha had a son and uh by the time that his son was about

40
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:23,440
seven years old six or seven years old um he apparently was mostly under the

41
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:30,199
care of his father and we don't usually think of the Buddha as a father and uh we think of him as monastic was quite

42
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:37,440
removed from kind of Parental responsibilities we don't know much about how he was a father but uh his son

43
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:44,720
came joined became what was called the novice Monk and um and so then lived that life

44
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:52,440
until he grew up and when he Contin then when around 20 years old you're allowed to ordain as a full monk so he was a

45
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,479
novice for 15 years 13 years and then became a

46
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:02,520
monk and uh at some point point in the son's youth maybe we're still pretty

47
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,320
young um it seems that um rahula told a

48
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:17,759
lie that's the only way you can this this story make sense and uh and so um the

49
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:24,840
Buddha they I think they go they they're they finished having their they go out every morning with a bull in order to

50
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:31,440
collect arms for the food they're going to eat that day and I think some somehow maybe that just close to finishing their

51
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,319
their meal they'd wash their bowl each monk is supposed to clean their own Bowl

52
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:43,120
usually and um and so they were sitting there and then the Buddha said um you

53
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:52,000
see how little water is left in this bowl here and uh Rula said yes and the Buddha

54
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:01,880
said um the monastic life of someone who uh deliberately

55
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:07,919
lies is as trifling or is worth as much as a little bit of oow in this

56
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:14,479
water so I can imagine his son gulped he's been

57
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,880
busted and then but the Buddha doesn't stop at that he says and he turned the

58
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:26,560
bowl threw the little bit of water out of the bowl and then he said the monastic life of someone who

59
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,599
deliberately lies oh no a little differently so I'll say this time they

60
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:40,560
actually the monastic life is someone who deliberately lies and has no shame about

61
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:47,520
it is uh is like uh this bowl which has no water in it there's no substance in

62
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:54,800
it nothing in it and then he goes on and says it again he says something like uh and now if you

63
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,080
turn the ball upside down so that to be gu last little drops fall out or something

64
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,759
something he said the monastic life of someone who deliberately lies but has no shame about

65
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:12,400
it is like a bowl that's upside down and in the fourth time he says then

66
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:19,400
he picks up the bowl and he says you know shows see it's all it's empty now of anything at all and the Buddha said

67
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:29,400
it's you know that the monastic life of someone who liberate lies but has no shame about it is um is hollow and void

68
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:37,960
just like this bow is so I imagine that was three big gulps this s side so in my imagination

69
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:46,280
of this uh because we don't know what in the text um the Buddha didn't say this in a harsh way or an angry way and but

70
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,720
he also didn't um you know didn't go let it go

71
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,039
unnoticed that his son had lied he was you know as a maybe a parental way

72
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:05,319
addressing this directly and um and I think what one of the things that's important here is that um

73
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:13,240
this word for shame I think in the Modern English in California at least that's a difficult word shame and it's

74
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:21,759
very it's a very heavily loaded and it's uh many people many people struggle with this word shame and and a tremendous

75
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:28,240
amount of pain and suffering and self-criticism around this word which much of it which is very

76
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,518
unnecessary but there is a place for a certain kind of healthy remorse certain

77
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:40,039
kind of healthy uh having a bad conscience about

78
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:45,839
what you're doing uh what you've done and uh without that uh we're not going

79
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:52,920
to correct for ourselves we're not going to get the message and you know boy I really blew it I really made a mistake

80
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:58,959
and so some kind of feeling of something is off here and exactly how we should

81
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:05,519
try uh call this in English I went to dictionaries yesterday and and um

82
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:12,160
wondered is there another word besides shame that we could use I wonder could we use disgrace doesn't feel disgrace

83
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,560
does that work better or um and some of the dictionaries the word lah in p and

84
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,959
also Sanskrit um can also mean bash they dictionary say mean bashful

85
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:31,560
embarrassed and that doesn't seem quite right either someone who deliberately lies but

86
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:38,800
doesn't feel bashful embarrassed might work but that kind of you missed kind of the the the

87
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:46,279
ethical feelings of this is something unethical here that happened so regardless you know there's

88
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:52,360
that would emphasize that so it isn't that he he delivered the lied that was a

89
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,399
problem what was the problem was he felt no regrets No Remorse he didn't feel

90
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:04,839
like he didn't recognize he had done something that was off that's what was the real thing because if you recognize

91
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:11,399
that you've done a deliberate lie and have some kind of remorse some kind of Shame then there's a possibility of

92
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:17,200
doing something about it making a corrective and we'll get to

93
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,360
that and for a monastic the idea of a monastic life in Buddhism Buddhism in

94
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:30,320
general is more a life than it is a philosophy it's a way of living the Dharma is a way of living and uh and

95
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,680
it's kind of um most represented by monastic life for the monks and nuns

96
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:44,320
because that's they're giving them over entirely to living a Dharma life that's the whole idea and it sometimes it might

97
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,839
look that the monastic doesn't do much but actually they're busy all day

98
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:56,120
long meditating being honest not being

99
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:03,000
greedy you know just kind of um being of service um processing their challenges

100
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
in the monastery I mean it's really you know it's a way of kind of being immersed in the Dharma life all day long

101
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,120
it's quite a wonderful thing and it's also kind of non-stop so if someone

102
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,240
wants to really live that life you can do it in Daily in in household life and

103
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,320
outside the monastic life as well but in monastic life you're constantly reminded

104
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,519
to do it stay close to the truth stay close to the heart of what man IC life

105
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,160
is about in Buddhism hard of what Dharma is about and that is

106
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:40,839
non-harming it's a dedication to not causing any harm both in the world

107
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:46,480
around us but also to ourselves and that's part of the reason

108
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:54,519
why you know the four noble truths that address suffering and the end of suffering uh is Al so Central because uh

109
00:11:54,519 --> 00:12:01,839
suffering just another word for harm and and the and the ending of suffering is the ending of whatever

110
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:08,200
we're doing in ourselves whatever psych whatever psychological processes we have that contribute to our suffering is what

111
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:15,040
we're overcoming we're changing with the four noble truths so to to discover how

112
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,320
not to even harm ourselves um and then to understand that

113
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,720
there's a intimate connection between not harming ourselves and not harming others not harming others not harming

114
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,040
ourselves you can't can't really do one without the other and that this is at

115
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:39,120
this is what the heart of the Dharma is about is finding that possibility it's not necessarily easy

116
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:45,440
but I'm still remain tremendously inspired by this and uh I feel like it's a guiding

117
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:54,440
principle for my life that this is the life I want to live the life of non-harming and uh so here is uh rahula

118
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,480
deliberately lying and which is uh causes lying causes a a tremendous

119
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:05,440
amount of harm um it's harmful for the person who lies and harmful the person for the

120
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,560
society the community that has to live with those lies it creates divisions it

121
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:17,839
creates hurt when the lies come out it creates mistrust when we just people discover they've been lied to the person

122
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:24,240
does lie um uh the reference point for the impact it has on a liar that the

123
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,800
Buddha has I think or buddhis Buddhism provides us is maybe something like what

124
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,959
it was like for you to sit and meditate today or maybe some today maybe you didn't have a good

125
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:43,040
meditation but maybe some point in your life maybe you had a meditation where you felt particularly calm and centered

126
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,800
peaceful and felt kind of like now I'm really in touch with myself I'm arrived I'm here I'm not thinking about other

127
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:55,720
things other concerns I'm I'm arrived I'm here I feel peaceful and good and um

128
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:03,000
and uh you're unlikely to turn to the person next to you when you open your eyes and just lie about

129
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,240
something if you did I think you'd just feel so awful inside something inside of

130
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,519
you that had been built had been kind of you settled into while you're meditating

131
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:21,120
suddenly has been squashed it's been closed like the some something in your heart closes that with that lie and um

132
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:27,560
uh or or there's tension builds up or you might kind of start getting calculating well if you know if I say

133
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:32,759
this slide then I'll have be careful and some someone once said that um it's

134
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:37,800
better to be honest because then you have less to remember because if you tell a lie you

135
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:43,560
have to remember it and then do it again and um so the

136
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,600
impact it has on the liar in from the Buddhist point of view is said to be

137
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,160
huge for someone who chronically lies Chron chronically tense chronically

138
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:01,600
fighting a fighting with everything around their life they're not they're so agitated they don't see the impact it

139
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:09,680
has but it does have an impact and the impact is huge and uh so and if the dedication of

140
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:17,000
a life is to not cause harm like it is for rahula being a a novice monk then um

141
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,560
you know of course not just the Buddha as a father but also as a guide for training people in that life he has to

142
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:32,560
say something so he said these things about the and then he went on to say make make an

143
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,279
analogy uh for this for lying that uh uses a a war

144
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:44,279
analogy and it's I think it's quite evocative to use this analogy when you consider all these wars that we have in

145
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:51,839
our society and the people who are Waring the people who are constantly fighting and arguing and and um hating

146
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:59,680
other people that way of life for some people to be that way so the story is that um you know the

147
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:06,279
the Bradley tanks of ancient India were elephants and uh they had these big war

148
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:11,440
elephants that were trained to fight and they were trained to stay tame and and

149
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,560
uh tame and I guess calm enough to go into the the middle of battles uh so

150
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,759
that the person sitting people sitting on top of them could fight uh you know

151
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:31,199
in the middle of battle from this height and um and then also I guess they were also fighters these these big tusks and

152
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:36,399
legs that could kick and stuff and so the Buddha talks about there was this

153
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:43,160
elephant that um you know was well trained and knew how to fight and was

154
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:50,560
trained to go into any situation any kind of battle uh and to do whatever was needed in order to

155
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:57,800
fight and so recognizing this then the charioteers the elaters would take them

156
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:05,079
into battle and in in fact the the the uh elephants were so well trained that

157
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:11,360
they would just do exactly that they just fight no non-stop would do whatever it took to fight up until the point

158
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:18,360
where they got killed and uh and so then he go so that's the example he gives and we

159
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:25,438
probably see people like this in our in our Lives who don't stop for anything and then uh and then the Buddha

160
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:33,360
says someone who tells a deliberate lie there's no evil they're not capable of

161
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,520
doing so the elephant is no no no no

162
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:44,919
killing they're not willing to do once they've been trained that way so that's the kind of dramatic contrast for this

163
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:51,160
idea impact lying has so I can imagine that rahula is

164
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:57,360
thinking twice now about what he did if in fact he lied and uh and so he's

165
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,240
getting us getting you know has gotten his the Buddha has gotten his attention around

166
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:09,640
this then the Buddha switches gears and he gives rahula some

167
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:16,200
teachings first he asks the question he said what is the purpose of a

168
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,360
mirror and rahula says the purpose of a mirror is reflection so you can see

169
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,760
yourself in the mirror um in the same way the Dharma is

170
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:32,159
a mirror where we reflect in and how do you see

171
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:37,880
how do you find that mirror by reflecting on your

172
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:45,679
actions if you want to reflect you want look at your actions to see if I do any

173
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:52,400
act physical act through my body through my words or through my mind does it or

174
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:58,480
does it not cause harm in the world does it not cause harm to self or others

175
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,520
that's the Dharma question he's offering the Buddha you should reflect on everything that you do all actions you

176
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:10,240
have and reflect about whether or not they cause harm that's a tall order to

177
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:16,440
go around with that question all the time and does that mean that we're going to be busy remember I said monastics

178
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:23,039
have a busy life they're not sitting around they're busy kind of monitoring

179
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:30,039
themselves saying it and that's part part of the purpose of mindfulness is um not just to be calm and you know manage

180
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:36,360
with our stress but part of the purpose of mindfulness in the teachings of the Buddha is to be able to monitor

181
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:43,559
ourselves enough to see is what we're doing in body speech and mind is it

182
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:49,120
afflictive or not does it cause harm or not does it C cause stress or not in

183
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:56,400
ourselves and others and some people could be quite dis quite uninterested by this aspect of

184
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,919
Buddhism because it's much more interesting to talk about great states

185
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:09,240
of meditative absorption the Bliss and the calm and you know Bliss out you know it's you know and you know and if it's

186
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,320
not so great to do life meditation like this tremendous states of you know meditative absorption then I'll just do

187
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:22,640
psychedelics you know and that you know for a good time but uh in fact what the Buddha is

188
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,280
doing suggesting is um yes in Buddhism we have wonderful states of meditation

189
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:35,799
can be attained but that's not the the point to have those States the point is to have an ability to really track

190
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:41,360
ourselves to be able to live a life of harmlessness the result of that is a

191
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:48,880
tremendous inner peace so that's the reward from being able to do that but um but what means to

192
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:56,240
that is to have the self-reflection of body speech and mind think about it don't go through your

193
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,919
life not mindful don't go through your life mindful without questioning what

194
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:10,080
was the impact what was the consequences of what I've done here so this kind of reflection constant

195
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:16,640
reflection so um so then the Buddha says um if

196
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:25,520
um if you're going to do something in body speech or mind before you do it

197
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:32,000
reflect uh is this going to cause harm in any direction myself or

198
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:40,400
others and is what I'm going to do is it wholesome with good consequence or is it

199
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:46,240
UNH wholesome with detrimental consequences so afflictive just means

200
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,480
harm uh so is it cause harm or not harm but the second criteria was is it

201
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:58,039
wholesome or UNH wholesome means that um is the in doing it is it is it Nur

202
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:06,080
nourishing is it wholesome is it healthy for my whole psychophysical system to do it is it healthy for our society is it

203
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,120
beneficial for the people around us nowadays um just yesterday this

204
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:16,200
weekend I think maybe you saw it too that there studies that um uh parents

205
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:22,159
who yell at their kids growing up uh they are are impacting the kids uh

206
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:27,360
similarly to what it's like to be uh physically hitting CH young children

207
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:34,320
children gr up being hit uh and being uh yelled at have similar kind of impacts

208
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:41,159
on their trauma growing up their sense of abuse Growing Up So how important it is not even to yell at

209
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:47,159
people and uh you know mean words to people uh is not wholesome the person is

210
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:52,480
being mean it's also not so helpful for our society what goes on around

211
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,840
us so these CR budha offers these criteria is it healthy for you to do

212
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,159
that this is it healthy for others in the long term so not just right now but

213
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:11,039
in the long term so I've told this story many times of yelling not yelling at my son but but um I I Ed my I called it my

214
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:17,960
strong voice and um and it was uh rarely

215
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:25,679
used but um the um it was kind of like like you know seeming every other thing

216
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:32,520
had wasn't working terms of the the behavior the kid was

217
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:38,480
doing and so so I finally I just have to use my strong voice I said you know so it was kind of deliberately thought

218
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,600
about and considered it wasn't like just suddenly screaming and I would just say

219
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:49,960
in very strong Stern voice no and and that was effective okay okay

220
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,320
that okay good

221
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:01,000
until I heard exactly the same voice voice of my older

222
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,960
son uh using the same thing to his younger brother and then I said oh no

223
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,880
what have I done and that was I never used a strong voice

224
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,240
again that that way find other ways to you know

225
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:24,480
to to deal with parent

226
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:31,080
issues so um the uh um so then he said so before you do it

227
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:36,440
then the Buddha said while you're doing saying something doing something

228
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:43,640
or even mentally your thoughts around something you should be reflecting thinking about cons uh tracking yourself

229
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:51,440
monitoring yourself is this causing harm now and sometimes we only know uh about

230
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,640
this causing harm once we start because like some of the people we're talking to

231
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:04,080
we we're we're involved in uh we don't know what will affect them something that is innocuous

232
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:11,240
for one person is because of their background is very harmful causes a lot of pain for someone and so sometimes we

233
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:17,520
have to ATT track and pay attention in the moment and not just treat everyone like they're ourselves and think just

234
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,760
because I can say that and this has no impact on me it might have a huge impact

235
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:29,320
on someone else who has a you don't know their background and what they've been through so while you're doing it

236
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:36,679
important to track pay attention and it uh is it causing harm to yourself to others uh is it healthy

237
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:44,720
for yourself is it healthy for others what are the long-term consequences of this and if you find that it's unhealthy

238
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,200
and afflictive then the Buddha said you should stop don't do it just stop just

239
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:58,000
stop what you're doing and then the last one is interesting then he went through it again and he said be uh after you've

240
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,840
done something you should reflect on the same way but after you've done it if you

241
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,039
discover that yes it it was it hurt someone it was harmful yes it was

242
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:16,520
unhealthy and had deletar long-term consequences then you should go find

243
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:22,640
someone that you respect a wise person that you respect and tell them what you

244
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:28,240
did I don't want to use the word confession because that has a heavy and

245
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:34,000
some people in the west I think that the translation sometimes use confession but the poly word does not mean confession

246
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,799
because you know it's they were Buddhists

247
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:49,480
not not the people who use confession and um and so it was uh uh it

248
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:57,320
simply just says you want to go and acknowledge what you did it's more like an acknowledgement uh what you did and U so

249
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:02,760
me I'll read it to you and this is maybe for some people

250
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,600
the most difficult thing to want to

251
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:16,880
do um oh here here this translation is different it says um you should lay it

252
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:24,679
open that's a nice expression lay it open just be open about it put it out there lay it open to your teacher or

253
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:30,240
your wise companions in the Holy life oh here's the word

254
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:35,720
confession so again maybe I'll skip it because it's not the the P doesn't mean

255
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:43,200
like the way we associate what what we associate with the word so having said it having said it revealed it and laid

256
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,720
it open you should then undertake restraint in the

257
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:57,519
future so we do make mistakes we do do cause harm there are in intentional

258
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:04,840
unintentional ways in which we hurt people and uh to lay it open to someone

259
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:11,480
it makes a big difference because it's kind of like when you say it out loud you not you're not squirming around it

260
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:19,360
you're not kind of pretending it's not there you're not kind of like to trying to belittle it or or also you're not

261
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:25,679
holding it by yourself sometimes when we we we hold our sense of guilt by ourselves all

262
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:31,039
alone it tends to build unnecessarily big there's way too many people this is

263
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:36,519
why the word shame is so difficult uh to even for me to use it here today because

264
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:42,640
so many people have this private shame that they carry with them all the time there are some people feel shame just

265
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:49,840
because they breathe you know just they never do anything wrong but just that somehow they're they were born wrong so

266
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:56,799
they carry the shame with them or feel that way and um but uh when we do when

267
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:03,880
we do some cause harm in the world to carry the guilt to carry the shame privately and alone sometimes can be

268
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:11,440
very difficult and kind of the tension can build and and in some ways even make it worse for ourselves continues the

269
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,960
harm but you lay it open to someone else who's wise who will receive it well

270
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:24,080
who's not going to make you feel shame or not make you to feel he's not going to belittle you or be angry with you um

271
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:30,640
is a really a healthy thing to do and then you're accountable a little bit then you know if you really commit

272
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:38,360
yourself to not doing it again in the future you know oh you know my wise friend you know knows what

273
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:45,120
I did before and they're going to their eyebrows going to go up if they see me do it again I don't want that to happen

274
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:50,159
or you know or or now I know that I'm accountable to someone so maybe they'll

275
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:55,679
call me on it or maybe we'll have be maybe we need to have more conversations to understand better what what's

276
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,880
happening to me what's going on for me a wise friend will engage you with

277
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:07,279
respect with kindness um and honesty in order to find a way with what

278
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:15,320
happened so that's what the Buddha has said to his son after you know lying is not

279
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:22,279
good it's not good for someone who wants to live the monastic life lying deliberately with no sense of

280
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:29,440
Shame no sense of remorse no sense of conscience and and uh and this is how

281
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:36,320
you should live this life you should live this life uh monitoring yourself being

282
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,919
reflective some of you might think this is a a headache now to go around

283
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:47,840
monitoring yourself all the time about your actions but just like with learning

284
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:54,399
how to practice mindfulness after a while it becomes second nature it's like riding a

285
00:30:54,399 --> 00:31:00,679
bicycle if you had to always be learning to ride ride a bicycle from scratch every day time you ride a bicycle why

286
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:06,919
would anybody ride a bicycle but you know you learn the bicycle and then it becomes easy look my

287
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:12,760
own no hands and uh you know it's becomes kind of second nature and you can do all

288
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:22,039
kinds of things while you're riding a bike even talk on the phone and um but um uh so the same thing

289
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:28,159
this monitoring of ourselves that mindfulness does become second nature you carryed with you all the time and

290
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:35,279
it's such a be it's like a treasure to have this it's a gift to be able to attract yourself and to monitor yourself

291
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:43,240
in this ethical way not causing harm is also a tremendous gift because then we

292
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:48,360
become a gift for society our society needs a lot more examples of people who

293
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:53,600
live a harmless life and to live a harmless life that is

294
00:31:53,600 --> 00:32:02,120
not silent when there are problems in this world so the Buddha was not silent when

295
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:08,600
his son lied and whether you think this was good parenting or not that's an open question

296
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:15,559
but um but he did he wasn't silent he wasn't just sitting there like meditating pretending nothing happened

297
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:22,240
he addressed it directly and uh and I'm pretty sure the Buddha was doing the very thing he was

298
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:28,519
talking about doing before during and after speaking to his son this way he

299
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:33,720
reflected will this be afflictive harmful or not to say it this

300
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:39,200
way uh is this a healthy thing for myself and for him and will have good

301
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:45,360
consequences or bad consequences in the future so you know so this monitoring

302
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:51,120
always this monitoring going on and um so his son stayed in the

303
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:57,080
monastic life and when he was about 20 or so uh he became enlightened himself

304
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:04,000
self and then continue living this life the monastic life apparently to end of end of his

305
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:11,200
life so um so this importance of Ethics or life

306
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:17,840
of non-harming is a good thing to remember when we have so many examples of people

307
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:23,559
who are causing harm and uh where the heart it's you

308
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:30,440
know and sometimes these cycles of harm and violence um it's hard to know chicken or egg

309
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,519
where did it begin who's

310
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:43,039
responsible but it's easy to see how it just keeps going these cycles and this Palestinian and Israeli cycles that have

311
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:48,320
been going on for so so long you know from the distance it looks so

312
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:54,039
unnecessary something's not working and um so exactly what kind of

313
00:33:54,039 --> 00:34:01,799
self-reflection is needed is hard to know it's what to say from a distance is

314
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:07,440
hard to say but um this idea of the middle

315
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:13,760
way that cares for everyone involved is has compassion for everyone

316
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,960
involved is looking for the best for everyone involved so what's what's Ben

317
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:25,679
most beneficial what's healthy for everyone involved that is the way forward I

318
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:31,240
feel um and um without without that I think there's not much hope we'll just

319
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:38,960
continue the Cycles on and on forever so

320
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,760
