3
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:18,760
am and I'm happy to see all the chat messages coming in and feeling a sense

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:25,289
of a connection right [Music]

5
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,920
here yeah so welcome to our 7 a.m. uh guided meditation

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:41,440
and uh darat uh where will be um starting our

7
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:48,800
meditation I'll offer just a couple of orienting words um

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:56,640
here uh yesterday we started our meditation uh from this sense of

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:04,478
grounding and today we'll be expanding our meditation uh if you like to stay with a

10
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:12,280
sort of grounded feeling this sitting like a Inner Mountain feel free to do so

11
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:18,479
um but we're also uh going to extand uh to

12
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,600
include a kind of aliveness in this being so think of this is kind of like a

13
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:32,960
live Mountain um if that image or that metaphor somehow works for you and that

14
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,880
includes um paying attention to our life breath the movements of the

15
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:46,119
breath and so that's the orientation I we'll be working with and we're

16
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:51,360
expanding to um explore uh the nature

17
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,960
within this aless and enlivening uh

18
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,438
aspect of our being so what start with a sound of a

19
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:13,620
[Music]

20
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,840
bell pausing to

21
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:31,800
begin arriving arriving at when where you

22
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:40,800
are and how you are just as it

23
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:48,400
is not as what you wish it to be or not

24
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,079
demanding it to be otherwise

25
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:13,159
gently softly feeling and

26
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:21,120
sensing here and

27
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:30,159
now maybe with the felt sense in the body

28
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,840
sound

29
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:50,560
temperature whatever may be present in this moment

30
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,159
mindfulness is add to the

31
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:24,840
foreground and maybe heartfulness and body

32
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:30,280
fullness are here too

33
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,680
sensing this body

34
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,560
sitting maybe the posture

35
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,800
movements of the

36
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:19,319
breath that's a general sense of the body without having to figure it out

37
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,160
maybe you're feeling the weight of the body settling

38
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,080
down

39
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,800
naturally felt sense of Earth element in the

40
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:19,120
body like mud settling down in the

41
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:27,039
water it's natural

42
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:46,599
feeling and sensing the earthy body resting on

43
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,199
earth like a stones in the river bed

44
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:09,479
or a sense of sitting like a mountain

45
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,680
within quiet

46
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:32,479

breath maybe throughout the

58
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:32,760
body or just a throughout out to the Torso

59
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,560

aliveness Within

00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:03,759
aliveness you may stay with the the movements of the

maybe sweet joy

84
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,919

felt

95
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,880
sense maybe there is no need for

96
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520

e e

106
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:24,319
in this last a few minutes of our meditation [Music]

107
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,120
together allow this aless

108
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:38,120
flowing from the movement of the breath to

109
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,880
nourish the whole

110
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:56,320
body the light the whole body

111
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:16,279
allow the flow of the breath to dance its own dance

112
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,000
a for

113
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:20,309
[Music]

114
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:05,159
yeah so we'll make a transition uh to a little more

115
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:13,799
words and so this uh darat that um uh this a sequence of uh

116
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:22,240
dmats that were building upon was from the sua in Sam nikaya and yesterday I

117
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:29,880
offered an uh kind of an overarching um description of what this

118
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:35,919
suta was about um to unfold and was was

119
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:42,840
about and um the sutta started out by saying that knowing and seeing the

120
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:50,440
destruction of thingss come with development uh or come with cultivation

121
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:56,000
or you can say practice not otherwise and then the Buddha offered

122
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,080
the three different simes to illustrate some of the

123
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:09,200
characteristics of um the cultivation and so I wanted to unpack

124
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:18,840
the first one uh which has to do with a chicken and a bunch of her eggs and so

125
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:26,480
let me read this little piece uh right now Suppose there was a chicken with 8

126
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:33,120
or 10 or 12 of eggs but she had not properly sat on

127
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:40,240
them to keep them warm and incubated that chicken might

128
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,840
wish oh if only my chicks would break out of the eggshell with their clouds

129
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:53,120
and the beak and the hatch safely but they can't break out and

130
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:59,039
hatch safely why is that because that chicken

131
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:04,519
with 8 or 10 or 12 eggs has not properly

132
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:11,120
sat on them to keep them warm and

133
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:20,399
incubated and so just like that if the practitioners would not properly

134
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:28,480
cultivate and wholeheartedly cultivate develop what is needed

135
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:35,120
even if we wish all we wish we won't be free so just like the

136
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:42,600
chick and I was struck by uh this little piece um this uh simile right

137
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:49,679
here uh there are two things that got highlighted and that the the word was oh

138
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,960
the chicken uh had not properly sat on

139
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:01,519
them and the second word is to keep them warm and

140
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:07,040
incubated and so the first time one I want to point out is that our

141
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:14,200
cultivation and development is um rather

142
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:21,000
specific and so uh this cultivation needs a proper cultivation

143
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:28,280
and development and in the Susa um the Buddha offered uh that that

144
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:35,440
the the specific cultivation and development is the 37 wings of Awakening

145
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,560
the four foundations of mindfulness five faculties the five

146
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:47,560
spiritual faculties five powers and some of you would have known this um and you

147
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:53,638
know those are all the things that we've actually spoken about in the 7 a.m. Dar

148
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:58,960
meds seven factors of Awakening Noble Aid fold

149
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:06,720
path and so the development is uh quite specific and we have to engage in them

150
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,920
and this other word keep them warm and in

151
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:18,520
incubated in that sense that we have to give ourselves over to commit to this

152
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:24,599
cultivation and development

153
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:31,079
um you know if the chick wants the chick uh if the chicken wants the chicks to

154
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:36,960
break through uh to break through the shells but you know she wanders around

155
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:45,160
and socialize with other chickens or U go get her warms or something you know

156
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:53,720
and she sat for a few minutes and gets up and that won't you know the chicks won't

157
00:35:53,720 --> 00:36:00,720
break through right and so in this way um for us

158
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,920
too when we cultivate um uh the Noble

159
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:16,000
eight-fold Path uh our whole practice um is oriented is aligned with

160
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,280
what Eightfold Noble Eightfold Path is orienting US

161
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:28,880
towards and I as I was reflecting that um

162
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:35,599
and there's a lot of nuances in um how

163
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:42,920
chickens incubate and allow the chicks uh uh to to be

164
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:48,800
hatched you know I I don't know somehow this kind of a LIF making

165
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:55,520
processes um probably is never as traval as what we think or what we

166
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:04,400
see and and I had some birds um incubating and hatching under my

167
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:10,040
roof I was kind of stuned by uh in the

168
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:15,800
intricacy the uh the mama bird was um

169
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:21,599
engaging in this whole process there were times that she had to protect the

170
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,839
eggs because the Big Bird would come and and there are times that she would be

171
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:34,040
there and sit it so we don't know what's what might be going on

172
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:40,520
within uh the chicken but my sense is that she's

173
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,240
attuned to this

174
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:51,640
process she's attuned to um and the

175
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:58,000
um the chicks uh being incubated in some way

176
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:07,119
yeah and so for us uh this development uh invites us to be attuned to our inner

177
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:15,200
process and then the assimile goes on um with another term here and that

178
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:23,480
the Buddha also said you know I'm going to paraphrase this a little bit and then I'll read it basically said well you

179
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:28,960
know even if you didn't wish to be free but if you keep motivating and

180
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,640
developing uh the mind and heart properly and to keep developing it even

181
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:41,160
if you didn't have a wish to be free it'll happen on its own just like the

182
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:48,280
chicks and so let me read this part and said when a medicant or when a

183
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:55,400
practitioner is committed to development they may not wish if only my

184
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:03,560
mind was freed by a from the tins by not grasping even so their mind is freed

185
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:10,599
from tins by not grasping why is that and you should say

186
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:18,160
it's because they are developed developed in the 37 factors of

187
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:26,240
Awakening Suppose there was a chicken with 8 or 10 or 12 eggs and she properly

188
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:33,599
sat on them to keep them warm and incubated and that chicken may not wish

189
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:39,760
uh if only my chicks would break out of the eggshell with their clouds and Beak

190
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:46,560
and hatch safely but still they will break out and hatch

191
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:54,240
safely why is that because that chicken with eight or 10 or 12 eggs properly sat

192
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:59,319
on them to keep them warm and

193
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,760
incubate and so this uh what's um interesting or stood out for me or two

194
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:16,319
things uh in this little um teaching one is that our practice or the

195
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:25,359
cultivation development is not based on wishful thinking or based on our gohal

196
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:33,200
or the ideas of a ghost or the results it's not an orientation of

197
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:39,880
resulting cuz we can wish always we wish and this you know this goal

198
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:47,599
orientation or the resulting orientation is kind of in the popular

199
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:53,680
culture right and they were very driven by the goals of often

200
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,800
times and yet our practice

201
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:05,880
um is not go driven or result

202
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:15,599
orienting and rather um it invites us to cultivate and

203
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:25,160
develop uh with wholeheartedness sincerity and aligned in a way that is

204
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:32,079
conducive to Freedom and uh the other point that uh this

205
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:37,880
particular simile really kind of highlights is that uh just like the

206
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:43,760
chicks hatching there is a natural process that

207
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:51,440
is being born the uh process of Liberation is born with

208
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:58,760
in so much of us is of it is kind of under the surface level of our being

209
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:06,839
being there is a natural unfolding and the the chick can't just

210
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:13,920
uh go ahead the chicken can't just go ahead and break a shell for the

211
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:22,920
chicks and the inner development has to unfold in its own time and it's in its

212
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:30,640
own way and the chicken plays A Part in doing

213
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:40,559
this and as we can see much of this happens below the surface level of our

214
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:46,800
being and so just uh like this our Dharma practice uh we're partic

215
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:54,640
participating in uh is kind of um a process of

216
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:00,680
developing and cultivating or nurturing kind of a w like

217
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:05,760
environment for the goodness of freedom and knowing and

218
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:12,559
seeing to grow and to mature sometimes I feel like the

219
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:19,400
freedoms almost uh like coming out the womb of my being like you know from the

220
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:25,240
belly center of my being and rather rather than coming from

221
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:31,559
the head Center and this process we can't rush

222
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:39,960
it and you know we can't rush it because we want it so badly and if you know if you just hear

223
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:47,960
that it almost feels silly or it doesn't make sense because clearly that is not

224
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:54,119
aligned with non-grasping right cuz we wanted so

225
00:43:54,119 --> 00:44:01,839
badly um and so instead the invitation is that we learn to

226
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:07,520
properly cultivate um the inner capacities that

227
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:12,680
kind of grow out of our inner uh [Music]

228
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:19,440
womb with the sincerity with the care with the

229
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:25,599
patience and a greater degrees of wisdom

230
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,040
and uh love

231
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:36,720
and so thank you everyone and so that's the Sim of the

232
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:43,520
chicken and eggs thank you for your

233
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:50,780
[Music]

234
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:58,160
attention have a wonderful rest of the day everyone
