1
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:18,379
so hello everyone welcome

2
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,960
and welcome to this now next half hour of

3
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,579
I hope that it's something delightful

4
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,239
delightful period of meditation and to introduce it

5
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,300
I want to make the point that

6
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,780
we have many physiological systems within us

7
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:01,800
that are fairly distinct from each other they also work together

8
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:08,280
so for example we have the capacity to hear sounds I hear the garbage trucks

9
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,159
outside not right now and and

10
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,320
I mean some of us can hear and some of us have the capacity to also

11
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,720
to walk and those can be done independent of

12
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,720
each other and they can support each other

13
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:38,460
so we have psychological systems within us that can be independent of each other and work together

14
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:45,860
and one of them is partly at the protective system

15
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:52,680
that reacts to the threats in the world and responds quickly

16
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:59,640
but that also becomes reactive to all kinds of challenges all kinds of Imagine

17
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,460
challenges all kinds of things which are not ever present

18
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,619
but maybe imaginary or future threats or

19
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:16,680
that um and and so then this reactive system

20
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,379
it kind of can go Haywire and sometimes what the reactive system

21
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:29,340
is reacting to is thoughts and memories and impulses ideas in ourselves and

22
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,400
reactivity is sometimes reacting to reactivity and so the cycles of reactivity kind of live in people

23
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,640
sometimes for decades foreign so there is this protective reactive

24
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:49,140
system and then there's also the nurturing loving system

25
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:55,260
and this is where we appreciate people we have good will for them we respect them

26
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:01,819
that there's love of all the different shapes Shades all different forms of love

27
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,379
and uh and sometimes the reactive system

28
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:14,879
predominates when we have challenges then in particular the reactive mode gets the

29
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:23,599
upper hand and the nurturing mode the love mode is forgotten is pushed to the side

30
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:31,620
they're always there together and they have the opportunity to cooperate and work together

31
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:37,739
and they can be done independently and meditation is a Time

32
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:44,879
to relax and quiet the reactive mode it has a role sometimes in our lives but

33
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,659
it also it's really healthy to learn how to quiet it

34
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:57,239
to let it settle down to have a break a vacation from that

35
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,280
not as being disloyal to it there's a time and place for it

36
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,400
the reactive mode but if we can quiet down settle it in

37
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,480
meditation then we can bring forth the love mode the nurturing mode that

38
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:23,040
that which is really feeds us and fills us with kind of healing loving

39
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,740
soft dharmic um

40
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:35,400
qualities it's always there but my thing for it's often the one

41
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,220
that's forgotten the one that's overlooked the one that is somehow

42
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:49,680
buried so to call upon to tap into

43
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,620
the capacity to have good will well wishing

44
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,740
to view look upon others kindly

45
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:06,780
and good will your words Good Will kindly doesn't mean doesn't have the high bars

46
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:12,600
if we use the word love it's possible to have good will and look

47
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:19,860
kindly on people who we don't like liking and

48
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:26,660
love not liking and Goodwill liking and kindness are two different things

49
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,000
and one way to distinguish this is that

50
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:41,360
love liking good will is so good for ourselves

51
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,720
it nourishes ourselves and it's possible to have this good will

52
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:55,020
and its benefits fill us in a wonderfully inspiring

53
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,539
healing maturing way

54
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,940
so to sit in meditation

55
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:16,440
and to assume a posture that allows the reactive mode

56
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:22,199
to relax if you're sitting first thing in the

57
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:27,840
morning maybe the reactive mode is just a little

58
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:35,660
bit left over from the day before a little bit of physical tension

59
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,660
maybe there's reactive thoughts and contractions and tensions in the mind or

60
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:50,240
the heart but to sit in a way that is going to allow that to relax

61
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:03,680
then that classic posture of sitting upright can allow for the deepest relaxation

62
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,639
gently closing the eyes

63
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:21,120
and taking some long slow deep breaths and on the exhale

64
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,699
without ambition or trying too hard

65
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:33,740
relax your whole body and mind let things release let go

66
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,560
to avoid being reactive to your attention

67
00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:02,180
to avoid have any aversion to the tensions of the body and mind

68
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,940
while caringly kindly

69
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:18,800
letting things relax as you breathe

70
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:29,240
and if you could intentionally relax act on that intention

71
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:51,000
and see if you can find how the intention to relax

72
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,760
can arise from a good will a caring

73
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,580
a kindness to yourself into your body

74
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,459
meditation is a time out

75
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:36,740
from being involved in the challenges of our life the best we can

76
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:42,560
or at least a time out from being reactive to them

77
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,959
trying to solve them or understand them or

78
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:04,399
relaxing relaxing as a form of self-care

79
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:37,339
and then letting your letting go of actively relaxing

80
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,260
and sit quietly with your breathing

81
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:56,040
as if you're getting ready to gaze upon breathing kindly

82
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:01,560
with Good Will with love for your body breathing

83
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:09,920
but first just let breathing reveal itself to you

84
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:18,199
let the inhale and exhale arise and manifest

85
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:24,120
as if they want to be known in whatever way you're breathing

86
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:31,100
breathing is the way that they want to be known

87
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:46,220
in you just feeling it knowing it

88
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:40,320
and to gently without any worry if you can't do this

89
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,980
and to allow your breathing

90
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:53,180
to relax let there be a caring

91
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:59,540
a good will a kindness for your breathing

92
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,420
to make room for it to relax or to ease up

93
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:18,660
breathing moves in the direction breathing easily lightly

94
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:37,260
being content with the very slight

95
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:42,320
easing up or relaxing of breathing

96
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:07,339
looking for places where the inhale has a softness to it

97
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:18,439
looking for places where the exhale has softness as part of it

98
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:12,959
and then is there a place in your body anywhere at all

99
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,399
that you associate

100
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:28,339
with good will kindness

101
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:34,699
love and well-wishing of others

102
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:45,420
well wishing of yourself maybe in the heart area maybe your belly

103
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:53,540
maybe in your mind maybe your whole body

104
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,959
and wherever is the

105
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:14,180
Place associated with love kindness

106
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:32,540
breathe with that breathe through it

107
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:40,220
as a Gentle Wind that fans aflame

108
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:53,699
gently fans a campfire Fanning the flame of love

109
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:56,480
kindness

110
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:09,740
centering yourself in the kindness

111
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:13,459
not in the reactivity

112
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:38,600
and then turning your attention more fully

113
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:45,020
to gaze upon yourself kindly

114
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:51,679
to view yourself with Good Will with care

115
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:59,159
with friendliness your eyes your inner eyes

116
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:06,720
gazing upon yourself kindly forgivingly

117
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:36,419
and then to turn your gaze out upon the world to the people around

118
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:44,159
you your life and your communities is if you're looking out into the world

119
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:50,039
whoever comes to mind for you quietly peacefully

120
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:57,679
maybe without them needing to know gaze upon them kindly

121
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:09,919
an attitude of friendliness warmth good will

122
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:51,320
the Buddha likened meta Goodwill

123
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,820
to the sound of a trumpet

124
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:03,120
you don't see it the sound travel but it travels out from the mouth of the

125
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:13,340
trumpet out into the world far so let these words of loving kindness

126
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:23,960
project your kindness good will out into the world

127
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,360
as a loving trumpet call

128
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:37,519
may all beings be happy

129
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:45,200
may all beings be safe

130
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:53,778
may all beings be peaceful

131
00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:03,440
may all beings be free

132
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:14,720
and with our love with our care and friendship

133
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:21,980
May each of us contribute to that possibility

134
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:27,799
even in the smallest ways

135
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,839
[Music]

136
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:09,720
so hello everyone and we're here at the second talk for this

137
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:17,960
week's series on love in times of challenge

138
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:25,700
and um so just repeat a little bit what I said for the guided meditation

139
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:32,640
we have many systems operating within us and um physical psychological

140
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,820
physiological mental systems some of which can work independent

141
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:44,580
enough from each other and some work together and

142
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:52,320
but even some of their independent can cooperate so for people who can hear and people

143
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,600
who can walk those two functions can operate

144
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,640
independent from each other and but also

145
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,880
they can support each other if you walk and hearing a car coming from behind you

146
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:16,320
makes you safer as you walk and um so

147
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,919
we have two primary systems and in Buddhism it focuses on

148
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:28,559
the most common way they talk about it is the wholesome and the unwholesome but

149
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:34,620
I don't know if that really represents well what happens for us inside that what I want to emphasize

150
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:43,679
I'd like to I like to think of them as being the protective and the and the nurturing

151
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:51,480
the protective and the cultivating so the protective is what reacts

152
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:57,240
the the reactive mode of something dangerous up and suddenly we have to act

153
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:02,279
instinctively and quickly and just react you know without thinking about it

154
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:09,120
but this reactive mode can operate when there's no immediate pressing Danger

155
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:15,720
and so um and sometimes what we're reacting to is our own thoughts I've sit quietly

156
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,940
sometimes and or just being by myself and and it started to have a little

157
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:27,360
fantasy imagination of some scene that turned out to be kind of dangerous

158
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:33,659
and I could feel my system reacting to it I get tense and activated and and a

159
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:41,159
little bit feel the alarm comes up and it's all a product of my imagination it's not a real thing but my system is

160
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:47,520
reacting to the imagination and so some people that end up living in

161
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:54,539
a reactive mode this protective mode way too often in such a way the protective mode is not really protecting

162
00:32:54,539 --> 00:33:01,679
us it's doing the opposite that uh over protection overreacting always being in

163
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:08,520
this reactive mode is phenomenally stressful for us for the system

164
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:14,220
so um so it has its role but it can be overdone

165
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:19,320
the other system is the nurturing one the one allows that cultivates something

166
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:25,399
to grow and develop from the inside out and nurtures

167
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:31,500
the wholesome in US and that system as it operates very

168
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:40,919
differently it doesn't react to anything it it Wells up from within and we create

169
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:49,679
the conditions for it we create the ease and part of the reason to relax deeply and and live with less less stress is so

170
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:56,580
this deeper system the nurturing system can operate best and that nurturing system sometimes has

171
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:03,299
a lot of intelligence that can help us find our way through life's challenges in a very different way than the

172
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:09,179
protective system does which tends to focus on the immediacy of things and and

173
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:17,460
um and sees things through the lines of lens of threat and fear doesn't see things through this lens of

174
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:23,638
the wholeness of it and so this nurturing system is where

175
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:29,419
love exists the kind of deep abiding um

176
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:37,260
nurturing love which Wells up from the inside and does not get entangled with the reactive

177
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:43,460
system sometimes what we call love is mostly in this world of reactivity

178
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:50,339
transactional love a love that comes from maybe feeling insecure and what we

179
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:56,638
really are in love with is not a person but we're look searching for security in someone and someone seems to provide

180
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,859
security and that's what we're really wanting and the strong want for security

181
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:07,980
the strong want for children the strong want for

182
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:15,960
um praise strong want to be associated with someone who somehow

183
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:22,320
builds up our sense of self it's it's kind of trying to find our way

184
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,839
in the reactive mode rather than um the love being something that Wells

185
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:34,800
up from the inside that's not transactional it's not looking for getting something from someone else

186
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:43,200
some people love others occasionally why they love them in quotation marks is

187
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:49,320
because they love they're being loved and it's so meaningful to be loved that

188
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:55,619
they're in love with being loved more they're in love with the other person so the love thing can be complicated

189
00:35:55,619 --> 00:36:02,339
when it's mixed up with the reactive mode but uh what we do when we really can

190
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:08,160
relax deeply and what Buddhism really Champions is a non-transactional love

191
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:13,380
a love which is not needing or getting something from another person

192
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:19,200
but has a number of beautiful qualities it has a tremendous appreciate

193
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:24,599
appreciation of others for who they are there is valuing others like this isn't

194
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:30,540
they just have a tremendous sense of value and the importance of this person there's a lot of respect for the other

195
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:37,500
person um that uh respect that also includes kind of granting them giving them their

196
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:43,320
autonomy uh letting them make their own choices and have their own independent life in a

197
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:50,420
certain way and not needing to fold their life into mind so that I feel safe or secure

198
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:56,640
and um and then there are the primary characteristics of this Buddhist love is

199
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:03,000
uh Goodwill is well wishing wishing really wishing someone well

200
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:10,079
and that well-wishing is not you know calculated well-wishing but rather just

201
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:15,900
a nurturing feeling like you want to nurture this person or maybe that's a little bit suffocating for some people

202
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:24,000
they feel too nurtured but but uh we just want we want the best in them and we take the light in in the possibility

203
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,460
of them thriving and being well and and this combination of respect

204
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:35,700
depreciation valuing and wishing people well and wanting to support the Wellness

205
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:43,079
in people um is kind of this constellation that is meta loving kindness

206
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:48,540
and that's a nurturing system so these things can operate together or

207
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:57,119
they can be mutually supportive but what happens when we're challenged uh some challenges uh trigger the

208
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:03,660
reactive system the protective system so strongly that it's the only one that's operating

209
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:09,839
and if it's only the reactive system it's fine if the mountain lion is

210
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:16,859
attacking you but uh it's not fine if it's uh you're going

211
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:23,040
for a job interview and the job interview is in a month and the whole month you're just living kind of biting

212
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:29,359
your fingernails and pacing around your room and kind of activated in some kind of tense way

213
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:34,560
That's not healthy living that kind of reactive mode

214
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:41,040
to to be hurt deeply and to live in the reactive mode that just keeps Us close to the Earth and

215
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:46,920
keeps us spinning in the reactive mode is also not healthy for us

216
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:54,780
so that to live solely in this reactive mode is not healthy so when we're challenged

217
00:38:54,780 --> 00:39:00,119
the important question I'd like to propose is where's the love

218
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:06,180
can there be love here can there be kindness here where does or where does kindness begin

219
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:11,579
where do I find it here and some of that we find in wanting it

220
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:17,460
to be there to want to have love to want to have good will and meta that desire

221
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:23,760
for it is profound it's the beginning of love even if you can't do it in a

222
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,700
conventional way you're beginning it by just wanting it and just appreciating that wanting and

223
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:36,300
relaxing as opposed to being in this transactional mode of wanting and then

224
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:41,760
depending on getting what we want it's wanting and appreciating the Wellspring

225
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:49,140
within in which it comes from and so when we're challenged

226
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:55,079
notice if you're forgetting this other whole system the nurturing system within

227
00:39:55,079 --> 00:40:01,560
and what can you do to tap into it what can you do to let the nurturing system

228
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:07,500
support you to reduce self-care to to find ways in

229
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:14,099
which to settle the reactivity enough or put it aside enough so that the

230
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:19,920
nurturing system has a chance to to emerge as well

231
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:27,359
maybe it's something maybe going for a walk or stepping away from the challenging things spending time with a

232
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:32,400
friend who makes you kind of feel happy so that you're not always kind of caught

233
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:38,700
in the realm of your challenge and and then you could come back to the

234
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:44,640
challenge in this with with this other mode available the nurturing mode the

235
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:52,260
kind mode the Goodwill mode and maybe your ability to engage in the challenge will be very different

236
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:59,060
than if you're only living in the reactive mode so this is a this is a suggestion then

237
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:05,300
that there is kind of a strategic stepping away from our challenges

238
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:11,339
when possible when it's not the mountain lion there and meditation is one of the ways to

239
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:17,579
step away from it so we're not thinking about it chronically if we can but find some way to step away enough so

240
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:23,880
it's not obsessing the mind and it allows something deeper to emerge

241
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:31,560
from the inside some sense of well-being some sense of Peace some sense of calm some sense of Goodwill of kindness

242
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:37,500
look for the kindness and sometimes it's enough to just ask the question

243
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:43,560
what's that kind thing to do here what would be the kind thing right now

244
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:49,560
and inserting that in the middle of the you know swirl of challenges

245
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:55,140
can contribute to there being light you know

246
00:41:55,140 --> 00:42:00,240
appearing in a dark room it can it can create space in a place that's been

247
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:06,559
claustrophobic so um

248
00:42:06,859 --> 00:42:13,020
non-transactional love non-trans transactional meta and Goodwill

249
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:20,160
what do you know about that what do you know about love how is it that your love

250
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:26,640
for others is mixed up with transactional love or mixed up with the reactive system

251
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:34,500
is there a clarification a purification of love that's possible when we quiet the reactive mode down

252
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:39,540
dramatically and now and then keep asking what would

253
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:47,940
be the kind thing here what would be the supportive thing here and finally this mode of coming from the

254
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:54,180
nurturing mode the kind mode is um is one that

255
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:59,520
um wants the best for everyone involved

256
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:04,859
not just for oneself not just for the other for everyone involved

257
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:11,040
and believe it or not even for the people who are our biggest challenge

258
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:18,260
even for people who you might think of as your enemies the Goodwill mode

259
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:24,480
has no boundaries for who deserves and doesn't deserve our

260
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,599
basic Goodwill so thank you and I hope that you take

261
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:36,900
these words and reflect on them and think about them maybe have conversations with people about them and

262
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:44,540
see if you can really kind of discover for yourself in this nurturing mode the loving mode

263
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:49,619
and uh and how it can become a greater resource for you

264
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:54,680
don't let it atrophy thank you
