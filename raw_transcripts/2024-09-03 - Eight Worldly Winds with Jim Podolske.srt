1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:09,358
good evening everyone how's the sound for you okay

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,719
[Applause] good well uh as you can tell Diana's not

3
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,720
here tonight she asked me last week if I would fill in for her

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,720
so

5
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,679
um for those of you who have been around the Buddhist scene for a while you know we

6
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:38,920
have a lot of lists lists of uh various qualities and uh

7
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:45,680
activities and so tonight I wanted to talk about one of the uh lists of eight

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:53,840
called the sometimes called the eight worldly winds or the uh see the

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,920
eight uh concerns or conditions or Vic

10
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:07,840
solitudes so there are eight uh I'll say conditions or energies

11
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,320
or behaviors that um we all engage in we

12
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:21,200
all experience and

13
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,360
they're outlined in this suta by the by the Buddha called

14
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,000
the locati sua it's un

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,720
un a 8 colon 6

16
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,000
so it's a list of eight things that are

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,840
four pairs and these are all

18
00:01:52,920 --> 00:02:00,840
uh energies or conditions or experiences that we all experience

19
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,719
continually throughout our lives whether we're

20
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,120
um just starting out in this practice or whether you've reached the

21
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:19,599
end um they're all going to occur so just to kind of set the stage

22
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:26,440
for that um so that's why it's important to learn

23
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,720
to recognize these and see

24
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:40,879
um under what conditions they arise um and how we relate to them how

25
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,400
are you going to um how are you going to relate to these

26
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,959
things that are going to be you know

27
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:59,400
a what do you call it a ubiquitous part of your experience

28
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:09,920
and I realized I picked this topic based on something that um Tanya Wiser told

29
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:16,360
me and then as I went and I looked at talks in the recent past I realized that

30
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,720
Tanya has given five talks about these last month and Gil gave a whole series

31
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:27,920
of talks a couple weeks ago so if what I say tonight doesn't exactly

32
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:36,319
click with you there's plenty of talks on audiio Dharma about the eight worldly

33
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:47,560
winds so I'll start off by describing them the the first pair are gain and

34
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:56,000
loss so this refers not only to um physical

35
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,720
things things like money resources

36
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:10,239
um you know possessions but also relationships right

37
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:16,759
um our our family our friends

38
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:23,840
co-workers we um gain new family when somebody gets

39
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,880
married or has a child or um something like like that and then we

40
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:38,080
lose people from our family right there's death is uh a part of life so

41
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,280
there's continual gain and loss on the realm

42
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:52,320
of uh relationship uh friends sometimes we gain new friends and other friends um

43
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,479
may move away or you may have um you know

44
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:05,360
some uh uh rupture in in the relationship with a friend and uh things

45
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:14,720
change that way um so gain and loss can be seen all

46
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,080
the way from you know the very Monumental gains and losses like

47
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:27,080
losing a friend or a parent to death two very subtle gains and

48
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:32,199
losses uh as I was thinking about this day I was driving to have lunch with a

49
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:37,759
friend and I think there were four stop lights between my house and the

50
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:44,240
restaurant and at all four of them I hit the light wrong you know I like I got to

51
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:51,160
I got to one just as the left turn light turned red

52
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:58,319
and normally I would have just you know kind of mumbled under my breath or something like that but I thought oh

53
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:05,800
yeah this is loss right you know like I I lost a couple minutes because I have to wait for the whole cycle to go

54
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:12,840
through uh and then one actually one light was was with me so that I felt like I gained a little bit there

55
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,880
so so this gain and loss um

56
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:25,319
experience can occur at many many different levels

57
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:34,520
um and often times it goes on the noticed right you don't notice that

58
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:42,319
um that something is being gained or something's being

59
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,800
lost

60
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:57,039
um but it it can color our experience so that's

61
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:05,800
the first pair to look at is gain and loss the next pair is described as uh Fame

62
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:13,520
and disrepute now probably most you don't use the term disrepute uh I don't but so it could be

63
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,639
Fame and disgrace or fame and

64
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:25,840
insignificance or instead of Fame you might want to use the word status so you

65
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,879
know Fame and insignificance you know who doesn't want want to be the center

66
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:39,479
of attention you know to have the spotlight on them to be um recognized

67
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:44,000
heard um

68
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:55,919
celebrated like right now there's a famous person going by

69
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:03,960
um and then the opposite of fame or status is can be either uh

70
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:09,360
disgrace in which you're still getting attention but it's it's sort of a

71
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,639
negative attention right it's it's attention that you don't really want or

72
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,840
or most people probably don't want um or

73
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,879
insignificance you know not getting paid attention to you know you're kind of out

74
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:31,159
there on the periphery of the of the crowd or in the

75
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:39,240
corner and I imagine we could all uh recognize

76
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:47,480
having experienced Fame and uh disrepute in our lives sometimes

77
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,680
in a major way sometimes in a minor

78
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,600
way I think for for me one of the the times uh that I remember the earliest I can

79
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,120
remember in my life was my senior year in high school the either last or second

80
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,600
to last day of high school we had an awards day you know where you know

81
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:21,120
everybody went into the gymnasium and they had a stage set up and the head of the math department

82
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,680
got up and announced that this year all of the

83
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:32,920
Awards being given in mathematics were were going to one person and it was me

84
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:38,399
and you know I walked up there and I got a prize and I don't know a little certificate or

85
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,519
something and this was many years ago before being a math geek had

86
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:52,160
any you know cache to it at all you know it's just like so I sort of was famous

87
00:09:52,160 --> 00:10:01,160
but but only to a handful of other people that actually saw that as a uh

88
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:09,040
valuable uh prize

89
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,920
um you know but nonetheless um you know there is value to being recognized to

90
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:26,200
being heard to being valued and it can also push us around

91
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:34,839
you know can also influence how we act and talk and um experience our lives and

92
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:39,920
the same with its opposite you know

93
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:50,600
um you know being being disgraced or being uh

94
00:10:52,560 --> 00:11:00,040
marginalized and then the the fourth pair of worldly wins our Pleasure

95
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,360
and Pain and

96
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,160
I don't think that I could even enumerate all of the possible kind of pleasures and pains that you may

97
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:17,959
experience both physical right you know like when I got here this evening I went

98
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:24,360
in the kitchen and I found that there was some dark

99
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:31,240
chocolate and so so that was you know that was pleasurable

100
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,519
um but if I ate the whole bar it probably wouldn't have been so pleasurable right you know it's it's

101
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:44,560
kind of it has its pleasure has its limits and same way with pain you know

102
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:52,000
most of the time we avoid pain right it's it's not something that

103
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,360
um that we want to uh welcome in you know on the other hand if if you

104
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:08,120
practice anything practice sports um you may find that you you need

105
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:14,519
to work hard enough that there that some pain arises or if you've been injured you know I've had a number of

106
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:20,959
experiences where I've had to go through physical therapy and

107
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:28,600
um you know in physical therapy there's I don't think there's any Physical Therapy that you can do that doesn't

108
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:38,120
involve some degree of discomfort or pain it's just you know you have to see the value of experiencing that to

109
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,600
um to decide to go through

110
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:48,600
it so you know these are the the four pairs

111
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:55,760
they're all things that are uh you know prevalent in our

112
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,120
experience all the time so

113
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:09,800
why if we can't avoid them if this practice doesn't lead to the end of these

114
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:16,160
eight uh worldly winds you know why talk about

115
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:23,720
them so um here I'm relying on this this sua

116
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,759
that um tan Jeff translated

117
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,560
and what he what the Buddha talks about in there is the difference

118
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:41,199
between how an uninstructed mind he calls it an

119
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:47,920
ordinary run-of-the-mill person responds when they experience these things and

120
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,920
how a well-instructed person a well-instructed mind responds

121
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:00,000
to these uh eight worldly winds

122
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,639
so I I have to say I'm I'm I think I'm somewhere between these

123
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:14,560
to I'm not an uninstructed mind and I'm not a completely well-instructed mind at

124
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:23,959
this point so I'm I'm sort of here with with all of you um working on

125
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:33,560
this so the the first thing about these uh eight worldly winds is do we

126
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,880
notice when they're operating are we mindful are we

127
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:45,360
clear that you know praise is going on or that

128
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,160
blame is going on

129
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:56,360
um actually I think that's a pair that I missed praise and blame so I think you

130
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,040
you get that or or praise and

131
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:06,920
centure um so

132
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:15,519
in uh uninstructed mind first of all wouldn't recognize that force or that

133
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:21,920
wind or that energy going on and as a result they wouldn't

134
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:29,680
see these three qualities of it which are number one is that it's inconstant

135
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:36,880
it's stressful and it's subject to change

136
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:44,399
so I imagine all of you have noticed that you have a pleasant experience you

137
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:53,040
know you might listen to some piece of music that you love or have a wonderful meal or

138
00:15:53,120 --> 00:16:00,160
um get a great massage and

139
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:09,920
when it's over it's over right you know it's just that that that's it there might be a little bit of lingering to

140
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:16,120
it so two of the qual two other things that can

141
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:25,680
occur uh when the when one of these uh winds is operating are uh hope and

142
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,399
fear so for example when I'll say when

143
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:35,839
um when gain is is

144
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:44,040
operating we hope that it stays as long as possible and we fear that it won't

145
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:49,639
you know so there's there's some hope of trying to hold on to an experience and

146
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:56,160
some fear that it's going to go away now hope and fear on their own

147
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:05,480
aren't intrinsically bad it's good to hope for a better world or fear can help

148
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:15,000
protect us from things but in this case hope and fear can also get in the way of us really

149
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,880
experiencing what's going on you know like if something's Pleasant's going

150
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:27,319
on if we're hoping that it'll just last longer and longer and we're afraid it

151
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:32,480
won't then we're missing the pleasant experience we're

152
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,240
not we're not fully there so

153
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:46,399
um so one of the differentiations between the these two

154
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:56,600
um uh uninstructed and fully instructed Minds is that uh one is going

155
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:02,480
to probably go automatically go to Hope and fear and the other will just go

156
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,520
to um seeing it more clearly you know

157
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:14,799
not um kind of seeing its impermanent nature seeing its stressful nature

158
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:21,200
seeing its um in constant nature and then

159
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,120
just uh if it's Pleasant enjoying it and if it's

160
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,360
painful um acknowledging it recognizing that it's

161
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,919
there and

162
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:46,240
um not getting carried away so the F the first element is then

163
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:53,360
is to be able to be aware when these eight winds or one or more these eight

164
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,520
winds are operating or these eight conditions the next one

165
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:09,600
is for the uninstructed mind the it the mind can remain consumed

166
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:18,960
by the wind that is M maintained sort of stuck in it right you know like if

167
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,960
if if somebody's praised you you know and you just get oh that's great yeah

168
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:31,440
and I wonder if they'll remember to talk also about this thing that I did and that thing I did and just you know the

169
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:39,480
mind can just um latch on try

170
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:49,440
to um try to cling to what can't be clung

171
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:58,600
to whereas for somebody that's uh well instructed

172
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:05,840
uh their mind is not consumed you know they can they can see it but don't get

173
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:13,080
caught in the story of you know what does this mean or how

174
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:19,360
can I how can I make this last longer or how can I push this

175
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,280
away that it just it sees it and it recognizes

176
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:33,280
it and it experiences it uh using one of the words uh Diana uses basically it

177
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:39,679
digests the experience it brings it in and it processes

178
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:46,360
it without getting without getting stuck

179
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:55,200
um now the the third phrase from this suta I had a little diff difficulty

180
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:02,480
with and it's that with a for an uninstructed mind they welcome the

181
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,200
Arisen gain and rebel against the Arisen

182
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:16,520
loss so there can be a way in which the mind grasps on to and clings to what it

183
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:23,080
wants and Rebels against pushes away what it doesn't

184
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,960
want the word that I had trouble with was welcome because in some ways I like

185
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,278
the idea of welcoming things you know

186
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,480
so in my own mind I I realize well I don't I don't think that the translation

187
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:46,240
really meant welcome like be open and accepting but more welcoming

188
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:53,039
like taking in uncritically something that you really

189
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:59,120
like so the image that came to me was um

190
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,480
being welcomed by a Carnival Barker now some of some of you may have

191
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:11,799
never been to a carnival I realize that's kind of an old style form of uh entertainment but they

192
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:19,159
have these games where it's like the ring toss and the coin toss and things like that where there's there's a barker

193
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:25,919
out in front that's always trying to get you to come and you know come on and you know try out this this

194
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:32,080
game and they're always a con they're always was you know they're they're the things that you'll never be able won't

195
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:40,799
ever actually work but um they rely on this sense of uh welcoming people to

196
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:47,200
their Booth so that's that was the image that came to me on that

197
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,799
one um whereas the instruct the

198
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:58,559
well-instructed mind doesn't welcome the Arisen gain or

199
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:05,120
the Arisen praise or the Arisen pleasure um nor does it rebel

200
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,520
against uh the

201
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:17,600
opposite so again in in reading this it it can

202
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:24,320
sound a little bit passive like really the practice is just to

203
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:30,760
notice you know just to not be reactive to just

204
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:36,720
notice um to recognize what's going on

205
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,200
and I don't think that's what this is talking about I

206
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:50,039
think it is not only allowable but I think also

207
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:56,360
necessary when things arise that you do respond to

208
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,679
them what what's important though is that there's

209
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:09,080
some pause there's some break between seeing what's going

210
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:14,360
on and then responding in a way with as

211
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:20,960
much wisdom and compassion as you can find

212
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:27,880
so so these eight worldly winds can be res can be responded to either in a sort

213
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:34,880
of a immediate kind of knee-jerk reactive way or you can respond to them

214
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:41,880
in a more thoughtful wise and compassionate

215
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:48,480
way so that's uh to me the difference between

216
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,080
uh the U uninstructed and the well-instructed

217
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:59,320
mind in terms of working with these winds and

218
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:08,440
the final result you know in in seeing them in not getting the

219
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:16,320
Mind caught in them in not kind of pushing and pulling trying

220
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:22,399
to get the ones you like and not not get the ones you don't like is that for an

221
00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:30,840
ill- instructed mind doesn't lead to the experience of

222
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:38,840
being released from suffering that it is possible if you're not

223
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:44,799
recognizing what's going on and developing some

224
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:52,720
skillful um some skill at recognizing and not getting caught by them then you can be

225
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:59,919
go through life just continually reacting to these eight uh

226
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:07,080
forces in a way that um it's sort of a NeverEnding

227
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:12,200
spiral of suffering the image that that came for

228
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:18,720
me on that was um where I grew up in in the

229
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:26,039
midwest there's we'd often drive on dirt roads and if it was raining and there

230
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:31,159
was a a rut or something you could the car could get in a position where the

231
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:36,919
drive wheel would have nothing underneath it so it would just keep turning and turning and turning and the

232
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:42,039
car wouldn't go anywhere and so you had to do something right you had to get out and you know

233
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:49,520
like rock the car or um maybe get a tow truck or some you know something to push

234
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:55,600
um you need to do something to get out of that rut and

235
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:03,039
so uh I think this practice this sta practice is really

236
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:09,799
uh number one helping us to see when we're stuck when the wheels are

237
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:18,120
spinning and also find the the wisdom and compassion to get

238
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:23,440
unstuck and so then for a well-instructed

239
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:29,640
mind and again I'm reading from this text you're released from s Sorrows

240
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:37,720
Lamentations pains distresses despairs suffering and

241
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:43,320
stress so that's pretty good right

242
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,080
um so

243
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:58,840
that's I I suspect that's what all of us want um is

244
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:08,360
not to keep going back to the same um stuck place that we've been in the

245
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:15,399
past and not get blown around by these eight winds these eight winds know kind

246
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:22,919
of pushing us in one way than another um but to be able to see them

247
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:28,960
clearly and uh

248
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:38,880
not get stuck there's a at the very end of this there there's this wonderful phrase as it talks about this it

249
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:49,080
says it it talks about gain and loss status and gra disgrace censure and

250
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:54,360
praise Pleasure and Pain these conditions among human beings

251
00:28:54,360 --> 00:29:02,720
are in constant impermanent subject to change knowing this mindful the

252
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:11,360
intelligent person Ponders these changing conditions desirable things don't charm

253
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,720
the Mind undesirable ones bring no

254
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:23,320
resistance his welcoming and rebelling are scattered gone to their end do not

255
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,320
exist

256
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:34,399
so I like this particular phrase about desirable things don't charm the

257
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:41,919
mind that doesn't mean that we reject desirable things but we're not under

258
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:47,880
their spell we're not Charmed

259
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:56,480
um I suspect that all that probably all of us at one time or another have been

260
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,640
Charmed by something Charmed by another person you know

261
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:06,679
Charmed by the latest gadget or you know some

262
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:14,519
wonderful car or you know you know something some TV show some movie

263
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:19,519
some celebrity

264
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:26,720
and you know at some point the spell breaks right you know

265
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:33,919
that that Charming person you know kind of cheated us out

266
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:42,919
of our money or you know did something and so part of the practice is

267
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:49,720
about um seeing through this

268
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:58,919
there's two terms that I remember Gil using years ago one is um

269
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:04,480
what was it that sometimes when people first come

270
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:10,440
to the practice you can be enchanted with the practice and he said if you're Enchanted

271
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:16,399
it's important to become disenchanted and if you're illusioned by

272
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:23,039
the practice it's important to become disillusioned

273
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:28,639
so some of these things like charm and enchantment

274
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:35,600
and illusion may seem

275
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:43,159
uh attractive But ultimately they need to be seen

276
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:50,159
through and learn then the practice can lead to

277
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:58,320
seeing how things are more clearly so that you don't get caught

278
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:08,679
the other line in here about uh undesirable ones bring no

279
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:15,120
resistance and and this I think it for me is a little bit harder

280
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:22,159
because you know how do you how do you not

281
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:28,760
resist um loss

282
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:37,559
or [Applause] um how do you not resist loss or um

283
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:42,759
disgrace or blame or

284
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:55,039
pain and I think that that there maybe the the important thing

285
00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:00,919
is that with all actually with all of these State wins

286
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:08,279
is seeing them as not personal seeing them as not

287
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:14,679
personal not permanent and not perfect you know that

288
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:22,519
they're they're impersonal forces and again that doesn't it doesn't

289
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:28,399
mean no resistance means passivity

290
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:33,519
it's more no resistance

291
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:41,000
means no ignorance that they're going on you can still act but you're not acting

292
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:49,760
out of pretending as though they don't exist or or through aversion or hatred you're

293
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:58,320
you're seeing that that they're going on but you can respond to them

294
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:04,840
from a place of uh wisdom and

295
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:16,800
compassion so that's um my take on on the eight worldly winds

296
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,560
and um I thank you all for coming tonight and I'm willing to take any

297
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:29,720
questions or comments or um objections

298
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:51,760
here if you take

299
00:34:52,119 --> 00:35:00,320
that yeah I was um can you hear me is it yeah sounds good um I was at Tanya's uh

300
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:07,320
uh work on on these and um you know the review is is great I'm things I thought

301
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:13,839
about um today I hadn't really thought about before so thank you for that um

302
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:20,839
The Middle Way comes to my mind though about trying to stay in that um that

303
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:27,320
observation mode and trying to stay in the middle way you know when thinking about these things that are happening

304
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:34,520
mhm uh you know stay out of the stay out of the the r and be careful on the the high

305
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:40,839
the high road you know when when these things we we're experiencing these things so

306
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:47,720
um that's kind of the um I think strategy that I've trying to employ

307
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:53,079
regarding those things and uh sometimes successfully sometimes

308
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:58,839
not so uh it's it's a work in progress isn't it

309
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:06,280
yeah yeah isn't it it's it's uh and the the the the problem is when

310
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,960
you're IM mesed in it IM mesed in the the storm so to speak those skillful

311
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:19,839
things you talked about aren't as you can't you know use them as as like you

312
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:26,319
like you could if you're if you're more balanced so I I I think it's

313
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:31,400
um um and it's hard to recognize when when that's happening you know when

314
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:37,960
you're mesed in a in a crisis we'll call it um I think that's the challenge is to

315
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:44,079
to recognize and then start digging your way out of it rather than making it worse I know Gil always says don't make

316
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:50,480
it worse uh so um yeah there's there's a there's a lot of resources out there

317
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,640
that that I'm glad I have but I wish I was better at uh you know picking the

318
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:02,800
right one at the right time so well thank you so when something like

319
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:09,480
that happens um do you review it later and think

320
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:15,839
about well what could I have done differently yeah about 10 minutes into your talk I started reviewing something

321
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:23,200
that happened happened today so very very timely thank you yeah well what

322
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,560
what can happen over time is you know first you you recognize like a day later

323
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:35,560
that yeah you could have done something different and then you know maybe only an hour later and and uh you know

324
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:41,839
eventually it's like you can recognize it in real time but

325
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:50,280
um thanks yeah thank

326
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:02,440
you this anyone else uh have a

327
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:08,119
question um

328
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,319
okay let you get

329
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,000
it thank you for this opportunity to be here

330
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,720
um I it was just uh uh

331
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:35,000
another comment uh maybe somewhat uh similar to your observation while

332
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:42,079
talking about pleasure versus pain and

333
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:49,240
uh um how one can an instructed mind versus

334
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:56,160
an uninstructed mind uh can respond uh wherein

335
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:02,640
uh I I think I uh kind of agree with you

336
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,920
that um maybe the interpretation or how the

337
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,680
it was presented about uh an uninstructed mind

338
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:21,000
is uh more uh equanimous or more

339
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:28,720
uh uh quiet about um uh being uh

340
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:36,520
uh pleasured versus being uh uh not

341
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:41,640
happy whereas uh an uninspected mind is

342
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:49,359
said to be uh elated versus uh unhappy in the

343
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:56,400
other situation otherwise um I I I kind of feel that

344
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,520
it's you I just wanted to share that comment

345
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:10,560
that that's something that uh um it's okay to be balanced and maybe

346
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:16,319
that's what is the interpretation that you are also saying

347
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:22,839
that and uh whether happy or happy whether the

348
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:28,440
situation is happy or not so happy and versus uh

349
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:34,040
an uninstructed mind where it is it can be like much worse

350
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:42,040
sinusoidal if I can use a mathematical expression yeah for that so

351
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:52,160
which can come across as less balanced um yeah it's like to keep

352
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:59,240
a equanimous temperament in either

353
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:11,560
yeah well that's that's a an important point but I think a well-instructed

354
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:19,440
mind can experience you know highs and lows you know they can enjoy the roller

355
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:27,040
coaster of life it's just that they don't identify with the

356
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:34,560
RO roller coaster you know it's like you know cuz I I don't think that the practice

357
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:42,720
leads to just being flatlined you know what I mean that

358
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:49,119
Equanimity doesn't mean that you don't you don't experience Joys and Sorrows

359
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:55,920
but you don't get caught by them and that that's I think

360
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:01,680
that's yeah thank

361
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:17,200
you all right well thank you all um and um Diana should be back next

362
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,200
Monday
