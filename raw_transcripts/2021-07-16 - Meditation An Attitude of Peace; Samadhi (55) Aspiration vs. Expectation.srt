00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:14,639
planet earth good wishes to you so

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:21,359
so we continue today our fifth day in the series of exploring

4
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,840
supportive conditions for somebody for concentration for calming

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,880
settling unifying the mind heart

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,320
and um just to briefly remind us

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,480
what we have worked with and all these conditions together are

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:53,600
really support each other it's not just one versus another all of them together

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,559
the fabric it's as if samad is a fabric and and it's made of

10
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,039
all these threads all these threads

11
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,920
relinquishing what is not helpful and on the other side of the coin

12
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:20,560
noticing there is joy in the present moment this moment is enough there is beauty

13
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,320
wonder awe and this the simplicity of this moment

14
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:33,520
and then there is relaxing the body a relaxed body so that it can support a

15
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,560
relaxed mind and that is only possible it becomes a

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,040
wise effort if on the other hand we have atapi gentle persistence

17
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:52,479
coming back over and over again as well as what we discussed vitaka and

18
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:59,280
vichara initial application sustained application connecting with the breath serving the

19
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,799
breath sir surfer enjoying surfing the entirety

20
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,200
of the breath today we could have gone on more and

21
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:18,319
more and yet today what we will add here is our attitude our

22
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,920
intention our interest because the way we approach

23
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:31,760
this practice makes a difference is the mind tight is the mind curious and interested

24
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:38,560
to learn no matter what does the mind have zest does the mind

25
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,120
have a wanting i want the mind to settle does it want a state does it want an

26
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,239
experience so what is the attitude is is the heart

27
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:57,840
giving itself is it dedicating as as if it's honoring as if it's

28
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,280
putting itself on the altar um as if it's a sacred

29
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,920
act this practice are these dimensions of beauty and sacredness in the practice

30
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:16,720
or do we have a work orientation we bring the mind that we have in daily

31
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:23,760
life the achievement the achievement orientation do we bring that what is the attitude what is the

32
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,599
container so becoming tuned to that again without judgment if you notice

33
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:37,280
oh yeah i really want to state i really want to get concentrated and have uh absorption

34
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,640

35
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,400
okay yeah there it is so sweetheart yeah i know that brings that brings tightness that brings

36
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:55,280
pain it practice becomes a source of suffering so just know just notice

37
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:03,120

42
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,840
of taking refuge in this moment

43
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,880
taking refuge

44
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,840

trusting the goodness of our intention

49
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:48,479
connecting to something above and beyond our selves

50
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
trusting

51
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,240
this expansiveness spaciousness of this goodness

52
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:12,000
that we are a part of whether or not we see it we have

53
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,440
access to it trusting trusting it and relaxing

54
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:27,120
into it trusting the stream

55
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,840
that will carry us

56
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:48,080
letting the body relax soften

57
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:56,560
as if you're floating floating in a gentle gently

58
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:05,919
loving stream of goodness if your body is tight it's harder

59
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:17,840
imagine yourself floating on top of the water with ease

60
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:45,840
stream of the dharma the goodness you're a partner

61
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,839
turning away for what is not helpful

62
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:48,000
recognizing the joy the delight of coming back connecting with the breath

63
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:59,360
staying on the breath as if you were surfing

64
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,760
this beautiful wave of the breath this gift of the breath

65
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:12,640
for as long as possible before dropping off

66
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,080
and connecting catching the next wave

67
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:27,279
with interest with reverence

68
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:37,839
not with expectation or tightness

69
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:51,839
but with grace

70
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:05,680
let the body be soft and relaxed letting go

71
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:15,120
of any tension

72
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,800
with each breath

73
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:29,839
calming soothing subtly

74
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:54,480
checking in now and then is the body relaxed

75
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:05,919
ah is the mind relinquishing turning away

76
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:13,440
from what's not helpful in this moment recognizing the simplicity

77
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,200
the joyful delicious simplicity

78
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,799
of what's already here

79
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:31,919
connecting with the breath in the lower abdomen if the mind is busy

80
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:39,840
today the lower abdomen is most settling

81
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:47,679
observing the breath as many breaths

82
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,679
as available enjoying surfing

83
00:19:53,679 --> 00:20:07,840
the joy of surfing the breath

84
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:57,840

85
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,919

102
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,840
thank you for your practice

103
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:31,279
so greetings greetings international sangha friends around the

104
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:38,640
world this green blue planet of ours

105
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:46,399
so for this week we have been exploring supportive conditions for

106
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:54,159
cultivating samadhi also translated often translated as

107
00:31:54,159 --> 00:32:01,360
concentration but perhaps more preferably translated as calm

108
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,919
unification of the mind calm abiding

109
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:16,960
etc so that there is less of a sense of tightness in the word that there might

110
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:24,000
be associations for some people with concentration and

111
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:31,440
today we combine them all together and brought in the container the

112
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,600
container that holds them all which is our attitude intention

113
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:45,200
so again we had started with relinquishing what is not helpful

114
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:51,840
and on the other side of the coin realizing oh yes there's beauty there is grace there is

115
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:57,679
delight joy in the simplicity of the pleasant present moment they work together

116
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:03,600
they support each other these two supporting conditions and then the

117
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:09,840
other couple of supporting conditions we talked about one was relaxing the body

118
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,880
relaxing the body so the mind can relax

119
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:22,279
and then if the body is just relaxed well maybe maybe the attitude becomes a little too

120
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:28,640
relaxed but then on the other side of the coin with a relaxed body we have

121
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:34,240
coming back again and again gently atopi coming back perseverance gentle

122
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,440
perseverance and together vitaka and vichara

123
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:46,720
connecting connecting and sustaining connecting and sustaining vitaka

124
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:52,480
containing initial application which are sustaining so

125
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,240
all of these four and and you see two and two the the the first two are kind of a pair the

126
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:05,039
second two are kind of a pair and then what holds all of these is is

127
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:13,520
our attitude our intention the mind that is meditating and attitude intention is so important

128
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:19,919
um that actually i have been weaving it through all of these

129
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:28,240
teachings all of these supporting factors our attitude is not separate from them it is in the way we

130
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:35,118
show up in the way we approach each of these factors it's not separate and yet

131
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:45,358
it is important to name it today as the container that holds it all holds our practice holds our cultivation

132
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:54,720
so a few notes on on attitude on intention

133
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:03,680
so otagenia um a burmese monk

134
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:10,960
i've practiced with he um likes to he has an an interesting way of

135
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,800
putting attitude and he often says what is the quality of

136
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:24,079
the mind what is the mind he says what is the mind that is meditating is it a

137
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:31,760
greedy mind is is it a mind that has

138
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:39,440
aversion and ill will in it is it a confused mind so is it a mind that are is infused with the three poisonous

139
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,440
roots already or is it the mind that is infused with their opposite

140
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:52,560
with ah relinquishment the ease generosity is it a mind that is infused

141
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:58,640
with kindness good will is it the mind that is infused with

142
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,599
wisdom with trust with faith

143
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,760
so knowing what is the mind that is practicing what is the mind that's

144
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:17,920
meditating is it the mind that wants okay all right i want to get concentrated i want this i want that

145
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:24,480
what is the quality of the mind and at first if you're beginning in our practice

146
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,680
sometimes it is hard at the beginning to notice the quality

147
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:36,240
of the mind because we might be a fish swimming in water it might be hard

148
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:42,720
to know what if the if the water has dye in it has a little bit of color in

149
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:49,200
it we may not notice but just gently keep noticing what is the attitude in the mind what is the

150
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:56,160
attitude in the mind and i tell you especially with the practice of samadhi

151
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,520
practice of samatta leading to the state of samadhi

152
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:08,880
i've seen so many practitioners get exceedingly tight

153
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:16,880
exceedingly tight and unfriendly and um and you know the sense that

154
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:24,240
okay you know for say that i'd admit in a meditation hall and practicing under retreat

155
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:31,520
they become so attached without seeing it they become so contracted attached to the quiet to

156
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:39,200
the connecting to the breath to this to cultivating this that become they become really brittle the mind becomes really brittle

157
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:46,240
and irritable every sound every door that closes every

158
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:52,800
noise outside every breath next door is like oh make it stop quiet quiet i'm trying to develop

159
00:37:52,800 --> 00:38:01,440
concentration it's ouch ouch ouch notice so if that arises for you it's okay just realize

160
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:08,400
that the practice is becoming their source of suffering because of the attitude in the mind it's

161
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:14,720
okay it's okay is the mind does the mind have generosity and kindness

162
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:20,480
or or grasping craving and aversion just notice what is the

163
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:26,079
mind so that is one question you can drop in

164
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:31,760
now and then and become attuned to it become attuned to it in a very friendly

165
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:37,920
gentle way because again it's the water that we swim in in our practice

166
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:44,320
and similarly the sense of intentionality is what is

167
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:50,000
the intention is it is the intention me me me i want

168
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,240
this me me me you know what is the intent you get to know it is it an intention of service are you

169
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:02,240
giving your heart to this practice without expectation

170
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:10,320
there is it's wonderful to have aspirations but not expectations so

171
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,520
are they different an aspiration is a beautiful intention

172
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:21,760
to have an aspiration an intention a design an intention you use the word aspiration

173
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:30,240
for waking up for service for for generosity for kindness

174
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:37,440
so as an aspiration it lifts us up it supports us

175
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,800
in our path whereas expectation i expect to wake up i expect

176
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:49,440
to become more generous you see it's much tighter this expectation tightens us

177
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:55,200
it makes us smaller it becomes about me me me i expect

178
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,400
whereas ah aspiration aspiration

179
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:07,200
as if we're putting ourselves we're putting our our precious minutes precious moments on the altar

180
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:14,400
of humanity together it connects us to to something above and beyond ourselves

181
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:21,040
that we are a part of we are a part of it expands us

182
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,839
it expands us

183
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:33,200
so attitude

184
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,800
intention another thing i wanted to bring here which is

185
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:44,720
important is an attitude of

186
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:51,440
interest and curiosity interest and curiosity

187
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:58,720
so whatever happens even if your mind is distracted

188
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:05,119
if things are coming up if it's sleepy as long as there is interest curiosity there is zest oh this

189
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:12,560
is interesting ah this just like a nick just like a scientist of your own mind

190
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:18,560
there is no failed experiment because you always learned as long as you have that

191
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:26,480
attitude as long as the attitude is one of open openness curiosity learning

192
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:33,280
interest chanda zest this interest in practice instead of okay

193
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:39,359
all right it's all right i got it sit down it's my 30 minutes all right okay i

194
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:46,000
gotta do this just just as i brush my teeth and yeah i'm supposed to meditate because i read

195
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:53,920
in whatever news articles but it's good for me oh don't don't if if you're

196
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,119
showing up like a soldier like every day it feels like it's

197
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:04,480
drudgery stop practicing for a week just just don't until you

198
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:11,280
love it until you you miss it until like oh yes even actually for longer until you

199
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:17,599
really feel the desire the love the the curiosity interest

200
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:24,560
so do it with love do it because of love not because i have to that's the

201
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:31,760
perfect way to to kill aspiration

202
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,160

203
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:43,440
