1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,520
okay folks so uh so welcome nice to

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:14,200
um see your names places

3
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:22,480
um yeah let's uh let's practice together

4
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:39,360
just um remember I remembered um yoga teacher saying something

5
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,079
like how you get into the posture is uh as important

6
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:51,038
as where you get to or something and

7
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:58,399
uh that can refer to literally the posture of your body but also how you

8
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:07,400
take a kind of inner Dharma posture posture of the heart and just

9
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:15,240
um get into that posture

10
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,000
carefully you sense all the different parameters of your being

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,600
being maybe subtly shifting as we come into

12
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,600
Stillness

13
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:13,400
not in a rush to put your heart

14
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,400
into some particular

15
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,120
posture your attention into some particular shape

16
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,400
just finding your

17
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,840
place

18
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,760
e e

19
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:08,260
and just sensing if there's uh anything that uh [Music]

20
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:15,040
needs the blessing of uh awareness

21
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:21,560
patience in order for you to be

22
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:29,199
here to be

23
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,759
available for your

24

breathing e

25
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:53,280
and just checking what image you have of your own body the way that

26
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,560
image gets refreshed often

27
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:23,360
to the extent that there's uh self-consciousness that um associated

28
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,520
with any part of your body

29
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,560
just relax

30
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:08,879
to the extent that there's anything Your Body Sensations that um

31
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,720
hurt

for e

36
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,640
feels uh irresponsible to stop

37
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,040
clinging even for a few moments

38
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:18,920
but uh whatever alarm Bells go off that make

39
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:26,959
that feel unsafe just breathe into that

40
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:37,279
and breathe knowing the beginning and ending

41
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:44,959
of your inhale beginning and ending of your

of seeking some small small scrap of

51
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:20,199
peas but the uh the budha said uh peace

52
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:29,600

[Music]

86
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,120
for for

87
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:32,760
okay so um question from

88
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:42,880
uh the uh chat line whatever that thing is um so uh person wrote um can you give

89
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:48,200
some guidance on etiquette for approaching meditation teachers like is

90
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:53,559
there anything that really annoys you about people who sit with you and engage

91
00:29:53,559 --> 00:30:00,240
with your Reflections way people approach you or not it's Etc conversely is there

92
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,559
anything that makes you really happy about the way people approach and engage with

93
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:12,080
you um I like this anonymous question portal

94
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:17,279
you people just say things and um that's

95
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:22,799
good so the first um the first thing that I thought of

96
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:29,200
when I saw that was Michael Scott from the office

97
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,559
and um kind of if you're unfamiliar sort of

98
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:39,600
very loving depiction of delusion and

99
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:47,120
self-absorption but loving for sure and um I there's some clip I don't

100
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,440
know what it's in the context of or whatever but it's Michael Scott at his

101
00:30:52,440 --> 00:31:01,039
desk you know do I and says do I need to be likeed absolutely not I like to be

102
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:07,840
liked I enjoy being liked I have to be liked but it's not like this compulsive

103
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:15,639
need to be liked like my need to be praised so you got to find the clip

104
00:31:15,639 --> 00:31:22,320
that's very good and um that's just the first thing I thought

105
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:29,559
of that's not what I model my life around but I suppose the question is like what

106
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:36,240
do What do teachers want from students and

107
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:44,919
uh I'm not totally sure but but what actually came to mind was almost

108
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:55,200
nothing but not nothing so teaching is um is merely a

109
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,840
kind of aspect of practice one takes care with

110
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:06,200
it and anyone who thinks they're a

111
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:13,600
teacher it's not a teacher and teaching is it's partially

112
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:22,480
just a kind of practice of of service you know and the currency is compassion

113
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:28,480
sympathetic Joy uh

114
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:36,159
once um Ain suito was talking about the the Buddha the the Buddha's decision to

115
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:42,559
teach for 45 years instead of didn't need to do that didn't need to pad the

116
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:50,200
ego make money but just moved by

117
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:56,799
care and uh remember uh John being quite you know

118
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:04,720
getting emotional just reflecting on that uh shinzen Yang said uh this about

119
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,639
teaching said when you've had an exceptional meal you leave a nice

120
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:18,559
tip teaching is um is a devotional practice you know it's kind of an

121
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:25,159
expression of the uh of love for the for the lineage for the

122
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:31,679
dhma and giving a talk giving a Dharma talk is like writing a love letter to

123
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:39,360
many people at the same time and you just kind of hope someone reads

124
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:48,399
it mostly um I feel like it's a teacher's job to be highly flexible

125
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:54,799
meet however the student manifests meet however the student expresses themselves

126
00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:00,679
in other words no code of adquate really come as you

127
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:07,520
are and the flexibility is about

128
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:13,679
giving the student a kind of unpressured space to see their

129
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:20,240
mind and so much gets um stirred in relationships with teachers

130
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:27,320
and teacher plays many roles and represents

131
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:32,480
many things and psychotherapeutic models of

132
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:40,480
transference are not always on point but often somewhat relevant um you know a

133
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:47,118
relationship forms even if one has very little or no contact with somebody with

134
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:55,720
a teacher something happens and so um and if one does have

135
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:01,079
more contact UM then that's that's evocative

136
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:08,599
terrain and there's our own you know I know from my own history with teachers

137
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:14,680
almost none of whom I had much direct contact you know so when I say my

138
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:21,359
teachers I was not like you know nurtured all along the way with a lot of

139
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:28,320
individual attention or something like that it was not like that it was just practicing with people

140
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,880
um and so there's our own historical material the ways that

141
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:42,800
teachers function as a screen onto which our um deep conditioning early

142
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,920
relationships are dramatized the shadow cast by those

143
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:53,760
Dynamics and in you know in the classical Freudian sense like um Freud

144
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:02,680
said something like there is there is no love that does not reap produce infantile

145
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:09,599
stereotypes you know and um teachers can

146
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:16,000
disappear behind the veil of projection they become just an object in the world

147
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,400
of the student and sometimes a

148
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:29,560
compliment is more about the person offering it than the person to whom it's

149
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:37,240
directed The the emptier a teacher gets the easier it is to see the

150
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:43,960
movement of one's own mind you there there's been times when I'm you know sitting

151
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:49,119
Retreat and um and the teacher is just

152
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:56,359
like I don't know all I perceive are the movements of my mind whatever is evoked

153
00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:04,319
in the field you know but um it's not merely about the

154
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:12,520
student it's a relationship this is more modern kind of um understanding

155
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:17,839
of therapeutic relationships in this context in in the course of therapy but

156
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:23,680
may be relevant for Dharma relationships too so this is um Drew Western and Glen

157
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:29,520
Glen gabard um they write uh transference is not simply a def defense

158
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:36,720
or displacement of libidinal energy onto the therapist as Freud

159
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:43,920
proposed it is not simply the activation of an old representation lying in weight

160
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:50,280
indeed transference is not really about transfer at all it is about the continual

161
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:58,960
construction and reconstruction of thoughts feelings wishes fears patterns of relating and

162
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:05,960
ways of regulating affect in the context of a new relationship

163
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:13,039
experiences that can only be understood in the context of old

164
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:23,359
ones now those Dynamics because it's um those

165
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:29,960
Dynamics can be a kind of vehicle for healing we can

166
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:35,920
perceive our minds our needs longing in with more and more

167
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:44,000
clarity in the context of a of a relationship and in that process

168
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,800
sometimes idealization um is is a maybe a phase

169
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:55,280
but it's not the last word and spiritual maturity is the

170
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,960
accurate perception of self and other the Toleration of

171
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:10,200
ambivalence the integration of the you know the the the coexistence of strength

172
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:17,040
and flaw in self and other student and

173
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:25,319
teacher it is um the teacher's job I feel to offer

174
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:32,920
something without strings ATT Ted in the sense that

175
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:42,800
um the teaching Dharma teaching is an offering that does not establish

176
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:47,559
debt does not establish

177
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:57,960
debt I I don't wish to burden you with uh implicit demands of how um to be

178
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:07,200
viewed or treated that's just kind of static for your mind to contend

179
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:12,359
with and I want to do whatever I can

180
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:18,319
that's create kind of open space for your

181
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:26,880
mind um so what I believe teachers want from

182
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:34,599
students probably you know the simplest way to

183
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:39,280
put it is uh

184
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:46,400
sincerity and that's a word I I first think I heard that when I was sitting

185
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:54,400
Retreats with um with Rodney Smith and um Rodney said that that

186
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:00,160
sincerity is the manifestation of the heart when it is freed from the

187
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:06,599
authority of self sincerity is the manifestation of the heart when it's freed from the

188
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:13,640
authority of self uh teachers do

189
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:19,359
not uh uh want to relate ego to

190
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:24,720
Ego and sincerity is

191
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:32,200
the I don't know it's a certain kind of fluidity and a willingness to

192
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:37,440
examine um what um what Agnes callard calls like

193
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:43,079
loadbearing questions the answers to which support

194
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:48,640
one's life to be willing to examine loadbearing

195
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:56,280
questions that's sincerity certain kind of willingness

196
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:01,520
not to know that I associate with sincerity it's really it's stepping out

197
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:08,319
of the bureaucracy of ego TR

198
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:16,000
said and when I'm in uh kind of amidst sincerity in a in a

199
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,280
sa the sense of self Fades very

200
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:29,119
dramatically and I can be as silent teaching as um as in my own

201
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:36,400
practice um but when there isn't there and that's why I'm careful what context

202
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:42,520
in which I I teach um when that isn't there when there isn't

203
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:50,319
sincerity some modum of sincerity myelf congeals in a ferocious

204
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:55,760
way and I feel kind of ashamed of what I care

205
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,880
about you know you only talk about love with

206
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,960
certain people

207
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,880
and there's a distinction that's become important uh to

208
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:18,880
me um that I I sometimes say like the need

209
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,400
need to be loved is distinct from the wish to be

210
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:30,839
understood and the need to be loved is a wasp

211
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:36,559
n no no praise is sufficient for the ego

212
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:46,359
it tolerates no goodness outside itself insatiable live by the ego die by the

213
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:53,960
ego and that's no way to live that has faded

214
00:43:53,960 --> 00:44:00,960
dramatically but the wish to be understood is the

215
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:08,920
sense of like hearts meeting in the Dharma and my sensitivity to that over

216
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:16,480
the I don't know 15 plus years of teaching um that's

217
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:23,880
only grown and I'm most um touched when

218
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:32,640
people are tracking my heart closely listening very

219
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:39,640
carefully and relate to me not in my role as

220
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:47,040
teacher but we we meet in the open space of of the

221
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:53,800
dhma and I'm touched when my goodness is not

222
00:44:53,800 --> 00:45:01,559
elevated as some special possession but reminds you of your own

223
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:08,359
goodness a teacher doesn't want to be

224
00:45:08,359 --> 00:45:14,599
loved but to uh

225
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:18,640
dwell in what we both

226
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,000
love offer this for your consideration

227
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:35,160
and um yeah see you uh be back next week

228
