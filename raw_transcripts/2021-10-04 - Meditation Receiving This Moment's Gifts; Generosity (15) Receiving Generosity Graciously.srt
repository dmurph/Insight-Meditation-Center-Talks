76
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,839
it's a gift to teach us something to point something out and if only we

77
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:25,560

besides the breath

99
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,840
a chair or cushion that's supporting us

100
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,919
a roof over our head likely some food that we have eaten that's

101
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,360

the works of uncountably many people who have contributed

105
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,640
to our well-being to support us in this moment we are receiving so much in this

106
00:26:52,640 --> 00:27:01,320
moment connected through this web of humanity

107
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,240
not to be overwhelmed

108
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,799

114
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:11,960
to have kindness generosity

115
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:20,480
in our attitude towards ourselves it's okay it's okay it's okay letting go

116
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:27,240
letting go of any judgment relinquishing releasing any judgment

117
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:32,720
and trusting that there is goodness generated

118
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:43,120
from our coming together showing up showing up and practicing that there's goodness

131
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,640
so so friends

132
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:19,679
you might have already guessed the topic for our exploration

133
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:25,919
for this week i'll give you some cues we'll make this a little interactive even though it's

134
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:31,360
kind of awkward right i don't see you or not in the same room i'm actually on zoom

135
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:36,559
i'm not at imc for those who already know this is virtual background

136
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:41,480
this audio is going through zoom etc

137
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:50,159
so we'll try to make it all interactive so so you might have already guessed

138
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,120
perhaps from the theme

139
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,919
of the guided meditation i'll say a few more the theme for this week

140
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,960
the theme for this week is one that

141
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,960
the buddha taught first and foremost and emphasized

142
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,320
especially especially for for us lay people

143
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:24,640
emphasized and it's a practice that he taught first

144
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:31,039
before he taught sila before he taught ethics so

145
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:37,200
the found this topic which i'm not naming yet just see if you can guess it

146
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:44,159
um this it's so important that he taught this first and when it

147
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,440
was firmly established when the mind when the heart really had this

148
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,480
down only then did he uh teach

149
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:00,399
uh ethics and only then after that did he teach what's called

150
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:06,360
bhavana cultivation of the mind meditation

151
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:12,398
above on a cultivation meditation cultivation of the mind and heart so

152
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:19,280
this comes first in the trilogy before sila ethical teachings

153
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:26,399
and before bhavana meditation and

154
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:34,039
any guesses i'll wait in chat for a moment you probably already have it

155
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:41,358
and um also i'll say one thing that for me

156
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:48,638
in my own practice when i was younger i was primarily interested in meditation

157
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:54,638
it's bhavana yes and as as i've become older and and

158
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:00,000
hopefully a little wiser the importance of these other two

159
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,160
factors of course of course silas so important of course ethical conduct and

160
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:11,920
this other factor that i'm not naming yet has become even more important in my

161
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:18,560
practice somebody guessed it yes generosity donna exactly

162
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:24,160
dhana sila bhavana dhana silabao and adana

163
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:29,280
generosity i realized that in my own practice in my own

164
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:37,520
and when i say practice it's not just an outward practice of giving it's so much more than that it is so

165
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:45,920
much more than that and i think when i was younger i was mistaking generosity as as just the outward act of giving yes

166
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:52,960
it is that too of course it is that but it is so much more than that it's

167
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,800
it's really an internal practice it's really a practice

168
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:05,440
of cultivating generosity towards ourselves towards others towards our

169
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:12,880
mind towards our bodies towards our life generosity of attitude generosity in in

170
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:19,760
the way we treat others the way we give the way we receive it's it's such an

171
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:26,480
important practice um and as i was saying just a little early as

172
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,920
i've become a little older i re and and as practice becomes

173
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:38,240
life as as you know after a while many of you already know you have been

174
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:44,320
practicing for a long time life becomes practice practice becomes

175
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:49,920
life so your practice is not just something that you do on the cushion

176
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,760
in the morning or in the evening or sometime and then you go and live your life it doesn't work that way maybe at

177
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:02,480
the beginning it felt like oh yes i'm meditating and then after a while your life becomes your

178
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:08,000
practice your life becomes your practice the way you live your life the way you

179
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:15,680
show up the way you treat yourself the way you treat others the moments of your of your living

180
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:22,480
become become your practice so in this way generosity is not just something that

181
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,920
you do you just give something to someone oh yes generous i'm being generous

182
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,960
it becomes it infuses infuses your heart your mind

183
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:38,400
generosity towards yourself towards others and it's related to

184
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:45,359
to many path factors we have four other days so i i'm so excited i

185
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:50,720
need to pace myself part of me wants to just share all the teachings all the

186
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,160
all the [Music] teachings i am so excited about i want

187
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:01,920
to teach them in one go but slowly slowly slowly so there's

188
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:07,839
i'm thrilled for us to be discussing this for the next

189
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:13,680
few days and not just discussing but to let our hearts and minds swim in

190
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:19,839
in generosity what what is it to have a generous heart or or notice moments

191
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:26,880
where there is no generosity and i've done this practice before to have my mind swim in generosity

192
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:33,119
for days as a practice and it's been hap happy making and also very opening so so

193
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:38,800
that's the topic it's a long way of introducing the topic so

194
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:46,640
so to place um

195
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:53,760
as i already mentioned with with dhana sila bhavana dhana being

196
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,200
first donna this word for generosity or giving

197
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:06,400
in fact um the word dhana is both giving and what

198
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,880
is given in pali the word is d-a-n-a

199
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:18,079
it's both what is given and the act of generosity

200
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:25,280
and uh and in an article written by upandita

201
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:32,000
he called dhana sila acts that purify our existence i love

202
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,839
that acts that purify our existence

203
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:46,000
what a beautiful way to relate to it acts these are acts that purify our

204
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,440
existence so they have internal dimensions not just external

205
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:59,359
dimensions of of benefiting others but internal dimensions of purifying and also

206
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:05,200
other dimensions that are even above and beyond our perception our understanding

207
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:11,280
to just open to the beauty and the mystery of this giving and receiving

208
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:17,520
in in life we're always receiving we're always giving in our

209
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:22,839
lives [Music]

210
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:29,280
so i'd like to invite us to start today as we already did with our

211
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:37,520
guided meditation in to start with ourselves to start with

212
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:44,640
ourselves so in some way similar to the practice of meta loving kindness

213
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:54,160
where we start with in smaller concentric circles start with ourselves and then go out out out

214
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:00,720
and we cultivate kindness good will for ourselves and with meta may i be safe

215
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:09,359
may i be happy may i be well etc so that when our cup feels full then we

216
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:15,920
can share it with others we don't have a needy sense love me love me love me

217
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:23,119
right when our heart is full when our cup is full with our own kindness

218
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:30,640
it's less needy we can offer it to others so drawing a parallel here let's try

219
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:36,960
this on for size drawing a parallel in order for us

220
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,960
of course for many might be an easy step from receiving to giving but

221
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:50,319
but to appreciate and acknowledge receiving acknowledge receiving acknowledge

222
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:57,760
that we are the recipient of so much goodness so many gifts so much generosity all

223
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,760
around us i mentioned a few

224
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:11,200
items in our guided meditation the the breath

225
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:18,720
the air you are breathing in this life this body it's ours and it's not so ours nothing

226
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:23,839
is really ours even things that we own own

227
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:32,079
quote-unquote own [Music] aren't really ours we are a traveler in this life

228
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:39,839
we're just passing through and we use these items for a while for a while

229
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:44,960
you know after i'm long gone this this beautiful tibetan bell will still be

230
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:52,560
here for now i'm i'm it's um owner or i'm it's a custodian that's it

231
00:42:52,560 --> 00:43:00,480
i'm it's custodian but when i'm gone it's it'll still be here so so acknowledging acknowledging

232
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:08,720
so much that we receive so much goodness this being that is living this life is receiving

233
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:16,400
is receiving as a way to open our hearts to the to the awareness of oh letting go

234
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:21,839
letting go letting go generosity letting go

235
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:27,520

with delight because that act of graciousness openheartedness

253
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,880
opens our heart to turn around and share its its own generosity share
