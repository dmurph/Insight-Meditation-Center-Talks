1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:07,240
and hello again greeting you from Redwood City

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,480
California on this guided meditation as part of the samade

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:21,240
series and one of the at some point as the mindfulness

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:28,080
gets stronger the sensitivity gets stronger the momentum of the practice

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:36,399
gets stronger that's what we feel is the momentum or we feel the movement of the

6
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:43,120
practice or we feel the way or the place in which the practice is

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,600
growing or the place with that that feels onward

8
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,960
leading that there's a place there's a there's a feeling that

9
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:01,399
yes uh something is happening here and it's good and it's good to stay

10
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:08,840
with it and go along with it and um to be kind of very simplistic

11
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:16,240
about it it could be as simple as feeling the muscle tense in some way and

12
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:23,840
feeling that if you really sense the muscles that are tense tight you can almost feel the

13
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,600
desire a momentum movement that wants to happen

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,119
which is the muscles to relax and so it is that there's a kind

15
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:44,520
of easing kind of relaxing a kind of onward moving a gathering together a

16
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:52,079
unification a feeling oh yes yes this is good this is going someplace or there's

17
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,438
this is the place to be or this is where things are

18
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,520
releasing this is the place where things are becoming concentrated gathering

19
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:14,160
together this is the place that feels like we're growing or something is developing or something really good is

20
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:21,080
about is happening and that feeling of onward leading is really when it when it

21
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,599
happens it doesn't always happen there has to be some deepening of the

22
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:32,840
practice then we're starting to approach What's called the approach stage of

23
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:39,560
somebody where we feel that we're coming into a territory or getting close to

24
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:45,599
something so there's many ways of describing this feeling of onward

25
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:52,640
movement of the meditation practice and to feel it and sense it and

26
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,040
then to go along with it or that supports the Gathering it usually comes

27
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:04,400
with a sense of rightness yeah yes a sense of this is where I want to be not

28
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,239
anywhere else and so it supports the Gathering Together the unification of

29
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:18,599
who we are it's not necessarily going to feel it from day to day it can vary quite a

30
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:25,239
bit but when to know about it means that um when you recognize it that supports

31
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:31,080
its growth that can that can then it can help there be there to support you

32
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:39,120
can also so it could also be there to trip you up if you get too involved with

33
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:46,599
it part of the beauty of this onward leading feeling is that it's not part of our

34
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:53,640
Desire System it's not part of our willful system or system of self me and

35
00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:00,560
my and I it's almost as if it's something profound within us that is not

36
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,599
us or not part of our willfulness or our

37
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:12,680
desires or our Cravings that is operating it's something to let go

38
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,359
into so to assume a meditation

39
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:26,320
posture and part of the role of an intentional aligned

40
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:33,440
posture is to begin that heightened sensitivity in the

41
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:41,240
body that can sense the subtle movements the subtle

42
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:49,960
unfolding that might appear and softly closing your eyes and

43
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,840
letting your eyes rest in their eye sockets

44
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,070
sitting quietly in your

45
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:19,800
[Music] posture sitting quietly Here and Now

46
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:39,880
and feeling your body whatever is happening in your

47
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:50,199
body and sense if there's any place in your body that would like your

48
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:56,039
attention not that it's screaming for it necessarily but any place in your body

49
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:05,319
that says please my friend come come here bring attention here to this

50
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:21,720
part and to take a few long slow deep breaths breathing

51
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:30,599
through or with this place that wants attention that calls on you

52
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:36,560
and as you exhale relax and soften all around

53
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:57,120
it as you have a longer exhale than usual is there a place in the exhale the

54
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,000
end of the exhale that would like your

55
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,599
attention welcomes

56
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:18,680
it some place in the body where the final feelings of exhale

57
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:37,479
appear and and letting your breathing return to normal and spending some time relaxing

58
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:46,120
in your body on the inhale feeling the muscles of your

59
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:52,680
face Maybe feeling if they would like to relax or

60
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:59,680
soften on the exhale to soften in the face

61
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:16,720
on the inhale to feel the shoulders and feel if there's any desire

62
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,400
or momentum in the shoulders to

63
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,400
relax on the exhale

64
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:33,080
to soften the

65
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,839
shoulders and inhale feeling the

66
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:02,800
belly on the exhale softening in the

67
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:24,480
belly on the inhale feeling the thinking mind feeling and if anything wants to

68
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:31,120
relax or soften or quiet in the thinking mind

69
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,640
on the exhale let there be a softening a

70
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,240
quieting in the thinking mind

71
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,920
on the inhale feeling any way in which your whole body

72
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,760
is bracing itself or

73
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:32,320
collapsing on the exhale to to relax the

74
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:38,920
bracing or release the collapse so your body

75
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,920
straightens

76
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,279
aligns for

77
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,680
relaxing into the body

78
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:53,759
breathing as if there's a wide circle of sensations of the

79
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:02,160
body that around breathing and as as you breathe as you

80
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,879
exhale all those

81
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,800
Sensations incline towards the

82
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:19,000
breathing the sensations of breathing

83
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:41,839
and in the softest way

84
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:50,880
gently count your breaths up to three and then do it

85
00:12:51,480 --> 00:13:00,839
again a counting that is loving that is caring

86
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,959
gentle as if it's gently brushing

87
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,440
stroking each

88
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
breath

89
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
for

90
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
for

91
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
for

92
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
for

93
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
for

94
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

95
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
for

96
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

97
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,840
for for

98
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:52,600
with a heightened sensitivity

99
00:18:52,600 --> 00:19:00,159
allow your body to feel the

100
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:08,600
entirety of breathing in the entirety of breathing

101
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:17,679
out perhaps mostly in some place where the

102
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:23,240
breathing is Pleasant

103
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:29,919
quiet where the experience of breathing

104
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:36,158
welcomes you to stay with

105
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,679
it for

106
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:43,559
and as you give yourself [Music] over to your

107
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:53,080
breathing is there any feeling in the breathing any place in the

108
00:20:54,120 --> 00:21:00,600
body it feels like the right place for your awareness to be

109
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,679
where there's a subtle feeling of yes

110
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:12,480
here perhaps where there's some semblance of an onward leading

111
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:18,559
feeling this is the way forward staying close to

112
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:26,559
this and if so re

113
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,840
give yourself over to

114
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,640
it allow yourself to

115
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:55,360
feel the very subtle momentum

116
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:05,240
of here this is onward

117
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
leading

118
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

119
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

120
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,440
e for

121
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,880
one aspect of the onward leading nature of the

122
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:02,039
practice is related to Faith or

123
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:08,600
confidence that has within it a

124
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:19,480
desire to be more present to be awake and present for our

125
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:30,320
experience because knowing how good this is having faith in

126
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:44,919
mindfulness attention brings an onward leading

127
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:53,320
desire to being more fully here for our experience

128
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:22,520
and as we come to the end of this sitting to appreciate that Faith

129
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:30,240
confidence in being present for our life being present for the experience

130
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:42,679
translates as a kind of a love care respect for those we

131
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:49,679
encounter there is a very subtle maybe sometimes not so

132
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:55,600
subtle faith and confidence it's good to be

133
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,240
present each person in their own way

134
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:09,720
but to be present and attentive aware of those were

135
00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:17,960
with and this is onward leading onward

136
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:27,600
leading to a peaceful and harmonious Society

137
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:36,799
may this practice of mindfulness the practice of

138
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:47,360
samadi support us in being Mindful and

139
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:56,559
present for that onward leading nature of building a harmonious Society

140
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:07,000
may all beings be happy may all

141
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:16,919
beings be peaceful may all beings be

142
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,880
safe and may all beings

143
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,880
everywhere be free

144
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,720
[Music]

145
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:50,500
thank you [Music]

146
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:29,840
hello and welcome to the 35th talk of this Samar series

147
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:35,840
and um and as the Mind

148
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:43,799
relaxes as our ability to be centered and be more fully present

149
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:51,919
here there is this amazing feeling that to be here fully and completely is not a

150
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:58,159
static thing but there's an onward leading nature to it there's something

151
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:06,720
that wants to move through us something that wants to express itself something wants to be for us and that can be many

152
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,720
things but in terms of somi when we're giving ourselves over to this giving you

153
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:19,919
know one primary activity of just being present here for example for the

154
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:26,360
breathing that starts to kind of become the place that the whole Mind Body

155
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:34,640
Gathers enters into and the goodness of it the rightness of it yes the feeling of yes

156
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:41,000
this is where I want to be this is healthy this is appropriate um it begins to stand out

157
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,039
and highlight when we start realizing that

158
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:54,399
to be cut up in our thoughts cut up in our plans our worries our memories our

159
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:59,639
regrets our know our irritations or

160
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:05,360
complaints that is not not as healthy as being really here

161
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:13,159
fully being here in the deep samadi is almost like having entering into a deep

162
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:18,840
vacation a deep rest a deep healthy alternative to the usual way in which

163
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:24,440
the mind is stressful what what it does and it feels good to be there it feels

164
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:30,919
like this is a healthy mind this is a healthy heart and body and there's a kind of feeling of yes to

165
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:37,200
this and that feeling of yes uh has a kind of feeling of there's an onward

166
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:43,639
leading nature there's a it's um it's similar to being on the top of a slide

167
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:49,600
and you're you you maybe slid a little bit down the slide and then hold on to

168
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:56,000
the side so you don't go any further but you can feel the tug the pull of gravity

169
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,039
that wants to kind of pull pull you down if you just let

170
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:07,519
go and uh and so the same thing there's a kind of a slide or a kind of a of a of

171
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:15,960
a movement that we can feel that is not um that it's kind of like the pull of

172
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:23,960
the the heart's gravity or the gravity of the inner life that um is not willful

173
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:32,519
it's not a desire from the usual uh self that wants and expects and demands and

174
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:38,320
is disappointed it's almost as B it's a kind of a biological feeling that is

175
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:44,039
deeper than any mental movement of the

176
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:51,720
mind and um and to appreciate that uh to be fully present

177
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:58,760
is not static but is being part is to join to join a kind of momentum to join

178
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:04,120
the living uh stream of life that now is

179
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:09,519
kind of going along into more and more presence more and more just here just

180
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:16,279
with this experience and certainly there are times in ordinary life where we get absorbed

181
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:21,320
in a particular activity it just feels so good to some people say they feel

182
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:26,519
lost in the activity and they just can't wait to get go back into it they might

183
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:33,279
get pulled out and sometimes it's interesting to see how being pulled out of activity we're absorbed in their part

184
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:39,480
of the mind just wants to come back it's like the momentum is there and and

185
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,559
um and then as soon as we let go of the other thing that has to be taken care of

186
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:51,480
it feels so good to be back in the groove and this is the way to go this is the way to move

187
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:58,559
forward and um so uh it's actually very

188
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:05,120
useful for the purpose of somebody to not just be willfully trying not not at

189
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:10,240
all to be kind of willfully kind of pushing and straining to concentrated

190
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:16,280
but a lot of it is letting go but not but it's letting go at some point

191
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:22,520
into uh the onward leading nature into this way in which our

192
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:28,960
system wants to move forward by stepping into to more

193
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:36,280
into the experience more deeply give ourselves over to the experience more deeply and sometimes this onward leader

194
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:43,118
nature can can uh take the form that we Fe just a subtle feeling that says oh

195
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:48,720
this is where the attention should be uh it might be if it's connected to

196
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:54,040
the breathing it might be this part of the body should where attention should

197
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:59,800
be and like rest having attention rest there like a hand hand resting on a

198
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:05,320
maybe on your thigh uh just now it's the the the hand of awareness is resting on

199
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:11,359
some place in the body where breathing is felt and sometimes that shifts and

200
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:17,520
changes as we develop the practice um I've often had the experience of uh I

201
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:25,240
stay I'm often centered on my belly as I breathe feeling the movements of my belly as I breathe but then sometimes as

202
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:31,560
the mind as the breathing gets quieter and quiet sometimes the the the place that feels

203
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:38,880
like the this is where the attention should be moves up to the middle of the chest and I feel this little movements

204
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,160
in the chest there and then sometimes it moves again sometimes it moves back to

205
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:52,480
just a little Point uh of pressure a little point of of sensation uh deep

206
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,760
somehow deep in the belly below the belly button somehow and it's just like that this is where the attention should

207
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:03,880
be and there might be almost no movement if I'm really still and quiet but

208
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:10,160
there's a feeling oh this is where the attention wants to be this is onward leading or this is where the request is

209
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:17,200
this is where the where it feels the yes is there and this yes this onward leading

210
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,720
nature can also be related to a number of other things one of them is it can be

211
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:30,200
related to um faith and Faith s in P is

212
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:37,920
um is um is a kind of a desire a healthy

213
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:44,000
desire that says yes this is where it's right to be this is what wants to happen

214
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:51,640
this is what I have faith in this is what I have confidence in and again it's not I even though I say I it's something

215
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:57,319
deeper inside that not really the control tower the control self this is

216
00:36:57,319 --> 00:37:02,599
the place where there's a natural system operating the natural system has this

217
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:08,960
faith has this confidence has his yes has this desire yes stay here be with

218
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:14,079
this and um but don't push it don't if

219
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:20,079
you feel the onward leading nature let go into it participate in it but don't

220
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:26,040
bring the the control self the control desires um to bear like okay now I'm

221
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:32,280
going to do it really well I can feel it and now I'm going to really push against it or or you know but it's it's more

222
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:38,560
like be soft ease into it trust it the faith is

223
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,960
the TR is it can also can be a trust trust this experience and Trust to go

224
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:49,839
along with it and this is particularly important for samadi because any degree

225
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:55,520
of concentration that we have always has a lifetime concentration you can't just

226
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:02,119
get into a state of Som and stay there for forever it always has a lifetime where it Peaks and then it's going to

227
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:09,839
fade away and so if you're uh coming with your kind of control desires to want to

228
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:16,040
get concentrated um then you might be overriding uh the the wave of somadi

229
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:22,839
that's going through and part of the art of somadi is also to appreciate when the

230
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:28,160
the peak of whatever degree of subtleness you have and

231
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:36,520
past and uh and partly you know that because a thinking mind begins to start up again and it's not wrong that the

232
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:42,319
concentration waines it's just a natural part and what part of a healthy kind of

233
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:47,440
relationship to some and concentration is to learn to recognize when the

234
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:53,040
concentration fade starting to fade and then be gracious about that uh just

235
00:38:53,040 --> 00:39:00,400
continue the practice for a while but not with any idea that it should be any different that it's not supposed to fade

236
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:08,040
um maybe switched to mindfulness more than concentration and um and uh don't fight

237
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:15,000
it don't try to override it that fading away when that time comes and if it if that fading way

238
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:21,960
happens before the end of your normal meditation then just continue with the practice the best you can but don't have

239
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:27,480
a high standard it's not going to look that great as your concentration wanes

240
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:32,680
but the effort to continue with the practice um is building the muscle of

241
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:39,440
practice the strength of practice that then will support you at other

242
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:46,040
times so um the onward leading nature and this uh

243
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:51,920
becomes important for what we'll do next week which is uh uh go go into a little

244
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:57,040
bit more detail or in different way the approach stage of going into deep samade

245
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,079
deep absorption and uh and becoming skilled a little bit in the approach stage is

246
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:07,800
helpful which is where we really kind of start uh feeling the we're in the

247
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:13,000
approach where where the momentum is starting to kick in and to learning how

248
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:21,319
to ride that is important so uh the other thing um next

249
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:30,400
Friday um after this 7:00 a.m. at I think it starts at 9: or 9:30 uh I'm teaching an online dayong

250
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,720
for the inside Retreat Center that um will be on

251
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:41,480
zoom and um it's on mindfulness of emotions so it's a different topic than

252
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:48,160
Sade but um uh it's certainly the more we're mindful of emotions and are wise

253
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:58,160
about it the more that actually supports somebody because in a certain kind of way um samadi is emotional belongs to

254
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:07,040
the deep Deep Emotions profound emotions of uh well-being of Peace of confidence of joy

255
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:13,359
of of um equinity so learning how to be with emotions can be

256
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:18,599
supportive and if you're interested in doing that you need to register and um

257
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:26,640
it's uh in the Insight Retreat Center website so thank you all very much and I

258
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:32,799
look forward to our approach next week
