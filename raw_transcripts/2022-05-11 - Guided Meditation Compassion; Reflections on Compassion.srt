1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:06,319
so welcome um you know you know the drill here

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,839
uh let's let's sit together

3
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,040
just let there be space in your heart

4
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:20,040
for all the joys and sorrows being human

5
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,720
when the heart begins to give permission

6
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,319
something drops in the body something settles down

7
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,560
no one has a perfect shiny mind or a perfect shiny life

8
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,599
some loose ends in every human life

9
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,000
we develop the confidence that

10
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:32,120
we can take our seat amidst it all

11
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,800
when we stop trying to control our experience

12
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:02,198
the necessity of love becomes more and more apparent

13
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,759
just breathe and relax into

14
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,720
the condition of your life this moment

15
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:57,560
you're not responsible for solving the predicament

16
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,680
the human condition

17
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,960
you're simply being asked to

18
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:21,280
uh bless the intensity of the human condition the intensity of a moment

19
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,800
of an urge or a feeling to bless

20
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:35,479
this with wisdom and love

21
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:14,680
every moment is practicable in one way or another

22
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,680
in the wake of letting go

23
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:33,320
there's something like a quiet love that remains

24
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:56,320
and turning now more explicitly

25
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,680
to compassion

26
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,560
just bringing into your heart mind

27
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,480
someone you care about who's suffering

28
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:50,560
when we first fill out the landscape of their pain

29
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,720
to actually take that into our heart

30
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:08,360
to consider their inner life the life of their body

31
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,560
and develop a kind of vivid sense

32
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:28,720
of their suffering this is only one part of our practice

33
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,160
but this is the first part

34
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:19,440
and to understand their pain of course we naturally draw

35
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,720
on our own pain

36
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:33,639
from memory or from life right now

37
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:50,880
we make vivid the suffering of

38
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,600
this person we love we care about

39
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:33,840
and so in compassion one dimension is a willingness to

40
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,240
grieve

41
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:08,440
but we do not stay here grief is not the last word

42
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:26,120
as the vision of their pain this dramatized made clearer and clearer

43
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,160
our heart makes another move

44
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:44,880
and we pour all of our love

45
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,280
into them

46
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,279
as if we fill their mind and body

47
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,480
their care or wishes that their suffering be alleviated

48
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,240
that they be at peace

49
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:07,519
of course there are traces of the grief but it's mostly

50
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,159
displaced by the warmth

51
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:20,000
love of compassion

52
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:27,720
kind of compassion that doesn't fatigue our own heart

53
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,960
what feels good to dwell in

54
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:35,679
we're not insisting that someone stop suffering where

55
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:43,400
offering our love and our blessings that it might be so

56
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:01,840
we just rest our mind abiding not care

57
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,440
warm

58
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,840
and then maybe these last few minutes we let go

59
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,559
orienting to one person

60
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,840
of orienting self and other

61
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:20,200
instead we practice just dwelling in the openness

62
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,320
of compassion

63
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,600
distinctionless compassion

64
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,120
it's good to sit with you

65
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,799
so it took uh suffering

66
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:10,080
is both everywhere

67
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,200
and super obvious

68
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,880
but it's also kind of shocking that there is suffering there's

69
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:27,919
something shocking startling about that at least startling to our nervous system

70
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:35,440
and when there's some hard moment

71
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:43,519
i find there's a part of me that can like barely believe it you know like of course i know i've

72
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:51,120
contemplated dukkha a lot right but there's a little part of some naive part of my mind is like how is this happening

73
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:58,080
you know and we can have that sense of like how did the the universe conspire to do

74
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:06,880
this to me this moment and it might be just like some small ache you know

75
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,000
holla allian poet um psychologist and poet

76
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,399
wrote a kind of grief poem this is i think it was published in september or

77
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:28,159
october of 2020 so pandemic

78
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:33,360
george floyd election uh

79
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:42,880
staggering amount of dukkha and uh one of the lines in that poem was

80
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:49,120
the patients who come to me swarmed with misery and astonishment their hearts

81
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,720
like newborns after the first needle

82
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:01,519
or it's like newborns after the first needle dukkha

83
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,799
can feel like that

84
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:16,240
the buddha asks that we we comprehend suffering that we comprehend suffering

85
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,398
i somehow like that translation comprehend suffering

86
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,760
and the the act really of comprehending suffering

87
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:39,240
highlights the necessity of love

88
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,640
yeah sometimes i feel like yeah the first noble truth

89
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:52,399
that there is dukkha contains the next three in a way to really

90
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:58,880
compreh comprehend suffering that is to uh

91
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,720
to know the necessity of love of compassion

92
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,398
otherwise we just kind of armor up and try to make the first noble

93
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:15,679
truth vanish or we crumble collapse

94
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:24,079
so the the alternatives when when i think about it the alternatives to love really

95
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:31,118
are something like hate and apathy those are the alternatives

96
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,638
and so while we we have some details to work out no

97
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:42,560
doubt the path is actually pretty clear

98
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:52,000
compassion is is love in the face of dukkha the wish that it be uh

99
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,720
let it be alleviated and

100
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:06,640
part of compassion is coming to a more nuanced understanding of our own

101
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:12,720
of our own suffering we first comprehend our own suffering

102
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,760
and so often we we kind of you know without training [Music]

103
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,920
we basically misdiagnose our own suffering

104
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:34,400
you know it's just like people are trained a doctor whatever trained in differential diagnosis or something

105
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,920
and we have to train in diagnosing our own suffering too

106
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:46,560
because our habit is to embrace monocausal models yeah like

107
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,480
single cause this is what's doing it yeah

108
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:58,000
this is the source of my suffering and

109
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,320
the buddhist psychology invites us into a much more

110
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,440
complex map of causality it's

111
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:16,560
it's almost never just just this yeah our mind gets seduced into that

112
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:23,440
but as we practice more we start to appreciate the complexity of causality

113
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,400
so we're not highlighting just this you know

114
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:34,400
we have that fantasy if i could just pull that one thread the whole thing unravels but

115
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:40,720
our dukkha is a testament not to one thing but kind of to

116
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:46,720
everything and if we have the wrong diagnosis

117
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:53,240
we can issue the wrong treatment

118
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:01,838
so often um we want to

119
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,320
control our suffering rather than understand it

120
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:15,920
and compassion makes us patient in our understanding

121
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:21,720
makes us patient in our understanding of suffering

122
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:29,760
the the compassion the love of which i'm speaking it's not a kind of enmeshed

123
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,839
love it's not emotional contagion in that first phase of taking in the

124
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:43,359
suffering of another kind of the willingness to grieve with them

125
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:49,839
um we're not we're it's it's not this pure emotional con

126
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:55,599
kind of contagion and my my conditioning around love is a

127
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,920
kind of enmeshed model or something it's like

128
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:07,520
your pain is my pain is your pain and love and space

129
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,560
are somehow intention rather than space

130
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:20,800
affording room for love and so i've found that um the the

131
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:27,599
suffering the suffering of loved ones spins me

132
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:34,560
spins me in particular ways and

133
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:40,320
my words maybe some you know might masquerade as compassion

134
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:50,240
but what they really testify to is the intolerance of their pain

135
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:58,000
yeah and so it's somehow wanting to quickly manage dukkha

136
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:05,119
and makes sense that you know as as children like the suffering of a parent

137
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:11,760
or caretaker or someone it's like an existential threat you know

138
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:17,119
and um at some level growing up all of us

139
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:22,560
all of us want the adult to be

140
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:30,160
fully enlightened you know to be free of suffering to be a kind of

141
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,520
master of samsara and that is not so

142
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:41,680
and and so maybe maybe some of that sense of

143
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:48,000
threat the the threat of the suffering of the other encodes some fear

144
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:57,079
as we grow up of our own families the commitments loved ones

145
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:03,119
that the suffering of the other spins us but compassion is not

146
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:11,599
a kind of insistence that someone change it's not even an insistence that someone

147
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:19,040
stops suffering it can feel that way

148
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:27,280
but then we just need to issue our own heart love it this compassion is love

149
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,880
in the face of suffering

150
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:41,920
the monk uh matchy ricard and brain scientist tanya singer they were doing

151
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,599
some you know kind of uh

152
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:55,280
study where where he was in the the scanner doing compassion practice and

153
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:01,760
um she's sort of uh you know this kind of exceptional being she's interested okay

154
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:08,720
what's this person's brain like and um and she saw she saw that kind of brain

155
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:14,240
activity and she asked him afterwards like what were you doing you know because

156
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:19,280
the brain activations you know looked quite different to what she

157
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,319
she had expected the kind of some of the familiar nodes

158
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:32,560
that light up with when when people are in a state of empathy yeah

159
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,800
the kind of brain regions that you would see activated when you

160
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:44,000
experimentally you know a loved one is getting an electric shock or something like that

161
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:50,079
and in empathy where we're feeling the grief of the other's pain and that's

162
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:57,200
hard but compassion might use that as a seed for generating

163
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:02,680
our commitment but that's not the last word

164
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:10,240
but and then this kind of turning of the heart to love to actually

165
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:16,440
enjoying act in a subtle way enjoying

166
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:24,880
take that han said um true love never makes you suffer

167
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:33,040
compassion is a form of true love

168
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,359
and uh love doesn't hurt

169
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:46,240
clinging for sure hurts controlling for sure hurts

170
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,520
but love doesn't this kind of love

171
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,680
so we

172
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:08,880
recognize without without compassion the path can feel

173
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,960
almost sometimes like greed more and more

174
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,838
happiness ease peace for me

175
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:26,480
and so we we center this commitment to the welfare of others

176
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:34,160
and we develop our own compassionate motivations by knowing

177
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:42,160
suffering intimately in awareness in every day we can do this the pain

178
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:48,720
of pain the pain of change the pain of the disjointedness of

179
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,880
samsara and as we

180
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:02,240
start to release our own pain

181
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:09,760
to comprehend dukkha to become more and more free

182
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:16,720
the pain of the world doesn't so much resonate with our wounds but

183
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,560
with our heart and um

184
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:28,640
our compassion is is vitalized our own healing

186
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,480
makes it more urgent because we know suffering so vividly

187
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:48,160
so intimately start to

188
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:55,440
wish more and more naturally that it be alleviated in others

189
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:01,200
