1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,319
so good day and welcome to the arising of this

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:13,360
meditation session together and it'll now that it's in the process of

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:20,000
appearing it will persist for some minutes and

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,599
then it'll come to an end and this uh insight this appreciation

5
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,680
deep appreciation for the inconstancy of experience

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,640
is one of the specialties of insight meditation and to really begin to appreciate and

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:48,239
value and be attuned to how things are how experiences how we experience

8
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:55,760
things is a transient phenomenon that the particularities of what we are

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,000
aware of in the moment come and they go and so some of the thoughts that you're

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,760
already having now listening to what i'm saying but didn't exist

11
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,760
10 minutes ago and there a few minutes ago then they have appeared and i'm sure someday

12
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,159
they'll disappear as a current active thoughts that you have

13
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,159
and and there's something about observing or recognizing this transient

14
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,840
of experience that supports

15
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,840
a movement towards freedom freedom from being entangled in the transient

16
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:44,079
experiences freedom from the searching and looking and wanting to hold on to something

17
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:53,200
just letting go and and so there's many ways to experience

18
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:00,000
constancy you can be aware of how things arise that something new appears it was

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,280
unexpected unplanned and there's a sound there's a thought there's a feeling we can be aware that

20
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,760
things have passed things that were there now are gone and sometimes it can be a surprise where did

21
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,040
it go i've had physical pain in meditation

22
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,280
and then i don't know some point i was aware it was no longer there and i didn't see it pass away but i

23
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,920
certainly know now it's passed away and wow where did it go and

24
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,400
the and uh and it's not just uh you know the

25
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,480
experience that's you know things that we experience that arise in past but it's also the way in which we

26
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,239
experience them the fickle way in which attention and thoughts kind of focus on things

27
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,760
that we might be focused on the breathing and hang stay there pretty well but then there's

28
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:03,200
a loud sound and we say what's that and the sound has just arisen the thought what's that has just arisen

29
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:11,040
the thought i better find a quieter place to meditate has just arisen and then we're aware that that's passed

30
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:18,159
for a moment it's just a thought and because we don't lean into it and hold on to it we don't add another thought i should

31
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:24,319
find a better place to meditate i wonder what's a better place to meditate we take the time to recognize the first

32
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:31,200
thought it arose it was there a little bit and then it passed and

33
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,480
and if what i'm talking about you don't understand that you have the thought that doesn't understand that that

34
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,959
thought arose and then maybe persists and then it passes

35
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,640
and so it doesn't say that all things are supposed to be quickly

36
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:56,000
transient and constant the buddha talked about things arise they persist and they pass away

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,120
but there's something about being attuned to how they arise

38
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:09,519
when they arise that they arise and that they pass is really the art of this and

39
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,239
and uh and part of it what's also interesting is that maybe we're not there to notice when

40
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,680
something has arisen but maybe we notice that our awareness of it

41
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,759
has now arisen we weren't exactly aware of it but oh i'm aware of it now and that

42
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,680
awareness has arisen and then at some point we it hasn't

43
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,280
passed away it persists but we've been focusing on something else we've gotten involved in a fantasy

44
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:46,880
and then we're aware that oh the awareness of that has ceased for a while and so there's

45
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,160
all these ways in which we see we're not supposed to search for seeing

46
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,680
arising and passing a phenomena as much as settle back and observe it

47
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,960
appreciate it be attuned to it in the way that it helps us to keep

48
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,080
letting go keep relaxing keep not getting involved in things and

49
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:15,199
searching and wanting and making things happen just settle back and the arising and passing of phenomena

50
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,240
in all the ways that can be experienced happens without our involvement without

51
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:27,840
our making it so and so to settle back and just observe and watch and watch

52
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,440
so taking a uh i would say maybe i said differently

53
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:42,560
beginning with a new beginning of bringing attention to your posture

54
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,199
and adjusting your posture and be aware that as you do so there's

55
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:55,840
something new that keeps arising new sensations in the body new feelings

56
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,360
and then settling into this body

57
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:10,720
and if your eyes are still open there's the occurrence of closing your

58
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:18,080
eyes a new beginning or an ending

59
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,840
of the eyes being open

60
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:33,919
and the breathing itself is uh one of the great teachers for any constancy

61
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,960
that all the sensations that come and go with breathing are coming

62
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,840
and going arising and passing

63
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,080
and in some ways the constancy continuity of the inconstancy of breathing

64
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:59,120
is also a wonderful reference point for seeing the

65
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,120
inconstancy of the mind's ability to stay focused and present

66
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:14,400
the arising of new thoughts through persistence of them the changing nature of thoughts

67
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:21,120
thoughts themselves are not one constant hum but new thoughts ideas

68
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:28,000
images are constantly streaming through and to be attuned to the inconstancy of the

69
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,160
details of thinking as a way of

70
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:45,840
not clinging so much holding on

71
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:52,240
as you exhale relaxing the belly

72
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:12,639
softening the belly and being aware of changing sensations that come and go as you do so

73
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:27,840
as you exhale relaxing the chest

74
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,839
as you exhale softening the shoulders

75
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:55,839
some things pass if the tension relaxes and do things arise in the shoulders

76
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:04,959
softening the muscles of the face your dear face

77
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,120
softening relaxing giving it a break

78
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:28,720
and then gently maybe lovingly to relax your thinking mind

79
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,560
maybe on the exhale softening the brain or the forehead

80
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,240
the holding the contraction the searching the wanting

81
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,839
exhale and soften relax the whole body

82
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,079
and then taking that thinking mind of yours

83
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:18,560
and letting it rest settle back as if it's settling back against a

84
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:25,839
comfortable tree on a comfortable day

85
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:33,839
ready to observe the river flowing by

86
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:46,399
the flow of arising and passing a phenomenon

87
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:53,600
sometimes we're aware of sensations coming and going sometimes aware of our attention coming

88
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:01,839
and going our thoughts coming and going

89
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,759
one way or the other something new is always arising

90
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:15,839
it's one way or the other something is always ceasing and passing away

91
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,920
and you can do all of this seeing all of this in the breathing

92
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,240
settling into your breathing maybe your breathing is the tree you're

93
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:36,160
leaning against resting in the breathing

94
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,839
floating on this river of change

95
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:57,839
in the body as you experience breathing changing sensations of breathing

96
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
so

97
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,839
so

98
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,839
uh

99
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:17,840
there's a way that the arising appearing of new

100
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:25,840
something new in awareness supports not clinging to anything

101
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,400
there's a way in which the ceasing of things the passing of things

102
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,640
supports not clinging not holding on

103
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,320
if you stay close to how things are appearing and disappearing moment by

104
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:51,279
moment it can be a little bit like a massage for

105
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:58,799
the mind the mind's tendency to want and search for and

106
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,960
create think

107
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:11,360
just let go let go let go with the inconstant

108
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:21,840
the flow of inconstancy

109
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,840
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

110
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:17,840
one of the descriptions of mindfulness practice could be that it's being available

111
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,840
for the way in which life is ever renewing

112
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:30,960
ever-changing to be available for what arises that's

113
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:37,520
new by not lingering and holding on and

114
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:44,480
living with what has passed and it's a

115
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:51,760
wonderful gift to give to others to be available for them as if they are

116
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:57,520
new as if they are renewed as if you don't know them

117
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,320
but they're appearing fresh without your

118
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:10,080
old news your old ideas about who they are and what

119
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:16,320
they've done and your expectations of how they should be

120
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:24,000
but to be available to see how people are ever new and re

121
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,559
freed of their past

122
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,760
to be available

123
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:46,320
for the ever renewing aspects of this life so that we can love and care and

124
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:52,960
be tenderized by what is happening moment by moment

125
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,720
so we can be sensitive to the depth of the present moment

126
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:04,398
sensitive to the depth of our contact with others

127
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,840
how they live in our lives

128
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:17,840
and this ability not to linger in the past to hold on to things

129
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:24,240
to be fresh is a wonderful basis upon which to care

130
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:30,720
for others and may it be that this practice of ours

131
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:37,840
helps us to care deeply because we feel deeply

132
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,000
into the newness of each moment

133
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,039
may all beings be happy

134
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,559
may all beings be safe

135
00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:02,000
may all beings be peaceful

136
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:19,840
may all beings everywhere be free

137
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:32,399
so as i've been talking over these last days about the 13th step

138
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:40,559
of mindfulness of breathing being you're being the observation

139
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:47,679
settling back and observing the inconstanty of phenomena how things are constantly renewing but

140
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:53,279
also constantly passing and that appearing and disappearing of

141
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:59,440
our experience moment by moment certainly sometimes it's unfortunate that things pass away

142
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:05,360
sometimes we're very fortunate that finally it's no longer here and sometimes we're fortunate that

143
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:11,200
things are are arising and sometimes it's unfortunate what's arising

144
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:19,039
it's painful or something and sometimes it's neutral so there's no particular

145
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:29,279
prioritizing or valuing or or how to say it putting a value on the particular

146
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:35,279
arising of passings that occur it's not it's not a discounting of

147
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:41,200
things it's not a celebrating of things necessarily it's just seeing that actually this is kind of the

148
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,480
nature of when we're really settled really peaceful not overlaying concepts and

149
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,000
ideas on top of experience

150
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:57,679
can we can kind of um that's what we experience we're in the flow of our experience flow of

151
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:04,960
sensations and experience and but the great value of it is not in

152
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:12,559
and of itself like we're supposed to celebrate it or supposed to be depressed by it or something it's uh

153
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:17,760
that we can't it becomes a reference point

154
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:24,799
for how valuable it is not to cling to any of it not to contract around any of it not to

155
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:30,799
resist any of it and especially and in meditation

156
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:36,000
uh in real life you know there's certain things that should be held on to or resisted perhaps

157
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,720
but in meditation to really learn to free ourselves from any movement of being for against

158
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:49,519
holding on or pushing away and because the kind doesn't work but

159
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:55,519
also because this ability to observe and not get engaged and attached to things

160
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:03,679
begins feeling so good i feel that's where freedom is and uh and the core kind of

161
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:10,000
catalyst for freedom in the teachings of the buddha is this experience this deep insight

162
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,358
into inconstancy and so the way in which the more free we become the more

163
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:25,200
in constancy is a support for greater freedom the more free we are the more we see

164
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:33,118
recognize how we're trying to hold on to what is constantly changing or how we've left the flow or how we you know like

165
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,638
put our hand out the window of a car and we have wind drag we're going to have wind drag we put our

166
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:44,480
hands into the river and trying to stop it we picked up a bunch of handful of water

167
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,720
and we left the river thinking we have the river still there's all these ways in which we recognize

168
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:56,800
that we've we've kind of left the flow of inconstancy the flow of life

169
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:04,160
because we've gotten excessively attached or involved or clinging and so see that in meditation

170
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:10,240
and to see that we're actually better off backing off better off not clinging that

171
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:15,599
it's not so interesting to cling or to want and so there's a begins to be an inner

172
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,640
psychological change that happens and as some of that is starting to

173
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:28,160
become a a relaxing the search relaxing to trying to do

174
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:34,079
something or get something or relaxing the need to know

175
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:39,359
and searching to know and because all that is kind of is too much it's like leaning forward

176
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:44,640
when we can just settle back in the sense and then now the

177
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,839
uh all these attachments we have starts we start feeling them as being wind drag

178
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:54,880
we start feeling them as being um interfering with the the

179
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:02,320
radiance of the heart the beauty of the mind the freedom of of uh of our lives and we can see that

180
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:09,119
they diminish us the clinging the attachments that we have things we hold on to and so there starts to be a fading

181
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:16,800
away disinterest and a fading away of jealousy and envy and conceit

182
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:23,839
and and craving and hatred and resentments

183
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,960
you know you can go on the list is long of things that we begin recognizing oh this doesn't really serve me this

184
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,320
i'm not so interested in this anymore it's not like i have to be a good buddhist and this is bad that i'm doing

185
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,520
this and i have to stop doing it it's more like i'm no longer interested in this

186
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:47,599
this is less and less interesting to do i've been resentful for 30 years and i think that i'm getting

187
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:53,280
tired of it i think i see that it's not so interesting i've been chasing after

188
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:59,680
having the perfect physical physique for decades and at some point i'm not really

189
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:05,520
interested in presenting myself always with the perfect human physique whatever that might be

190
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:11,440
and we start losing interest in it always wanting to make more money or

191
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,800
have status or i don't know what all these things were kind of chasing there's a healthy kind

192
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:22,640
of oh wait a minute this doesn't serve me this is not the best place to be this is

193
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:30,079
not the most wonderful way to be to be preoccupied with these things i'm beginning to know something better

194
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:36,960
i'm knowing something about freedom and ease and peace and i want to stress over again that um

195
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:43,839
the primary reference point for what i'm talking about here now is in fact meditation because

196
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:50,720
outside of meditation you might argue well wait a minute isn't it okay to do it here or here we need to do it here

197
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,880
i don't want to get into those discussions what i want you is to really discover that in meditation

198
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,640
you don't have to be pursuing the perfect physique more money more status more

199
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:08,880
whatever it is that you're trying to do in meditation you can feel it meditation

200
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:16,480
itself it's better easier just to let go or not be involved and then to really have an experience a

201
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:24,160
qualitatively high experience of freedom of ease of peace where we're no longer grasping holding

202
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:30,400
or resisting or tightening or contracting that becomes your teacher

203
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,599
rather than debating me with me about wait a minute aren't you supposed to hold on here or

204
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,800
resist that uh it's not so interesting to debate with me it's

205
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:47,760
really for real spiritual life you should be debating with yourself when you have this deep reference point

206
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,839
for peace deep deep reference point for freedom that's that's where it gets really

207
00:38:53,839 --> 00:39:00,640
interesting that's where it really comes alive this practice of freedom and uh and really kind of explore and

208
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:08,720
find out what what is really true for yourself so with this uh observing and constancy

209
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:14,880
then there's a fading away of the interest in some of our attachments and then there's a fading away of the

210
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:21,280
attachments themselves and and so

211
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:29,119
the word for the 13th now the 14th step of anapanasati the pali

212
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:41,040
and there's two different translations of this word and the one that i'll stress today is

213
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:46,079
um it means the fading away when observed the fading of the fading away

214
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:51,520
of these attachments and um the fading away of um

215
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:58,480
of our interest or our addiction to addictive interest in in certain things

216
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:05,359
that are not really serving us anymore and so they're fading away of fading away and this speaks to something very

217
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:10,800
important about this path of liberation in buddhism that sometimes there's a tendency to want to

218
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,800
look for um you know a sudden experience that the key to it all that just unlocks it all a

219
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,160
number free forever just like but a more mature way of seeing it is that

220
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:28,880
a lot of it has to do with just fading away fading away a wearing away dropping away

221
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:35,599
drop by drop um everything dries up or falls away the evaporating

222
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:44,160
of it a phenomenon of our attachment and so raga the root of the word v raga

223
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:52,240
can mean a dye that we call or cloth with and v raga the v prefix means of fading

224
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:57,680
away or separating of that dye and so one of the meanings is to fade away the dye you put

225
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:04,880
you know you dye some clothes and you leave it in the sun for too long and it gets bleached to get the color fades away and so or just time

226
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:12,640
fades it away and so the fading away the fading away and um and this uh when we really feel

227
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:20,079
the the um unsatisfactoriness the the offness the the

228
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:27,119
discomfort of attachment of clinging of addiction of all these movements of the mind that we

229
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:33,839
have and we start to feel oh this is lightening up it's loosening up

230
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:38,960
there's a lightening a lifting a lifting of a cloud and

231
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:46,000
letting go relaxing and then the mindfulness practice is to be available

232
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,800
to that fading to be open to that fading to allow for that

233
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,880
fading because if we go right back into clinging we reinforce more clinging

234
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:05,280
we strengthen that capacity to cling and attach and resist and be addicted to things but once we

235
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:12,079
start feeling this process of fading away then the mindfulness practice is to be available to that fading

236
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:17,119
available to it so we don't reinforce the opposite

237
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:23,839
so one trains breathing in observing

238
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:32,480
fading away when trains breathing out observing fading away

239
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:39,200
and uh and uh so that's one of the meanings of the raga and then tomorrow

240
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:45,440
i'll talk a little bit about the second meaning which is dispassion and uh

241
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:51,760
at least that's all you often how it's translated into english and and probably not a very good

242
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:59,839
translation but that's for tomorrow so um

243
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:08,640
thank you and this comes to an end
