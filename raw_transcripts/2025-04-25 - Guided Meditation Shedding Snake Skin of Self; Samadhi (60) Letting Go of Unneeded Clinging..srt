1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:10,920
so hello and welcome to this meditation session that is part of the series on

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:20,720
samadei and the last two days I've emphasized that or taught how samadei

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:27,279
can be understood as a progressive process of calming the mind stilling the

4
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:34,079
mind in a way that leaves the mind not frozen or offline but leaves it kind of

5
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:42,559
luminously awake and clear and and uh kind of a kind of a very peaceful lucid

6
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:50,760
awareness that and then yesterday I talked about the the process of

7
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,719
um uh stilling the mind stilling the mind

8
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:03,199
not just calming it but um letting go of clinging a progressive process of

9
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,439
clinging less and less and less less contraction less tightness less holding

10
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:15,600
on until there's a feeling of of a kind of a phenomenal degree of freedom in the

11
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,799
mind because it's not disturbed by anything and it's not clenched or held

12
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,920
or resisting feels it it doesn't feel safe but it has

13
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:33,159
a because that's too active to have that feeling and idea but it's a situation of

14
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:40,400
predominant pre pervasive a kind of safety that is so safe the idea of

15
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,399
safety and danger disappears and then today I want to emphasize that uh

16
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:53,560
samadei going through the jas is a progressive Um stilling

17
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:59,079
quieting or releasing or

18
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:05,079
dropping the activities of the mind that involve

19
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:11,840
selfing that involves taking something using it to define who I am commentary

20
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,080
about oneself having concepts and ideas of uh who I am in some way that we're

21
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,120
living in those concepts and ideas even if they are subconscious and they're not

22
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:31,599
really even part of the conscious thinking mind uh we are stilling and quieting

23
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:38,959
even the the very subtle activity that of amness I am it's just a feeling I am

24
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,120
not I am anything in particular but we'll see as we go into this

25
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,920
that that uh the feeling of I amness that there's a locust there's a kind of

26
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,920
a place or something kind of a concentrated area of a a concentration

27
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,720
or a coagulation a contraction or a pressure point

28
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:07,680
inside that identified emnness that seems to be here no matter what

29
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,599
unconditioned by the by events of the world there's still the one who knows

30
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,959
the one who thinks the one who is and oddly enough because it's so

31
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,400
strange from how we normally live our lives uh this is an activity of the mind

32
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,760
that constructs that that makes that and that quiets down so all the

33
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,959
constructions all the thinking all the the mental formations that have to do

34
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:41,040
around me myself and mine that has to do around

35
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:47,519
I not none of that is rejected none of that is no philosophy that says that

36
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:54,120
that shouldn't be there somat samadei has nothing to do with philosophy nothing to do with

37
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:01,360
beliefs but rather samati is a deep

38
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,519
appreciation that we don't need to

39
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:12,640
do we can let go of what is stressful in the mind we can let go of what is uh

40
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:19,280
hinders a kind of natural radiance of mind the luminosity of mind perhaps

41
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,880
a clarity of mind a peace of mind these are all metaphors rather than looking

42
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,639
for exactly these things themselves maybe metaphors for something

43
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,479
that cannot be discussed so much um the Buddha you know in the description

44
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:44,080
called it a pure clear mind or a clean and clear mind

45
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:51,440
and some of that is uh the softening that relaxing of what is often quite active

46
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,840
for many people in daily life is selfing referring things to myself and how it

47
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,880
affects me and and what the self wants so it's a

48
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:11,360
it's a uh again it's not something we have to do it's not a rejection of self it's not a letting you know in a sense

49
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,560
not quite a letting go of self it's just feeling sensing through the calming through

50
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,000
understanding clinging the disturbances of the mind that they're not those the

51
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,520
activities of selfing are not needed and we can just be we can just be in such a deep way

52
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:40,360
that even the the practice of being a practice of being is too much falls away

53
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,960
so to assume a meditation posture and

54
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:56,639
to one of the associations I have with meditation posture is to assume a dignified

55
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:03,160
somewhat dignified upright posture that

56
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:09,160
somehow allows the the body to be expansive

57
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,960
if maybe simply that the chest is a little more open than usual one way or

58
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:22,720
the other for people on laying down there's a way of kind of adjusting the back so

59
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,479
that um if you're on your on your back to uh get the shoulder blades in the

60
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:37,479
back kind of go down the back a little bit the shoulders a little bit turned and the chest a little bit open

61
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:48,400
maybe rather than having the hands on the body or just to the side to have the hands if you're laying down kind of open

62
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,840
expansive sitting in meditation i like these days to have my

63
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:01,199
hands on my thighs the feeling of more openness a little bit

64
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:10,680
bigger and this idea of a bigger in the posture is the idea is

65
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:17,759
to grow bigger than the skin of snake a

66
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:24,360
skin of the skin like a the snake snake skin that falls

67
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:34,039
off as the snake grows as we take our bigness

68
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,440
the skin of self can begin to crack and fall

69
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:46,080
off we don't have to be here with a lot of selfing and self ideas and

70
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,240
comparisons and right and wrong and worthy and not

71
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:58,800
worthy even thoughts I can and can't do this just become bigger than all of

72
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,919
that gently close your eyes

73
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:15,280
and with a way that maybe you can enjoy slowly take some deeper breaths

74
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:22,319
just deep enough so it stays enjoyable but these deeper breaths again

75
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,319
make your inb breaths make you bigger

76
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,800
big enough to shed thoughts

77
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:40,479
ideas memories feelings that make you

78
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,120
smaller that keep you

79
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:59,839
small and as you exhale long exhale imagine all that keeps you small

80
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:07,040
falls away relaxing the

81
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,959
body and then letting the breathing return to normal

82
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:35,000
and continue feeling the body and on the exhale relaxing the

83
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,800
body sometimes when we relax the muscles they might

84
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:47,200
settle but they might also expand a bit

85
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,880
because they're not held in clenched and there's a way of becoming

86
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,880
larger

87
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:09,200
generally relaxing the body will relax the mental constructs

88
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,560
that we live by relaxing the mental constructs

89
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,440
relaxes the body

90
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,680
and then sitting quietly centering yourself on the breath

91
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:48,079
maybe resting in the resting place at the end of the

92
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:57,000
exhale the grounding place and from there feeling the expansive of the

93
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,360
inhale the return of the exhale feeling that

94
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:10,680
rhythm as a way of helping the mind settle also and relax

95
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,910
as you breathe to see if you can

96
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:06,480
[Music] feel the tension or

97
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:15,240
pressure maybe even clenching that might be

98
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:23,279
associated with the activity of selfing often manifested in the thoughts

99
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,480
that are centered on

100
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:36,079
self the pressure to think the tightness to think that about things related to me

101
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:44,279
myself and mine or

102
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:50,000
perhaps the emotional center of some

103
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,480
emotions that

104
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:06,399
arise from stories and ideas and experiences that we

105
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:13,360
carry as a concern of me myself and mine

106
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:21,399
so the center of self in emotions in thoughts in the

107
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:29,040
body feel that as you inhale and on the

108
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,759
exhale let it fall

109
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:41,000
away let it float away relax

110
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:48,560
that for these few minutes the tension the

111
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:56,880
pressure is so associated with that has any association to me myself and

112
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:05,480
mine is not needed and you can stay

113
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:12,000
large and have the snake of snake skin of self fall

114
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:26,680
away so that a natural way of being that's free of self

115
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:33,040
ideas contractions feelings

116
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:40,040
judgments as a chance to open up

117
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,600
every exhale letting

118
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:01,960
go not of self but any pressure tension

119
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:08,679
activity activation in the body and

120
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:14,440
mind connected to selfing self-

121
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:22,640
concern self assertion self

122
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:33,799
imagination letting go of it all

123
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,080
and as we come to the end of the

124
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:31,440
sitting to feel and sense any way that you feel calmer or

125
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,360
more settled than the

126
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,679
beginning or any way that you are

127
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:50,360
not in either way

128
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,320
and you for the last few moments

129
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:03,400
here let go of anything that is not

130
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:09,240
calm anything that is not peaceful

131
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,360
even if it's just letting it recede a bit to the

132
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:25,120
periphery let go of

133
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,520
holding let go of

134
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,919
resistance let go of pressure

135
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,440
let go of wanting and not

136
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:53,200
wanting and as you do

137
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:04,919
so does that soften any self-

138
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:09,320
concern self-p preoccupation

139
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:30,559
and in the middle of it all maybe there's some feeling

140
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:37,559
sense of a clear clean

141
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:45,120
awareness that takes a form of a radical

142
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:55,840
simplicity just to be alive is enough for these few moments nothing

143
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:02,279
more is needed and to sit here quietly

144
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:11,200
peacefully allowing the body the mind to breathe to

145
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:20,919
exist with as with nothing extra at the center of awareness

146
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:40,960
like an open window that allows sights and

147
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:49,000
sounds to come and go freely

148
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:54,158
so open

149
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:03,520
awareness clear clean

150
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:15,799
awareness with which you allow yourself to feel

151
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:20,158
see the people of this

152
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,720
world where that clear seeing is a

153
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:39,720
gift a gift that you don't impose yourself your self- ideas self

154
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:47,640
assertions needs and desires onto others

155
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:56,480
you don't require them to activate their self their ideas

156
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:02,360
of self in your open

157
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:07,799
awareness all things are allowed to be themselves for a few

158
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:12,200
moments just this

159
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:26,000
and then connecting it all a simple goodwill and

160
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:32,039
care that wishes for the well-being of all

161
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:43,320
beings may all beings be happy may all beings be safe

162
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:50,640
may all beings be

163
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:58,120

[Music]

165
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,919
thank you

166
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:19,240
so hello and welcome to this and be the last talk on the samadei

167
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:25,840
series and um and the idea is that uh

168
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:31,000
uh when when I'll be away for three weeks we have guests coming to replace

169
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,960
me and then when I come back in a sense I'll do the second part

170
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:44,600
of this series which will switch to vipasana to the clear seeing to

171
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,720
insight and the reason for that or how this works is that uh there's a

172
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:57,360
traditional Buddhist idea that Um the purpose of samadei to to go into the

173
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:04,399
jannaas or deep concentrated states is for the purpose of then at some point uh

174
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:10,878
coming into a capacity for deep insight deep seeing

175
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:16,480
there's something about the clarity of mind and the softness of the mind the

176
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:23,200
the readiness malleability of the mind in deep states of meditation that uh

177
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:31,839
predisposes it to both see clearly but more importantly to have the mind let go

178
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:38,440
of any clinging which is not needed and I say it that way that's not

179
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:45,118
needed so that's a little bit more welcoming this idea of letting go and uh

180
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:52,000
and it's a little bit of a I don't know a trick in that there is no

181
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:59,040
clinging that's needed but until you know that don't worry about it if it's not needed if you

182
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:05,040
see that let it go let it go let it go but the ability to let go the ability to

183
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:11,680
relax the ability ability to calm the overactivated mind is part of what

184
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:18,640
samadei helps us to do and so samadei in Buddhism is not an end to itself but is

185
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:26,160
a means to discovering the end of suffering a means to let go of what

186
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:35,839
often is impossible to understand how to let go of there's uh feelings of distress dismay depression sadness uh

187
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:41,520
all kinds of deep emotional pain that people carry that it's inconceivable how

188
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,560
can this be let go this is who I am this is the nature of the world this is the

189
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,960
consequence of my how I live my life and this is how I'm stuck

190
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:57,280
with and uh and it certainly can feel like that in ordinary states of mind and

191
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:03,119
there might not be an avenue in to let go of it in a conscious way but uh in

192
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:09,680
this very deep quiet and and peace and well-being of samadei uh unusual things

193
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,040
begin to happen in terms of the ability to let go the ability to see clearly the

194
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:21,839
ability to heal uh samadei is also a healing phenomena and uh we can't I

195
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:30,800
shouldn't underestimate how significant it is to allow the well-being the goodness of samadei to recondition us

196
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:40,560
from the uh difficult conditioning we've had growing up or through our lives which is uh can be so deep um that

197
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:46,640
um I was really surprised when I sat my long retreats to get the mind so still

198
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:53,040
and quiet kind of going into kind of the deepest places of my mind and find that there was things I was attached to that

199
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:59,599
I had no idea I was attached to um and um and one of my thoughts was kind of in

200
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:08,960
kind of in surprise about it all was how did I let those people into my mind that deeply and uh

201
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:14,160
that doesn't make any sense them to be have occupied taken up space in that

202
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,920
depth of my mind that is so personal that's a place of that doesn't you know

203
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:25,920
you know that uh where I should be free I shouldn't be caught I shouldn't be preoccupied

204
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:31,359
with these people these kinds of activities um that's not that's kind of

205
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:39,920
like being possessed in some way so um so samadei really helps

206
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:48,240
so we go through this process of samadei of the deepening the the stability of mind

207
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,359
deepening the settleness of mind deepening the unification of mind

208
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:59,839
deepening the calming of the mind uh filling out into the vast

209
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:06,880
uh centerness simplicity and that simplicity matures in the fourth Janna

210
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:14,640
where it's radically simple and one of the things that um uh you becomes comes

211
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:19,839
into highlight better more and more as we go deeper into samadei is when

212
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:25,520
selfing when attachment to self in any kind of way attachment to self-image

213
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:31,119
attachment to uh ideas of self ide attachment to what the self needs what

214
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:39,680
what's right what's wrong with self any kind of attachment to emotions connected to self thoughts judgment connect to of

215
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,960
we start seeing them in more highlight and we see that they're not needed so we

216
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,400
see how they diminish us how they um uh

217
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:56,680
disturb us how they um uh in a certain kind of way take us

218
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:03,599
away from deep in a deep intimacy with ourselves if we use that word self all

219
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:10,880
the time so it's it's almost like preoccupation with self takes us away from the self pre preoccupation of self

220
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,920
takes us away from a deeper intimacy with uh with who we are that's it's a

221
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:22,359
little bit oddly enough too much preoccupation in self caught up in self for example in extreme diversion

222
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:28,800
narcissism or heavy duty conceit delusions of grander is in fact an

223
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,359
alienation from self and then losing touch with ourselves in that

224
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:39,839
process so deep samadei we start seeing how this works and we see we're better

225
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:47,520
off to let go let go and not to have any preoccupation with self and the metaphor

226
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:53,720
in the fourth Janna I kind of see as being expressing this in this to me in a nice

227
00:39:53,720 --> 00:40:02,320
way as a person uh sits covered from head down with a white cloth

228
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:07,839
um so there's no part of its whole body there's not covered by that white cloth

229
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:15,640
no part of the whole body is not covered or sat filled with a clean clear

230
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:21,040
mind and um what I like about this idea of being covered with a cloth is that

231
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:26,480
the details of a person are not seen someone walking by they don't see

232
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:32,320
something they don't see their physical characteristics very well a lot of the details of who they are what their

233
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:37,920
gender is what all kinds of things about the person are not seen uh but you see

234
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:44,000
the general outline just this is a human being there and um and it's not just

235
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,359
others but also ourselves uh we're not caught up anymore with our particular

236
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:54,560
physical characteristics or our particular emotional capacities or

237
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:00,720
particular mental activities or what our thoughts do these recede and settle away

238
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:06,880
and so there's this beautiful feeling of uh m maybe some a piece of cloth that's

239
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:14,160
very very clean un unt unarnished uh uh beautiful letting a beautiful sunlight

240
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:20,480
come through that's very peaceful and clear that uh we that without even

241
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:26,119
ourselves seeing all the details that we've been so caught up in maybe for a

242
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:32,560
lifetime and so there's much less self in these deep Janna and uh and then

243
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:39,440
there's because of that there's insight to seeing when self arises to

244
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:45,280
see the idea of self and and you see very clearly that's just an idea that's

245
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,800
just a thought um the thought doesn't really represent what's really most more

246
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:57,280
intimate deeper more fuller more true about what's here in this lived life

247
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:02,960
and then there might be a letting go so with the fourth Janna in

248
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:10,400
particular we are um uh the fourth J in particular we're

249
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:16,480
ready for this insight part of the practice so when I return in three weeks

250
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:22,960
uh we'll start uh with that journey together and just as uh we've done this journey

251
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:29,520
with the samadei and um and you don't have to have experienced the fourth genre for

252
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:36,560
this that is not what I've been expecting through this series but I wanted to give you a feel for it a sense

253
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:43,520
for it for those of you and some of you it might be relevant someday or it is already uh some of you it might just

254
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:50,800
kind of help you trust this process and and understand the process and the principles of letting go of being

255
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,560
settled and studied and unified that uh you don't have to go into Janna but it

256
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:02,480
it will help you be be prepared to go through something similar

257
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:09,839
through the pasta insight practice there is a correlary to uh samadei janna in

258
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:16,319
doing deep insight work and that's called insight janna vipasa janna and um

259
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:24,800
so um we'll have the chance to talk about that a little bit when when I return so I want to thank you all very

260
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:33,440
very much for coming along for these 60 talks on samadei and I hope that uh this

261
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:39,040
has uh been supportive for you and made it interesting for you this world of

262
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:47,760
samadei some of you maybe are noviceses to it and um and that uh rather than making you

263
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:54,800
experts as samadei my wish is that this uh this series has helped you have a

264
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:02,000
deeper appreciation for this body mind heart deeper appreciation of the natural

265
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,520
processes that are at play here that processes that uh samadei helps us to

266
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:13,839
trust more deeply and uh so um I hope that that helps you

267
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:21,599
settle be more settled on yourself more appreciative of yourself more um uh have

268
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:30,720
greater faith in the process of uh mindfulness samadei meditation and

269
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:35,839
being present for this life that we live may this serve for the benefit of all

270
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:41,359
beings so thank you and um I do look forward to
