1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,319
here we go okay so hello again and welcome to happy hour

2
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:13,019
everyone so for the theme for today

3
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,199
um I'd like to invite us to consider consider

4
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:24,960
wise speech [Music] um truthfulness there are many aspects to

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:33,059
why speech but today specifically um truthfulness as as an expression of

6
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:38,760
matter not just for others but really for ourselves as an expression of care

7
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:45,180
as an expression of love for ourselves so I want to bring those two to Concepts

8
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,480
together for us to sit with and to practice with with the guided meditation and

9
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:58,379
the consideration um is you know we often don't connect the

10
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:07,380
teachings on on Silo and ethical conduct um truthfulness as a subcategory of why

11
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:13,860
speech or being one of this we don't usually connect it with with the Brahma

12
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:21,060
viharas with the heart practices but they are intertwined they aren't they are I mean all of the Dharma is

13
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,880
interconnected to me the more I get into the Dharma all aspects of it

14
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:34,500
um it's like a cloth and you take one you take one thread and you pull it like

15
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,259
oh yes this thread is the whole cloth it's it's so there are all these aspects

16
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:49,560
of these teachings really they they come together so so the the relationship between

17
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:57,479
um truthfulness honesty um as an expression of love so so how

18
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:05,939
are they related many ways but it's formulation consider this um not only is it an act of care and

19
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:11,340
love to to be truthful to others um

20
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:17,099
and to care for them not to deceive them not to be deceitful to offer safety to

21
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:23,640
offer care in that way but even more so even more so it's for ourselves really

22
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:30,480
and I want to emphasize that um because and made me seem counter-intuitive

23
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,379
um this teaching on the Bliss of blamelessness the Bliss of blamelessness

24
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:44,400
it's such a beautiful heart space to have because when we have

25
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,819
done something when something just a little you know we've told uh a lie or

26
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:56,819
we've been untruthful in other ways um it's it's a niggling feeling it

27
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:03,720
doesn't sit right it doesn't feel right and it can lead to all kinds of other problems and issues and not sleeping

28
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,000
well and and and and and just the the heart being riled up the heart being

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,640
riled up so as a way to really love ourselves and

30
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,220
care for this being who is me offering themselves offering ourselves offering

31
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:28,739
ourselves this gift of honesty ah what a relief what a relief and you

32
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:36,900
might actually remember or as I'm telling as I'm sharing this briefed our

33
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:44,540
met consider times that maybe there was a niggling feeling or something that you're not quite truthful about or or or

34
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:50,519
kind of sitting with should I do it this way or that way and and maybe

35
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:56,599
in maybe in in reality it it caused a lot of trouble Pro for you and others

36
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:02,280
and also maybe you can remember a case where there was a sense of clearing a

37
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:09,000
Clarity a clearing of of um resolution that there was this maybe

38
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,099
um say something untruthful or unethical

39
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:20,340
and then when you actually did the right thing there was a sense of release there was a sense of release for you and

40
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:26,940
relief for yourself and someone as an act of care for yourself gosh this was so easy why didn't I do this earlier

41
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:32,880
this was would have been so easy to to tell the truth and and and and act

42
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,380
ethically so so in Praise of honesty and praise of truthfulness

43
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:46,919
as an act of matter it's an act of care as an act of offering safety offering

44
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:52,740
um love and care for ourselves especially for ourselves as well as others because it's interesting whenever

45
00:04:52,740 --> 00:05:00,180
we think of honesty we usually think oh yeah honest for the sake of others yes true absolutely but I'm trying to

46
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:07,759
bring in different aspect of it here which we usually don't consider how important it is for

47
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,320
our benefit really um there's also another thing I want to

48
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:19,199
briefly connect with it is with the five Daily Reflections the

49
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:25,340
fifth one having to do with Karma excuse me I'm gonna cough

50
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:33,180
where the fifth reflection is that I'm the heir to my actions born of my

51
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:41,160
actions um and I have my actions as my arbitrator and protection whatever I do

52
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:47,699
for good or bad of these I shall become the heir and this sense of

53
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:54,120
of our actions really impact ourselves first and foremost so do we want to care

54
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:02,580
for ourselves do we want to love ourselves not rile ourselves up and cause problems for

55
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:09,960
ourselves in in our future selves um so for our consideration for our

56
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,020
consideration and again the invitation is not to feel tight about

57
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:21,180
honesty truthfulness why speech but actually see it as a gift see it as a

58
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:28,979
gift of love to see it as a gift of protection we give ourselves first and foremost yes others too but forget about

59
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:36,300
them for a moment really the the sense of filling our own cup with care with our own care with our own truthfulness

60
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:42,780
honesty um why speech so

61
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:49,440
so offered for your reflection and now let's uh let's sit together let's

62

205
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:27,200
thanks everyone thanks for your practice

206
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:34,260
ah so as always no there's so many different aspects and

207
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:40,380
dimensions too to practice of the Brahma viharos and it

208
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:47,400
really as I mentioned it ties into the rest of the teachings including truthfulness as an offering

209
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:54,119
safety to ourselves and others and I wonder whether as you were doing this

210
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:59,820
practice what came up for you this really recognizing the the goodness and

211
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:07,619
truthfulness and and how a pride actually how good it feels that when it's so easy to to say a white light but

212
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:12,660
just to say tell the truth how easy how good it feels how it's a reaffirmation

213
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:19,380
of goodness it's a gift to ourselves and also if it's ever been the case when

214
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:25,500
when in your life maybe there's been a reckoning and actually that maybe that was a a

215
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:33,240
relief oh yes oh yeah I was holding this I was holding this heaviness this rock on on truthfulness for a long time and

216
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:40,160
now gosh it's so ah what how Blissful will that have to carry this anymore

217
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:47,880
so I invite your Reflections I'm changing the chat settings you can send

218
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:55,020
um chats to the to everyone or if you send it to me it'll be private I won't read your name you can also raise your

219
00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:00,660
Zoom hand not your physical hand because I cannot see you there are too many of

220
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:06,200
you I do see Richard's Zoom head Richard please

221
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:13,619
oh you're doing can you hear me uh this practice you know I'm very happy

222
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:20,339
about it it's been it's really allowed me led me to be much more myself I speak

223
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:28,579
much more freely much more naturally on occasion I'll Express

224
00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:35,220
happiness over some good news that I've had and I'll I'll make somebody in my

225
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:40,680
audience will feel bad that you know they haven't had the same good luck the

226
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:47,160
same good fortune and you know it's almost like to be truly wise you have to

227
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:53,460
shut up all the time and and I I don't quite know how to make that

228
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:59,160
bounce yeah yeah thank you Richard it's a great question

229
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:05,099
and and multiple things it's it's in also about how we share and with whom we

230
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:11,579
share right so truthfulness um it's as we talked about it tonight you

231
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:18,780
know if there is a piece of good news and say um [Music] but I'm gonna make an extreme case but

232
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:24,900
say you just start you know you you're falling in love and it's a new relationship and you're so excited about

233
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:30,359
it and and yet maybe there is a friend you have who's just had who's whose

234
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:37,560
partner has just left them or or has died right so gushing it's it's maybe it

235
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:44,940
means it's not very wise right it's so wisdom comes in there so it's not very wise to I mean it's truthful to say oh

236
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:50,339
yes but it's not very wise it's not very caring it's not very compassionate to

237
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:57,780
gaussians how awesome it is and uh so so I think wisdom here uh when you in this

238
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:04,500
special specific case that you're talking about so wisdom when it's not appropriate to be gushing and and of

239
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:11,000
course that can bring up grief and sadness and not mudita not vicarious joy for the other person

240
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,140
and then also there are cases with with folks maybe with some people in your

241
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:23,700
life where um it's it's part of their work it's part of their practice of of

242
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:29,579
um of Envy or jealousy that so that's something in general they're working with so it may not be a bad timing

243
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:35,820
because with why speech there are five different aspects through one is it has to be not just truthful but it has to be

244
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:40,980
timely so in this case that I laid out may not be Timely

245
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:47,640
and in the case of and also with with Y speech there's also um kindness so it may not be actually

246
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:52,680
kind for you to gosh when you know this person has a tendency to get into go

247
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:58,260
into envy and and self recommendation that they don't so knowing all those it

248
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:03,720
may not be kind right so all those aspects of why speech are not satisfied

249
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:10,800
so you have to be wise it's not it's different it's it's not just truthful but it's like sharing your good news and

250
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,380
boasting about it or or it's it's a special case does that make sense the

251
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:24,000
distinction yeah great thanks for that question the other questions are reflections more

252
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,119
generally about truthfulness about the theme of the the uh practice that we just did together

253
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:35,940
with sense of safety sense of e seeing our own goodness

254
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:41,420
what came up for you Jamie please

255
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:49,200
um well I I need to leave a little early tonight Nikki and I just wanted to say thank you before I leave

256
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:57,420
um now I I was adopted and I think as a child I was a bit of a square peg in the round

257
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:04,320
hole of my adopted family even though they were loving and did their best for me um I didn't and I didn't really want to

258
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:09,720
see uh the ways in which you know my family and I were not a

259
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:15,960
perfect fit and so truthfulness didn't it's actually come easily as a result of that and

260
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:21,839
somehow this this set just allowed me to see that and that it's okay to be honest now

261
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:28,020
well thank you thank you Jamie thank you so much for sharing that so beautiful

262
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:34,800
yeah it's it's yeah so it's okay not only okay but it feels good in your in

263
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:41,280
your voice I was hearing the sense of fullness yes it's okay to be truthful now it's the fullness of your heart is

264
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:48,480
coming through through the line thank you so much Amy yeah I see yeah thanks

chat you can raise your hand we still have another couple minutes

267
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:09,660
so it's a big topic anything else anything that didn't work

268
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:13,160
for you but that's okay too

269
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:21,960
brag please I really appreciated that the second

270
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:27,839
piece you added there about other aspects of white speech a friend

271
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:35,760
of mine once said to me Brock you wield the truth like a hammer so what are the other other ones you said it was timely

272
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:41,819
kind yeah truthful yeah so so I have I have an acronym for myself let's see if

273
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:49,160
I can remember all of it TT ttb GK timely truthful uh beneficial

274
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:55,560
beneficial uh gentle okay kind

275
00:43:55,560 --> 00:44:00,900
thank you those are the five aspects of it yeah aspects and all all five are

276
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:06,740
important thanks Brad great

277
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:12,119
Reflections all thank you for the reflections and questions so

278
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:21,240
so now here's the invitation for our small Sangha practice this evening is

279
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:27,900
um the here is the um the question is appropriate somebody

280
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:34,440
sent in it that's not one of the five because I think basically if you do all the five appropriate becomes it becomes

281
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:42,180
appropriate it becomes part of why speech so so the question so the reflection for

282
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:47,819
the small groups tonight is regarding you know the sense of as

283
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:53,280
you feel your body as you feel your sense of integrity as you feel

284
00:44:53,280 --> 00:45:01,800
into the sense of Integrity of taking your seat feel how that feels different uh how

285
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:08,640
that feels different in in leaning into the truth or not leaning into

286
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:16,079
forthrightness into honesty into into why speech so so it's an exploration of

287
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:22,980
embodied the embodiment of this uh this why speech with care with kindness

288
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:28,339
towards yourself so just each person will have a minute to have a monologue

289
00:45:28,339 --> 00:45:35,819
of of [Music] um um us speaking out loud exploring and being

290
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:41,339
held witnessed I'm going to set up the groups and someone asked what do you mean by

291
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:46,380
beneficial beneficial means but of the benefit of beneficial for the other

292
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:52,619
person so when you're saying something yourself is of benefit it's a benefit for the other person's benefit for

293
00:45:52,619 --> 00:46:00,000
others it's not to make your ego uh bigger that that's what beneficial means

294
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:09,900
okay so so let's uh let's turn to the breakout

295
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:16,500
so so again take care of yourselves take care of each other be kind uh only speak

296
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:24,480
from your own experience and um yeah not leading Joy just speaking from

297
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:31,859
your own experience and then if you want to pass you can pass and hold uh

298
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:38,819
compassionate silent space for others you can just say pass and it's an interesting exploration the embodiment

299
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:43,980
with care and the theme that we've been exploring tonight so uh and then next

300
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:50,220
person will talk and next person will talk and if there is time we'll come back to you so so I'm creating the rooms

301
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:56,099
now take care of yourselves take care of each other be kind and and enjoy this

302
00:46:56,099 --> 00:46:59,720
exploration here we go

303
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:11,579
close everybody's back so I would love to maybe um hear one or two Reflections if we

304
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:18,318
have time maybe one reflection what did you discover if you haven't spoken yet please

305
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:27,119
Serena hi thank you for letting me ask this

306
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:34,280
question um I've had a very difficult relationship with my sister

307
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:40,220
and um I really have been working on this forever

308
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:47,579
and I sent her loving kindness I wish her

309
00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:53,300
well when we

310
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:59,099
uh however when there are situa family situations

311
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:05,660
where we're both present and she takes over

312
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:11,640
and whatever Dynamics happened I always wind up leaving the place

313
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:21,740
feeling uh wounded feeling yeah like I somehow

314
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:28,680
a lot of the time I don't leave the place feeling okay

315
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:34,800
so I really

316
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:41,579
don't know what you know what else to do besides saying from her yeah yeah it

317
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:48,060
sounds it's it's it's it's a um thank you for asking that question it also does seem like you've done the

318
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:54,900
complicated Dynamics and and for the given that it's already actually 701 to go into detail but this is one thing

319
00:48:54,900 --> 00:49:02,339
that I can say Serena um and that is you know there's still what I'm hearing is yes you are doing

320
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:08,160
meta for her compassion for her and and and and please do it for yourself I didn't hear that you're doing it for

321
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:14,700
yourself because you're the one who's who's feeling hurt and leaving wounded so it's important for meta and

322
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:20,640
compassion to be uh 360 degrees but also to do meta and compassion for the two of

323
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:27,119
you who are entangled in this way in this life to to do Mets and compassion for the relationship and then let go of

324
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:33,480
the outcome let go of the outcome I think you're still attached like that's the sense I have attached to things

325
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:39,300
going particular way maybe they won't in this lifetime but still so release your

326
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:45,599
heart but continue to do release your heart from expectations and and continue

327
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:52,380
to have compassion for her for yourself and for the two of you entangled in the relationship

328
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:58,680

329
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:06,660
this topic tonight quite uh yeah quiet intense and related to meta and care for

330
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:11,760
ourselves and others so thank you all for your practice mayor practice be of

331
