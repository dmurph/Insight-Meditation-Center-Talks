00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:07,200
so hello and welcome to happy hour

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,559
wherever you are on this planet of ours in whatever condition in this moment

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,680
for your body for your heart for your mind

4
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,960
so for today's practice the theme i'd like to invite us to explore together

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:34,800
is the theme of um practicing compassion practicing care

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,960
holding suffering with love both giving and receiving

7
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,360
happy everywhere in the past we have explored many times we have explored giving and

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:55,360
receiving of meta loving kindness friendliness where we share our good will and care for

9
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,719
people we care about and we also receive from others

10
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,240
we receive or for ourselves the sense of goodness

11
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,560
good wishes friendliness well-being kindness care so many different

12
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,680
translations of the word metta similarly there is the practice of

13
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,439
compassion which is very similar to meta but met when met metta

14
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,880
holds suffering when meta meets suffering and friendliness kindness holds

15
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,280
suffering it gets expressed as compassion so [Music]

16
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,520
many many times in your life i have no doubt i have no doubt that you

17
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,799
have been there for someone for some being maybe a child maybe a pet an adult a

18
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,560
friend who has been in a challenging situation

19
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:03,040
either physically maybe they've been hurt or emotionally they were going through a hard time and you were

20
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,119
you were there for them maybe it was just simply holding presents and listening

21
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,440
just making them not feel alone in the world

22
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:22,160
and i also fully trust that each of us each of us in our humanity

23
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,400
have had times where something someone has been there for us

24
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:36,000
has supported us it's given us inspiration support care

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,360
maybe with just their presence being there could have been a teacher a coach a parent a relative

26
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:52,560
a friend or sometimes a stranger just being there for us supporting us

27
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,040
so this idea of giving and receiving giving compassion holding others in

28
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,319
compassion when we have the resources when we have the

29
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,400
stability of mind and heart to support others through a rough time

30
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,920
whatever it might be and many other times in our lives when

31
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:23,440
we are in need when we appreciate a holding hand a supportive ear a patient ear to listen

32
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:30,159
to us maybe a friend on the phone just listening just letting us share

33
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:38,400
being there for us feeling cared for so we have both received compassion

34
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:46,640
care where we have been suffering and our suffering has been met with kindness by another

35
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,959
by patience by listening by presence and when somebody else is

36
00:03:52,959 --> 00:04:02,799
suffering we have held we have met it with our kindness with our patience just with our presence

37
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:10,480
so in this practice today we will bring we'll bring we'll tap

38
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:18,479
into this felt sense memory in our body of

39
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:25,280
just one time doesn't have to be a whole panoply of of situations just

40
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,040
one situation is enough if you want to bring more you're welcome

41
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:38,479
to where someone has been there for us

42
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,600
when we're suffering and also tapping into this felt memory

43
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,520
felt sense of the memory of when we've been there for someone else giving compassion even if we didn't

44
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:58,720
think much of it like oh yeah it's not that big of it it's like but yeah it's like this giving compassion is very simple

45
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:05,440
maybe it's just being on the phone with someone with a friend who's going through a hard time being

46
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,800
there for them just as simply as that as helen keller

47
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:19,199
says to sweeten someone's pain your life is not in vain

48
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:27,680
to sweeten someone's pain your life is not in vain

49
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:35,360
so let's practice together i'd like to invite you

50
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,320

reflection if just sent to me alone i'll only read

195
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,240
the reflection not your name or you can raise your hand what was this like for you

196

what did you discover in this practice

197
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:51,200
of giving and receiving what was surprising what showed up what

198
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:56,560
was difficult anything is welcome and your

199
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:11,839

200
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:24,800
also thank you to those on the youtube practicing your appreciations coming on youtube

201
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:31,920
thank you all so

202
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:38,960
as i wait yes so one reflection sometimes when people didn't show

203
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:46,400
compassion to me those situations came to mind so i offered forgiveness beautiful

204
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,760
beautiful yeah beautiful

205
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:58,720
i love reading how wisely you adapted this practice for

206
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:04,880
yourself to go in a wholesome direction of offering forgiveness

207
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:13,119
beautiful thank you for that insight another reflection a lot of sukkah

208
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:19,280
came up but it somehow felt okay to admit to it

209
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:28,079
i am encouraged enough that it left me and i later felt peaceful and kind

210
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:34,079
ah nice mary um just making sure did i read that okay

211
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:39,520
so you meant sukkah not dukkha right a lot of sukkah came up but it somehow felt okay

212
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:44,640
oh dukkha you meant dukkha that was a misspelling okay just to be okay so i'll reread it because

213
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:50,319
the second phrase didn't make sense okay great all right we'll bow to that i'll read it

214
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:56,560
again a lot of dukkha came up but it somehow felt okay to admit it

215
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:03,839
great great beautiful of course of course it's a part of compassion

216
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:11,280
to admit to to allow the tuka to be not to push it away beautiful and then the second part i'm

217
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,720
encouraged though that it left me and i later felt

218
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,839
peaceful and kind beautiful and by turning towards it

219
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:28,160
actually more peace and kindness can open up by acknowledging it yeah thank you for

220
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:33,359
that reflection yes please stand oops

221
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:40,960
wait i'm having computer difficulty here we go sam please um

222
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,799
yeah i've just been feeling a lot of stress today and

223
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,310
maybe i didn't even realize how much stress i was feeling you can tell i was in the meditation

224
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:59,920
[Music] and then it all kind of just came together

225
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:07,280
pretty heavily um i'm glad that i was aware of it more aware of it

226
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,880
even though i still feel it you know pretty strongly you know i guess i was kind of wishing

227
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:19,359
it would just go away of course but but the awareness is good

228
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:24,720
yeah yeah thanks for the reflection and what i appreciate is when you

229
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:30,319
brought up this sense of so much stress i think you used the word stress i

230
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:36,720
stressed you were and you may know that the word dukkha or

231
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:43,920
suffering is often translated as stress we don't think of stress as dukkha so

232
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:51,040
i'll paraphrase what you said i didn't realize how much dukkha was present all day until i sat

233
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:56,160
with the meditation realized wow there's a lot of dukkha present

234
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:01,839
and it's good to be aware of the dukkha because it's here anyway so might as well meet it with

235
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:10,079
kindness that's my paraphrase of what you said sam how is that is that okay that's very good thank you great great

236
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:17,359
thank you thank you so much yeah so

237
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:24,800
so dear ones let's uh turn to practice in small groups

238
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:32,079
and uh in small groups of three or four and it will start as always with

239
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:37,920
15 seconds of silent compassion uh

240
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:45,280
for each other for ourselves and each other for any suffering any dukkha any stress

241
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:52,800
that might be here in our lives as we all have and then after that

242
00:44:52,800 --> 00:45:00,560
listening to each other holding space for one another and for yourself holding whatever is

243
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:08,319
coming up whatever is coming up being for each other so i've created the rooms

244
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:13,680
and such an important place the rubber meets the road where we can be

245
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:19,520
present for each other so i'm going to open the rooms now take care of yourself

246
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:26,720
take care of each other slow down slow down here we go

247
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:37,359
okay welcome back everyone welcome back

248
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:43,920
i see so many smiles after the uh groups it's so sweet

249
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:51,119
so we have a few minutes or any reflections that have come up any

250
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:58,000
insights from discussing yes please kneel

251
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:06,720
so this was the lovely practice by the way um one of the things i noticed was that

252
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:12,319
as the meditation went on and there you know there were sort of like two rounds right

253
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:21,200
someone taking care of you you taking care of someone and then you know a repeat of that that you know that i really appreciated

254
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:28,160
the the last taking care of someone right by the time we got to that you know you know all the all the love

255
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:35,359
and feeling cared for and feeling safe and protected really really sort of you know you know got my compassion

256
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:40,400
juices flowing if you will i think i think that's the buddha said that somewhere along the line

257
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,920
um you know so yeah it was it was you know it was very interesting how it

258
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,359
encouraged you know you know that you know you know being

259
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:56,880
grateful for you know for the caring you know and and you know in some sense nurturing

260
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:04,400
yourself really opened the doors to taking care of others yeah yeah beautiful yeah thank you so we

261
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:11,040
appreciate you naming that that you notice that oh you're going the back and forth in the

262
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:18,160
back keeps opening up more into feeling the care and being available to offer more care

263
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:25,040
to others yeah thank you for noticing that meal that was that was the intention that was
