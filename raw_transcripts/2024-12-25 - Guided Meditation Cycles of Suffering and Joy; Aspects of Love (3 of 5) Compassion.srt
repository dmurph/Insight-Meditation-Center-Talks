1
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:08,639
so I'm seeing as I sit down getting ready to teach here all the chats that

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:18,240
offer such wonderful greetings both morning greetings and seasonal greetings and uh it kind of

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,960
makes me kind of feel H kind of very happy and delighted

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:30,320
to for to be able to be here sharing this time sharing this purpose for we're

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:40,039
gathered here and thank you for being here um so in the way that this was

6
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:45,640
going to unfold here this week the different forms of love that get

7
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,840
emphasized in Buddhism Monday I talked about anukampa

8
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:58,039
the word I translate as care yesterday meta which I mostly translated as

9
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:03,600
friendliness and today we have the word uh

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:12,200
karuna which is normally translated as compassion and um so this is one of the

11
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:18,000
inspiring and beautiful qualities of the heart but it's kind of a mixed thing

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,720
because uh compassion arises is born from the experience of suffering in this

13
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,960
world and so the idea is to hold them both

14
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,240
to hold the the suffering of the world and

15
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:45,880
and then maybe simultaneously to hold a certain kind of profound sense of goodness within us

16
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:53,880
which is compassion compassion free of fear free of distress free of feeling

17
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,840
helpless or hopeless compassion that can flow freely

18
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,439
uh as the simple wish the aspiration I love the word

19
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:11,920
aspiration because it's connected to the word for breath respiration in

20
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,480
Latin um the simple aspiration the and profound aspiration

21
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:26,200
to uh wish others well wish others that their suffering might end that their

22
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:32,879
suffering might dissolve or pass past for

23
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,440
them and for me in um uh in my early

24
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:44,040
years of doing Buddhist practice uh it was uh not

25
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,760
intentional that I sat with my own suffering I knew I was practicing to

26
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,800
come to an end of my suffering because but um but what

27
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,800
I uh what I was taught to do was simply to be present for it

28
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:08,920
and then not try to fix it not try to understand it and not try to dissolve it or not to use not to use an

29
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:15,120
antidote but just to be with it and uh and to learn how to be with it really

30
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:23,319
simply and the effect that had on me it uh it it was it it tenderized me it

31
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:30,159
softened the edges of the suffering soften the reactivities I had to suffering soften the second Arrow that

32
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:37,200
were added on top of the first and that process of softening

33
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,239
tenderizing then started to not just be on the edges but started to penetrate

34
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,200
into the suffering itself and that was what uh began to

35
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,799
dissolve some of the big sufferings I brought with me to the

36
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:59,040
Dharma and uh so there wasn't like this you know rapid end there wasn't like

37
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,760
this magic Insight that suddenly now I'm free of suffering but there was a thawing of it

38
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:13,599
the melting of suffering and um and so learning how to be present for

39
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:19,600
suffering is in fact part of what the Dharma is but how to do it

40
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,759
so it doesn't undermine us how to do it so we don't get depressed or feel like

41
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:31,479
we're suffering more and how to do it with faith and confidence that that it's actually very

42
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:39,080
wholesome there or there is a very Wholesome Way of tending um maybe in a friendly way in a

43
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:45,639
caring way to our suffering and one of those is in fact to

44
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:51,080
um to um meet their suffering with

45
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:59,240
compassion to recognize in us that there is the desire to have it melt to have it

46
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,960
go away way to have it not be there not out of aversion not out of

47
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,280
desperation but rather something deeper than those in the heart it's the heart's

48
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:19,000
song the heart heart sings compassion may I be free of suffering

49
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,360
May others be free of suffering and in that way it's actually

50
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,240
possible to connect uh compassion to a kind of a Joy

51
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:38,440
or kind of a something really good within us and have that also

52
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:46,600
spread so I'd like to offer you uh a form of practice that I call um

53
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:54,319
practicing the cycles of Dua and Suka uh the cycle of just like there's

54
00:05:54,319 --> 00:06:01,840
the U water cycles in Environmental Studies or oxygen Cycles so there are

55
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,840
the cycles within us of Dua and Suka of

56
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:15,039
suffering and happiness and to they can coexist in a beautiful important way and this is

57
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:24,080
somewhat like tongling practice in Tibetan Buddhism and um and it uh but it's the

58
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,919
the cycle goes in two different directions uh when we're feeling our own

59
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,000
suffering then in the in the exhale uh

60
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,039
uh exhale let it flow out of you and not into the world but maybe up into the

61
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:49,960
space let it flow out of you and uh and then on the inhale um the

62
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:56,879
um uh and and in that flow and then they inhale feel the happiness feel some

63
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:03,240
well-being feel the joy or the goodness or the rightness of just being there to

64
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:10,280
feel the suffering so feeling happiness some kind of Happiness as you breathe in

65
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:16,800
and then sending the suffering out as you breathe out that's one direction of

66
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:25,160
the cycle the other is when uh you feel pretty stable and somewhat uh resolved

67
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:32,400
in some of the deeper uh scars we might carry because we don't want to activate them more

68
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:39,560
there comes a time when sometimes we can do it the other way this is more like tonglin where we we actually imagine

69
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:45,159
ourselves breathing in the suffering of the world we receive it because it's

70
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:51,240
really helpful for people to know they the others know their suffering are witnessing their suffering that they're

71
00:07:51,240 --> 00:08:01,639
not alone in their suffering and then on the exhale to um to uh send out your

72
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:07,560
joy into the world so when it's your own suffering to

73
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,479
breathe in joy and happiness and exhale suffering out when

74
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:21,080
it's the suffering of the world breathe in that suffering and offer out to the world your joy and

75
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,280
happiness so if you'd like to do this if it feels appropriate for you you can do

76
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:33,360
it I'm not going to lead you through it uh it's because I I don't want anyone to feel like they have to do it but if

77
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:41,560
you'd like for this sitting today you might try uh these two cycles of duka

78
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:49,320
Suka Suka Dua so to assume a meditation

79
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:59,600
posture and part of assuming a meditation posture is in a subtle kind

80
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,640
of way organizing your body so you're beginning to P gather

81
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:15,279
together all the different parts of your body so that they work

82
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:25,959
together part of the reason to relax the

83
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:31,800
body is because it helps that bringing it together Gathering it together into

84
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,519
one organized Cooperative

85
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:53,000
body and feeling the body more broadly as part of this Gathering organizing of

86
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,560
the body taking a few long slow deep breaths

87
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,360
a lengthy

88
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,920
exhale and in and then breathing in deeply and

89
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,000
exhaling fully feel your

90
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,920
body to see if anything can be shifted in your

91
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:28,200
posture so your body is more aligned

92
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,440
more in harmony with

93
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:55,600
itself then letting your breathing return to normal and centering yourself on your

94
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,399
breathing where the rhythm of breathing in and

95
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,480
breathing out is like a gentle

96
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:13,600
massage or the gentle lapping of waves up upon the

97
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:35,240
shore and then to in you in this simple way and if you would like if it feels

98
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,560
right to you you might

99
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,480
practice the Suka Dua

100
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:55,680
Cycles breathing in feeling Joy breathing

101
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:01,920
out spread sending out your suffering ing out of

102
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:12,600
yourself or if the opposite is appropriate breathing in

103
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,720
suffering sending out

104
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160

for e

132
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:57,120
as we come to the end of this sitting to appreciate that while we

133
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:04,279
meditate when we feel

134
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:11,960
suffering when we have compassion it's not necessary to

135
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:19,960
understand it the way we're present for it can be

136
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,360
much

137
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:32,919
simpler we offer our pray presence to it we offer to be

138
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:39,799
present and are willing to be open and

139
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:47,480
receive whatever it's like to feel and sense and know

140
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:56,120
suffering but in not knowing it understanding

141
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:04,440
it without judging it it or making a story about it it might make it easier not to be

142
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,360
stuck in suffering or stuck in

143
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:16,559
Joy but rather have it move through

144
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:25,640
us so it's not exactly us but it's not not us it's just something that

145
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:31,720
moves and as we end this sitting that

146
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:37,679
movement can be intentionally inclusive of all

147
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:43,640
beings wishing that somehow this practice we're

148
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:50,320
doing will serve help us serve the

149
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:57,320
world to reduce the amount of suffering the world has to increase the amount of happiness

150
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,039
and joy

151
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:10,000
so without understanding just letting it

152
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,640
move on the inhale breathe in the suffering of the

153
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:22,320
world and on the exhale breathe out whatever Joy

154
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:29,679
well-being you have give it away

155
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:36,480
don't hold on to your own Joy let it go out into the world in such a

156
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:44,000
way in such a generous way that it generates more

157
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:54,960
joy breathing in and the suffering of the world breathing out May all beings be

158
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,960
happy

159
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:08,880
breathing in suffering and transforming it

160
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,679
into may all beings be

161
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:29,559
safe breathing in suffering of the world and letting that inspire

162
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,000
and Inspire dedication may all

163
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,679
beings live

164
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,519

167
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,120
thank you

168
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:05,278
hello and welcome to this third talk on the aspects of love the different forms of Love or flavors of Love

169
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:11,159
or qualities of love and for me I kind

170
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:16,919
of feel that the first one I talked about the simple sometimes quite humble

171
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:23,799
care to offer care um makes the others a lot easier

172
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:28,880
makes the others less likely to be something we latch on to or get attached

173
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,080
to that it's just simple care that gets expressed as friendliness or care that

174
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:40,240
expresses compassion provides the love the friendliness provides the compassion

175
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,399
with a little bit of ease or openness or

176
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:52,399
maybe in some ways supports it from being too heavy and certainly compassion can be

177
00:32:52,399 --> 00:33:00,440
heavy can be a big thing can be overwhelming at time but that's because it's not only compassion we feel

178
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:06,279
compassion in my understanding I don't want to make a claim for everyone but my

179
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:11,639
understanding is compassion always has something light something feeling

180
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:18,720
rightness to it even with there's pain with the compassion it's all happening in a field

181
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:25,720
within us in a heart within us that feels this is it's good given that they're suffering there's a rightness

182
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:31,440
there's a goodness to to feel that

183
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,960
pain and for some uh sometimes compassion is held up in Buddhism as the

184
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:43,600
the most important social emotion and some and sometimes that can can feel

185
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:51,880
that way or it can be that way when we realize the magnitude of suffering in this world and um one of the ways to

186
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:58,440
understand the magnitude is not to read the newspapers and see how big it is in Somalia and Gaza and

187
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:04,399
Ukraine and around the world certainly that's

188
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:10,800
huge but understand that uh in your own mind

189
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:17,158
how this a percentage of the it's the way we think has stress in it has

190
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:23,679
suffering in it and then we realize these ordinary ways of thinking that has some kind of tension built into it

191
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:31,320
unnecessary tension unnecessary Dua uh if this is true for me then it must

192
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,440
be true that the level of suffering is so much faster than I ever thought that

193
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:44,040
human beings carry with them every thought they have sometimes is comes with stress comes with fear comes with

194
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:52,599
aversion comes with greed and um but to encounter the the

195
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:59,400
Nority of it all and have a humility or simp it in it

196
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:05,000
uh to not be the savior of the world not feel like we have to be responsible for

197
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:12,440
fixing all the things but to do something much more profound and that is to be there to

198
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:17,560
witness the humanity of others who are suffering to

199
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:25,079
witness it and listen to it and be present one of the big um moments for me

200
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:31,880
with compassion was uh in the early 1980s I was living in the monastery deep

201
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:39,560
in the mountains and we didn't get news very often but one day there was a I think it was a Time Magazine appeared

202
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:45,839
and I opened it up kind of randomly and there was a multi-age spread and

203
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:51,200
discussion about the Israeli bombing of refugee camps in

204
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:57,400
Beirut and um and I'd been to Beirut as a child and I'd lived on the edge of the

205
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:03,440
m Mediterranean growing up good part of my growing up and so um right next to

206
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,839
the right next to uh what now Yugoslavia town called triesta in

207
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:15,480
Italy and um and uh and so to have to to kind of

208
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:22,839
witness through these photographs the suffering of these refugees and the and the how many of

209
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:29,839
them died uh deeply moved me and one of the strong EST feelings I had was I had

210
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:36,000
to go there we had to Bear witness how important it is to Bear witness and let

211
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,160
people know that they're known of course we should do things as well but that was

212
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:47,400
such a big I didn't feel like I I wasn't motivated to leave the monastery the work I was doing there felt very

213
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:54,640
important but this strong urge and um it was very clean and I've learned in

214
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,920
looking at Compassion myself that it's not always always clean uh it can be

215
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:07,800
burdened it can be entangled with shoulds ideas are shoulds and shouldn't it can be entangled with uh a necessary

216
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,960
burden of sense of responsibility that I have to fix it that I have a

217
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,079
responsibility that I'm somehow un unnecessary degree of of kind

218
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:24,160
of being attached to it or or reacting to it or and adding levels of attachment

219
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:30,319
that take the form of Despair or discouragement dis stress or fear or

220
00:37:30,319 --> 00:37:35,560
anger and um when those when those movements of the heart involve

221
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:42,720
increasing suffering we're actually um causing harm to the

222
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:49,640
suffering of the world we're adding to it we're adding to the distress we're not showing or meeting things with the

223
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:54,920
alternative a different way of doing it and so uh some people have a lot of

224
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:00,720
emphasis on empathy how important empathy is and I think that's depending how we what

225
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,280
we mean by that word empathy is really important but if EMP empathy is feeling

226
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:11,560
what other people are feeling uh in exactly onetoone correspondence I don't

227
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:17,560
think that's necessarily healthy um if someone else is suffering

228
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:24,599
if I'm suffering I don't want someone else to suffer the same way I am to feel my suffering and suffer the same way

229
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:31,040
what I'd like is someone recognizes the suffering maybe something inside of them are is

230
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:36,560
moved that in that um they feel a certain ache they feel a

231
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:42,640
certain heaviness or seriousness or they feel something that tells them yes this

232
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:49,440
is a human being suffering yes this is unfortunate yes uh I have some sense of

233
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:56,440
what you're feeling I I know that you're suffering but without taking it in

234
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:03,800
myself so if anything uh other people's suffering go through me I I feel it and

235
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:09,640
allow to change me and motivate me and and feel compassion but it doesn't stick

236
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:15,800
in me it doesn't it doesn't become more complicated so a big part of Buddhist

237
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:23,560
practice mindfulness practice is to disentangle compassion disentangle love

238
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:30,119
from all the ways we get stuck with it all the ways we get caught in it and tighten around it all the ways that we

239
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:36,040
suffer because we love we suffer because we have compassion because somehow it's

240
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:42,240
gotten mixed up with other things so to sit in in mindfulness meditation is part

241
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:49,359
of this disentangling learning where the stress points are where the tensions are where

242
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:54,880
the extra arrows are where the belief systems are that are all added on top of

243
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,240
this Simplicity of compassion so that compassion can

244
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:06,599
shine and when compa compassion becomes cleaner and that way or comes simpler

245
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:14,599
that way then acting from The Compassion is much less tiring then if we act out

246
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:20,160
of compassion together with all the attachments and fears and entanglements

247
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:27,400
we might have so one of the great tasks of a human life is to clarify clean out

248
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:36,440
out love clean out care and compassion so it becomes clean and direct and

249
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:43,000
simple and see it as part of it is not just certainly not just the empathy to

250
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:50,480
feel someone else suffering the key component of the form of love that is compassion is in fact the desire the

251
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:58,680
wish the aspiration that others do not suffer and it's good to act on that

252
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:05,680
sometimes strong compassion um is difficult because something that aspiration that wanting

253
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:11,119
to support and help has been bottled up there has no Outlet we don't know what to

254
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:16,400
do there's always something we can do it might not be for the suffering we we'

255
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:23,200
encountered in the world but maybe it's local so one of the things that I do when I read about horrendous things in

256
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:29,640
the world is that there's too much of it for me to think that I'm going to make a difference I can't give enough donations

257
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:35,040
to all these different places to help but I take it in and the aspiration to

258
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,359
end suffering is stronger because of it and then I try to do my work as a

259
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:46,440
Buddhist teacher even locally better I I'm more motivated to do what I do and

260
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:52,160
that's where it's channeled into doing this for other people it might be channeled into caring for their

261
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:57,760
neighbors or having more care for people their colleagues at work and might be

262
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,720
that they have a particular cause that we're motivated to support and so experiencing suffering elsewhere and

263
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:09,359
feeling compassion that aspiration to end suffering gets channeled even more

264
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:15,640
into the cause we already have so

265
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:21,520
compassion as a gift to the world compassion not as a drag because it's a

266
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:28,280
drag if we're caught in our attachments and it makes our life harder and more difficult and we're overwhelmed

267
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:36,800
but to um but to uh have the gift of compassion for this world we know

268
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:42,400
that the world needs it and get and compassion can be a

269
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,480
present and if that's too difficult or nots

270
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:55,280
clear then uh being present becomes the present that we can offer being

271
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:00,480
attentive being standing being present in a full

272
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:07,119
way may that be the present that you offer this world on this day that's

273
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:15,280
often for many people associated with giving presents so thank you very much and

274
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:21,640
um and I hope that uh uh you spend this

275
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:28,000
day um stay close to either care care

276
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:35,520
friendliness or compassion as what is needed and tomorrow we'll do appreciative Joy thank

277
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,520
you
