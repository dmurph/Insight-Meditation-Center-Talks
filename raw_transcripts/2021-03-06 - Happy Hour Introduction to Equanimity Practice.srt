1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,879
so hello and welcome to happy hour a warm welcome wherever you are in the

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,160
world so as we've been working our way through

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,640
the different categories as well as a different brahma viharas

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,400
just to give sense of context and again if this is your first time at happy hour no problem

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,960
whatever you need to know will be shared with you explained to you um so

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,160
it's all good and i still want to give the context just for those who've been coming regularly

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:43,520
just kind of get the sense of where we are so with the four brahma viharas practices of the heart we start with metta

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,680
loving kindness we worked through the categories all the categories with that and then we moved to the second

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,039
brahmavir heavenly abode practice which is compassion then we went through all the concentric

10
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:01,280
circles through that starting with um our easy person ourselves etc that

11
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,479
are moving to all beings then we switch to mudita empathetic joy

12
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,600
and we've been pla playing around with different categories in empathetic joy and we

13
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,680
stayed with empathetic joy for for a good long while uh which was fun

14
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:26,080
awakening joy and um and um the the fourth brahma vihara is

15
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,400
equinemedi opeka and sometimes we think of upeka as oh

16
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,680
very cool detached

17
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,640
but that's actually the near enemy of equanimity that's not equanimity equanimity is in

18
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,680
the same family as loving kindness and vicarious joy and compassion so

19
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,079
that should give us a signal oh equanimity has warmth to it has care to it it's not

20
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,600
like oh i'm just equanimous i don't care [Music]

21
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:08,000
but it's a sense of equipoise holding holding whatever

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,959
is arising challenges goodness holding it all holding it all

23
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:22,080
with balance with care not diving into it not overwhelmed not into

24
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:30,200
it diving into and not pulling away not turning away from it

25
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,720
equipoise equanimity stays with whatever is arising

26
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,720
whether it's joy so that it doesn't become exuberance there's a sense of balance

27
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:50,720
or with compassion so that it doesn't become empathic distress pain on top of some

28
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,959
our own pain or someone else's pain equipoise stays balanced so it's a it's a practice

29
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,640
in and of itself as we will practice tonight and

30
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,080
it's also it's the platform it's the stability

31
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,519
you if you think if you consider for example a buddha image or with a statue or a

32
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,800
statue of kuan yin compassionate image they're always on a platform

33
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:26,080
of stability so if you think of yourself as this ah embodiment here let's start

34
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,400
feel yourself as an embodiment of goodness compassion care

35
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,599
you sit on a platform a stable platform one that's not wobbly

36
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:46,159
one that's stable and supports you and that platform of stability

37
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,440
that foundation however the image works for you is one of

38
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:58,840
equanimity it allows you to engage with all the other brahma-viharas from a place of

39
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,480
balance as well as relate to anything in the world from a place of balance

40
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,640
so i like to sing the praises of equanimity because we've been bringing equanimity

41
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,239
in without really advertising it so much into all of our practices

42
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:22,320
so far with all the other brahmavirus and another thing to say equanimity is the

43
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,600
crown jewel of buddhist practice it's really the crown jewel

44
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,880
so it's not detached at all it cares it's engaged with the world

45
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,759
it's it's a part of the family of the heavenly abodes together with as i mentioned with meta

46
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,960
and compassion and and vicarious joy and it supports them all and it supports

47
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:52,639
us to have a stable expanse of heart not to be um

48
00:04:52,639 --> 00:05:00,160
washed over or or um or caught up and and if we do get caught

49
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:07,520
up or washed over oh being able to stand up again so praise of in praise of equanimity

50
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,639
practice so i hope you're excited by now to practice equanimity formally

51
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,240
together so so the place we start this equanimity practice

52
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,039
traditionally is where it's easiest and it is said the easiest

53
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:32,479
category is the neutral person makes sense right neutral person

54
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:38,400
there is kind of a balance you you it's not your difficult person so you don't have antipathy towards them

55
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,320
it's not your dear person so you don't love them it's like oh there's some neutrality right you can

56
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,520
both feel their pain and their happiness but their senses through neutrality so

57
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,840
traditionally it is said this is the easiest place to start it may not be the easiest place for us

58
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:02,720
to give but let's start there okay let's let's see canonical teachings work for us in terms of story starting

59
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,639
where it's easy so so

60
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:15,600
let's start i think that's all i want to say let's dive into it um

61
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:23,600
yeah oh i guess i'll say one last thing the near enemy of it as i mentioned is aloofness this detachment is kind of

62
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,759
like oh i don't care it's all okay um and of course the far enemy the opposite

63
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:36,160
is when you get really entangled like uh or either you get really jump into it

64
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,520
you get entangled you get attached or you completely turn away um so aloof

65
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,280
is still cool so anyway you'll you'll discover the far and near enemies for yourselves

66
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:54,080
because they'll they might come up they probably will it's part of learning uh this practice it's not that

67
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,360
we completely avoid these ends it's just that they will come up we recognize them and we learn how to

68
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,918
relate to them and ourselves all right now let's jump in

69
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:15,759
okay let's blend ah

70
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,720
in our bodies let's land

71
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:31,840
ah our bodies with our breath

72
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:40,560
feeling [Music] our stability on the earth

73
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:48,000
this body connected through our feet through our legs our

74
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,440
sit bones whether you're sitting on a chair or a cushion

75
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:04,879
feeling this body connected to the floor to the cushion to the earth

76
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,840
sense of stability landing

77
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:28,080
ah relaxing letting go of

78
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,159
any tension the muscles in the face are holding

79
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:43,279
let the forehead be soft the jaw

80
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,839
muscles of the face from the inside

81
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,600
relaxing the neck and the shoulders

82
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:23,839
letting them drop

83
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:32,560
letting your chest soften your heart

84
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,480
feel safe

85
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:52,959
lowering the center of gravity of your attention from your head where the thoughts reside often we

86
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:58,000
associate our heads with our thoughts bringing

87
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:06,880
down [Music] center of gravity of attention to chest

88
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,079
feeling the breath in center of the chest heart center

89
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,839
then moving further down attention down down down the belly

90
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,680
and into the sit bones

91
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:41,600
to the legs the feet letting your attention hover hover in

92
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,839
the lower part of your body

93
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:06,000
putting your whole trunk chest and abdomen relax

94
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:15,839
your groin area

95
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:23,360
your sit bones in your legs dropping dropping their weight onto the

96
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:30,160
earth drop

97
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:42,320
as if an elevator goes down down down down

98
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:49,440
the weight shifting down down down down

99
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:59,040
if ever you notice your top heavy in the head with thoughts

100
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:05,440
push the ground floor button on your elevator of attention

101
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:12,240
traveling down down down down

102
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,480
it's okay to push this button many times throughout

103
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:39,839
if you feel it's helpful and needed it's okay

104
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:26,560
you can even push this ground floor button on the elevator of tension in every out

105
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,839
breath to settle in more see what it feels like

106
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,839
experiment

107
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,839
now i would like to invite you

108
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:20,798
to bring to mind someone who

109
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,079
is somewhat of a neutral person for you

110
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:34,799
you don't have much history with them maybe a neighbor a delivery person

111
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:43,120
someone who works at a store where you shop someone you don't know very well

112
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:50,240
you've seen them they're a human being they've made an impression

113
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:58,799
but you don't know them much as a stand-in for all of humanity

114
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:04,720
bringing this person this person to mind

115
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:15,840
for the purpose of this practice as as clearly as possible

116
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:29,840
what they look like maybe what they sound like

117
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:36,480
be with what you've picked up from their mannerism from the little interaction you've had

118
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:43,840
with them

119
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,480
and consider that just like you

120
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,240
just like you just like me

121
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,960
this human being wants to be happy

122
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,840
just as i don't want to suffer

123
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,600
they don't want to suffer

124
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:28,559
just as i have a complex inner life with inner dialogue

125
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:35,679
concerns worries fears hopes dreams disappointments

126
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:41,360
people i care about challenges in life

127
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,039
they too just like me

128
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:53,840
they have a very complex inner life that's compelling to them

129
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,279
that's as compelling complicated as mine

130
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:11,120
and just like me they care about

131
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:18,640
others and they're also object of affection

132
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,480
of others they're a child of someone

133
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:35,840
or a parent someone a sibling a friend a partner

134
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:48,640
they have loves things they love to do things that bring them joy who knows

135
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:55,200
maybe even your favorite food favorite flavor of ice cream is the same

136
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:03,840
imagine them enjoying what you love to to eat

137
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:20,240
and now [Music] imagine that this being this person

138
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:31,840
is experiencing challenges in their life right now

139
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:39,360
you may not know what they are as you don't know them and it's okay to use your imagination

140
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,840
perhaps you want to relate to something you're experiencing right now

141
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:55,840
that's challenging for you something very common these days with

142
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:02,559
the pandemic could be a sense of isolation or loneliness perhaps

143
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:12,400
or could be something else that's more present your life can you imagine

144
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:20,000
they have the same challenge too as a way in is a way to relate it's okay to use our

145
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,840
imagination to relate

146
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,360
seeing them working with this

147
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:55,840
or feeling or feeling challenged in the same way

148
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,480
and now from a place of stability

149
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:36,080
of the body of the mind feeling your body feeling your feet on the ground

150
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:44,320
feeling your sit bones on the cushion [Music] your hands touching each other your lap

151
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,799
feeling your body stable breathing

152
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:57,520
as if this body is sitting on as if this body is

153
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:04,880
the stable foundation of stability that grounds you

154
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:11,360
so that you don't get knocked over it grounds you

155
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:24,480
from this place of stability and also holding in mind in your heart

156
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,000
this person this human being relating

157
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:35,200
feeling this challenge they feel this shared challenge

158
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,639
but focusing on theirs

159
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,840
how they're suffering through it

160
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,360
allowing your self to feel a sense of balance and equanimity

161
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:05,279
not turning away with coldness from their challenge but feeling present as if you were

162
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:14,000
holding present caring space for them

163
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:21,600
the feeling of equanimity is present not turning away caring

164
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:34,240
but not entangled and not turning away holding space

165
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:42,880
being present with care for them to be

166
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,159
exactly as they are

167
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:56,799
but holding caring presence i'll offer a

168
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:04,640
few phrases of equanimity that might support this practice

169
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:11,840
things are as they are right now

170
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:22,840
things are as they are right now each breath can silence through your

171
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,320
sight or

172
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:39,840
it is what it is it is what it is

173
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:17,840
or may you be with peace

174
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:25,679
with the comings of goings of things

175
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:35,840
may you have peace with the comings and goings of things

176
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:43,200
continuing to stay connected and attached to your care

177
00:27:47,520 --> 00:28:03,840
as if you're giving a lot of space holding with a lot of space

178
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:20,000
i wish you well and i know that your happiness

179
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,279
or unhappiness

180
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:45,840
is dependent on your actions and not my wishes for you

181
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:13,200
or the classic equanimity phrase

182
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:19,760
all beings our air are heir to their own

183
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,480
factions

184
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:32,158
their happiness or unhappiness depend on them

185
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:41,840
and not my wishes

186
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:05,679
keep your connection with this person the sense of care the sense of spaciousness

187
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:13,039
see which of these phrases might connect for you better you don't have to use them all

188
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:19,360
experiment and see in this practice today which one works

189
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,840
best

190
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:43,120
whether i whether or not i like it

191
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:51,440
things unfold

192
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,240
lawfully

193
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:05,840
events unfold according

194
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:19,840
to universal laws

195
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:57,840
or all beings have their own journey according to their karma

196
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:47,519
or no matter how i might wish things to be different

197
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:53,840
things are as they are right now

198
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:34,398
checking in if there's a sense of stability connection and care for this person

199
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:39,760
allowing a lot of space for the unfolding

200
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:49,839
i care for you but i can't control your happiness and unhappiness

201
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,240
whether or not i understand it

202
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:45,838
things are unfolding according to a lawful nature

203
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:49,040
and for the last moment of this practice may i be at peace

204
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:55,839
and ease for whatever arose or did not arise during this practice

205
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:04,560
were there challenges arose distractions emotions that were difficult

206
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:11,359
joyous may i have peace and ease with the comings and goings that

207
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:16,560
happened during this practice period

208
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:23,839
may i accept with equanimity and peace

209
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:51,839
may all beings be at peace may all beings be free

210
00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:00,319
thanks everyone thanks for your practice

211
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:08,960
so now we have started to dip our toes at happier to equanimity practice

212
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:15,280
and love to hear your questions reflections observations you're welcome

213
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,599
to raise your hand or type them in chat if you type them privately to me i won't

214
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:28,320
say your name if it's public i will say your name and of course you can raise your hand

215
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:35,680
and share and to say one thing that can happen with equanimity practice the sense of

216
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,720
calm stability the heart can feel really calm

217
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:47,040
with a sense of care there's a sense of warmth and care that's there but there's a sense of ah

218
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,560
as we if you were here last night and we did um

219
00:38:52,800 --> 00:39:00,240
modita vicarious or empathetic joy or the past few nights you know there's a sense of joyous exuberance that can be

220
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:07,200
there and this can be ah connected and um and more stable anywhere lots of

221
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,720
different things can come up and uh we're finding our way together in

222
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:18,720
this practice so so love to hear from you

223
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:26,079
what did you notice bill says compared to metta equanimity

224
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:31,920
practice seems cold to me indifferent so i'm probably in one of

225
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,000
those near enemy things right

226
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:44,240
so maybe yes could be so here's so you said two different things so if

227
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:50,240
compared to mental equanimity practice seems cold i wouldn't say cold it's cooler

228
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:56,160
it's a little cooler it's not as warm and yet if it feels indifferent then you

229
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:03,920
probably are hanging out in a near enemy so notice where you are and it's okay we explore our

230
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:11,040
relationship here and see if there can be more connection and more care and maybe with the other

231
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:16,160
beings it could be it could be easier emily says i noticed

232
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:22,079
that it was a little hard for me to concentrate compared to mindfulness practice simply following the breath

233
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:28,160
switching between listening to different phrases and the guidance and choosing phrases to use in my own mind felt a

234
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:34,640
little complicated sometimes yes yeah i was offering this is the first night we're exploring there are a lot of

235
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:40,880
phrases because some phrases work some phrases don't and as we go through through the week you would have had you

236
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:47,359
choose the phrases that work for you and the ones that connect and also one thing that i will do i

237
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:55,280
think that will make it more helpful for the next sessions i will um have the the list of phrases shared in

238
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,400
the google groups so if you're not on google groups please join

239
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:06,720
because all the phrases will be shared with you there so you can read over them and see which ones work

240
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,760
for you and i might offer fewer options uh next week just one or

241
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:17,200
two and then i trust that you've already looked over and you're experimenting so that's one thus so thank you emily

242
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:23,119
thanks for that this can happen of course this is a little intellectual but i

243
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:29,440
realized today that i don't think of equanimity as being oriented towards specific people the other brahmavihara is yes but i

244
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,040
think of economy as just being a better relationship to experience not necessarily ben so there are

245
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,960
different kinds of equanimity practice and there are 10 different kinds of equanimity in buddhism

246
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,560
so this practice of equanimity specifically that we're practicing is related to a person

247
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:52,640
this is how it's practiced as part of the other brahma viharas there are other equanimities as part of the seven

248
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,160
factors of awakening etc etc that are related relate to experience in

249
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:04,319
general but not this one what else let's see jerry says it was

250
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:10,319
helpful to hear that in this neutral person that they have an inner life and this helps me

251
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:17,280
feel more connected to them great thank you and emily says plus one to what jerry wrote a cool new experience

252
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:24,000
great nice thank you both for that and a direct message to me really helped me

253
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,599
with a former spouse i of which there was tension this week this was

254
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:36,720
so needed to me letting go of being responsible for their happiness it felt freeing and compassionate and

255
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:42,079
released thank you oh thank you so much for that i'm so glad this connected for you

256
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:48,079
great this is a really powerful practice and we're going to continue to engage with it with

257
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:53,599
other categories and 10 different kinds wow okay i guess

258
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:59,330
i have some educating myself to do yes ben yes indeed

259
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:04,400
[Laughter] uh humility beginner's mind is

260
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:11,520
good in at every stage of practice and susan has their hand up so

261
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:18,240
susan please hey thanks um hi everybody um

262
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:25,520
i think this is kind of yeah this is totally part of it i am recalling when i used to go to a

263
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:31,040
lot of aaa meetings um and i have this experience like

264
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:39,520
somebody would come in with new who would have a lot of problems obviously and um

265
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:47,599
when they would be distressed i would have this wave of faith in them and that's what

266
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:55,119
i kind of form my feelings around equanimity i don't know if that makes sense so

267
00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:02,640
it would be that they would be okay that everything was going to work out fine um that it of cour you know it was both

268
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:08,240
and that they were having really difficult times but that they were also

269
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:13,839
yeah covering and so yeah i see what you're saying i appreciate you bringing that in susan so

270
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:18,960
so i would say there is a similarity here and a slight difference and i want to point that out the new ones here

271
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:24,079
tease it out so the um the sense this beautiful sense

272
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:30,400
that you're bringing in is that you know they're having trouble right now but they're going to be okay there's a sense there's a trust

273
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:37,440
there so now if we shift that if we shift that to actually at the awakened mind

274
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,640
perspective that actually in the big picture they are okay

275
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:49,839
this is what this is what's happening this is what needs to be happening according to a lawful nature so that's

276
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:55,520
even a bigger a bigger okayness it's a bigger trust so i'm building on what you said

277
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:02,480
it's not so much trust that in the future they will be okay but it's like this is okay this is part of

278
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,599
being human there's a bigger picture whether or not i know it i'm aware of it whether or not i

279
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:12,880
understand it um it this is okay so there's a sense of

280
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:19,680
trust so thank you so much for bringing that up really really uh i appreciate that so

281
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:26,640
and a couple of quick comments uh on uh youtube had difficulty imagining

282
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:32,240
someone having difficult time because i think that everyone around me is doing so much better than i am

283
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:38,319
ah that is so interest in an interesting perspective because it

284
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:43,920
is so not true everybody has challenges in their lives every single person it's

285
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:49,359
it's a mark of existence dukkha is a mark of existence

286
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:55,680
and let's see it was difficult for me to follow some instructions because i don't speak

287
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:02,720
english but spanish but i was able to connect oh that's sweet thank you for for that reflection uh

288
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:09,680
gero and the previous one was robin thank you so much for both of those reflections so um i'm glad that you were able to

289
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:15,359
connect even if not with all the words and also rob and i i invite

290
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:20,640
feeling into this um misconception that everybody else is

291
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:26,319
okay know that suffering is the common bond

292
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:32,160
we may not know what people are experiencing but we can be sure they're having difficulty it's a part of

293
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:38,720
being human there's so much more i can say about that but time is running out and there are more

294
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:45,119
questions but we're going to be doing this practice all of next week so let's um i want to make

295
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:52,240
time for practice meeting in groups and hold your questions for uh

296
00:46:52,240 --> 00:47:00,319
for later so i'm going to create the breakout group so the invitation is to start with um 30 seconds of meta

297
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:06,560
for each other just quiet 30 seconds of meta wishing each other well and then you can

298
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:14,240
share how this practice was what you discovered uh tonight with this new practice which is

299
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:19,680
different and there's no right or wrong you know that you're not trying to impress each other but just to support each other and

300
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:24,800
share each other's practice so here we go i'm opening the rooms now

301
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:32,079
okay enjoy welcome back everyone

302
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:37,760
so we have maybe a minute for for one reflection if you like to share what

303
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:44,960
did you discover both in your practice and sharing with others

304
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:53,440
yes jerry i see you um um

305
00:47:53,440 --> 00:48:01,200
so uh i'm amazed at the comments that people make in the group that are so uh helpful in terms of

306
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:07,280
uh just trying to want to say things that actually hit the mark

307
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:13,119
about what you were trying to do so it's an amazing supportive group so that's what i want to say

308
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:19,839
