1
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:10,240
so good day warm greetings

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:18,880
and here we are to continue on our adventure in uh

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,960
mindfulness of breathing and the last tetra at the end of this

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,240
whole sequence of settling in deeper and deeper

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,520
is to come to a place where we're able to

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,480
observe things in a

7
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:49,440
non-interfering way non-reactive way and whereas

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,199
observing by itself might not seem like a very interesting way of meditating perhaps or a little

9
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,399
bit detached it comes after

10
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:07,840
a process of calming relaxing the body and mind and liberating ourselves just enough

11
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,960
with our reactivity and our preoccupations and our busy mind

12
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:20,159
so that rather than letting go at this point we can let things be

13
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,040
and letting things be can be seen as a very generous thing

14
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:32,400
to not interfere to not assert the self and not assert one's preferences and

15
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,560
desires and aversions but to really just kind of have the

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,079
peacefulness to observe and some things we observe are difficult we

17
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,880
might be anxious we might be upset we might be

18
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,880
you know agitated in some way but it is possible to come to a place

19
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,759
where we just observe that and we let it be we don't have to let go of it because we

20
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,040
can just let it be um and uh

21
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:14,879
and and watch it see it and so

22
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:22,000
the last tetrad is just observing things coming and going and starting

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,480
to become attuned to the fact that in some way or many ways in profound ways

24
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,640
our experience is constantly shifting and changing and arising and passing

25
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,560
and to now not be interested in the content of our experience the content of our

26
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,599
thoughts the content of our feelings but rather to be interested in the

27
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,519
process by which they arise in their past they come and they go we're switching to process rather than

28
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,680
content is a big shift for the human mind and to observe

29
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:04,000
to let be and in a sense we're learning to ease up on our

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,599
experience not to get rid of it but to be able to observe it in a peaceful way

31
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:18,319
so beginning with a meditation posture

32
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:27,519
that allows you to both have some alertness but also to feel at ease in yourself

33
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,440
some easiness

34
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:43,040
and to gently close your eyes

35
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,840
and to take a few long slow deep breaths

36
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:55,760
long slow deep breaths to feel yourself

37
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:03,920
fill yourself with awareness and to relax to settle in

38
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:11,599
and to settle in as you exhale to some place within that feels stable

39
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:20,079
a stability stable in your body

40
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:28,160
stable in your heart

41
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,000
maybe stable in your mind

42
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,560
not looking for great stability but rather

43
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:47,520
becoming a little more stable than you were stable here definitively

44
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,240
here and now in this place at this time

45
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,160
and then letting your breath return to normal and

46
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,960
perhaps as if there's waves of relaxation through your body

47
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,840
relaxing the muscles of your face

48
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:23,199
as you breathe the waves of breathing are like waves smooth washing through your face

49
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,280
softening relaxing

50
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:39,840
waves of relaxation through the shoulders

51
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:55,039
waves of relaxation through the belly softening on the exhale

52
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,840
and waves of relaxation through the whole body

53
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,800
and then letting yourself sit quietly here

54
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:41,198
and let yourself be easy be at ease in your body

55
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:49,360
or if your body feels uneasy ease up on how it is

56
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,199
allow things to be but ease up around them it's okay

57
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:03,840
breathe with it ease up and just observe

58
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,160
experiences of your body

59
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,840
and set your heart at ease

60
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:29,360
maybe you can feel gentle tender soft

61
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:37,759
in the heart here and now at ease or if the heart is uneasy to ease

62
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:46,800
up on that it's okay and for you to observe this is how it is

63
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:54,960
as if a as if the observing is accompanying the uneasiness you feel

64
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,840
with care and compassion

65
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:13,840
and as you exhale setting your mind at ease it's okay to be here now

66
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:26,560
and if the mind is uneasy ease up on that

67
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:40,080
so you can maybe just observe

68
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,240
be at ease in how you observe

69
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:54,560
no need to strain or be afraid as you open up to observe

70
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,200
phenomena

71
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,720
the observing itself is a place of safety

72
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,959
we begin approaching a place of non-reactivity non-harming

73
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:22,640
just observing phenomena

74
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,480
and one of the things you can observe

75
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:37,839
is how you lose your ease how you lose your calm

76
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:50,480
how you go in the opposite direction then easing up

77
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,839
be sure that you don't overlook the moments of

78
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,080
contraction and agitation

79
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:11,360
reactivity but when you see it when you know it meet it with relaxing

80
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,839
meet it with easing up

81
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,320
with observing this is how it is now

82
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,839
letting it be

83
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:43,040
but not being it letting it be but not becoming

84
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,839
the reactivity

85
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
and all along breathing in and breathing out

86
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,920
as if breathing is the rhythm of the universe

87
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,959
that washes through you through

88
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
everything

89
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,830
[Music]

90
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
so

91
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:35,839
[Music] ah

92
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,839
so

93
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,400
noticing ways that you've been caught that you get caught in thoughts and

94
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,200
feelings and experiences in the body

95
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,799
we're being caught or preoccupied or concerned

96
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:24,480
is going in a different direction than being at ease easing up

97
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,840
simply observing

98
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,840
with the help of breathing

99
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:51,919
let breathing help you not get so caught in things stay with the rhythm of breathing

100
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:58,400
so that you're in better position to simply observe the comings and goings of

101
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,799
reactivity preoccupations

102
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:15,600
contractions comings and goings of what you want and what you don't want

103
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,840
the coming goings of wanting and not

104
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,840
wanting

105
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:54,028
[Music]

106
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
um

107
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:14,480
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

108
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,600
to appreciate the possibility of easing up

109
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:33,520
and one way this easing up is so helpful is to

110
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:40,320
help us recognize in inner safety

111
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:47,039
that as we sit and meditate we don't need to be talking to people or

112
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:56,080
interacting with them and be out in the world driving our cars on dangerous freeways

113
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:02,320
that for these few minutes of the meditation

114
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:09,120
you don't have to solve your problems or

115
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:17,840
engage in the difficulties of life it's a safe time just to be let be

116
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,720
and it's also somewhat private what goes on inside

117
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:33,200
so in the safety and privacy without anybody needing to know

118
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:40,000
can you open your heart tenderly caringly

119
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:47,520
to feel good will to have kindness love

120
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:56,158
first for the people in your life it's relatively easy to love and have good will

121
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:04,639
and allow you yourself the luxury of feeling that privately

122
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:11,679
without the any complications of it being done publicly or

123
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:19,120
overtly just feeling the simplicity of your care your kindness

124
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,640
your appreciation of others

125
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:30,559
perhaps breathe with it breathe through those feelings

126
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,679
make room for it

127
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:46,879
and with this simple useful connection to your goodwill

128
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:55,279
perhaps it's easier now again in the privacy of meditation

129
00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:02,000
to have thoughts of well-wishing for others

130
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,320
it would be quite wonderful if they could be happy and peaceful

131
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:18,960
safe and that they they could thrive and

132
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,840
have a good life

133
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,720
and then to give words to this good will this well-wishing

134
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,440
may they be happy

135
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,039
may they be safe

136
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,720
may they be peaceful

137
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,559
may they be free

138
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:03,440
and may our well-wishing extend outwards throughout the lands

139
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:11,519
and seas and in all directions how wonderful it would be if all beings

140
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:18,880
could be happy may all beings

141
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:26,880
be peaceful may all beings be safe

142
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:33,840
may all beings everywhere be free

143
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:42,158
and with the support of our meditation practice mindfulness practice

144
00:31:42,559 --> 00:32:01,000
may we in our way in ways that we can contribute to that being possible

145
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,500
[Music]

146
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,880
so my friends we continue with this anapanasati

147
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:24,000
and the topic is the 14th step one trains oneself

148
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,480
breathing breathing in observing

149
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:38,799
fading away or a different translation is one trains breathing in observing

150
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:45,039
fading away observing dispassion

151
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:51,600
and this word translated as dispassion

152
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,799
the word is v raga v-i-r-a-g-a

153
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:05,440
you know it doesn't quite work for some english speakers because over time the word passion has

154
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:13,200
acquired many positive associations and connotations definitions in english in some circles and the

155
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:21,679
original i think the original meaning of it that the passion of christ where it meant suffering is kind of lost

156
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:27,599
but i think still there's remnants in english that the passion can have negative connotations you know it's a

157
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:33,118
is a source of suffering so you know someone say someone has a passion for power or

158
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:41,280
passion for sex or a passion for you know something you know that it's an

159
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,320
intense engagement in something and intense engagement

160
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:55,040
can be um very painful so the um so i want to talk a little bit

161
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,079
about this uh dispassion this uh b raga

162
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:07,200
uh maybe with a indirect way so buddhism is often considered a

163
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,240
religion and once it's called a religion it's reasonable for people to

164
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:19,040
try to understand what are the fundamental tenets and beliefs of this religion and in doing

165
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:24,800
that it's kind of looking at the generalizations just being universal statements about things

166
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:31,520
and and so one of the universal statements is that buddhism emphasizes that

167
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:37,680
everything is impermanent or inconstant usually people say everything's impermanent

168
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:43,200
and then we have this universal statement and then we're contending with this universal statement like is this

169
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,800
really true and is this always the case and and this seems like you know or maybe

170
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,560
rather depressing way of seeing everything or all kinds of reactions to this almost like a philosophical statement

171
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:00,640
general statement as if it's you know some universal truth that buddhism teaches

172
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,000
and so looking at this in a universal statement says

173
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,560
yes you know they understand buddhism is one approach i think the the practice approach to

174
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:20,720
understanding buddhism is not to understand buddhism in the abstract but not begin there but to begin with

175
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:26,320
oneself and one's own experience and um and

176
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:31,520
uh so to the degree to which buddhism emphasizes the possibility of being free

177
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:37,760
from suffering then we begin with ourselves and look what is

178
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:44,000
the suffering here that i have what's my pain emotional pain what's

179
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,400
happening here and they say it's possibly free of it well how could i become free of it

180
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:57,599
what does it take and um and in and in this very personal kind of

181
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,960
exploration and feeling and being here then buddhism says well if you really

182
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,240
look carefully at your experience you'll see that there's a very close

183
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:14,079
connection to uh the experience of

184
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,200
inconstancy change transiency impermanence

185
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:26,079
and our ability to ease up from our suffering to soften it to

186
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:32,960
calm it down even to have it fade away and disappear and so we see then

187
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:40,000
in this kind of going from this direction where personally the purpose of seeing and constancy

188
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:48,839
is not to have some universal theory and belief and philosophy about life but rather it's a pragmatic

189
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:54,480
practical idea that that in the observation of change and

190
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:03,119
inconstancy this is an antidote this is a medicine for what buddhism calls suffering

191
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:09,119
and there's something that eases up when we can really kind of feel the flow and be in the current of

192
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:15,680
change and whether impermanence and constancy is a universal philosophical universal

193
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:21,760
metaphysical concept or other is really besides the point

194
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,200
it's the point is that we're pointing to inconstancy and permanence because of

195
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:35,680
its value and helping us loosen up lighten up free up the places we get caught

196
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:41,359
and uh and that's enough we don't have to then make it a big leap of philosophy to make a universe

197
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:47,920
versatile claim about now i know something about you know the fundamental nature of the universe the

198
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:53,280
physics of physics of the universe that everything is impermanent and changing all the time

199
00:38:53,280 --> 00:39:00,800
it's an interesting idea but that idea is not really what you know buddhist practice is about

200
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:06,560
so so but as we see things shifting and changing and transitory

201
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:12,480
nature of phenomenon and we get more interested in the process of change

202
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:19,680
the process of inconstancy then we are with the content of our thoughts content of our

203
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:27,599
feelings many times we're focused on the meaning of things or the content the purpose the what's

204
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,880
really you know the ideas and the particularity of what is going on

205
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:40,000
uh but in a sense at this point in anapanasati we're stepping back and in particular

206
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,880
what we're thinking is not that important just to see the thinking itself is an inconstant phenomena it comes and

207
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,640
goes probably you've had some of your thoughts repeatedly they've come and gone for

208
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:58,320
days and weeks months years and they just come and they go and after a while if you see how much they come in to go

209
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:06,079
maybe you ease up about it and so then

210
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,599
so then and also with our emotions sometimes the

211
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:17,599
meaning of the emotions the story around them even the emotion itself what emotion it is and what it means to have that

212
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:23,440
emotion and how it reflects back on ourselves as a human being comes into play

213
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:31,119
and but at some point meditation we shift from all that complication to not even

214
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:37,040
caring whether it's sadness or joy but rather tuning into how the process

215
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:42,400
of how it it is shifting and changing and morphing and

216
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:48,480
and moving and coming in and out of existence and how

217
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,680
attention awareness picks it up and puts it down gets distracted by the train whistle

218
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,800
and for a moment is not sad because it's just a train whistle and then we pick up then we're aware of

219
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,920
sadness again it's that is arisen and then we hear more more whistles and

220
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,920
you know it's all this kind of going and coming and going and it's that coming and going that

221
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:17,520
begins to loosen up it's like it's like a lubricant that begins uh unsticking the ways in

222
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,560
which we are kind of uncontrollably

223
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:29,280
caught in our emotions or in our activity and our motivations

224
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:36,560
so and one of those is raga and raga can be translated as passion or lust um

225
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,599
but it's translated as lust some people feel like it limits it too much to sexual

226
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:48,000
passion and um but one way of it's uncontrollable the one definition in the poly tech

227
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,200
society dictionary is um uncontrolled excitement

228
00:41:53,200 --> 00:42:01,680
so there's something about i like to think of it as drivenness when there's a driveness to our draw you know to our drives a

229
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,880
driveness we're driven by lust driven by

230
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:12,880
greed driven by hatred and ill will and uh there's some way in which

231
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:18,079
something has taken over control and we're not in control anymore this power of that level of

232
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:23,119
passion and um describing the way i the way i do

233
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:28,240
it seems kind of dramatic but in all kinds as we get quieter and quieter in the mind

234
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:35,760
we see the subtler and subtler ways in which we're caught in the grip of certain driveness anybody who's been to

235
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,760
meditates tend to see that you know that how it's surprisingly how much we get swept away in our thoughts

236
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:50,160
or pulled into our thoughts caught in our thoughts that represents a little bit of a kind of uncontrolled excitement or

237
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:56,880
interest or engagement as we settle back into um

238
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:03,680
into just observing we can see that um this doesn't serve us to be

239
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:11,200
involved in this uncontrolled drivenness and cotness and preoccupation and so there starts to be

240
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,640
coming this process of disinterest losing interest and continuous doing that

241
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:22,960
i've had the same thoughts for months now i'm not interested in doing it anymore i have the same preoccupation with

242
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:29,119
certain emotions and feeling as if they're the most important thing and i'm not so interested in anymore and

243
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:34,880
i don't want to give much more attention to these things i've given so much attention to them i've been kind of driven to pay

244
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,400
attention to my anxiety and i think it's okay to put the anxiety to the side and

245
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:46,800
i know i'm anxious but i don't have to be so driven by it and i can ease up i can just observe it i

246
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:55,359
cannot be so involved or entangled with it and so the movement to being non-driven

247
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:03,280
movement being no the dropping of compulsion is this uh thing called v raga this

248
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,960
fading away this dispassion and it's very closely connected to freedom

249
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:14,240
it is a kind of freedom and after a while we begin appreciating that

250
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:22,400
freedom is sweet freedom is a breath of fresh air freedom

251
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:29,839
is a kind of joy and delight and vitality and a kind of health

252
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:37,920
a healthiness and so to begin to feel that be have a feeling for a sense of freedom

253
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:43,040
as we observe there's freedom in the observing

254
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:50,800
and that freedom the observing is a guide a support to lose interest or lose our

255
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:56,480
preoccupation with our drivenness with the things that we're caught in

256
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:05,119
and so there's this fading away of compulsion of a a um

257
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:10,480
a that a process that some translators will translate as dispassion

258
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:16,640
a movement towards this passion towards freedom the word viraga is a celebrated term in

259
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:24,319
india more often than not it's a kind of akin to it's in in to liberation itself

260
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:30,960
the freedom itself and um the end of raga the end of compulsion

261
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,800
drivenness lust in all its forms passion and all its

262
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:42,400
negative forms and um and it comes when a peace it can

263
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,760
come with a peaceful way i like to think of this whole process as a process of

264
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:55,520
settling into ease easing up relaxing softening fading away

265
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:02,319
into not not into nothing so much but fading into a peaceful happy

266
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:09,920
healthy liberated way of being so breathing in

267
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:17,359
observing fading away breathing out observing this passion as it comes along

268
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:23,200
here so um thank you

269
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:31,040
and um we'll continue with this and i um i believe i

270
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:37,680
apologize i didn't check my calendar but i believe that on friday we could do another session where afterwards if you want to stay and ask

271
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:44,079
some questions that was very nice last friday and and as we're doing the sign up on asati

272
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:55,359
maybe it's nice to for you having more questions about this so thank you all very much
