1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,879
so welcome welcome nice to see you all

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,359
hmm that was a very nice fit for me i i kind of

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,630
got settled in and felt kind of cozy [Laughter]

4
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,679
so today i'd like to continue on this series of teachings that i'm doing on

5
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,440
the seven factors of awakening

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,640
i like this idea that there's these certain factors that support awakening

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,079
like there's and then i'm going to talk a little bit about how we can cultivate them

8
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,640
sometimes we might have this feeling and i know i certainly did for quite a long time like

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,559
i don't know finding more freedom just seemed like it might be some random thing that happens or

10
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:07,040
if the conditions were just right you know or something like that

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,760
but there's some factors of awakening 0.2 that we can cultivate we can work with these things we can

12
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:21,280
help create the conditions in which there's more freedom in our lives

13
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:29,759
i'll talk a little bit more about that but today is the fifth factor which is tranquility

14
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,360
pasetti in pali probably we all know this idea what

15
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,799
tranquility is it's peaceful or calm

16
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:48,000
serenity contentment but maybe it's worthwhile spending a

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,600
little but a little bit talking about what it's not because sometimes we might have this

18
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,200
idea that um tranquility is just about

19
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,360
being quiet and there is a way in which it certainly is about being quiet

20
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:16,400
but we might think that it's just the absence of moving or the absence of making noises or something like this

21
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,879
or maybe something that it's more closely related to sometimes we might

22
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,800
use this expression near enemy something that looks like that but isn't

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,360
it's like this sleepiness right when you kind of have this certain amount of relaxation before you drift

24
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,480
off to sleep that's not quite the same thing as tranquility even though

25
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,879
there is certainly some tranquility there but the tranquility that's the factor of

26
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,239
awakening has a certain alertness to it even though

27
00:02:52,239 --> 00:03:00,080
there's not activity it doesn't mean that the mind is kind of like checked out and there's some dullness or

28
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,400
some i don't know just not really being present

29
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,239
so it's not also it's not a complacency where or a lack of energy

30
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:18,400
where we might just be kind of a dolly sitting there right this is kind of it's not really tranquility

31
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,560
tranquility still has this uprightness but it has maybe we might say

32
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,440
just the right amount of energy not too much and not too little

33
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,720
right and this is something we always practice with is you know what is the right amount of energy what's the right amount of effort

34
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:45,840
and i'd like to say this is part of the art of practice it's not like we dial it in once and we have it and we never have to

35
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:54,400
work with it again maybe i'll say something else about tranquility it's not like this bored

36
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:02,000
indifferent disengaged like yes okay i'll sit here upright if

37
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,599
you're meditating and but we're off you know in some fantasy

38
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:14,959
or about what we're going to do as soon as the the dang bell rings or something like this

39
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,880
so tranquility it does it has a certain amount of alertness but and the mind is

40
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,080
certainly present and the body has some ease to it

41
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,199
it's other type of you know relaxation and it's similar to what we might say equanimity

42
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,759
but equanimity is pointing more towards like a view that we have and i'll talk more about equanimity it's

43
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,199
also a factor of awakening it's the seventh one whereas tranquility is more kind of a

44
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,280
feeling in the body this non-agitation kind of a

45
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,479
contentment so

46
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:02,880
maybe i'll just say i mentioned that tranquility is the fifth effect of awakening equanimity is the

47
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,520
seventh i'll just read the list here i'll say the list mindfulness investigation

48
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,520
energy joy tranquility concentration

49
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:22,240
equanimity and there is a way in which we could make a story about how one leads to the

50
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,240
each of the others we could start with mindfulness mindfulness can be a support all the way through or there's a way in

51
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,600
which we can just practice and cultivate each one individually it's a little bit of both

52
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,080
happening at the same time but i think it's noteworthy that in this list that

53
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,240
tranquility follows joy because when there's a certain amount of

54
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,440
joy and we feel that and we're like saturated with it

55
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:58,319
then there's can be a sense of no more looking for something else

56
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:05,440
no more thinking like gosh i wish things were different this is terrible

57
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:12,319
right when there's a certain amount of joy there can be a settling of that it can be so subtle and sometimes really

58
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,639
obvious a settling of that leaning forward looking for something else the next thing

59
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:26,160
looking for something better or something that has is more satisfying

60
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,080
so i think it's noteworthy that tranquility follows joy but it's not the only way to get to

61
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:39,280
tranquility we don't have to fill ourselves up purposely trying to get as happy as we can

62
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,280
so that we can have some tranquility

63
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:52,000
but instead i'll talk a little bit about um so what is part of the role of tranquility in

64
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,479
our practice and then i'll talk a little bit about how we can cultivate it

65
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:08,080
so part of the role is there's a way in which when there's some quieting down

66
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,599
then there's this softening of this persistent

67
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:20,160
feeling that something has to happen this persistent feeling of wanting to be entertained or

68
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:27,840
persistent feeling of wanting to feel like we're in control or that we're alive or something like this

69
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,120
when that has quieted down there's a lot of healing

70
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,800
that can happen and i'll just use this generic word

71
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,039
healing there's it's all the different things it can be

72
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:52,240
physical healing i'm not here to say that it's a miracle tranquility and mindfulness is

73
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,639
i know it can have a lot of shifts in people's life that can be really support for something different to show up but

74
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:06,319
there's a way in which just being quiet can be a tremendous support

75
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:13,039
for whatever's happening in our lives and sometimes this being quiet means that the inner critic

76
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:19,039
has settled down this kind of way in which we often beat ourselves up or

77
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:25,120
thinking like you should do this or you shouldn't have done that or you know this kind of also this persistent inner

78
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,479
voice we might have sometimes so when there's some tranquility that

79
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:36,080
inner critic has softened when that inner critic has softened then there can be this

80
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:44,480
opening and relaxation and we're maybe a little bit more available to

81
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:51,839
examine what's really happening or what's what is the wise thing to do or maybe

82
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,959
try something different or make room for some new ideas or some new thoughts to

83
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:03,200
arise so this tranquility can serve as a tremendous resource

84
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,399
in our lives and to be able to have know that it's

85
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:16,959
even possible and to have to cultivate it and develop it can be a real support

86
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,519
so one way that it can be a support i talked about how can allow healing and maybe a little bit of

87
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:30,000
space for something new to arise but some of this what's new to arise

88
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,680
might be wisdom i think we all know that when we're

89
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,279
agitated we don't have access to our best wisdom we don't have access to the best

90
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:47,600
versions of ourselves so gil franstal says

91
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,680
if you need wisdom try tranquility first

92
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:01,600
tranquility helps create the conditions for some wisdom to arise often we can't just you know conjure up wisdom

93
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,079
so tranquility is a way which can really be a support for as i said like the best versions of

94
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:14,399
ourselves and in this tradition of meditation and this

95
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,800
tradition of buddhism we focus on the development of insight

96
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,640
this scene deeply into our experiences deeply

97
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:33,120
into our lives so that we can see them differently and we can understand them differently

98
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,399
and with that understanding there's can bring a certain sense of freedom there can be

99
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,519
a realization like oh i don't need these things that i'm

100
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:49,200
really holding on to i don't need to prove that i'm right all the time

101
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,440
i don't need to bolster up this sense of self and make sure everybody

102
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:02,240
knows how wonderful i am or how they don't know how i think i'm not wonderful this

103
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,519
way in which we try to hide from other people and put up these

104
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:14,399
walls so these insights

105
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:20,720
often can arise when we have some of this tranquility and it serves like we might say it's like the best possible

106
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,320
soil for wisdom to grow and insights to grow

107
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:34,000
so in this way tranquility does support awakening it's an awakening factor supports liberation

108
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,560
because it helps creates the conditions in which not only can there be some wisdom that

109
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,959
arises some insights that arise but i think all of us know without my

110
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:52,000
having to say this that tranquility arises when there is

111
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,760
not a lot of holding on for dear life right there's a certain amount of

112
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,880
letting go there's a certain amount of ease that has to arise when there's some

113
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:09,760
tranquility and the same movement these exact same movement of letting go

114
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,680
the letting go that supports tranquility is the same letting go that supports awakening

115
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:23,040
awakening is a really deep letting go and so when the mind starts to quiet and

116
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:29,440
i'll talk a little bit more about this when i talk about the next awakening factor concentration

117
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:36,320
but when the mind and the body start to settle it starts to become more clear the way

118
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:43,360
in which we're clenching the ways in which we're holding the places that aren't tranquil just really become more

119
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,959
evident and so maybe there's a way in which in

120
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:55,760
that presence of some tranquility there can be a little bit more softening and letting go and that movement is the

121
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:02,000
exact same movement for awakening and whether it's a big shazam awakening

122
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,959
or just a little bit more freedom in our lives all of them have the same quality

123
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:16,639
of abandoning giving up relinquishing letting go

124
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:25,200
so maybe you'll have this idea like okay it sounds like a

125
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,680
reasonable thing this tranquility but how do we cultivate it

126
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,120
maybe the obvious one is meditation practice

127
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:44,720
i think probably all forms of meditation whatever form you do like buddhist or

128
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,760
not you know just really supports tranquility

129
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,880
and we might there's this way then

130
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:01,440
we might think that well i just can do insight or i can do concentration

131
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:09,839
or i can do living kindness those are kind of the three primary meditations that we do in this tradition

132
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:15,360
maybe i'll say that for the most part when we do

133
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,279
meditation on the breath which is often i think often when we teach introduction to meditation when we

134
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,480
teach mindfulness we often have this starting with the breath

135
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,839
something that can be a support to support tranquility

136
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,920
is two things one for the most part not to control the breath

137
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,279
as best you can i certainly went through this phase where i was like controlling the breath

138
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:48,959
that was like the only way i knew how to be aware of it was to somehow be manipulating it and

139
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:56,000
engineering and something at the same time i was paying attention like somehow i knew i was paying attention

140
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,120
because i was changing it

141
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:08,639
and i kind of struggled for a long time like i don't know how to pay attention without changing it

142
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:15,760
i'll just say that this is something that just kind of went away over time and so this might be a season of

143
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,360
practice in which you feel like oh i'm changing i don't want to change it

144
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,399
but maybe you can just soften about wanting to not change it if you notice

145
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,839
that you're settling subtly manipulating the breath

146
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,759
just notice we don't have to add additional problems on top of it just notice like

147
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,959
oh yeah okay here's a little bit of changing the breath

148
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:48,959
because there's a way in which we might be trying to control so many things in our lives

149
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:55,360
and why not right we want to control things we want to feel like we're in control the truth is we're not as nearly

150
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,639
as much as we think we are right but we want to feel like we are and so

151
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:06,560
it just kind of comes over into our meditation practice with controlling the

152
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,920
breath so now having said that

153
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:20,480
now i'm going to say to support if you're feeling really agitated and you're doing some meditation to support some ease

154
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,680
is to maybe pay a little bit of extra attention if this makes any sense

155
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:32,320
to the exhale a little bit more emphasis to the exhale

156
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:39,440
just maybe like to all the way to the end of the exhale notice in the beginning of

157
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,600
the inhale and there might be a way that can be like mindfulness all to the exhale for me i kind of has this feeling

158
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,720
it's going down and then there might be a way in which the mind darts away

159
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,480
okay here's another exhale but just noticing there's a way in which the

160
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,320
exhale really supports some ease

161
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:10,480
but one thing that we notice that when we're trying to meditate any kind of meditation and when

162
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:17,199
we're trying to cultivate tranquility tranquility will arise anytime we meditate

163
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,959
but if we have this idea we want to cultivate tranquility what we might be noticing is the

164
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,000
non-tranquility that's present

165
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,360
and we can work with that restlessness

166
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,400
worry anxiety these types of things

167
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,880
and very often we come to meditation as a way to work with these things

168
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:54,080
so one thing i'll say is like to understand restlessness agitation anxiety

169
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:01,280
probably the most helpful thing that we can do is to understand it

170
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,400
to get familiar with it this agitation which is exactly what we don't want to

171
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,679
do we want to make it go away but there's a way in which if we

172
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:18,320
understand it understand the conditions in which it really arises or what it feels like it

173
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:25,679
certainly takes a little bit of time we have to hang out with the restlessness we have to hang out with the anxiety

174
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:31,440
but this can serve us so much in our lives it can really make a big difference so

175
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:38,880
the first thing i'll say kind of like to work with the restlessness the non-tranquility is to hang out with it

176
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:45,600
how does it feel in the body how does it feel in the mind

177
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:53,280
there might be a way in which it feels like okay in the mind it just feels like i've heard the girl say this and i

178
00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:00,960
really liked it like ping-pong balls bouncing around inside so is there a way that we can

179
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:07,600
just feel like we're bigger so maybe our awareness is bigger or just

180
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:14,400
like feel the maybe there's even feel like a bubble around us or something so that there's a

181
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,679
little bit more room for the ping-pong balls to bounce around

182
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:26,240
we're not insisting that they go away we're just making space for them

183
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:32,000
so this is something that we can do just maybe with the idea i'm doing this with my arms because i feel like this often

184
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,799
when i'm meditating that i'm creating if i feel like i need space i feel like i'm kind of creating a bubble in front of me

185
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:45,600
a bubble with my awareness also again i'll credit gil for this

186
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:52,720
something that um i appreciate is like this imagination that um you're

187
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,720
in an elevator and this really did happen to me i'm not a very tall person and i was in

188
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,840
the elevator and then this whole basketball team got in the elevator with

189
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:09,760
me and we were all crammed in there right and everybody's so much taller than me

190
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,200
and there's this feeling like i had this little like get me out of here it just wasn't a good feeling

191
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,360
so this feeling of maybe like being crammed in and then you're with the people and

192
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:29,440
you're in the way that gail explained it and this was not the case for me but like what if they're really smelly

193
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:36,400
and their clothes have all these stains on them or something like this really tall and big you know

194
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:43,840
that you're feeling um i don't know claustrophobic and then what if the elevator opens the

195
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:51,919
elevator door opens and you're in a beautiful cathedral

196
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,039
then you just take one or two three steps

197
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:04,960
and everybody they're all still there but they all just kind of move out into this cathedral

198
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:11,679
is there a way that you know without making this a big complicated

199
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:18,400
um thing that we're doing like just bring to mind if you've been in a place with

200
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:25,360
high ceilings or that big windows that you felt like wow

201
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,039
i had those feelings like going through some of these cathedrals in europe like wow

202
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:38,400
like this amazing feeling so there's a way we can incline the mind that way

203
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:45,840
and recognizing that there might still be some agitation but it just stops becoming so much of a problem

204
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,799
and then in the agitation that things can calm down

205
00:21:53,039 --> 00:22:00,559
so in the mind agitation restlessness anxiety these things they might show up

206
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:09,280
in so many different ways maybe where the scattered thinking we can't quite land or focus on anything or

207
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:16,159
we feel like it's distracted by everything we have this in our daily lives we walk into a room wait

208
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:22,320
why am i here you know it's driving past our exits

209
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:28,159
these types of things but this restlessness this

210
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:36,080
non-tranquility it might be less noticeable if it's our constant companion

211
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:43,840
it's not uncommon these days for us to just be agitated

212
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:49,919
if you read the news a lot if you're on social media a lot if you have a job in

213
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:55,360
which it makes you feel frazzled or you have an environment which makes you feel frazzled

214
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,120
there's a way in which you can just feel like well this is what it means to be alive

215
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:08,960
is to have this certain amount of buzziness that's not tranquil

216
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:16,720
and i'd like to say that there can't be really be some ease that is available to us as humans

217
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,720
is possible but i also want to point to

218
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:29,840
maybe if it's our constant companion it's difficult to recognize but i also want to point to sometimes

219
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:35,520
we have this mixed relationship with this idea of relaxation or tranquility

220
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:41,200
we might feel like yeah i need to relax i need to be tranquil

221
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:47,200
and yet we're hesitant to get settled we're

222
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:54,320
reluctant to let go of whatever it is that's fueling the

223
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:00,480
buzziness we might not want to let go of these

224
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:07,760
anxious thoughts instead we might try to just distract ourselves from them by being busy or

225
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:13,600
doing something that increases or just sustains the

226
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,960
restlessness but there might also be this way in

227
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,880
which we want to shield ourselves we think that we're protecting ourselves

228
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:31,840
from avoiding any big emotional swings or something we don't want to get quiet

229
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:37,520
because we know we're just going to be anxious or restless later so we might as well just be restless all the time

230
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:43,520
because there's something about getting quiet and still

231
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:50,400
and then when that ends there's a disappointment or

232
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:56,320
something that just feels worse than just regular restlessness

233
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:03,120
but i'd like to encourage us to find a way in which we can get settled

234
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:09,440
because as i said earlier it's from those more settled places where the greater wisdom and the best versions of

235
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:16,640
ourselves can show up in which there can be some letting go

236
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,880
and i'll talk a little bit about that in a moment here but i also want to say that

237
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:29,360
there's also another reason why we are hesitant reluctant to let go of some

238
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,400
restlessness or it's because there's a way in which our

239
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:41,440
mind is thinking that it's solving a problem by just ruminating over something over

240
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,760
and over and over and over again i had this happen earlier this week i

241
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,120
was going to do something i'd never done before and there's a lot of things like i'm not

242
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,880
sure i know how to do this and i don't know i was just nervous about it

243
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:06,000
and i found myself like playing it over in my mind again and again like this actually is not useful

244
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,320
i'm either going to do it or i'm not going to do it and it was one of those things like if i didn't know how to do it well it would have been fine right to

245
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:18,320
know tragedy so this is just that mind you know our

246
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:25,600
wanting to feel like we're in control we want to feel like we're solving problems and instead we end up just

247
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:32,320
becoming restless and agitated but i want to say there's a good reason like we don't have to beat ourselves up

248
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,919
that we're this way our environments certainly support right

249
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,960
we have these huge industries that their sole purpose is to get us

250
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:49,520
agitated and distracted right all these apps on our phones and social media make us feel like we need to do

251
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:56,240
something else or advertising make us feel like we need something else right so i think we

252
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,960
can allow ourselves like oh okay this is what it is of course this is what it is

253
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:12,400
so practicing with restlessness recognizing how it feels in the body recognizing

254
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,760
giving ourselves a break that we might be reluctant to do this

255
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,559
but is there a way in which we can

256
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:29,440
let go of the beliefs that support this idea of restlessness

257
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:35,120
this movement oh yeah that's just a thought

258
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:42,320
it's just a belief i have this idea that if i think about this again and again

259
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,520
it's going to somehow be helpful or if i maintain this distracted

260
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,440
buzziness that is going to be helpful

261
00:27:52,960 --> 00:28:00,880
but there's other types of beliefs that really support this having really strong opinions

262
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,240
that's a way of which holding on and i'm not saying that we don't have to

263
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:12,640
have any opinions and i'm not saying that we have to tolerate everything but there's a way if we have this really

264
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,919
strong opinion then it sets up like no all those people are wrong and i'm right

265
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,960
and we have to somehow make sure that we've rehearsed all the

266
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:31,600
reasons why they're wrong and we're right and this holding on just the holding on itself is agitating

267
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,880
and along those lines is can we soften some of these judgments judgments about

268
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:45,398
ourselves judgments about others things should be this way things that should not be that way

269
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:52,240
can we just let those go or soften them as best we can

270
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:01,919
so here's this uh the buddha talks about this uh a little bit and one of these suit does

271
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:09,760
and here he's talking about can we let go of some of these beliefs can we let go of some of these attachments

272
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,440
these attachments like i'm the one that knows i'm the one that has it right

273
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,480
those people are bad and i'm good or something like this which sounds

274
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:27,039
ridiculous when i'm saying this but there's might be subtle ways in which this is showing up

275
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:32,640
and can we just say yeah okay this is the belief i have right now

276
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:39,760
doesn't mean it's true it's just a belief i have right now so the buddha he's in this quote he's

277
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:46,559
pointing to can we let go of whatever it is that's binding us

278
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:54,880
whether it's a belief or an attachment and he starts by giving a simile

279
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:01,279
suppose there were a bull elephant with tusks like chariot poles able to draw a

280
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:07,520
heavy load and battle hardened we don't have elephants so much here in

281
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:13,200
redwood city but you know elephants are giant and have tusks like chariot poles are

282
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,320
really long and battle hard end right it knows how to go in it's tough right this

283
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:24,320
big giant big tough thing and suppose this elephant were bound

284
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,600
with a strong harness but just by twisting its body a little it

285
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,880
would snap apart its bonds and go wherever it wants we can imagine this

286
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,320
elephants are giant creatures would it be right to say that for that

287
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,360
elephant that strong harness is a strong firm stout

288
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:52,480
bond no for that elephant that harness is weak

289
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,799
feeble rotten and insubstantial

290
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:03,840
and then the buddha says in the same way when some people are told by me to

291
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:10,320
abandon this beliefs attachments whatever it is we find

292
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,880
ourselves really holding on to and it's amazing all the things that we can hold on to

293
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:22,799
when some people are told by me to abandon things they say what

294
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:30,080
i just have to abandon this trivial insignificant thing as this a belief might think like it's insignificant

295
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:36,640
and when the blessed one tells them to abandon it they abandon it and they don't nurse bitterness towards

296
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:42,320
me towards the buddha and when the practitioners who wish to

297
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:48,240
train have abandoned that they live relaxed

298
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:54,559
unruffled their hearts free as wild dear

299
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:02,240
so these attachments we might have he's saying that there's a way in which we can abandon or we can break these

300
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,559
these bonds we can by letting go

301
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:13,440
and then of course there's the opposite so the opposite of the elephant in

302
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:19,679
the suit is a quail i don't know if california quails are the same as what they have in india but

303
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:25,279
california they're so cute right these little creatures they run along and they have these

304
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:31,840
little things on their head they're like so adorable but they ran like really fast all over it

305
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:38,880
suppose a quail was tied with a vine and was waiting there to be injured caged or

306
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,919
killed you know just being stuck and this might even happen i don't know

307
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:49,440
quail might get tangled up with a vine would it be right to say that for that

308
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:55,200
quail that vine is weak feeble rotten and insubstantial

309
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:01,360
no for that quail that vine is a strong firm

310
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:08,640
stout bond a tie that is not rotted and is a heavy yoke

311
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:14,559
in the same way when people are told by me to give something up

312
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:21,039
to abandon to let go they say what such a trivial and significant thing is this

313
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:26,559
this teacher is too strict and they don't give it up

314
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:32,640
and they nurse bitterness towards the teacher like i can't believe they're asking me

315
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,799
to let go or soften or loosen this thing

316
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:46,399
and for those practitioners that trivial insignificant thing actually becomes a strong firm stout

317
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:53,480
bond a tie that is not rotted a heavy yoke

318
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,720
so something for us to think about what is it that we're holding on what are these

319
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,080
bonds is there some softening some letting go that we can do

320
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:11,760
so that we can live relaxed unruffled with hearts free as wild deer

321
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:18,560
as in this simile maybe i'll say a few more things here

322
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:24,560
about how we might do that some of them are obvious

323
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:30,960
relaxing the body we do some of that in a meditation practice sometimes if i'm doing a guided

324
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:37,599
meditation i will start with relaxing the body i'll lead us and relaxing the body

325
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:46,078
one is to just continue sitting often tranquility finds us right if we're sitting long enough

326
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:52,480
one is is there a way to cultivate contentment and gratitude in one's life

327
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:59,280
like this is enough gratitude practice can be so supportive

328
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:05,920
and this sense of like i i don't need more i don't have to

329
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:14,640
succumb to this fear of missing out or instead have like maybe the joy of missing out or something like this

330
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:20,880
and then of course tranquility is a support for tranquility

331
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:26,960
so the ways if we notice that the restlessness

332
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,800
as has quieted or maybe there isn't a lot of restlessness to just notice that

333
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:39,119
calmness it might be subtle but just noticing that calmness helps support more

334
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:46,079
calmness help support more tranquilly appreciating when it's there and noticing it

335
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:53,440
and then of course spending time alone spending time off of screens

336
00:35:53,440 --> 00:36:01,440
spending time in nature i think i think everybody knows this right sometimes it's helpful to be reminded like oh yeah

337
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:07,119
it's good to spend time outside if we can't in nature

338
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,079
so tranquility is this factor of awakening so

339
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:19,680
great support for our lives and for our practice moving towards

340
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,680
greater and greater freedom so may you find some tranquility in your

341
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:31,280
life and may be a support for you thank you

342
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:43,280
so now i'd like to open it up if there are any questions somebody wants to say something

343
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,000
hi diana good evening i have so just to clarify from the text that you read or

344
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,359
the buddha's teachings on the elephant and the quail

345
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:08,040
it's not good to be tethered by the poles or the vine

346
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:17,760
to be tethered by the like you know how the quail was tethered by the vine yeah and and the the elephant was tethered by

347
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:26,320
the the those those poles or something it was tethered by a harness a harness harness sorry so you neither are good

348
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,680
yeah okay and this even this idea that like a harness we might think that oh

349
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:38,000
that's very uh it's significant but a big bowl could uh

350
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,880
be break does it won't be um [Music] tethered i guess by the harness

351
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:53,359
so but and sometimes we're quails sometimes we were held by things that are uh

352
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:58,560
maybe they don't seem like big things but they're they're

353
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:04,240
binding us and sometimes we're elephants but is there a way that we can be an

354
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,359
elephant with a little vine wait i said do i have that right

355
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:15,839
whatever it is i'm sorry like my mind just totally kind of left me so

356
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:21,200
if you can figure this out elephants quails vines and harnesses

357
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:28,920
thank you for this idea of letting go not being bound up yeah

358
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,359
anybody else have a comment

359
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,520
um thank you so much so as we were talking about um giving up agitation in certain parts of

360
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:51,280
our life i was thinking about a problem my own practice that comes up with like thoughts and

361
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,640
trying to like go back to the breath and things like that and i'm worried about it kind of can you

362
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:02,480
bring the microphone just a little bit closer i'm worried about a sort of like

363
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,079
recursion problem where you're like okay i'm going to create spaciousness in my mind like here's my bullet point list on

364
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:15,119
how i'm going to do that and like exert control over like spaciousness and then like

365
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:21,920
does that make sense you just kind of right so that you think that you're going to create spaciousness but the activity of creating spaciousness is

366
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:27,599
causing agitation yeah or it becomes like another thing to control yeah

367
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:34,160
yeah yeah this is something that is just going to happen that we're going to try to control things right this is what human

368
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:39,280
beings do but i think that as we i'll say one thing as meditation

369
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:45,920
sessions each individual session lasts longer then there's tends to be a little bit more uh tranquility that arises just

370
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,200
you know 45 minutes versus 30 minutes versus 15 minutes or something like that

371
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:59,119
and also i think that there's something about repetition that the mind and the body they just

372
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:06,720
recognize that oh yeah this is possible uh this little bit of ease and it just becomes easier and easier to access it

373
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:14,720
but in the beginning there is some more intentional and control that we're doing intentionally to get it there is did i

374
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:20,800
address your question yes thank you so much yeah yeah i mean of course right humans we we want

375
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,838
to do this we want to fix things we want to be comfortable

376
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:31,280
hi diana thank you um

377
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:37,280
i think that a lot of time in edge if i'm agitated or

378
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:43,520
upset about something that the walking meditation or some physical

379
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:51,040
activity some repetitive physical activity is often freeing just because it

380
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:57,760
somehow releases some sort of energy um

381
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:04,880
but is that the purpose of walking meditation is that why walking meditation became a

382
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:10,319
thing uh first of all i'll say thank you for

383
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:16,480
saying that nancy that's an excellent idea right we can like go walk in outside support tranquility or sometimes

384
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:22,880
like doing the dishes or some crafts thing that we love to do or something like that

385
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:28,160
so i think walking meditation became a thing because bodies cannot sit

386
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:34,319
for so many hours right we're just not built to do that unless you're in some really really deep

387
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:42,640
states then you can sit for longer so it's a way walking meditation is a way to um not ruffle the mind and yet

388
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:48,960
move the body and i'll say something else it's also walk-in meditation it's a great way to

389
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:55,760
kind of like um support our energy sometimes it brings our energy up if we're kind of

390
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:02,160
like you know really dull or in our sitting or it dissipates energy if we're

391
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:07,000
feeling restlessness so maybe that's

392
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:26,079
okay okay so thank you all for your kind attention

393
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:34,640
and i'll stay up here if anybody wants to come up and talk or have a question they'd like to

394
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:40,039
ask without a microphone so thank you
