1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:07,200
so warm greetings for this tuesday

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,400
morning and for our second talk on the third

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,400
foundation for awareness and we are trying to steadily

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:26,160
through this sativatana to cultivate a heightened awareness a heightened sense of

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,840
knowing attentiveness presence

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,719
and and

7
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:45,280
in a sense there's a path through these different foundations beginning with breathing and then

8
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,320
mindfulness of the body mindfulness of feeling tones and then now mindfulness

9
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,640
of the mind it's uh sometimes considered to be more refined or more subtle or more

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,840
um more accessible through a

11
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,040
settled mind and so the beginning of this process begins with mindfulness of

12
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,479
breathing so in this meditation i'll lead you through

13
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:19,119
kind of a quick trip through this first two foundations a bit with the button breath the body

14
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:27,159
feeling tones and then we'll open up to the cheetah the mind the mind state

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,280
so assuming a meditative posture

16
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,079
one that allows you to have a combination of being alert

17
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,759
and relaxed at ease

18
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:53,040
and you might lower your gaze to about 45 degrees angle looking down at the floor

19
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,320
and kind of loosening the focus not looking at anything in particular and

20
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,079
letting the eyes become kind of soft and relaxed

21
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,959
and very gently slowly closing the eyelids

22
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,200
and then perhaps letting the mouth drop drop open a little bit

23
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,520
the teeth apart so the mouth is a little bit more relaxed

24
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,920
and then gently float the teeth together so they're almost touching or touching

25
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,519
so the jaws are a little bit more relaxed

26
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:54,480
softening the belly letting the belly hang forward and down

27
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,959
maybe in softening the belly feeling the weight of the belly and

28
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:12,840
so the belly almost kind of settles into the down towards the pelvic cavity

29
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,040
maybe beginning with a soft belly as you inhale

30
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:36,560
letting the in the belly expand the chest expand

31
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,840
maybe taking a long slow deep breath

32
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,640
and a leisurely a little bit longer exhale

33
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,959
on the exhale relaxing the face

34
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,199
on the exhale relaxing the shoulders softening in the shoulders

35
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,080
adjusting your hands and arms a little bit if that helps the shoulders

36
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,680
and again softening the belly

37
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:57,320
breathing normally letting your breath just be let the breath breathe itself

38
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:06,080
and become aware of the thinking mind

39
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,840
is a lot of energy or pressure contraction tension in the

40
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,720
thinking mind

41
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,960
restlessness

42
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,320
maybe on the exhale a little longer exhale again

43
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,880
settle the mind quiet the mind

44
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,080
almost as if as the on the exhale the mind spreads wide

45
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:02,039
spreads horizontally wide and peaceful

46
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,160
and then settling the awareness into the body

47
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,160
breathing

48
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:26,319
and it might help you not to struggle

49
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,639
with anything if you think of the breathing not something to be

50
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:39,680
exclusively focused on but something to

51
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,680
allow to be at the center of all things as if the experience of breathing

52
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,599
is the center of your world

53
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:57,360
and your job is to sit at the centers be with the breathing

54
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,080
and allow everything else to be in the periphery

55
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:14,638
as if for a few minutes at least breathing is the only thing you need to do focus on

56
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,280
just breathing

57
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:17,680
and then knowing how the body moves as you breathe

58
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,760
the movements of the chest the belly

59
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,200
maybe the shoulders

60
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,160
even the back rib cage

61
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:07,279
maybe as if you're flowed and peacefully floating on waves gently coming and going across

62
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:13,680
the ocean gently resting

63
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,800
floating on the movements of the torso as you breathe

64
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,399
maybe being being aware of breathing in the middle of your body

65
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,880
the peripheral attention as a global awareness of your body

66
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:26,720
that receives the experience of breathing receives the inhale

67
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,720
settles on the exhale

68
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:53,920
and as you're aware of breathing is any of the breathing

69
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:00,800
is there anything connected to breathing pleasant or unpleasant

70
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,399
maybe there's both going on at different parts of the cycle some are pleasant some are more

71
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,399
unpleasant

72
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:30,480
see if you can be equanimous but pleasant or unpleasant and breathing

73
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,839
just know it that's how it is as if you're breathing through the

74
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:42,079
pleasant through the unpleasant

75
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,519
breathing with it

76
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:26,680
and in particular [Music] feel the pleasant part of breathing

77
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:39,199
and let yourself feel it more fully like taking in

78
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:47,839
drinking or receiving the pleasure of breathing

79
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,839
even if it's just a small part of the breath

80
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,480
and more broadly in your body beyond the

81
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,480
experience of breathing are there any pleasant feelings of your

82
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,880
body that you can breathe with

83
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,959
or that you can allow to accompany the experience of breathing

84
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,880
so your attention to the breathing is supported

85
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:17,160
by the pleasant sensations of your body

86
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:52,399
and notice if there's any pleasant or unpleasant sensations of the mind

87
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:03,680
breathe with them so your attention is more with the

88
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:12,319
breathing than reactive to the mind just breathe with how the mind is

89
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,839
whether it's pleasant or unpleasant

90
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,760
perhaps relaxing any agitation or tension in the mind

91
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,080
as you breathe

92
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,480
um

93
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,559
breathing in and breathing out centering yourself on breathing

94
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:02,559
and with the peripheral attention gently without

95
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:08,720
too much effort or focus see if you can know something about the

96
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,760
quality of your mind your mind state

97
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:25,519
maybe as if you're breathing with or through your mind your mind state

98
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,520
knowing it for what it is equanimously

99
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:40,080
whether it's pleasant or unpleasant whether it's agitated or peaceful

100
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:49,080
aversive or kind

101
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:05,840
strongly wanting something or being content

102
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:13,280
whatever way it is breathe with it

103
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:20,399
breathe through it know it

104
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:29,639
kind of as a peripheral phenomenon as you center yourself on your breathing

105
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,840
and then letting go of your breathing

106
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:13,120
and see if you can directly know your mind your mind state

107
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,600
and now let that be the center of attention

108
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:25,440
see if you can simply be aware no be present

109
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:34,240
for how your mind is the attitude the state the mood

110
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:42,520
the energy and see if you can know it

111
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,360
with a knowing that's peaceful equanimous

112
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:57,279
not troubled by how the mind is not desirous for anything being

113
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,840
different just knowing

114
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:15,520
and as you know it almost as if you're roaming around in the mind

115
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:23,639
to feel it know it in different ways different directions

116
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,759
and then coming to the end of this sitting

117
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:59,080
whatever the way that your mind is calm or equanimous

118
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:06,480
or even if it just wishes it was or assumes you have some

119
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,840
considering the suffering of this world

120
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,799
equanimously gazing upon it kindly

121
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:29,440
gently as you would gently touch

122
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,840
or clean a wound on the knee of a child

123
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,520
to cause the least amount of pain for the child caring loving the kid

124
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:52,840
so look out upon the world of that kind of soft kind gaze caring gays

125
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:01,039
as if having compassion for the world

126
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:07,000
should be done with respect and gentleness and

127
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,398
tenderness

128
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:21,520
and for all the people who are suffering in wars and poverty and oppression

129
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:28,480
all the people struggling can we from our

130
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:35,320
quiet whatever quiet and peace of the mind we have

131
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:45,200
wish well on this world may all

132
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,200
beings be happy

133
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,679
may all beings be safe

134
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:02,640
may all beings be peaceful

135
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:09,000
and may all beings be free

136
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:27,380
[Music]

137
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:36,959
[Music]

138
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:36,480
so continuing on these talks of the third foundation for awareness

139
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:44,480
which is mindfulness of the mind and so it's

140
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:52,080
building our capacity to be aware by knowing what's happening in the mind recognizing the mind

141
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:59,279
and the mind is important because whatever the mind is this inner mental state heart state

142
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:05,039
whatever the heart is the the there's the intellectual emotional

143
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:10,640
center for ourselves that's the location

144
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:16,559
for our primary experiences of suffering and for

145
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:23,039
happiness we can have physical pain and physical pleasure

146
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:29,360
but the places where the mind is the location for that which is existentially much deeper

147
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:35,360
and impactful and important for us it's a location for where

148
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:44,000
suffering occurs and whether you call that place the mind or the heart or some other name

149
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:50,720
the mind is that inner mental emotional landscape

150
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:57,279
that we have and you can define it for yourself it's more important how what you're experiencing than that you

151
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:01,518
experience some buddhist idea what the mind is

152
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:09,200
and um it's also where we can feel happy deep abiding happiness

153
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:16,320
deep peace and even the experience of freedom is something that belongs to the mind

154
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:23,040
this cheetah so the task

155
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,560
that as is described in the text is simply to know

156
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:34,480
the state of the mind in the way that it is there's nothing in it about

157
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:40,638
judging it making commentary about it wishing it would be otherwise being

158
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:48,398
aversive to it trying to fix it trying to make it into something else it's simply to recognize it as it is and

159
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:54,000
as i've said that simple recognition does change begin to change it

160
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,880
tends to change it in a wholesome direction because the clear mindfulness of it

161
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,320
is now is not feeding anymore the unhealthy and the unwholesome mind

162
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,599
states if we're not really mindful the mental energy can go into the

163
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:18,320
stories and the ideas and the resentments and all kinds of things that support this on wholesome mindset of

164
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:24,800
mind but as the energy of the mind goes into being to being a mindful

165
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:31,680
into a kind of clear knowing oh this is what's happening now i see i see

166
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,880
the mind is desirous the mind is full of wanting something strong

167
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:42,240
and that's what's going on in the mind it's almost like you can have that conversation with yourself oh that's

168
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,280
what it's like or it's full of aversion or resentment

169
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,720
or hostility or irritation that's what the mind is like

170
00:35:52,720 --> 00:36:00,720
right now the mind is like this if it's confused agitated

171
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,800
full of doubt full of delusion to know this is what it's like

172
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:13,599
this is a delusion delusive mind mind that's spinning stories and fantasies

173
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:19,440
and so the um to know to simply to know it and this is kind of the the center of

174
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,720
this exercise of the third foundation is that how simple can you simply know

175
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:31,040
the mind mind state makes a huge difference to do that

176
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:37,040
because chances are if we're not just simply knowing it if the mind is caught up in desires or

177
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:43,760
aversions or confusion delusion those come along as baggage carry on luggage

178
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,280
for how we do the mindfulness practice and the mindfulness itself will have

179
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:55,040
awareness itself would be somehow colored by that desire leaning forward grasping wanting

180
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:02,320
uh or by the aversion of pushing away or being hostile or looking you know meanly at it

181
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:08,320
or it's just confused the awareness itself is not very centered or

182
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:14,640
clear and calm because it's agitated confused not going with knowing which way to go

183
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:21,440
so the more we can just let the knowing be very very simple the less carry-on baggage it comes it

184
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,560
comes along with and then it just see lighter and easier and easier

185
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:33,200
so the way the buddha words these instructions he says when a mind when the mind state or the mind when the

186
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:41,520
cheetah is with desire it knows the mind is with desire

187
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:47,200
when the mind is without desire one knows the mind is without desire

188
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,240
sometimes translators have translated this as if one knows that the state of

189
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:58,720
mind is desirous a desiring state of mind

190
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,800
or an aversive state of mind but literally the the pali it says uh

191
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:11,440
mind with desire with the virgin and this is a very significant uh

192
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:17,440
distinction because as mindfulness is a clear awareness it recognizes something

193
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,160
clearly for itself as that becomes stronger

194
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,599
the desire and the aversion is not part of the whole mind it doesn't color or

195
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:35,599
shape or define the whole mind awareness the clear awareness begins to

196
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:41,280
expand the domain of the mind so it's no longer wrapped into

197
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,480
desire or aversion and so with clear mindfulness

198
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:53,280
desire is not the whole mind it's just a part of it the mind is coming along with the mind but it doesn't define the whole

199
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:59,200
mind and so um part of the this is why it's this practice of the

200
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,400
mind is so powerful when the mindfulness can see oh this is in the mind

201
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:10,240
and one place the buddha talks about the mind having

202
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,440
visitors the visitors that confuse it the visitors that defile it

203
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:22,160
the visited visitors that obstruct the mind and decide well lovely idea that greed

204
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,599
hatred delusion the hindrances are visitors to the mind not

205
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:33,280
inherent to the mind and we start when mindfulness becomes strong enough

206
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,720
then we start kind of prying ourselves apart from these difficult mind states

207
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:44,560
and we start seeing oh there's more going on but the buddha also talks about not just

208
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,839
seeing a desirous mind with desire but also seeing a mind

209
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:56,800
that's without desire this means positive states of mind

210
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:03,200
generosity is a state without desire without greed

211
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:12,720
for example and and so it's also positive states of mind but here we're asked to notice when

212
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:19,200
there's desirous in the mind and when there's not when the mind is colored and shaped by desire and when it's not

213
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,920
and it's of course part of the mind that sees it and um and so the three kind of three

214
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:32,480
root fundamental kind of forces of the mind that underlie all unhealthy states of mind according to

215
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:39,760
the buddha greed hatred and desire one knows a mind with greed with greedy desire

216
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:46,720
as such when knows a mind without greed as such when knows a mind with

217
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:52,079
aversion or hatred or stillie as such one knows a mind without it as

218
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:58,480
such and one knows a deluded mind or a confused mind

219
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:04,319
as such someone knows a mind without that as such and

220
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:10,000
and so becoming more and more familiar with this and then becoming familiar what's that like

221
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,440
so it's not just knowing it but knowing the felt sense the experience of it

222
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,359
uh recognizing um there's a clear recognition oh when the mind is full of desire it's leaning

223
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:26,880
forward it's searching when the mind has aversive it's

224
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:35,040
stabbing or you know attacking or blaming or or pulling away or it's getting the mind

225
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:41,119
gets narrower contracted it gets restless it gets a kind of maybe a phonetic

226
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,720
energy if that goes on the mind maybe the the mind is more up in the

227
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:52,000
head rather than in the heart and the body the location of the mind shifts and

228
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,680
changes depending on what the mind is caught up in at the moment

229
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:03,280
and when it's caught with great hate and delusion chances are it's there's some kind of locus

230
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,319
center of the mind where it's coming feel it's located that might be different

231
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:13,680
than if the mind is filled with compassion and love and peace and wisdom

232
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:19,280
and so to look around and explore what does it feel like in the body what does it feel

233
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:25,200
like in the mind itself what's it what impact does the these different states of mind have in our

234
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:31,040
clarity of mind and our ability to stay focused and balanced

235
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:37,520
so we begin kind of um familiarizing ourselves with all this but this is a third foundation of

236
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,800
mindfulness so to do this right away from the beginning

237
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:49,280
maybe it means that um we get rap we get just more confused by it or wrapped up in it or reactive to it

238
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:55,200
or it lends itself to a lot more thinking about it all but to think of this third foundation of

239
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:01,440
mindfulness as as having the first two foundations

240
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:08,720
as a support for it the mind is already able to get somewhat calm present stable

241
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:14,720
in the present moment the mind is starting to come strong in its mindfulness

242
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:20,800
so with that calm ability to be calm and centered and not being distracted easily

243
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:27,359
without and knowing something about this non-reactive awareness and just knows

244
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:32,640
very simply when that is all in place that's a good time to start becoming

245
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:38,079
aware of the mind state if that's not in place then it's good to go back to the beginning just go back to

246
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:44,079
just breathing and beginning of the whole satyapathanam until it all settles in again

247
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:51,680
and then we can kind of begin opening to the mind state and the mind state can color mindfulness

248
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:58,640
as i've said and color how we're mindful it's like carry-on luggage we bring with us so has become clear and clear about the

249
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:04,079
mind state that we have that um we have less and less of this luggage

250
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:10,319
and the mind becomes clearer brighter more free in a certain kind of way

251
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:16,720
in a couple of days we're going to look at the second half of this third foundation where that is looking

252
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:23,599
at the the what it grow how the mind can grow and develop when it's no longer in the grip of greed

253
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:28,720
hate and delusion or fear or agitation or contraction and

254
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:35,119
and what we'll see then is that the discussion goes from talking what the mind is with to talking about the state

255
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:41,200
of the mind itself and when these beautiful states arise they can coexist with mindfulness with

256
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:47,599
awareness it's almost like they are awareness but that's for in a couple of days

257
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:55,440
so um thank you and um in the next 24 hours or so when you have

258
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:02,800
a chance going about your daily life you might uh in daily life start doing a little bit in inventory

259
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:09,839
of the state of your mind is it a mind that with desire is it a mind with

260
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:14,960
hostility or hatred or ill will aversion is it a mind that's confused or delusive

261
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:21,280
and just notice these will probably float through and arise and pass in different circumstances when you're hungry for dinner

262
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:27,359
you might feel that desire mind is predominant when you've eaten too much a verse of

263
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:34,160
mind is predominant when you wonder how to do the dishes

264
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:40,880
uh when the dishwashing machine is completely packed and you might notice this confused confused mind or

265
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:46,400
you know just notice it comes and goes it's like kaleidoscope in small subtle and big ways

266
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:54,000
start tracking all this and when when there's no desire notice what that's like no ill will notice what

267
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,480
that's like and just kind of explore and and get to know and become familiar with it texture

268
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:07,119
the smell the feel for these mind states and see what happens when you recognize them

269
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:12,078
more and more i look forward to

270
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,280
i'm introducing the next talk thank you
