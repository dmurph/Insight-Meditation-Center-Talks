00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,040
my name is Maria Stratman i am here for Diana tonight and it's really a joy to

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:16,960
see you all here this is really delightful um I am recently returned

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:26,560
from Bhutan i've been back about a week from a trip that was uh amazing and

4
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,119
that's what I'd like to talk to you about tonight

5
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,160
my impressions of this place which it's a it's a small

6
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:44,280
country it's sort of sandwiched between India and China and it is a Buddhist

7
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,519
country through and through a Buddhist

8
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:57,440
country its laws are Buddhist its its attitude is Buddhist its culture is

9
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:04,559
Buddhist its way of life is Buddhist and it it is a culture with

10
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:11,840
which I am totally unfamiliar it was it was quite astounding to visit these people and the

11
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,479
one thing that I found most remarkable about these

12
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:25,159
people was their attitude of kindness kindness

13
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,200
kindness as a value as a way of being in the way that we think of

14
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:39,680
individualism you know here it's not that we're opposed to kindness we value kindness but for us you know the rugged

15
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:46,759
individual is pretty important for them kindness is really

16
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:53,040
important and it comes out almost immediately just immediately

17
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,200
people are kind i was so struck by

18
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,840
that it was an incredible experience just an incredible experience for me so

19
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,560
um there are about 780,000 people in the whole country which is you know about

20
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,840
the size of San Francisco the country itself is the highest country in the

21
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,360
world uh pretty much we actually stayed for a

22
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:29,920
couple of days at about 4,000 ft that's about as low as we got but most of the time it was you know 7 8 9 10,000 ft

23
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,599
that we were operating so while I'd wanted to go to Bhutan for I don't know

24
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:42,560
25 years or so I'd sort of written it off as I'm never going to be able to go there because you know I'm too old i

25
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,680
have trouble with altit altitude i'm in pretty bad physical shape it's not something I'm going to be able to

26
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,079
do and I

27
00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:01,879
went and I was scared what am I doing and rightfully

28
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:10,480
so it was tough it was tough i have I have a need that's due to

29
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,239
be replaced and pretty much everything is you you hike up we visited

30
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,760
monasteries and nunneries all over the country and everything is up they they

31
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,200
live at a high level and then you climb up to the monasteries i'm not quite sure what the reasoning is but everything is

32
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:35,360
up up to the monasteries well you know they have to go up there and isolate themselves and

33
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,280
the monks are that's what they do the monks and the nuns

34
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:50,040
we actually visited two nunneries which is unusual for tour groups they usually are limited to the monasteries

35
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,319
um these buildings are uh hundreds hundreds of years old and

36
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:05,439
the iconography inside of the walls are all covered with depictions of various

37
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:11,760
Buddhas and Buddhist lives all painted in mural like on the on mud walls and

38
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,880
they're periodically refurbished and re redone and they have schools where they

39
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,840
train people to do

40
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,240
this and they have to they have to be of certain skill before they're allowed to

41
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:37,720
perform these these refurbishments and so everything was also being

42
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:44,440
rebuilt so the the second day we were there we climbed from 8,000 ft to 9,500

43
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:50,639
ft just about killed me just about killed me and that's when I first became

44
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,680
aware of kindness the number of people who helped me get up that

45
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,720
mountain who urged me on took my backpack from

46
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:08,240
me insisted and told me I didn't need to carry that backpack that I could just

47
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,160
get myself up the hill and that would be fine

48
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,800
and I learned another part of kindness not only the attitude of caring about

49
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:26,160
somebody else but the willingness to accept kindness is also a part of

50
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:32,880
kindness a really important part of kindness if you can't accept kindness

51
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,240
you can also not be kind

52
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,080
and so I had to learn how to accept kindness you know I am kind of

53
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:53,919
a I don't need help sort of person but I needed help i needed quite

54
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,400
a bit of help

55
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,080
so that involved a certain amount of

56
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,880
humility and the interesting thing was you know I made it i made it to the top

57
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:19,680
and I was there it was great the monastery was astounding

58
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,720
we sat in this ancient monastery and the monks served us tea and we heard the stories about what

59
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,280
occurred at that particular monastery and we watched the troop of

60
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,479
monkeys and we looked at the the rebuilding of part of the

61
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:43,840
monastery and I didn't feel a sense of accomplishment i felt an amazing sense

62
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:50,400
of joy just overwhelming

63
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:56,199
joy just wow

64
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,919
being around people who are kind being able to accept

65
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:10,360
kindness elicits a feeling in the heart of such

66
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:16,960
freedom such ease that we are simply not used to

67
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:23,080
we're not familiar with at least I haven't

68
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:29,478
been it was lovely just lovely

69
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:36,240
quite remarkable it's part of their national

70
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,919
identity now I've kind of lost track of all the days we went to many monasteries but one night we had a speaker who was

71
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,280
in the education department so they they provide education for everybody as long

72
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:57,199
as they want to go to school it's free uh as long as they're studying if they're not studying then they can't go

73
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:04,560
to school anymore but this guy was um studying how to teach kindness to

74
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,199
grade school kids because they teach kindness to elementary school kids

75
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:18,800
that's how important it is to them and he found the most important thing was to model

76
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:26,440
it that that seemed to be the best way to teach it was to model kindness

77
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,518
okay that sounds good to me works that that's the way you spread

78
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:39,518
kindness so on that walk that I told you about that went up to the the Tego monastery

79
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:45,760
which means something like horse head there was u there they had signs to

80
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,440
encourage you partway up and one of the signs said if you want to know who you

81
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,920
were in the past look at who you are today if you want to know who you're

82
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,640
going to be tomorrow look at your mind today

83
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:12,440
that inculcating kindness as an attitude of mind determines who you're going to

84
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:18,000
be determines how you're going to be in the world whether you want to be a

85
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,480
person who is a caring person or

86
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:31,959
not it's a habit of mind this caring this being kind

87
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:38,480
people actually would stop and listen to you can I help

88
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:47,839
you what do you need did you get what you wanted and they they didn't ask casually they

89
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,839
really wanted to know did you get what you needed did you get what you wanted is

90
00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:01,000
there anything else you need here it was quite phenomenal

91
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:11,000
quite phenomenal the being present just being present stopping

92
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,760
stopping you know when somebody would give you your hotel room key they would look at you and they'd hand your key

93
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:24,160
over like this and you'd have to look them in the eye to take the key you know it's not

94
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:31,360
"Oh here's your key." And go on to something else it was "Here's your key

95
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,800
with you know a certain amount of expectation behind it yeah your key

96
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:43,120
right let us know if you need anything do we need any more water and

97
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:50,000
in the in the rooms instead of a Bible it said "What makes you think you're not Buddhist?" There was a book said "What

98
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,079
makes you think you're not Buddhist?" which you know I I didn't actually read because I didn't have time

99
00:10:57,079 --> 00:11:00,880
but I thought that was

100
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:10,120
interesting and if you said that you weren't happy with something the face would just

101
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:17,480
fall it was just catastrophic oh

102
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,959
i had a room a roommate that I didn't know very well and and uh you know when

103
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:35,360
you're tired it's easier to be irritated about things and we got very tired after

104
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,440
some of our tracks and one night nothing in our room seemed to be right and when

105
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:48,240
she couldn't turn on the light and couldn't get her adapter to plug in she just went ah

106
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:55,680
And so somebody made the mistake of asking how we liked our room and she said "Well," and so they decided to move

107
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,240
us because they couldn't stand the fact that we didn't like the room you know it was sort of

108
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:08,760
"Oh it wasn't that bad they were uh they were so

109
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:14,000
accommodating they were just uh it wasn't individuals it was

110
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:23,440
everybody that did that so um the last day that we were there

111
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:31,279
uh five of us from our tour group went up to the last nunnery and it if they'd told me what we

112
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:37,920
were going to do I probably would have said no but since I didn't know what we were going to do we ended up doing this

113
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:46,600
walk up a very narrow steep trail to 11,825 ft elevation

114
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:55,639
and uh it was about a 20 minute high cup so it wasn't very long but it was

115
00:12:55,639 --> 00:13:04,240
high and there were 21 nuns at this nunnery

116
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:11,040
maintaining this 8th century monastery they didn't have a teacher

117
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:20,680
anymore because there wasn't one that would come there and this nun had been there for seven

118
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:27,120
years and because she'd fulfilled her seven-year obligation she could now go

119
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,480
and do what she wanted to do as a nun which was enter into a three-year silent

120
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:40,279
meditation period and her only requirement was that she could go somewhere

121
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:46,680
warm it was pretty cold up there and this is you know spring pretty warm for

122
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:55,680
Bhutan and she was just tired of being cold and so she was asked "Why why after

123
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,320
seven years in the nunnery do you now want to go do 3 years silent meditation

124
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,720
somewhere?" And she said "Oh I'm so worried about the world i'm so worried

125
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:16,000
about the world and so I need to go settle my mind because I have to settle my mind

126
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:23,399
first what a way to think what a way to

127
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:30,079
be in order to create peace in the world I first have to create peace in my own

128
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,079
mind

129
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:42,320
it was quite inspirational quite

130
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:51,680
inspirational and she was so taken that we had come up there they they can't grow their food up there everything is

131
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,519
brought up to them you know at at that altitude they can't really grow anything

132
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:04,079
so all their food is brought up on somebody's back up this narrow trail so

133
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:11,360
they mostly eat rice and uh the government supports them

134
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,880
so each nun gets $20 a month the equivalent of $20 a

135
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:23,279
month and that buys their food and their fuel

136
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:32,720
you know they burn they burn wood in a a wood fireplace and they light butter

137
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:39,279
lamps to remember people so I got to light a butter lamp for my brother and

138
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:44,360
they promised to pay for pray for him

139
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:51,000
was a really moving experience to be among these people who were so

140
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:58,000
profound for for whom for whom their religion was their life it wasn't

141
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,079
something added on it was the way they

142
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:10,880
lived it was the way they lived and people would there are uh prayer wheels

143
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:17,600
everywhere and you're probably all familiar with prayer wheels so the form of Buddhism they practice is a a

144
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:24,160
vajarana Buddhism which is like Tibetan if you think in terms of Tibetan Buddhism it's similar to that there it's

145
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:30,800
a a sect uh of vajana Buddhism that they practice and so there are these giant prayer

146
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:38,160
wheels everywhere and stupas and people are walking around them all the time and in their

147
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:45,079
daily practice everyone does

148
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:49,040
is that's just what they

149
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:56,399
do that's just what they

150
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:03,199
do they don't know any other way of

151
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,480
being they stop they listen

152
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:21,280
they pay attention they

153
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,839
care and it's an attitude that they carry around with

154
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,880
them now the country has problems we heard a lot about their economic

155
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:43,400
problems and bringing the world them into the 21st century is not a

156
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:49,840
trivial activity for them their number one source of income is is hydroelectric

157
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:56,480
plants and they sell their their electricity to India and they don't actually see any money from that because

158
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:03,200
it goes to paying off their debt to India for building the hydroelectric plants so their second source of income

159
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,240
is tourism

160
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:20,480
and they tried to limit that and they have a policy that 60% of their country has to remain in

161
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,760
its native state they're the only country in the world that is actually

162
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,960
not carbon neutral but carbon negative they they plant more trees than they cut

163
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,440
down and

164
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:46,080
uh you may have heard they're the country that has that instead of talking about gross national product they talk

165
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:53,919
about gross national happiness so they're going to build a new city which is called a mindful city

166
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,120
in southern Bhutan that they think is going to bring them into the 21st century

167
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:06,240
and uh it's not at all clear to me how that's going to work but that's not the topic for this

168
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:15,919
conversation so I I don't want to create the idea that it's uh a utopian place

169
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,919
but I found the the character of the people quite

170
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:29,240
remarkable and the ease with which they go through their day quite remarkable

171
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,520
it was just stunning and to be in the presence of

172
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:45,280
kindness as an attitude was truly delightful

173
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:52,080
so I am here to procilitize in favor of kindness and to encourage you to think

174
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:59,760
about how you too can engage in kindness and make it part of your

175
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:06,240
life and finally there is gratitude so I have this little book

176
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,679
called the power of kindness and it's written by Pierro Ferruchi i don't know

177
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:18,960
if it's still in print i've had it for I don't know 15 years or so and since I came back I've I've been rereading it so

178
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,200
it's on the subject of kindness but he has a little thing here I want to read

179
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,240
you to be kind without being grateful is

180
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:37,440
dangerous perhaps impossible people who do do not know how to receive and do not feel thankful for

181
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,760
what they've been given are in trouble when they try to be kind they think they're being great benefactors and

182
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,919
everyone should be indebted to them maybe they even remind others of their own good deeds expecting gratitude they

183
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:56,799
become condescending also it's harder for them to appreciate subtle seemingly m

184
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:02,799
insignificant aspects for example a smile half an hour in someone's company

185
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:09,280
a witty remark they value only concrete and measurable gifts such as a watch or a

186
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:17,200
fountain pen but kindness not does not fit onto a balance sheet

187
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:24,159
so one of the feelings that I had when I was experiencing all this kindness was

188
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:30,720
the feeling of gratitude i think it's impossible to be in the

189
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,200
presence of kindness and not experience

190
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:43,400
gratitude and practicing gratitude is part of practicing

191
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:51,120
kindness and I don't mean you have to go around thinking thinking up things to be thankful for but rather notice things

192
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:58,200
like when I came in I noticed the dog woods are in bloom i love dog woods so I

193
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:06,480
stopped and was just silently grateful for Dogwoods it's the stopping and just

194
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:13,840
paying attention to a moment of isn't that great i'm glad I saw that i'm glad

195
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,960
I experienced that i'm glad I got to hear that i'm glad I got to see you i'm

196
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:27,480
glad just that amount of grat gratitude that's the other half of

197
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,919
kindness it's a very important part of

198
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:41,120
kindness so through my whole trip in Bhutan mostly what I felt I've told the

199
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,880
story about how I'd wanted to go to Bhutan for 25 years and I'd written it

200
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:53,360
off i'm not going to go i'm too old it's not going to happen and then I went not once did I have a feeling of

201
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:59,320
accomplishment i'd call my husband i'd say "Here's what I did today." And "Wow Maria you did

202
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:07,760
that." Not once did I have a feeling of accomplishment but always I felt like

203
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:14,120
every step was a blessing a blessing a

204
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:21,159
blessing don't fail to notice all the blessings in your life just a

205
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:28,240
blessing because you never know you never know how great a blessing will

206
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,919
just drop on you out of nowhere so be in the habit of noticing it so that you

207
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:40,960
don't miss it so one of the one of the greatest

208
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,760
experiences of Bhutan was in fact the

209
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:53,080
occasional feeling of being overwhelmed by a sense of

210
00:23:53,080 --> 00:24:00,880
joy i listened to the to one of Gil's talks on the third Janna which he's been

211
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,120
going through the samadei and he he talked about

212
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:11,360
happiness and the feeling of happiness and I thought "Yep that's just

213
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:17,840
what it was just just happiness for no reason." Not

214
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:24,480
that you can point at and say "This caused happiness," but just

215
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:34,520
wow notice when it arises in your life it's there don't let it pass you by

216
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,559
one of the people who talked to us was uh Kenpo who was a teacher at the

217
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:47,200
Buddhist University in Tempu which is the largest city in Bhutan and I went up

218
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:55,320
and talked to him after he gave us this talk and he said and I did a

219
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:02,520
little you know may you know peace and happiness for him and he

220
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:09,760
said you must smile like this every day and I didn't know whether it was a

221
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:17,840
blessing or an instruction and I've decided it was

222
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:25,159
both so smile every day let it be both a blessing and an

223
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:28,400
instruction thank

224
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:37,679
you so those are my thoughts any questions

225
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,360
comments yes

226
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:53,120
do I press something uh this is very new to me kind

227
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,559
of almost kind of confusing i grew up in the 50s and my parents never said never

228
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:07,279
talked about kindness and mindfulness and everything that I hear constantly on television i'm a TV watcher my age oh so

229
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:12,400
it's just a Well I don't know what to make of it

230
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,880
i've just never thought that way

231
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:23,640
yeah yeah i just never think that way but it's

232
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:30,720
possible you know could just wonder what's going on with the

233
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,480
other person this what's going on with you

234
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,960
how does it feel to

235
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:50,840
not just How does it feel to be you well I This seems to be a buzz word

236
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:56,520
kindfulness no me what did I write there me uh

237
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:03,600
meta what do you What's the buzz word mindfulness mindfulness i don't remember

238
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,880
my parents never talked about anything like that they were ra I was raised episcipellian

239
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,320
and I did some TM and nami huro i've done a

240
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,840
different forms of religion and this is nice because I just like sitting here and it's quiet and there's nothing

241
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:26,240
there's no cat jumping on my lap and you know it's just very peaceful so I really love it but it's just I don't know

242
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,840
mindfulness when did that come to is this a thing five years ago 10

243
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:38,240
years ago all of a sudden where Well I I think mindfulness is has

244
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:45,120
entered into the the everyday lexicon and it means a lot of things to different people but so so let me just

245
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:52,080
talk a minute about what it means to me so so mindfulness means that you're aware of some object there's an object

246
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:59,600
and there's knowing the object but mindfulness is knowing you know the object so what I mean by that is you

247
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,720
know I know I'm sitting here but until I say I'm sitting here and I'm aware of my

248
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:11,919
bum on this cushion I don't really know I'm sitting here you know it's all in my

249
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:18,679
head but I'm mindful of sitting when I notice I'm sitting so there's an awareness component to

250
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:25,200
mindfulness okay so when I was going down those hills I was extremely mindful

251
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:31,440
because my knee is so bad right so part of the time it was slick downhill and

252
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:39,039
part of the time it was stairs well neither is good when you've got a bad knee and you're going downhill so what I

253
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:45,279
would have to do is decide I have a partially torn ACL so that means that

254
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:50,640
twisting the knee is bad but because I have no cartilage and a torn you know

255
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,960
shredded meniscus in my knee I have bone on bone so when I step down off a step

256
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:04,640
that hurts so with every step I had to decide am I just going to take it straight on and take the pain that way

257
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,760
or am I going to go sideways and twist it and take the pain that way and every

258
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:16,559
step I paid attention to how I was putting my foot down that's mindfulness

259
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:24,399
okay that's mindfulness when you're paying attention with every step all right now when I'm walking down

260
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:30,559
the street I don't pay attention to every step i'm paying attention to something else but walking down that

261
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:36,159
hill I was extremely mindful with every step i was also the last person off the

262
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:42,720
hill all the time well no there was one guy who's three years older than me that was sometimes

263
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,278
later than

264
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:54,240
me so mindfulness is what are you aware of what do you what do you what do you

265
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:00,880
know when you're aware of something i think I'm too aware of everything all

266
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:07,600
the time well maybe maybe you know if if your mind is off wandering around and

267
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:14,080
you're lost in a fantasy you're not aware but if you are aware you're thinking of something you're aware i'm

268
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:20,200
thinking I'm thinking thinking planning planning i know that's what's happening that's

269
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:27,440
mindfulness okay so the point of mindfulness is to be in the present and

270
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:33,520
not lost it's to be to actually be living your life to be totally present

271
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,279
for your life that's the point of mindfulness

272
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,880
well maybe I am mindful just didn't realize I was well there you go i guess

273
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,159
I mean I'm I'm becoming more aware that I need to be nicer to people polite when

274
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:56,080
I'm driving you know every Well I usually am but just just say nice things

275
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:01,159
to people because I'm very critical of people and myself that's where

276
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:06,720
the Yeah so uh it might be useful to make a distinction between being nice

277
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:14,520
and being kind so we can be nice we're polite we uh you know we're socially

278
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:21,919
adept and we um we put out the tea but but you know

279
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:27,120
it's just automatic but being kind is being present for someone and doing

280
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:33,360
something that they want and not something just because we think it'll make them happy when when what I noticed

281
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:39,679
in the hotels in particular of people is that I never had the impression that somebody was doing something so I'd give

282
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:46,279
them a tip and you can tell you know when [Laughter]

283
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:51,919
somebody's or when they're really trying to help you the difference between being

284
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:58,159
nice and being kind and that's worth sort of thinking through for yourself

285
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:04,000
you know am I being kind to someone and and that can be

286
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,840
uh am I using someone's time appropriately

287
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:17,320
now am I am I being considerate of this person

288
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:38,519
yes thank you very much it was nice to hear about your experience

289
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:45,120
um I'm curious about a couple of things one is um your thoughts about kindness

290
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:52,960
and gratitude in relation to emotions like anger and uh self-p protection

291
00:32:52,960 --> 00:33:00,480
um and what your observations in Bhutan were of how people um are able are able

292
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:06,679
to set boundaries for themselves okay that's that's very appropriate so

293
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:13,120
um so I can't speak on behalf of people in Bhutan so let me speak on my own

294
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:19,640
behalf so uh I often in discussions with my husband you know we've been together

295
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:27,279
for 40 years we have things that each of us does that irritates the other and you

296
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:33,120
know it comes up right and so you can be in the middle of a

297
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:39,960
conversation you can feel it heating up and I can I I notice it's heating up

298
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:48,840
here and I can pause and say it's my intention to be kind to my

299
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:56,080
husband yeah but I'm right yeah but it's my intention to be kind

300
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:01,679
so is it important is is this conversation important because I need to

301
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:09,679
be right or is it because the consequences of my being

302
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:15,599
right are important for somebody's health or it you know if it's just that

303
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:21,679
I want to be right that's not important compared to wanting to be kind and I can

304
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:27,679
tamp it down but I have to be able to pause to do that so I have to be mindful of

305
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:35,838
what's going on in order to do that now if if it's a case where

306
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:45,158
uh in a previous marriage I won every battle and lost the

307
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:52,638
war because I didn't I'd always give in in the end this was not healthy and the

308
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:59,440
marriage ended so you have to know you have to also be

309
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,560
able to discern when to say "Okay I can't have

310
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:11,119
this conversation when I'm heated because we're going to say things that are unhealthy to one another but we have

311
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:16,560
to come back to this when I'm not emotionally overrought and can't say

312
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:22,119
things from a reasonable place." So you manage it based

313
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:29,599
on being mindful of whether you're emotionally stable or not so you

314
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:35,800
don't have to walk away from what you believe or what is important to you or or

315
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:42,839
um uh advocating for what's

316
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:50,079
right but acting out of anger is almost always negative

317
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:56,640
does that answer your question yeah yeah i will also say that in on the

318
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:03,680
final morning that I was in Bhutan I had a very long conversation with the hotel owner who was bemoning the fact that it

319
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:10,800
was very difficult to find trained personnel to work in his hotel they have a school where they train people and

320
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,560
people get trained and then they go off to Australia or Canada where they can

321
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:22,480
make more money and live a different life so they have a very hard time

322
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:29,400
retaining their young people so we were talking about that circumstance and he said some of the people

323
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:37,119
here believe so much in work life balance that they only want to work four-hour shifts and he says,"I need

324
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:42,800
people that are going to work eight hour shifts." And he'll say to them "I need

325
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,400
you to work an eight hour shift." And they'll say "Well I'll I'll just go live at my uncle's place for a while he'll

326
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,880
take care of me because he

327
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:59,680
will." So wise effort is also

328
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:10,160
required so the gross national happiness has

329
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:16,599
its overextension problem in Bhutan

330
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,519
yes behind you

331
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:43,000
um thank you for sharing your story i loved it like I'm I've done a lot of solo traveling

332
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,359
myself um and experienced the anticip anticipatory like fear and everything

333
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:55,599
that sounds like you had also i'm sorry am I having a little trouble hearing you oh oh sorry um I'm a fellow traveler

334
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,960
myself a solo traveler yeah uh-huh so I I relate to a lot of the things that you

335
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,800
said and I also have had five surgeries on my knee so okay i understand um

336
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:13,920
needing to ask for help to get up difficult hills and have people carry bags for me so yeah i wanted to ask um

337
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:19,320
two questions one um the woman that needed

338
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:27,200
to quiet her mind for 3 years mhm how does she know that the world is not

339
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,720
well if she's just up on a mountain meditating for seven years i don't Are

340
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:38,680
they reading the news there are they watching social media like

341
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:44,960
uh she's not unaware of the world she's not in silent meditation now she's at

342
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:52,480
she's at a nunnery so people are visiting her all the time the people who bring food they talk about the condition

343
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:59,599
of the world oh they they're they're not in silence

344
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:06,320
in these monasteries they they have to go to separate places where they they do

345
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:12,960
silent meditation i see so she's a she's aware that the

346
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,240
there are troubles in the world

347
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:24,440
um my other question is I wonder if the joy that you

348
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:32,320
experience is actually bigger than the joy that they

349
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:38,359
experience because yours is comparing to life in America

350
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:44,839
well you know my life my life in America is not terrible

351
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:52,079
um I think of kindness joy um

352
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:59,839
uh my my times of joy were not directly related to this person is

353
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:06,240
kind to me and now I'm feeling joy i just was experiencing

354
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:14,359
joy you know at at unrelated times I just noticed oh my goodness there's

355
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:20,000
this ecstatic joy that I'm experiencing at this moment and at one point one time

356
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:28,359
it was at a breakfast table one time it was coming out of a monastery you know just it was at various times

357
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:37,160
i I think that because I was traveling and out of my normal

358
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:42,720
circumstances and vulnerable that it was that it was more

359
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:49,440
accessible to me so in that sense traveling certainly impacted that freedom that I

360
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,599
was experiencing i think that's certainly true that makes sense i think that's one of

361
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:01,160
the joys of traveling if you allow yourself to

362
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:07,440
experience the raw experience without coloring it with the rest of your life

363
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,920
that's that's one of the great joys of life so I'm really really grateful that

364
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:22,480
I was able to take that trip yes

365
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:31,280
um you mentioned they want to come into the quote 21st century and that that was

366
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,960
a concern and an issue and building the city i'm wondering if anyone's thinking

367
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:44,240
about how much of this emphasis on kindness might be different if like what

368
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:50,079
coming into the 21st century means exactly and that I I see the possibility

369
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:56,480
that that kindness might um be shifted by that in ways so I just wonder if

370
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:03,920
anyone's thinking about that or Oh believe me they're thinking about that the because the the goal uh the

371
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,400
first afternoon we were there we met the CEO of uh

372
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:15,839
DHI which is Droldolding Industries which is the investment arm

373
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:21,359
of the Royal Family and they own the airline and they

374
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:28,319
they own the big companies of of Bhutan and they

375
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:37,520
outlined the strategy of of building this city in southern Bhutan which is uh G is uh the place

376
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:45,839
name of the city uh mindfulness city GMC and uh the idea is that it should be

377
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:52,079
something like uh Hong Kong or Singapore after 20 or 30 years and that it will be

378
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:59,599
independent of the rest of the country and then eventually they will merge the two i I see big problems with that but

379
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:05,680
what they want to do is protect their culture they really want to protect

380
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:11,680
their culture and they know that if they don't do anything they will be absorbed by

381
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:17,319
either India or China and they want to protect themselves from that as well so

382
00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:23,960
they're doing what they can the the king was educated at Harvard and he is

383
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:29,318
um he's trying to mastermind this

384
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:35,200
by absorbed you mean they might take over the like take over yeah yeah like

385
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:42,920
just Yeah right now they per perform a diplomatic barrier

386
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:50,119
and do diplomatic work bhutan forms a diplomatic buffer between the two very

387
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:57,240
often although there was a report in the economist last week that Bhutan had

388
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:04,079
a disagreement with China over some portion of land and India stepped in and

389
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:10,480
Bhutan was really pissed that India stepped in because they don't want to be seen as a vassel of India blah blah blah

390
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:16,640
blah so yeah they have real concerns okay thank

391
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:23,560
you all of this is not Buddhist in nature but it's related to how do you

392
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:29,119
make how do you maintain a way of life and an attitude

393
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:35,240
of life in a world that is very

394
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:44,440
different uh and it's a very real concern thank you

395
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:57,359
so thank you for your attention may you know smiles may you

396
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:05,160
know kindness may you know joy may you be happy
