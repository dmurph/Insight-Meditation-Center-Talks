1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:08,000
so once again good evening I'm Maria Strotman and I am here for

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,400
Diana who could not make it tonight And what I would like to talk to you

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,199
about is a spiritual life

4
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:28,400
Does talking about a spiritual life make you uncomfortable does it not really what you think of

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,840
when you're doing your practice does it make you feel like you're at

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,440
home oh yeah Great Now I'm going to know just what it is

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,960
I'm going to have all the answers So

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,719
let all of that evaporate because none of that's going to happen

9
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:58,320
So today the IMC newsletter came out and Gil had a really lovely essay essay in

10
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:06,240
there opening up that newsletter uh about his own spiritual journey which I highly recommend that you read If

11
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:14,400
you're not on the email list which is where I saw the newsletter you can find it on the website and just see what he

12
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,560
has to say about what it was like these last 50 years that he's pursued

13
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,240
meditation and and this way of life So

14
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,759
what I want to talk about because I've been contemplating my own spiritual journey its twists and turns

15
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:42,520
and its missteps and its blossoming and a kind of assessing

16
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:50,159
I remember setting out on my journey and saying you know I've ignored my spiritual life for some time

17
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,159
I think it was a therapist who asked me what my spiritual life was and I said hm

18
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,479
maybe I better go find out And this despite the fact when I was young I I had every intention of

19
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:10,000
becoming a nun I was going to be a nun I was quite determined and uh

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,080
uh I there are three primary uh vows poverty chastity and obedience And I had

21
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,959
a lot of trouble with the obedience one I just didn't want people telling me what to do

22
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,239
So I'm not going to tell you what to do because I'm really opposed to that

23
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,800
And also as I've reflected on this and the thing I want to emphasize tonight is

24
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,920
the efing trap the trap of of efforting in your spiritual path in your examining

25
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,680
of how am I in the world and what does it mean

26
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,720
the wanting to be something better than you are different than you are have

27
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:04,760
certain characteristics If I was just like this then my practice would be perfect and I would know just what to do

28
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:12,879
Because the one thing I am most clear about is that a spiritual path begins

29
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:20,080
right here right now with conditions just as they are

30
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,360
Right here right now just this

31
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,360
The only thing I have to work with is this imperfect being that I am

32
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,280
And this is my spiritual path not to become a better person although I

33
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:44,599
have aspirations like everyone else But what's become really clear to me

34
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,840
is to the effort that goes into trying to be something other than I am

35
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,040
is not the spiritual path

36
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:03,920
Over the weekend I attended a uh an art show

37
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,959
a ceramics art show at Palo Alto Art Center which is a very good show by the

38
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:15,040
way And one of the exhibits was 100

39
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:22,919
small cups like teacups that you might find in an oriental tea set

40
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:31,840
100 cups in two shadow boxes a pair of shadow boxes on the wall And uh each of

41
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,479
these cups was different It had a different glaze or a slightly different shape or you know some were round some

42
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:44,560
were very pyramat pyramid like pyramids

43
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:51,199
Some of them were had extra clay around them They were all different

44
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,240
100 of these And

45
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,800
in the what I want to read you is the uh the accompanying statement The artist's

46
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:11,280
name is Kina Yang And here's what she said As a hobbyist ceramicist these 100

47
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,440
cups made over the course of three weeks represent more work than I had ever made

48
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,800
up to this point I chose this quantity of cups within

49
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:30,560
this time frame to release myself from my own expectations of how perfect a

50
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,919
piece needs to be to share it with someone else

51
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:43,120
I chose this quantity of cups within this time frame 100 cups in three weeks

52
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,919
to release myself from my own expectations of how perfect a piece needs to be to share it with someone So

53
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:57,039
there are kind of two ideas in here that struck me as relevant One of them is um

54
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:04,880
that she was able to abandon her expectations of perfection

55
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:12,800
She was willing to just see what happened if she didn't have to have each one exactly right She could have chosen

56
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,520
to do just one piece and have it truly exquisite And I'm sure some some of the

57
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:26,400
pieces that she made as she was going along had to be discarded Maybe not

58
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,440
She was fairly skilled These were nice looking cups She

59
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,280
probably had some missteps Not all of them were perfect

60
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:44,639
The idea of what happens if I give up the need to be perfect

61
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:51,440
can I what kind of art do I present then and am I willing to present myself am I

62
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:57,280
willing to make myself vulnerable to doing this and that this idea of

63
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,440
presenting oneself is really relevant

64
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,759
This is the part where we say a spiritual path is about showing up and

65
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,960
you have to show up for yourself You have to I'm here

66
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,120
just warts and all here I am

67
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,639
meeting this moment meeting this day meeting this time

68
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:33,199
with these conditions As I was sitting here

69
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:39,199
I I felt my knee sitting here and I realized that this morning I had a

70
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,479
treatment of my knee and that the doctor had said to me "Now no big exercises I

71
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:53,039
don't want you bending that knee you know no bridges." And I'm thinking here I am sitting in this no bridges

72
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,319
I thought well this is the way it is because this is how it feels for me to

73
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:05,639
sit in meditation He would not approve

74
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,479
This is how it is Life is not something that we set up and

75
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,520
our spiritual path is not something that we set up only when conditions are

76
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,199
perfect This is it This is the whole thing Alan

77
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:31,199
Watts wrote a book called This Is It And I used to have it on my shelf And I I

78
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:38,000
would just look at the title of it and say "hm this is it This is it This life

79
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,120
right now this moment this is what we have to work with

80
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,120
This is a place of being in with just what arises

81
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:59,279
Whatever the clay decides to do in our hands at this moment I'm here for this

82
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:05,519
and I have to enter into this moment with whatever is here It's really about

83
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:13,760
entering into this moment It's not about achieving something or being somebody different or

84
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,519
attaining some magical state of perfection or

85
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:26,519
ecstatic joy Not that these things don't happen

86
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:33,920
but it is the very act of showing up with the intention of seeing what is

87
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:40,640
here How is it to actually experience

88
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:48,720
what you're experiencing you know when I first started meditating I think probably about week four

89
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:55,279
five something like that I remember driving down the freeway and thinking

90
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:02,160
about what I was doing I was mindful of driving I was mindful of my hands I was paying attention to all of this stuff

91
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,519
And I said you know I am inhabiting more moments of my life

92
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,200
than I ever have And what a realization that was for me

93
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,360
that mindfulness is not something you do instead of living

94
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,959
Mindfulness is totally inhabiting your life

95
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:30,959
being totally engaged with what's coming up Okay so if that's the case face it

96
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:36,720
it's not all going to be roses You may not even like roses especially

97
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:44,560
yellow ones Life is just as it is

98
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:51,839
And the trick is somehow to enter into the experience without constantly wishing it was otherwise

99
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,680
That constantly wishing it was otherwise is suffering

100
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,360
So last week I had uh I had a plan and I

101
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:10,399
wanted to get people together in a kind of a well it was family I wanted to get

102
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:16,640
I wanted to merge some family things And so that was my primary intention in in

103
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,480
getting things together But you know what it wasn't anybody else's primary intention

104
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,600
Their primary intention was to have a good time

105
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:36,079
And after a while I realized how tense I was becoming about

106
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:42,320
people wanting to go off on their own No no no no no We have to be here together

107
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:49,040
And I realized that that however wonderful the intention was it was

108
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:57,200
creating suffering for me and everybody else because I was so stuck on it

109
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,800
I was so stuck on what it would be like if we were all happy together

110
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,639
And so I had to walk away I walked away right before I said something really

111
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,760
hurtful to my sister So it's a good thing I walked away

112
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,560
and totally unnecessary

113
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,680
And as I walked away I could feel the energy ebbing

114
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:35,279
ebbing ebbing ebbing Okay letting go of having it a certain way allowed me to

115
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,279
just go back It was okay Then

116
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,399
the secret to a a rich spiritual life is not perfection

117
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,839
It's how you deal with imperfection

118
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,560
How you're willing to meet it How you're willing to enter into it

119
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,440
How you enter into the experience of life

120
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:14,320
The other day I was I I went to my husband and I said 'You know I'm I'm sorry I'm just feeling distressed And he

121
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,440
said "What can I do to make it better?" Sound doesn't that sound great it's very

122
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,480
generous And I said "Well maybe you just need to listen about why

123
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,839
I'm distressed." Now I didn't say that to him I just said

124
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:36,240
"Okay you're right I don't need to feel this way." And then after a while when I just

125
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,560
allowed myself to be distressed I didn't roll around in the floor on it

126
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:49,240
I just said "Okay distress is here but I'm going to do this thing with my husband."

127
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:57,440
I was able to I was able to just see okay I'm distressed Distress is here And

128
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:05,120
I cried a little and I watched the energy fall out of that

129
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:12,000
And then I noticed what a beautiful day it was and how nice the food was that we were

130
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,600
eating And I was still I still knew the distress It was still there The things

131
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,519
that were causing me distress were still true

132
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,800
But it didn't define me It didn't define the day

133
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,480
It's constantly changing

134
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,560
What I'm talking about is not so much saying anything that is distressful is

135
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:57,519
okay I'm really not saying we have to accept life as it is I'm simply saying

136
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:04,199
we have to see life as it is and say and now what

137
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,079
and now what it's not the effort that says I'm never going to get angry I'm

138
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:19,240
never going to be upset I'm never going to be too attached to my views I'm never No no no no That's a lot of extra stuff

139
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:26,399
The comparison comparing myself to this person or that person

140
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:34,680
is extra stuff Not needed not important

141
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:44,959
Not needed not important No expectations of the moment but a

142
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:52,120
curiosity about what's true here what's happening here

143
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:59,440
What this does is allow what is arising to to be there It's it's it's oh this is

144
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,480
what's happening Oh

145
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:11,680
now now when I see clearly I can see oh I don't want to be doing that That was

146
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,720
that I don't want to be doing that That just makes me unhappy

147
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:23,440
This is what happens as we practice It isn't so much that we be that we set

148
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,360
out to become better people But when we see oh this behavior is making me sad

149
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:36,160
and you sad and then we stop doing that And when we see ah this sitting in

150
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:41,959
silence and just breathing

151
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,360
is opening Oh

152
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,800
that's kind of nice I'm going to do more of that

153
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,839
I'm going to be more with that

154
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:06,558
One of the great problems that we have in our society is that we're all very

155
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:13,678
conditioned toward goals I'm going to do this I know how to do this I'm going to set my goals and I'm going to I'm going

156
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,520
to accomplish this and then I'm going to accomplish that and then I'm going to do this other thing and and the result of

157
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:25,038
all that is you know the payoff It's extremely difficult to step away

158
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:32,720
from that It's extremely difficult because we're

159
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,840
kind of we're kind of geared at that You know this is what I want to do so I'm going to do all this stuff to make it

160
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,840
happen

161
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:49,520
One of the consequences of that is that we we begin to harden ourselves with

162
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,679
resolve and we harden ourselves to an approach and we become rigid and

163
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:02,400
unyielding and the heart becomes rigid and unyielding

164
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:09,280
with ourselves with others and we can't get past that

165
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,600
But if we allow the vulnerability to slip in and say

166
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:22,080
well so what what happens if I allow my heart to soften a little bit

167
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,840
if we take the example of my my telling my husband that I was distressed

168
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,039
I could have said about his his technique by the way is you got to fix

169
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:40,799
that distress And my technique is okay it's here

170
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:47,520
Now there could be a clash there because he likes to fix things that are

171
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:56,559
wrong And so if I noticed that I am resistant to his efforts or resistant to

172
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:03,760
the distress or resistance to how I feel about something I'm beginning to

173
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:10,240
feel a kind of pushing away of the experience Now I'm not engaging in the experience I'm rejecting the experience

174
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:18,160
and I'm aversive to the experience When I see that I can say "Oh you're

175
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,840
trying so hard and I can feel the softening in my

176
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,840
heart." Now a soft heart can be seen as something

177
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,520
that is very uh diff uh risky

178
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:43,200
Can be seen as risky but it isn't

179
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,760
It isn't because what it does is open up for you the possibilities of seeing

180
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,880
things in a way that produces a different outcome So when I was walking

181
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,960
with my husband this afternoon I talked him into going for a walk because he was very stressed And so he said "Well okay

182
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:09,280
I'll go for a walk cuz I'll feel better afterward." And I said "How about just feeling better how about just going for a walk without expecting the walk to

183
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:17,520
make you feel better?" What happens then how about just changing and dropping the

184
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:25,840
attitude of I've got to do something responsible better but simply

185
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,360
abandoning that stress that efforting

186
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:38,960
and saying this is what needs to happen now What needs to happen now is I need to abandon

187
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:45,039
that just for now This is what we do when we meditate is

188
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:51,360
we sit and follow our breath and say just for now I'm not going to tell myself stories Just for now I'm going to

189
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,799
let go of that Just for now I'm just going to sit here

190
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:05,799
This is practicing the letting go of expectations and needing things to be a certain way

191
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:15,120
And what can arise in that moment if you're open to it is something else in

192
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:24,720
addition to whatever you brought into the moment that you can see something else

193
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,559
But when you're rigid oh it's like tunnel vision You can't you

194
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,880
can't see it It's not available to you

195
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:43,600
It's not the same thing as doing nothing and saying everything is okay That's a different kind of trap you know That's

196
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:50,880
that's a delusion trap It's got I'm going to pretend it's not there Doesn't work either You have to you know it's

197
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:58,400
here Whatever it is it's here We don't want to fix barriers against

198
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:05,919
the experience Go ahead and inhabit the experience

199
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:14,720
just inhabit it Okay this is this is what's happening How you respond to this moment is enough

200
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:24,520
It doesn't have to be better It's just here Here I am And I'm willing

201
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,720
to trust myself to present myself in this moment

202
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,520
and see what happens

203
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,360
we can just be good enough

204
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:54,240
We want to get away from the idea that life has to be

205
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:00,799
life is a life experience is a requirement and we want life experience to be an

206
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:08,440
unfolding just a an unfolding

207
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:16,880
I'm going to end my comments with a poem by uh

208
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:24,400
Jane Hersshfield In this poem there's a a reference to a place called Hyarpasa Station which I

209
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:32,720
think is in Istanbul It's a train station It's certainly in that part of the world So here it is The name of the

210
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:40,320
poem is 10 t i n I studied much and remembered little But

211
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:47,280
the world is generous It kept offering figs and cheeses Never mind that soon I'll have to give

212
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:55,120
it all back The world the figs To be a train station of existence

213
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,640
is no small matter It doesn't need to be Grand Central or

214
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:06,960
Haidapasa Station The engine shed could be low windowed with cold dust under a

215
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:13,840
slat shingled roof It could be tin Another mystery bandaged with rivets and

216
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:22,278
rubies leaking cold and heat in both directions as the earth does

217
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:32,240
I studied much and remembered little But the world is generous They kept offering figs and cheeses Never mind that soon

218
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:38,320
I'll have to give it all back The world the figs to be a train station of

219
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:44,799
existence is no small matter It doesn't need to be the Grand Central

220
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:50,240
or Hyasa station The engine shed could be low windowed with cold dust under a

221
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:56,240
slat singled roof It could be tin Another mystery bandaged with rivets and

222
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:04,519
rubies leaking cold and heat in both directions as the earth does

223
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:13,760
Our experiences allow us to be a train station of existence

224
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:20,640
which is no small matter Your existence in this world

225
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:28,640
just as it is is no small matter Treat it with joy and respect

226
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,919
and that's what you'll get back Thank you

227
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:46,799
So does anybody have any comments or suggestions as I straighten out my leg

228
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:52,679
difference dr Wall will be very happy

229
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:06,080
Does it make sense i I' I've really been struggling with how to

230
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:13,600
to uh explain the idea of of not having a a

231
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:20,799
predetermined approach to life That the spiritual p the spiritual path is really

232
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:28,159
an unfolding and not a direction or a a series of steps that you take that that

233
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:35,440
guarantee that you get somewhere else that that really the freedom

234
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:42,759
that we seek the freedom from suffering can only arise

235
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:49,559
by just being in this experience this one

236
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:57,960
as you are whatever you are experiencing

237
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:05,039
and not needing it to be anything else You know I would just assume my knee

238
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:13,880
didn't hurt but it's just a knee It's just a painful knee

239
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,760
It's not more than that It doesn't have meaning It doesn't have weight

240
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:31,000
And I can act on it or not act on it

241
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:45,760
the engaging with life just just this experience and seeing it

242
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:53,720
just as it is not how I would like it to be or how I thought it would be

243
00:27:54,399 --> 00:28:02,320
This is the route to freedom The freedom that says I don't have to be

244
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:09,039
other than I am The world doesn't have to be other than it is for me to

245
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,960
experience ease in the moment

246
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:23,200
It's not the ease of everything's okay It's the ease of ah I'm here

247
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:30,039
with this Does that make any sense definitely

248
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:44,440
Whether it's distressful or happy be there

249
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,520
Be there

250
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,279
And if something is painful you can move I was going to say something Um

251
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:05,200
Thank you for your talk Yeah it's time for me to shut up Wh when you were um

252
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:12,399
talking about the spiritual life I remember I can't remember if I read it or I heard um Sharon Saltzburg talking

253
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:20,320
about how to when she was um a beginner in in meditation

254
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,840
She said she would do walking meditation and but she was never noting anything

255
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:32,880
because she said "I'm just waiting for something spiritual to happen." Yeah Right like well you know okay I'm

256
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:40,080
meditating and I'm walking but now when is something spiritual going to happen and I I think about that sometimes when

257
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,600
I'm uh I don't know just

258
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:51,440
maybe having sort of a blah meditation or walking you know it's just

259
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:58,080
like no nothing's happening you know and then it's like huh

260
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,200
what what's that about right Great That's great That's great Thank you You

261
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:09,200
know I I remember being in meditation one time and and thinking I was about to fall asleep

262
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:14,559
and I had been meditating for a couple of weeks so I was very concentrated and

263
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:19,919
still And here I was I was just about to fall asleep And I thought well maybe I

264
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:26,559
need to sleep Or maybe I just need to know what it's like to be falling asleep Or how what is it like to be falling

265
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:32,399
asleep and I felt myself walking on this edge you know like if I fell off a cliff

266
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:37,600
I could just fall off this cliff into sleep But I'm right on this edge There

267
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:43,520
was just enough alertness to notice being on the edge of falling asleep And

268
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:50,799
how exciting that was how really thrilling it was to be on

269
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:55,919
that edge which is you know I was just falling asleep

270
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:01,440
And and I I think that's that's the same idea that that a spiritual life is not

271
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:08,240
about something else It's not about something else It's it's really

272
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:14,399
um Yeah that's that's the best I can do

273
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:24,960
Yes Well here I empathize I empathize so much with you

274
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:32,880
about the knees Okay Because I've been able to sit on a Zafu most of my career

275
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,720
sitting and this is a beginner question Um

276
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:44,399
when your knees are hurting so much then what story do you tell yourself you tell

277
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:54,320
yourself well I'm doing this practice this looking at this pain and and um

278
00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:03,200
where's that going or I have to give myself a reason for doing it or something bigger than myself or I

279
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:09,360
because it sometimes it's so extreme It's so hard to just stay with the pain

280
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,720
and just try to you know deal with it You know even especially on a long

281
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,320
retreat when you're doing it day after day after day on a long retreat I don't

282
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:28,000
spend all retreat with sitting cross-legged on the floor I spend a lot of time in a chair Even though there's

283
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,120
there's a certain energy that comes from this the triangulation and sitting this

284
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:39,519
way on the floor that feels feels right for meditating

285
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:46,480
I I can't do that because I'm too distracted by pain That's right That's what So there's no point There's no

286
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:53,919
point to that The object is not to meditate a certain way It's to

287
00:32:53,919 --> 00:33:01,039
be still and see what arises That doesn't require me to sit a certain

288
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:06,240
way Even if I'm more comfortable if I think I'm more comfortable that way

289
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,240
because if if the if all I'm doing is focusing on pain

290
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:19,600
I'm just focusing on pain It's just one big struggle So sometimes it seems like

291
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:26,000
just remembering to be present in your daily life for five

292
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,279
minutes or 10 minutes or some small

293
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:37,840
something through the day than it does to sit through all that

294
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:44,080
Well I don't want to I don't want to quantitate it right but it's very important to notice during the day where

295
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:54,600
am I how am I what's happening here what's my attitude what's the energy level It's a primary part of my practice

296
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:02,159
Thank you very much Once you become addicted to mindfulness it's pretty hard to get away from it

297
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:09,760
Some people can do that I've spent 50 years trying to do that

298
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:18,720
I'm sure you're I'm sure you are more mindful than you give yourself credit for possibly sometimes

299
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:25,280
But we're not we're not measuring You see it it isn't about measuring Just celebrate every moment that you notice

300
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:31,520
you're standing on the ground Celebrating being here tonight All right

301
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:37,839
There we go I'm very happy I'll celebrate with you

302
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:44,079
Anybody else um I I love that the phrase train

303
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:49,839
station of existence That's perfect And I think I have Grand Central

304
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:55,760
because it's exactly like that And what a me when I'm mindful is how much actually is going on in there at one

305
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:02,640
time The sensations the impulses the worries the fears the tensions um plans

306
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:09,040
all these things all like at one time This cacophony If I'm understand you correctly that's

307
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:14,400
fine Yes Okay

308
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:20,880
Sometimes Sometimes it's busy Yeah Yeah Okay Sometimes it's busy Yeah Or or a

309
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:28,079
lot of the time but you know No you uh to to be fair it's busier sometimes more than others Yeah Um but it it can very

310
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:35,839
much be that way It's like you can watch it go by like a parade Yeah Yeah And and what's what's uh what

311
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:41,440
might be useful is when when you notice all of that cacophony

312
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,720
and how do I feel about that and what am I what how am I responding

313
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:53,839
to that and what's the energy like is it does that caca

314
00:35:53,839 --> 00:36:02,240
cause jitteriness or excitement or aversion just notice what whatever is

315
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:09,200
happening just that's what's happening Yeah Well it's kind of like that I think the mindfulness helps because it used to

316
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:15,359
be if I wasn't aware of it I'd just be distracted or all over right and it's like okay there's all this stuff floating on there What do you need to

317
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:22,079
focus on now yeah You know yeah Um Oh see that's a that So I spent some time

318
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:28,560
today thinking about priorities that we're always trying to set priorities right and this has a higher value than

319
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:34,720
that So that has a higher priority And that that whole valuing our experiences

320
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:40,640
can really get in the way that this is more valuable experience

321
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,160
than that you know Yeah Well I meant like eating I mean you have to eat right

322
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:52,240
something like that But no no I I I totally get what you mean Uh you can get yourself more worked up for sure Um

323
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:58,000
making kind of priority list and thinking I got to do this first or that So but um I I don't have that too much

324
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,040
but I do have the train station existence I'm never going to forget that That's perfect That's a great It's a

325
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:09,320
great phrase I love that Jane Hersshfield said that Yeah

326
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:17,920
Excuse me The problem arises of the desire to just have a moment

327
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:24,720
of nothing emptiness or quiet or something

328
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,240
And you just can't you can't you can't arrange that It just happens No you

329
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:36,960
can't But the desire is always there So it's hard So so you notice the desire

330
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:43,359
Notice that and and just remind yourself what you're doing is wishing things were other than they are That's right And

331
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:49,599
then and then of course you say "Oh no I'm not going to do that." Right Right And then you can feel your heart

332
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:55,280
softening Say "Oh." And in that moment you can

333
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:01,880
feel the ease too And it is that very moment

334
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:08,400
Ah thank you Don't miss it

335
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:14,320
