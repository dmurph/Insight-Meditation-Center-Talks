1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:08,920
so uh so welcome folks nice to uh see the names streaming on the side

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,679
there um so one one announcement we I'll be

3
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:20,960
away and Retreat next week so we won't won't have class uh reather

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,960
22nd and um yeah I think there's enough Terra

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:37,120
flops or whatever it is of Dharma out there so uh we can make it a week and um yeah I was going to call the

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,039
class certain Wednesdays kind of like that it's a little too cute or something

7
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:48,559
but uh given that I'm very uncertain and that we'd be meeting on

8
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:57,640
certain Wednesdays but um it's just Wednesdays with Matthew that's what we ran with over at the uh shop and uh so

9
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:03,198
here we are and ready to uh to practice

10
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:12,600
together so um let's uh let's settle in

11
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:50,600
so part of why our breathing is

12
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:57,039
emphasized is that our breath doesn't depend on whatever we call me doesn't

13
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:00,759
depend on that

14
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,759
whatever feels like the headquarters of I

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,879
amness the locus of our willfulness the place where we must strive

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,120
from the house of uh our energetic

17
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:35,360
Vigor are glory and our shame all of

18
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:42,920
that the breathing doesn't depend on any of

19
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,840
it and so just to to

20
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,800
breathe e

21
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:37,480
and it can feel like well yeah the breath does itself but my

22
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:46,400
jobs to attend to it my jobs to point my attention at

23
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:54,920
it to not get distracted to be a good Yogi

24
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,079
but in the end the awareness doesn't depend on you

25
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,439
either you can't start it or stop it

26
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:45,120
so the eess breath being

27
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:51,280
received in the egoless awareness

28
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,800
emptiness knowing

29
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,639
emptiness

30
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639
e

31
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
e

32
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
e

33
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
e

34
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
e

35
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
e

36
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
e

37
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
e

38
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,360
e e

39
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:03,560
trunk fore said we're stepping out of the bureaucracy of

40
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:23,200
ego the micromanagement of self

41
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:04,639
and we set aside a kind of special C category for self-rated

42
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,360
phenomena but

43
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:24,279
uh it's all made of the same stuff rising and

44
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,360
passing the openness of awareness the

45
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,600
effortlessness of

46
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
breathing

47
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

48
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

49
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

50
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

51
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

52
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

53
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

54
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,880
e e

55
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:39,799
when we're especially moving our body keeps its uh balance

56
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:43,559
with sense of

57
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,600
proprioception the ego almost has its

58
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:05,080
own system of apprpriate reception egoic proprioception keeping

59
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,840
tabs on

60
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:19,559
self keeping tabs on the egoic

61
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,960
balance so we just keep reiterating the sense of self keep

62
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:39,000
humming kind of song

63
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:45,240
myself image of our body arises and

64
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:55,039
Rises the thinking and subtle thinking

65
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:00,720
that create a sense of place within experience

66
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:22,320
when this flies beneath the radar of

67
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,240
awareness the existence of me it's

68
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:59,240
unquestioned but as we become sensitive to more and more of

69
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,520
these

70
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:14,279
phenomena the self no longer feels like a home

71
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:29,400
refuge and modes of awareness that taste less and less like me

72
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,640
come

73
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
online

74
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

75
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

76
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

77
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

78
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

79
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

80
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

81
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

82
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

83
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

84
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

85
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

86
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

87
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
e

88
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,080
e e

89
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:24,320
okay so uh that's good to good to say with

90
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,640
you um

91
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:38,720
so Dara practice is well maybe we

92
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,919
say it's about coming home and leaving

93
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:49,480
home it's about uh loving what we have

94
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:55,799
always loved and also learning to to love new

95
00:30:55,799 --> 00:31:01,840
things uh the practice is a kind of um

96
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:07,440
sort of dialectic between incredible

97
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:17,360
coziness and uh venturing out into the world in order to be

98
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:23,120
startled so we come home to what we've

99
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:29,600
um what we've sort of long known long loved we come come home to what is

100
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:37,440
familiar maybe we've been uh neglecting what we know or what we

101
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,880
love but the Dharma when our heart is ripe and we

102
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:49,480
hear it it reawakens something and it has the flavor of of recollection Plato

103
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:58,760
said all knowledge is recollection it has that that feeling of like very familiar kind of

104
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:06,279
a home and uh even though I had a fortunate

105
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:13,919
childhood maybe maybe because I had that uh I was I was on to the first

106
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:19,399
Noble Truth you know early and

107
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:25,480
um and so when I actually heard it when I heard it spoken those words spoken my

108
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:32,559
heart just kind of lit up you know sense of recognition uh

109
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:40,799
recollection and as a teacher I I often have the sense that um I'm pointing to

110
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:46,519
some love in you that perhaps you've forgotten something that's dormant

111
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:53,960
something where I don't know it's like um I'm connecting some dots

112
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:59,760
or Reawakening something you you once had an intuitive sense

113
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:06,200
of and it feels like a kind of homecoming a lot of the Dharma feels

114
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:17,039
like the heart remembering itself returning to some ancestral ground Su say kind

115
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:27,320
of uh the kind of yeah I've always loved this

116
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:35,039
and that sense of homecoming of um of Refuge is so important because

117
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:42,159
we're also doing something new and so the path is is both about

118
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:47,200
loving what we've always loved and it's about learning to love new

119
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:55,600
things learning to love uh peace more than

120
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,440
pleasure space more more than stuff awareness more than

121
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:08,760
unconsciousness some of us have to learn dependency others have to learn

122
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:14,800
Independence but the Dharma kind of curriculum is perfectly tailored to the

123
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,480
way you suffer and it requires you to do

124
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:28,679
something new and today I read a um a story about

125
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:35,118
one of Freud's kind of most famous disciples um Alfred

126
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:43,200
Adler and uh at at at the first meeting Adler would often you know ask the

127
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,839
patient like what would you do if you were cured you know having the

128
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:54,000
assessment the kind of first consultation okay what would you do if you were

129
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,359
cured and the patient would answer and then he says

130
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:04,920
okay now go do that right that's kind

131
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:14,920
of uh compelling right compelling story but um the patient usually can't

132
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:23,160
do that it's more complex than just a decision and so when someone says you

133
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:29,640
know I want to practice more I want to meditate each day but

134
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:37,800
can't what they're really asking is like how do I love something

135
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:43,280
new and when someone asks how do I stop

136
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:49,839
um stop hating myself they're asking how do I love something new when we make New

137
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:55,640
Year's resolutions we're trying to Value

138
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:59,119
something new

139
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:08,200
uh but how does that happen you know if you've have you you know ever tried to

140
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:14,200
force yourself to fall in love

141
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:22,400
right I can't make you fall in love the path neither can you it's not a

142
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,560
kind of decision that you make what we value what we come to love

143
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:36,640
maybe we could say it grows through small gestures and we take small actions that

144
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,800
maybe seem insignificant small actions many times

145
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:47,160
small moments many times and maybe through that our uh our

146
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:52,760
love grows this is um

147
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:58,640
Agnes callard the philosopher she says

148
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:05,359
um uh we can all think back to a time when we were substantially different

149
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:11,839
people value Wise from the people we are now we care

150
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:17,480
about things we once did not care about how did this change come

151
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:24,079
about the transition from indifference to love cannot typically be affected by

152
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:30,040
way of doing any one thing no matter the strength of my will it

153
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:37,680
does not seem that I can muscle myself into suddenly carrying to be sure the path to valuing

154
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,160
something valuing something sometimes includes momentary expressions of

155
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:49,480
commitment the moment when you say I do sign the adoption papers or buy the

156
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:56,040
oneway plane ticket to a foreign country but these moments are themselves

157
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:03,000
only part of the story punctuating a longer process coming to Value something tends

158
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,440
to represent a deep change in how one sees and feels and thinks acquiring a

159
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:15,760
new value often Alters the structure of one's priorities by demoting or even dep

160
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:22,160
displacing something one valued before such changes take time over the

161
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:29,160
course of which one has done many things in service of value

162
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:36,079
appreciation the latter actions are shaped by the small changes that the earlier ones have engendered in such a

163
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:42,800
way as to allow someone to slowly develop new priorities concerns and

164
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:49,160
attachments the process as a whole is not structured by a single moment of

165
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:53,920
intention or decision at its

166
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:04,560
Inception um how do we come to love new

167
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:11,440
things we we make these small

168
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,680
gestures as we learn to love new things we sit

169
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:24,880
quietly or maybe we go to a group and practice with a SAA or we reflect

170
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:32,400
on goodness or we have just a a moment a conscious moment of

171
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:41,680
suffering we're awake to it and we plant seeds you know we want

172
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:50,079
to do so much more but but in coming to love new things we just plant seeds and

173
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:55,280
it doesn't seem like a big deal at all

174
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:01,640
but what does the Acorn know of the

175
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,760
Oak and so we in coming to love things

176
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:15,000
that are new we tolerate the the

177
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,040
disorientation you know we tolerate sense of not knowing we

178
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:25,480
tolerate the loss of one's old home this venturing out into the world to be

179
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,319
startled by newness

180
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:37,000
and in this way we begin to to live into

181
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:43,000
a Dharma life we begin to live into a Dharma life not something that happens

182
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:50,480
at once not something we chose at one moment and then just begin to

183
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:56,079
fulfill and then maybe at some point uh

184
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:02,880
there's a kind of moment and we look around we look

185
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:09,119
around and somehow we don't know even exactly when

186
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:17,920
but I've come to to uh to love this this is a new home

187
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:24,240
a new home somehow we don't know we it's very hard to track how the Dharma has

188
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:29,520
transfigured our life but it has at some point we wake up

189
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:37,280
to this and of course we we uh we keep

190
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,480
going we keep going we've

191
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:51,720
uh we're never done in coming to love new things we appreciate our home we venture

192
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:59,240
out so we uh rejoice in our home in order to uh to leave it

193
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:07,240
so uh offer this for your

194
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:13,800
consideration and uh yeah I wish you all a good couple
