so uh I'm your very own Tanya Wiser and you know some of you I

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:15,320
definitely know and know me and some of you I don't so maybe I'll say a few words about myself

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,400
um I'm I am graduating next week from

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,160
the IMC IRC 4-year Dharma Teacher Training Program

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:35,079
yeah yeah woo it has been quite a journey and

6
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:42,160
um so I'm a student of Gil and Andreas really IMC baby this has been my place

7
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,079
of practice um since I don't know

8
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:55,840
the I don't know around 2008 or nine or something like that

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:03,039
and uh I'm a therapist and I say that because it tends to uh it tends to

10
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,080
permeate the flavor of my dharma i tend to bring up things that I have learned

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,760
as a therapist so just just to you know give you all a heads up

12
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,080
and I teach here on Thursday nights um if you're interested in connecting with

13
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:27,040
SA um the way I teach includes small practice groups people talking about the

14
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,320
the topic and connecting with each other and sharing practice and it's a lovely

15
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,600
way to build and create a sense of connection to the SA here i also teach

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,560
the queer SA here which is happens once a month online

17
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,880
so all right so my talk will be on uh my

18
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,079
fa my current teaching topic for Thursday nights which has to do with not

19
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:01,520
knowing not knowing and tonight or to this morning I'll weave in how not

20
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,719
knowing supports curiosity investigation and ultimately the freeing

21
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:13,170
of our hearts so I uh I have

22
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,760
[Music] um I have long found that

23
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:26,280
uh you know I've long been a student of duca studying duca suffering contraction

24
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,160
clinging the ways that um you know I suffer in my life I see

25
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,959
other people suffer I guess it makes sense I'm a therapist is kind of what I'm tuning

26
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:44,000
into and over time the more I've studied it the more I've recognized that um the

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,080
antidote or the opposite is love the sense of presence i don't mean love in a

28
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,120
romantic way i mean love in being available present

29
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:02,319
receptive letting the heart soften so this inspires me a lot i find

30
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,599
a lot of joy when I um connect even with

31
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:15,920
real difficult things and I can do so in a way that feels loving feels caring feels

32
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,040
like my heart isn't um trying to protect or control a

33
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:30,720
situation so I see um I I've been having a lot

34
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,440
actually delightful time practicing with this idea of not knowing a practice of not

35
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,879
knowing even during the sit this morning you know I would watch the

36
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:49,239
mind I have friends who came from the East Bay today and I was like is that them is that them don't

37
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:56,280
know you know just sort of letting you know watching how the mind starts

38
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:03,120
to want to build and collect information and and find out an answer and somehow

39
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,680
just dropping in this don't know sort of allows things to soften and

40
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,799
I I just find that there's just it's almost like this big

41
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:21,840
open bright light you know this sense of softening opening oh then what what what

42
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,280
is here it allows me to re-engage in the

43
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:34,000
moment i also think it's actually quite respectful to not

44
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,759
know you know it's respectful for me because truly every moment is different

45
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:46,320
every person is different we're all changing all all the time things are changing and kind of holding this idea

46
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:53,400
of not knowing kind of allows yourself to open up and see and be

47
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,639
surprised um be willing to meet and see people or things

48
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:05,680
differently it also helps me keep my mind fresh here now you know sort of

49
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,840
just on this cusp of you know what's happening now

50
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,600
i don't know if it happens for you but if I think I like if I'm going into

51
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,960
a meeting or I'm going into a situation I think I know what's going to happen

52
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:33,199
there's a maybe a bit of a wall or a bit of a um l you know sort of a lack of

53
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,919
openness that I experience a defensiveness or an

54
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:45,280
offensiveness you know and um and that definitely doesn't support

55
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,960
the heart in in softening or in my receiving what is in

56
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,880
front of me so it's respectful to others respectful to my

57
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,080
heart and it helps me stay

58
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,560
interested it's also incredibly important if we want to be curious if we

59
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:17,319
want to do one of the things the Buddhist said was incredibly important which is to investigate our experience

60
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:24,840
it's incred it's essential for us to be curious to be

61
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:32,840
investigative but maybe not in the the way that we might classically think of it as an analyzing

62
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:42,440
conceptualizing but more in a direct investigatory experiential kind of way

63
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,479
so you know for all of this mindfulness obviously is the foundation of our

64
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,759
practice we need to be mindful and present and

65
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:05,478
aware and mindfulness is critical if we want to live a life of nonharming

66
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,280
but if we're just mindful and we aren't engaging in the

67
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,479
other teachings of the Buddha it's not

68
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:26,880
enough it's not enough to just know to just be

69
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:33,840
aware we can be mindful and do all any kind of

70
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,440
thing when we're mindful in the way the Buddha taught we're actually attuning to

71
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:46,599
harm and lack of harm or homeless um wholesomeness and unh wholesomeness

72
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:52,039
suffering non-suffering wisdom

73
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:02,638
we need to understand and want to understand what's going on but not not

74
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:10,879
intellectually not conceptually more directly more understanding and seeing the processes

75
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,000
that are happening to seeing things like you know

76
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,160
the energies of greed hatred and delusion and how they operate to see how

77
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,720
things change in permanence and to recognize when we've got a strong

78
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,120
sense of a constructed self happening you know or a strong sense of other

79
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,159
constructed other happening that has to do like with thinking you know somebody

80
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,719
you've constructed this person how they

81
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:54,360
are so you know it's important to think about why are you practicing

82
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,519
Well you know I came actually I came to the practice because I was suffering a

83
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:06,440
lot and I wanted to stop suffering i didn't want to suffer so

84
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:13,040
much and so you know for a long time early in my practice it was just about

85
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,080
you know trying to suffer less in each moment and so my meditation for the you

86
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:25,040
know kind of a solid first year of great difficulty it might be that I spent five

87
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:35,000
minutes and all I did was say breathing in I calm the body breathing out I calm the mind you just trying to help

88
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,640
myself calm down and that's actually incredibly important because we need a

89
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,160
calm mind we need a relaxed body We need to

90
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:53,000
be more open and spacious for us to actually investigate in any meaningful

91
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,959
way so however long it takes us to do that in our sit or in our

92
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:06,920
lives that's beautiful and then there's more as things start to calm

93
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:13,120
down we can start to look at different things experience the dharma in a

94
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,160
different way

95
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:31,959
so I'm going to talk about um the Kalama Suta um it's a suta about how do we

96
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:37,440
discern what's true what's truth

97
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:44,920
the Kamas um were a group who uh who lived in a village that was maybe in a

98
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:51,920
throughway or you know through um a place a lot of people traveled and stopped at and including a lot of

99
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,320
different kinds of spiritual teachers so they

100
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:04,839
had an abundance of teachings but from all different

101
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:11,480
perspectives and so they started to maybe be a little bit

102
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:18,240
overwhelmed with all the ideas all the practices all the directions that they

103
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:26,880
were getting from all these different visiting teachers and so they had the Buddha come

104
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,720
and talk and their question was "How do we know what is true how do we know who

105
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:43,000
is right well to parallel to what maybe they were

106
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:51,920
experiencing you know if we step back and look our culture is feeding us all kinds of ideas and beliefs all the

107
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:59,920
time and these ideas and beliefs start to fill us up and when we start to believe them and

108
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,920
collect them we start to close ourselves off

109
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:12,040
and our culture encourages us to come to conclusions to have answers to know to

110
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:19,040
think you know and so we start collecting what we think of as

111
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:26,800
facts which are really just stories and we bundle them together with

112
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:35,440
some magic thread to create what we think is our truth the truth about this thing or that

113
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,839
thing or another thing this person or you know and some of us have a lot of

114
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,519
experience in certain realms of our life so we've seen hundreds of times that

115
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:54,600
maybe this leads to that leads to that so this is the conclusion or at least the mind tells us

116
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:00,320
so and so there's wisdom and that you know collecting information and ideas

117
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:06,480
and theories and and our experience but the way the mind weaves

118
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:13,240
things together it's kind of invisible to us and you

119
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:21,720
know really really there's often just just as you are each so

120
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:27,880
uniquely different from each other each situation ation each person

121
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:33,399
each moment of healing or each moment of suffering has its own

122
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:39,000
uniqueness and we don't know really how things are going to wind up we don't

123
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,200
know we do know it will change something will change

124
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,600
this morning in my inbox I got a beautiful poem super short it was super

125
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,920
perfect for me for this morning's talk by Rosemary Watah

126
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:02,760
Tramer and it's called One Clearing she

127
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:12,519
says "Every day I dismantle its nest the fear that wings darkly into my

128
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:19,600
thoughts." What every day read i'm rereading it every day I dismantle its

129
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,920
nest the fear that wings starkly into my thoughts

130
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:32,600
i really love that image of the nest and how we you know and that she's

131
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:38,040
dismantling these fears these thoughts these stories these

132
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:45,040
beliefs that are collecting creating sort of some sort of

133
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:51,279
a foundational place that we could sit in and rest on and look out from but in

134
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:58,480
the case of fear that's probably not so skillful not so helpful so I love that I think

135
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,839
about oh yeah yesterday I had this con you know idea about theory about what

136
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:10,079
this is doing and what that's doing and what's going to happen no let me just pull it all apart you know and let these

137
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:15,279
things sit individually and just sort of loosen it

138
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:21,680
all up again and we build these nests under the

139
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:28,360
illusion that we actually know and see what's going on we actually think we really

140
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:36,519
know but they're really stories we're weaving and so much of it is drawn upon

141
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:43,040
historical associative or you know sort of some way

142
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:50,959
or another fabricated information maybe misperception is the norm what if

143
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:58,560
we all understood misperception was the norm you know our perceptions our habits our

144
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:05,920
views our beliefs our histories all of this stuff you know they they all tend to reinforce

145
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:12,480
themselves and we tend to agree with our own

146
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:22,040
views and now you know there are lots of wars going on over

147
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,720
views lots of wars going on over views

148
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:38,320
there's this um Indian lay teacher um who's deceased now but in

149
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,440
um her name is Deepa Ma or

150
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:51,600
was she has this quote that I love the mind is all stories one after

151
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,920
another like nesting dolls you open one and another is inside

152
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:03,920
open that one and there's another story emerging when you get to the last

153
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:11,839
nesting doll the smallest one and open it inside of it is what it's empty

154
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:18,600
nothing's there and all around you are the empty shells of the stories of your

155
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,918
life isn't that great

156
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:33,360
she was a terra meditation master she really um had kids and

157
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,360
um I had a child die and her husband die and you know she lived in very poor

158
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:46,280
circumstances and she practiced she went off to do intensive retreat but most of her practice was in daily

159
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:54,039
life and in very difficult circumstances and so you know she she

160
00:17:54,039 --> 00:18:01,039
she said mindfulness applied in every activity

161
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:07,760
speaking shopping ironing cooking caring for children she said the whole path of

162
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,440
mindfulness is this whatever you are doing be aware of it and she was called

163
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,720
the patron saint of householders

164
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,600
so to open ourselves up right to open these nesting dolls to dismantle our

165
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:34,960
nests it's really helpful to to not know and to be curious and to

166
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:42,640
investigate and it's not that we can exile ourselves from all of these ideas

167
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:49,520
and stories and beliefs there oh I wish I could I wish I could say I'm not going

168
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:55,720
to ingest this i wish I wish I could say that I could tell the mind not to remember

169
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:03,039
something it it doesn't work like that you know things just come in we get told all kinds of stories we watch movies we

170
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:09,120
watch TV shows you know we're conditioned by our parents and our teachers and all these things and so we

171
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:18,559
just we are we just need to know we're this big bundle of things that's ready to get all turned into nesting

172
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:26,960
dolls so we can't exile ourselves from this you know we just need to know

173
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,720
what's going on and be be curious and when we start to see the

174
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:39,000
mind gathering up all the data as much as possible don't

175
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,679
know don't know there's a neurologist um

176
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:51,440
neuroscientist who um I think her name was Lisa Barrett but I'm not sure if

177
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,200
that's correct but I read an article by her and she described you know the brain

178
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:03,280
is an organ right like any other organ in our body and she said it's our

179
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:10,320
prediction organ you know it's always predicting

180
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:16,880
it's taking all this stuff we have both willingly and and choicefully

181
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:23,200
inputed as well as unwilling have you know been inputed into us and it draws

182
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:31,720
on all of it and from that it makes kind of assumptions it predicts it's a great

183
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:38,840
thing until it's not so don't just believe your

184
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:47,520
thoughts test them investigate them and um so I'm this is bringing me

185
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:54,559
back to the Kalama Suta and what what the Buddha taught one of the beautiful things that the

186
00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:01,039
Buddha taught in this suta in my view is you know these these practitioners are

187
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:06,679
asking how do we know what is true how do we know what is true

188
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:12,120
truth and the Buddha doesn't say go write a

189
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:18,480
thesis he doesn't say you know think and analyze and cognize and imagine and

190
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,919
evaluate and judge instead the Buddha teaches us how

191
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:33,360
to look directly at our experience and to use the measure of

192
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:40,919
suffering or the absence of suffering to help us determine that which is leading

193
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:47,960
toward what we or what he would call true dharma

194
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,400
in order to notice and be aware of whether something is causing you know

195
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,960
more suffering for us or others we have to be

196
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:11,400
embodied it's not something that you intellectually evaluate it's something that you recognize you experience you

197
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:17,039
sense you have to notice how you're being impacted you have to notice the quality

198
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:24,480
of your heart you have to notice if your mind is contracting and oh is there aversion in

199
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,679
my mind is there's this thread of not liking not wanting anger

200
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:38,000
hatred anxiety and fear are part of aversion fear because it's something we

201
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:47,600
don't want we're afraid of and you know with greed it's all

202
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:53,919
about trying to get or hold on to or control right it's all about wanting and

203
00:22:53,919 --> 00:23:00,400
I was thinking about that this morning just from my lens of oh can I love or not because a lot of people are like

204
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,440
well but I'm attached i love I want this person i want this thing you know

205
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:14,000
but when I think about it if I'm really caught up in

206
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:20,480
wanting what does that feel like for me it's like ah you know I'm I'm really

207
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:28,840
focused on what I want to take in bring in you know keep and when I'm relating that

208
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:35,039
way I might know I love i might know I care but is the

209
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:41,480
heart really soft enough to open is this heart really

210
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:47,559
receptive i think it gets compromised

211
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:53,120
contracted in the effort and with delusion we're just all caught up in

212
00:23:53,120 --> 00:24:00,720
like stories so if we're not really connected what's really going on we aren't really caring

213
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:07,280
and loving what's here you know we can't we're not really seeing what's

214
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:12,320
here all right back to the

215
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:21,840
Kamas so the Kamas were really confused they were really like you know

216
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,279
complaining and saying "This one says this and this one says that and how are we supposed to know and blah blah blah

217
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:34,799
blah blah." And the Buddha said something beautiful in the beginning maybe it has to do with a little bit

218
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,880
with not knowing and the Buddhist said you

219
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:47,200
know of course you are uncertain Kamas ah isn't that nice they're trying

220
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:53,279
to know and he's saying "Of course you're uncertain of course you don't know of

221
00:24:53,279 --> 00:25:00,000
course you're in doubt there's reason when there's reason for doubt uncertainty is born." And so

222
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,799
this is the case ah I relaxed just imagining that

223
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:13,960
right of course and then the Buddha went on to say "Don't go by

224
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:23,080
reports legends tradition scripture logic conjecture inference

225
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:29,360
analogies agreement with your views probability or the thought this

226
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:37,600
contemplative is my teacher so the Buddha is even saying whoever their teacher is including him don't go by

227
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:43,760
just what I say and this is one of the things that I think that made Buddhism so accessible

228
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:49,919
to me was that I wasn't expected or required to just believe what I was

229
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,960
being taught that was really really important

230
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,559
for me to be able to really enter enter deeply into this

231
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,919
practice incredibly important for me

232
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:17,000
so you know we need to evaluate for

233
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,880
ourselves you know well let me come to the next thing

234
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:30,559
he says and I'll go back to that and then so he's laying the ground of course you don't know you don't know right it's

235
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:37,279
impossible to know with all these different things conflicting right and it's of course you you're doubting

236
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:45,440
and and uncomfortable and then he says don't just go by what's said or has been done

237
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:52,480
no matter who said it you know no matter how much evidence you have no ma no matter how predictable it seems and then

238
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,360
he says this when you yourself

239
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:04,760
know when you yourself know these things are bad these things are

240
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:10,080
blameable unskillful and unh wholesome so we're using we have old language here

241
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:17,520
but when you know this is not good this is not healthy

242
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:23,520
and he says 'Then these things are censored and and that they're censored by the wise undertaken and observed

243
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,600
these things lead to harm and ill will when they are hurting us when they are

244
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:38,080
hurting others abandon them when you yourself

245
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:47,679
know so the Buddha in this is one empowering each person right to engage

246
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:54,679
and reflect and he's also really

247
00:27:54,679 --> 00:28:00,640
beautifully simplifying what we need to know

248
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,679
directly what we need to connect

249
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:13,600
with and you know not you know you suffer I suffer

250
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:20,000
right I suffer you suffer just like you I suffer right we all suffer but we are all of us because of our own

251
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,080
conditioning suffer slightly

252
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:32,640
uniquely so we need to study ourselves we need to notice you know

253
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:39,679
when we're in unhealthy mental and emotional territory

254
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,039
this is so beautiful for me this is beautiful and it's so

255
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:53,880
simple so you know one of his key teachings is that greed hatred and

256
00:28:53,880 --> 00:29:00,720
delusion cause harm so we can just check in if there's

257
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,760
greed hatred and delusion and notice sometimes it's not clear maybe I need to

258
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:12,559
not like this or not want this or I want this but then okay is it causing harm is

259
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:21,960
it making me unwell is it making someone else unwell so for me I might give an example

260
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:29,880
of my child worrying about my child my adult child

261
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:35,240
is my worry while it's from the love of a

262
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:42,559
mama is my worry making me sick is it making me unwell is it contracting my

263
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:48,600
heart is it binding my mind is it turning my

264
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,960
stomach is it affecting my irritability

265
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:02,480
well if so it's probably leading to harm right it is i'm harming myself with

266
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,640
my abuse my ways that I'm holding

267
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:15,520
things so that tells me there's some way I'm looking at the situation or relating

268
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,880
it that I need to abandon there's some other way to hold

269
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,159
it or be with it that will allow my mind to relax and my heart to relax and my

270
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:32,399
body to be free the Buddha is telling us to know

271
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:40,360
the quality of our heart and our mind to use that as the reference point

272
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:46,760
for whether we want to pursue or abandon something

273
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:01,720
so after we come to this understanding for ourselves the Buddha

274
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:08,440
says "Know for yourself and listen to the wise."

275
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:18,399
When you know for yourselves and you can listen to the wise these things are skillful blameless

276
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:24,039
praised by sensible people and when you undertake them they lead to welfare and

277
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:29,200
happiness then you should acquire them and keep

278
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:34,840
them so the Buddha is not telling us to all be off in our own La La

279
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:42,159
Land right coming to our own completely own individual conclusions but rather to

280
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:48,200
also rely on those who are wise the teachings that are wise that have helped

281
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:53,679
us and you know our my relationship to various teachings change changes over

282
00:31:53,679 --> 00:32:00,960
time too so you know it's also always wise to keep checking in about what

283
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,278
we're

284
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:11,840
referencing and he doesn't say you have to believe the wise ones absolutely

285
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:18,440
right but use this as another gauge to help yourself

286
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:35,919
so what we come to know and see is not just you know not just me and not just another not them not me but

287
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:41,519
both both self-nowledge and the knowledge of the

288
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:54,120
wise in another suta the Buddha um is teaching his son

289
00:32:54,120 --> 00:33:01,600
Rahula about how to do this how do we how do we know whether what we're doing

290
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:07,360
is causing harm or not and it's not again it's not just

291
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:13,440
this intellectual analysis it's not a predictive thing but we might employ

292
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,760
those things but we don't rely solely upon them so he tells his son be anytime

293
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:27,360
time he's about to do something you know to take an action that might be significant to

294
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:34,720
reflect before you do it reflect is this causing harm to myself is it causing

295
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:43,679
harm to others or is it causing harm to both okay so before I you know go do

296
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:49,440
something important and say something important I want to reflect on these things and then the Buddha says "Okay

297
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:56,320
great." And then while you're doing it while it's happening reflect again have

298
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:02,240
mindfulness in the middle of it and reflect is this causing harm to me is it

299
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:08,398
causing harm to another or is it causing harm to both okay and so if it's not

300
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:15,358
Buddha says "Proce keep going." Great enjoy right

301
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:22,720
and afterwards so maybe you think it's not causing harm you go through it you still

302
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:28,118
don't think it's causing harm and afterwards you still pause and

303
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:35,599
reflect maybe many times after because sometimes we don't recognize the harm

304
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:41,040
until later and if it was all goodness it's

305
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:47,638
great to reflect and savor the goodness many many times many many

306
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:51,598
times asking the same

307
00:34:52,760 --> 00:35:01,000
questions it's you know this is our dharma

308
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,280
compass our north star this is such a beautiful again

309
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:14,320
accessible thing to do which is to notice ah can I love am I present Am I

310
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:23,440
open receptive you know taking in being willing or am I contracted and

311
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:30,000
hurting and closed off am I

312
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:38,240
suffering i think it's something that you know I I know I reference a lot but

313
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:46,079
not enough you know I think that uh I I too

314
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:52,720
often overlook how I allow myself to suffer and I don't think I'm

315
00:35:53,480 --> 00:36:00,320
alone and we need to look in all areas you know maybe we have we do work in our

316
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:05,480
our lives that's really meaningful and important work really helpful

317
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:10,560
work but if we aren't paying attention to how much we're trying to do or how

318
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:17,079
much pressure we're putting on ourselves or how much we're taking on we're letting ourselves suffer

319
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:24,240
probably most likely we need to notice it in all the

320
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,960
realms even if they're what we feel are completely wholesome realms we need to keep taking care of

321
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:38,760
ourselves be the guardians of our hearts pay attention to stress

322
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:47,440
early it'll help us make wiser decisions not to blindly just

323
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:53,599
accept our responsibilities our concerns as what is most

324
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:04,040
important so do you think you're paying close enough attention to your suffering to where

325
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:14,480
you're you know putting yourself in stress harm sway or harming others

326
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:22,400
is there some nest you're building a nest of fear stacking

327
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:31,480
dolls maybe pick one that you know you're constructing that you've been

328
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:38,880
building maybe bring it to mind maybe let yourself see the little

329
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:45,880
all the little tangled up pieces whether you like the nesting doll or the

330
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,559
nest all the things that are getting packed

331
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:06,720
together just take a moment to reflect on it and notice what you feel in your

332
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:17,560
body and what if what if you say don't

333
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:22,839
know don't know don't

334
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:29,480
know i don't know what if not

335
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:37,280
knowing releases the glue that binds it all together can you imagine

336
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:42,359
that letting the pieces soften

337
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:50,000
deconstructing your nest i'll read Rosemary's poem

338
00:38:52,280 --> 00:39:01,200
again every day I dismantle its nest the fear that wings darkly into my

339
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,200
thoughts

340
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:13,920
every day I dismantle its nest the fear that wings darkly into my

341
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,920
thoughts

342
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:53,809
[Music]

343
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:06,000
we have a couple of minutes i'm happy to take questions or if people want to come up I'm happy to talk to you after

344
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:13,559
afterwards so just is there a question or a comment anyone would like to share

345
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,680
ah Susan right behind you Martha

346
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:30,079
wow Tanya you're on fire oh um I really appreciate so much this

347
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:36,079
image of the nest um I'm like a very keen gardener and

348
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:43,359
every now and again after a windstorm it's not unusual to have a nest blown down and when you see a nest it's all

349
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:49,480
these little pieces of grass and feather

350
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:56,560
and somehow having this image of the little twig the little thing landing in

351
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:03,200
me and just gently let it go instead of this weaving

352
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:09,280
of the story line just so helpful thank you oh great Susan

353
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:15,119
thank you thank you

354
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:22,760
yeah anybody have a hard time imagining dismantling your

355
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:28,079
nest yeah maybe I'll teach you one of the

356
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:33,119
things that I do to help me it's actually comes out of uh my

357
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:43,200
practice with right effort so in my right hand I have the

358
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:49,540
nest that all that you were focusing on all that's sort of tangled up

359
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:56,040
[Music] together and

360
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:01,599
um you know all that that sort of contraction just let yourself feel it

361
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,079
and hold it

362
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,720
and then when you're ready in your left

363
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:17,760
hand there's not

364
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:26,599
knowing not knowing and opening relaxing into not

365
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:33,119
knowing just let the not knowing grow a bit

366
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:40,960
let it fill up your hand and the space around it just not knowing is huge it's

367
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,720
way bigger than the nest the knowing way

368
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:55,319
bigger and then when you're ready slide the not knowing under the

369
00:42:55,319 --> 00:43:02,319
nest take your hands and put the right hand above the left hand the nest being

370
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:12,880
held by this huge amazing field of not knowing and let the nest rest let it be

371
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:20,319
held in that field don't try and get rid of the nest just hold it in the

372
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:29,359
beautiful expansiveness of not knowing let it be saturated by not

373
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:36,000
knowing let it rest in not

374
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:47,599
knowing it can be it can be that simple we just might have to do it every

375
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:55,119
day right effort right is you know one of the ways the Buddha

376
00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:02,480
described it was in the time of the Buddha they didn't have nails so they used holes and

377
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,760
pegs to build things and so you know we're building

378
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:14,280
this nest so the Buddha would say when the peg is

379
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:20,800
rotten use a new good peg pound it in and replace the old one and then you

380
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:26,119
have the healthy rod in there holding things

381
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:32,800
together so what if not knowing can be that replacement thing holding things

382
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:40,240
together or allowing them to dissipate so maybe that'll help for those of you

383
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:48,599
who are having a hard time i hope it I hope it does thank you for your kind attention all right
