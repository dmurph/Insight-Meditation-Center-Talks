6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,480
know that diana and i were teaching a meta retreat last week online in fact

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,000
some of you were on the retreat oh my see you here hi

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,190
good to see you good to practice with you so so having sat really having been in a

9
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:59,600
[Music] container of meta for one week how nourishing it is and also meta can shape

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,878
shift into the other practices of of compassion into

11
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:13,200
a vicarious joy gratitude equanimity etc etc

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,400
and having led many different practices this past

13
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,159
week and and sat in them myself what feels really resonant is

14
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:30,720
the last practice that i invited folks to explore on the retreat which is

15
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:38,000
um radiating radiating meta over in the entire world can be such a

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,920
joyous practice they can be likened to us feeling like santa claus just giving

17
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,759
gifts of kindness gifts of kindness and if you think of if you remember a

18
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:58,320
time that you have given gifts just generously given gifts

19
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:06,560
of kindness how how uplifting how supportive for you that has felt

20
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,720
to be giving gifts to just share your generosity here here i am here is this

21
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,120
being who is me just sharing your generosity without any expectation for

22
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,959
for return for reciprocity just sharing sharing

23
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,959
your generosity your kindness your gifts can be very um

24
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,840
joyful just it can fill our hearts with gladness and happiness

25
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,000
and and to say sometimes

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,280
when people are do this practice of meta loving kindness for all beings

27
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,319
um [Music] actually let me just say one more word so so

28
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:04,640
as you might recall we practice the instructions um for meta loving kindness practice are

29
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,000
gradual it's a gradual cultivation the concentric circle starting from where

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,599
it's easy moving out moving out including more and more expanding more and more and more

31
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,440
and then the final category of all beings just includes everything and everyone

32
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:30,400
this idea of radiating radiating for everything everyone and everything and sometimes when people do

33
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,760
this practice they tune into and this can happen not

34
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,080
just with meta for all beings but even meta for say dear person or even for ourselves

35
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,080
when we're sharing loving kindness and then our mind tunes into challenges into

36
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,640
difficulty say if we're doing it for ourselves we get this sense of oh but i'm having such a hard time

37
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,239
oh and then the practice of metta becomes a practice of compassion because it's

38
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:08,080
meeting challenges similarly this practice if we do it for

39
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:15,680
someone who's near and dear to us a benefactor or dear friend when meta loving-kindness meets

40
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:22,880
challenge we feel oh they're going through a hard time first we're just practicing meta simply may you be safe

41
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,840
may you be happy no no may you be free from suffering oh when kindness meets

42
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:36,000
compassion when kindness meets suffering it becomes compassion similarly

43
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,919
some people sometimes tune into when they're trying to generate you know share their

44
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:47,919
goodness with all beings everywhere um

45
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:53,520
then suffering in the world comes up for them they tune into the suffering like

46
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,040
oh but so many people in the world are suffering so many animals oh

47
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,240
then at that point the practice becomes a practice of compassion it's not

48
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,560
pure meta anymore because metta is when we're wishing loving-kindness for

49
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,080
neutral beings so at that point mitta has shape-shifted to compassion not to

50
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,600
say it's a problem or it's wrong not a problem but just to recognize at that

51
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,199
point oh your mind is tuning into the suffering so the practice has become compassion

52
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,800
which is okay and if you want to keep the practice as a

53
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:40,880
meta practice for aldi just wishing well then tuning into just the gift the gift

54
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:47,520
of generosity of the meta and imagining beings who are new in a neutral

55
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,639
situation they're not suffering neither are they really happy or nor

56
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,000
unhappy so that's the trick here to keep this practice in the channel

57
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,120
of meta let's say advanced pointer just does that make

58
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,960
sense give me a nod or thumbs up you're with me yeah great

59
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:17,919
so without further ado let's practice let's let's give our hearts to this practice

60
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:25,440
so so [Music] arriving in our bodies always starting

61
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,240
with the body

62
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,840
starting ah landing in the body here

63
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,440
here

64
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,160
connecting with the breath connecting

65
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,199

66
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,360
sitting body turning our gaze inward

67
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,440
the gift of this moment the gift of this breath

68
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,560
my thoughts arise not that there is anything wrong with thinking per se but

69
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,680
in this moment we turn our hearts

70
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,840
we turn our hearts turn our attention

71
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:09,758
away from thinking thank you not now please come back later thoughts

72
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:16,720
turning away letting go [Music] gently smiling me

73
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,400

can we feel nourished

79
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:54,959
receiving the breath just the simplicity

80
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,240
of sitting and being breathed

81
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,800

you are part of all beings and so [Music] are your dear beings your friends

169
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:20,240
your benefactors family people who are easy loved ones

170
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,158
all the people who are neutral in the world you don't know them

171
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:32,240
i also let the beings you have challenges with

172
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:39,559
to be included if it doesn't make the practice too challenging

173
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:55,000
all beings everywhere let it be joyous practice of generosity

174
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:02,640
with each breath may all beings be well

175
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,760
may all beings be happy

176
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:19,200
also if mind states difficult mind states arise boredom

177
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:25,520
irritability irritation let that be held with kindness

178
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:33,240
meeting all experience too with kindness

179
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,200
with a smile

180
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:12,278
expansiveness of the heart may all beings wait be well may all beings be happy

181
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,480
expansive unbounded exultant

182
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,240
expansive expansive

183
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:10,159
imagining perhaps all the beings around the world all the two-legged beings may all be

184
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,720
well all humans

185
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,559
on so many different continents

186
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,000
all the creatures of the sea

187
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:48,120
may you be well may all the creatures of disguise

188
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,000
all the animals of the land

189
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,960
whatever the size might

190
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:18,278
be short medium or tall

191
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:42,559
and now i've been checking in to see what it feels like to be

192
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:47,039
radiating wishing well for all beings

193
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:56,440
excluding none whether there is a sense of more ease contentment

194
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:06,200
just suddenly maybe

195
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:32,599
after the last moments of this practice period

196
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,480
acknowledging this radiance of meta

197
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:47,839
is our true nature we're not creating it

198
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:55,118
fabricating it's already here we just acknowledge

199
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:03,000
and by acknowledging we cultivate it to be more readily available

200
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:11,119
and letting letting this goodness nourish us

201
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:16,320
pause as if we're sitting in it

202
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:23,838
this light this warmth as if it's a big warm hug

203
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:30,320
may i be well may i be safe

204
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,359
happy healthy

205
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:43,880
may i have ease and may all of this goodness

206
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,440
flow through me flow

207
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:59,560
to others beyond me through this vessel that is me

208
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:06,640
may all beings be well may all things be happy

209
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,319
may all beings be free

210
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,609

226
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,480
hi i just wanna thank you for a lovely practice again

227
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,000
it was just lovely to see you today i've been missing you both like for about a

228
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:31,200
week i guess okay so i was so distracted

229
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:39,119
by someone is cleaning my place right now so go back and forth wearing the mask and back and forth

230
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,720
um i really try hard to be this present

231
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:51,119
but then i was not able to i have to confess that um

232
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:57,520
so at the same time and um i'm trying to just let go of controlling part again

233
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:05,119
like oh you know what did she clean this part did she did what i said

234
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:13,359
so i was just sitting here i'm like okay let it be for 30 minutes

235
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:18,800
and whatever it happens just let it unfold it let it just let go of

236
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:24,320
it but i'm actually inside of the room small little room

237
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:30,000
and i'm thinking you know what i'll just let go of it whatever

238
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,200
yeah great thanks for sharing that sujang it's it's

239
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,480
lovely to be back to see you and everyone the sangha i've missed you guys

240
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:46,000
as well and what you're talking about two reflections one is regarding this

241
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:53,760
letting go the letting go like letting go of control letting go is also related to meta

242
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,880
related to meta because when we let go of control there's a sense of offering

243
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,160
generosity offering gift girlfriend like it's okay we're offering this gift of

244
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:09,599
meta to ourselves when we're not like you know holding tight just letting go

245
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:15,440
letting go so that's one reflection that comes out which i appreciate you're playing with this letting go another one

246
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:21,040
is when when with this other person rather doing what

247
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:26,160
i asked them to do etcetera etcetera you can include them in the meta you can

248
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,520
include yourself in the meta in this practice right because it's all beings and the person who's cleaning who's

249
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:38,720
offering their service their time can be very well included in that may you be well may you be safe

250
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:46,079
my thoughts of control oh just offering yourself kindness so expanding really directing

251
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:51,599
this meta to whatever is arising in the space of awareness does that make

252
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:57,839
sense what i'm inviting you to play with yeah next time you can try try that

253
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:05,680
of course letting go is lovely and yeah it's beautiful okay so let her do whatever she has to

254
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:12,480
do i think that that's also like a practice right yeah because that's what you're essentially doing anyway you're not

255
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:18,079
getting up to go interrupt so you might as well offer her gift of meta in your heart

256
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:24,160
because you're actually doing it but there's kind of a her you know holding back a little bit

257
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:31,040
right holding back memento with doubt is she doing the right thing oh may she be while she's doing her best

258
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:36,880
because you're not getting up to go interrupt anyway might as well you're ah in this way you're offering your own

259
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:44,000
mind piece that's what i'm pointing out by giving her meta you're offering your own mind and heart peace that's what's

260
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:50,960
beautiful about this practice we think we're doing a favor to the other person because actually we're doing ourselves a favor that's what i'm pointing at

261
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,480
freeing your own heart up from like oh what's happening

262
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:02,640
that makes sense thank you thank you

263
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:08,480
yeah and some reflections here lovely meditation thanks you're welcome

264
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:15,440
i loved generating the feelings of radiating love first before starting the words ah lovely

265
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:21,680
yeah do you have any suggestions for if i find it really hard for me sometimes to

266
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:28,240
believe that i have put a nature in me like i feel like i've forgotten how to have a kind attitude

267
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:33,359
i know i have it other times but today it feels so distant yeah i appreciate

268
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:38,480
the question um it's i think the last part that you say

269
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:46,160
i know i have it other times that that is the the stepping stone but you know you have

270
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:52,319
it some other times today it feels distant so you trust that you have it you you land in that trust that it's

271
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:59,599
available other times and that's enough just sitting with that it will trust me if

272
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:06,079
just sitting with that yeah i trust that it's available to me other times and then maybe even bringing to mind memory

273
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:12,000
of times you have been kind say to a friend or a child like oh yeah

274
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:19,440
it's not so distant so bring the memory in and that that helps rekindle

275
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:26,000
yeah yeah and reflection from someone who is on the

276
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,520
retreat so glad for this beautiful continuity it's really helping with the challenges

277
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:37,680
of integration and missing being steeped in the three jewels ah that's very sweet

278
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,880
so so glad kathryn that you can join papiar on

speaking with each other in small communities and just spreading spreading each other's

282
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:10,319
kindness receiving kindness and spreading kindness which is very simple it's not

283
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:16,000
big it's just we all have it we're all these candles

284

earlier today a friend had asked me to help him on a project which i which i

i'm skeptical that i can be very effective in healthy and but i i could feel

308
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:10,319
uh some of the the muscles develop from this regular

309
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:16,079
practice that allowed me to say uh yeah what the hell let's give it a try
