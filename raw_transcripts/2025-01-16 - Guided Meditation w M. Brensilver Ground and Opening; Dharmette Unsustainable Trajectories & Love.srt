1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:12,200
okay folks so um we should uh we should practice

2
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,960
together so finding your posture

3
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,038
finding your belly

4
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,120
just live in your belly for a moment

5
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,119
sense of gravity the earthiness of your body

6
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,079
really taking your

7
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,360
seat what did the the budha mean when he

8
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,840
touched the

9
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,000
Earth just let your body find

10
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,239
out right

11
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,840
now e

12
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,480
I'm so used to living in my heart heart and my head

13
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,640
that the attention almost drifts up like a helium

14
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,939
balloon out of my belly out of the [Music]

15
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,359
bones to my head and heart but we just stay grounded in your

16
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,319
belly sit in your bones

17
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,919
know yourself as

18
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,680
Earth breathe yourself down into the

19
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:01,639
ground may stay open but very stable

20
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,639
oh

21
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639
e

22
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
e

23
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
e

24
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
e

25
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,479
e e

26
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:49,360
just sensing um a AFF effect in your

27
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,680
body kind of uh circuits of emotional activation

28
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:19,519
and just bathing those circuits in uh

29
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,519
awareness

30
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
patience

31
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
for

32
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,320
for e

33
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:17,839
it's like we have a certain unannounced vision of how our life is supposed to

34
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,399
unfold and uh affect in the

35
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:31,240
body it's the way we assess our progress towards that

36
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:36,320
model of our

37
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:54,959
life but we're invited

38
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:07,160
to put down Notions of what our life supposed to be what it

39
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,680
is to put down Notions of what it is to

40
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,079
meditate and to breathe

41
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:57,600
let me just use everything is a way of becoming

42
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,120
more Al

43
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
live

44
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

45
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

46
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

47
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

48
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

49
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

50
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

51
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

52
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,840
e e

53
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,559
just for now

54
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,720
pleasure and

55
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:17,000
preferences become uh very much beside the

56
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:23,399
point not forever but for now

57
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:57,640
and you don't have to perform

58
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,679
awareness for

59
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,720
awareness depends on certain

60
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:50,000
conditions but none of those conditions are

61
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
you

62
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

63
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

64
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

65
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

66
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

67
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

68
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

69
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

70
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

71
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

72
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,278
e e

73
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,080
budda knowing

74
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
dum

75
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
e

76
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,120
e e

77
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,080
for

78
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,989
[Music]

79
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
e

80
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:58,799
okay so the uh the the Buddha's path began

81
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:05,799
with a a recognition that something something about his life was

82
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:14,279
unsustainable unsustainable and as the story goes before leaving the the

83
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:19,360
palace he was living in a kind of [Music]

84
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:28,200
Illusion and then he realized that pleasure couldn't go on forever

85
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:34,279
and there's a kind of recognition he saw the Human Condition was inherently

86
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:39,840
unstable ruled by

87
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:46,760
uncertainty and this recognition generated some

88
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:52,200
fear as the the illusion of a governable

89
00:31:52,200 --> 00:32:01,919
permanent pleasure crumbled and and he uh sought security

90
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:08,399
instead in relinquishment and in a way you could

91
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:14,600
say he sought security by being infinitely vulnerable

92
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:23,240
to the world and perhaps um the ambient

93
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:30,679
anxiety of 2025 of this moment is is something

94
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:37,639
along these lines some some we're intuiting something

95
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:42,960
similar uh but not about the individual but about our

96
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:51,279
society that we as a human species are

97
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:56,720
not on a sustainable path

98
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:04,480
and uh just as the the Buddha's pleasure was unsustainable so too

99
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:10,720
maybe conditions the trajectory of of uh

100
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:18,919
us and it's not that human nature is getting worse not that over the last

101
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:24,480
whatever 100 years or something we've deteriorated we have actually

102
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:34,440
gotten better in many ways it's just that greed and hate and

103
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:40,720
delusion scales more efficiently than

104
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:49,080
Dharma and technology has functioned not only but in part to scale greed hatred

105
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:54,720
and delusion

106
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:01,480
and our our bewilderment grows as we

107
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:06,639
um flooded with ideas and opinions but ceased to

108
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:14,878
care about evidence and overconfidence is what um what goes

109
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:19,960
viral so we're we're a kind of

110
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:26,079
caricature of of a the dun and Krueger effect the dun and Krueger

111
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:32,919
culture they write um the skills that engender competence in a particular

112
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:41,440
domain are often the very same skills necessary to evaluate competence in that

113
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,320
domain those with limited don't knowledge in a domain suffer a dual

114
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:54,560
burden not only do they reach mistaken conclusions and make regrettable

115
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:02,839
errors but their incompetence Rob robs them of the ability to realize it I was

116
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:09,800
angry when I wrote up these notes just full disclosure you

117
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:15,520
know and uh as I offer the talk I was sort of

118
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:21,160
recognizing like oh yeah anger always imputes an

119
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:28,240
agent and um maybe in certain moment and

120
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:38,040
reflecting on this theme I forgot something uh empty phenomena rolling

121
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,000
on let me continue my

122
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:49,480
rant Renee um Desta said that um freedom

123
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:54,760
of speech is not freedom of reach

124
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,560
ignorance now reaches

125
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:09,440
everywhere and there are

126
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:15,520
likely massive labor effects of of AI and new

127
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:23,000
technology disparities of um wealth or heartbreaking and the kind of emerging

128
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,560
economy is likely to exacerbate that Gap not heal it

129
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:39,280
and the rise of authoritarianism not just in this country um but many places

130
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:46,319
the the confidence of conmen mistaken for actual

131
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:54,880
hope and of course La is on my mind

132
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:02,119
and climate change and the kind of shrinking of livable land or

133
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:09,839
at least insurable land and all this just

134
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:15,920
um yeah it just seems like it's not

135
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:21,319
sustainable I don't feel apocalyptic or something or feel

136
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:28,160
like something so IM imminent but it just feels like this is not sustainable

137
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:35,000
and then we sense our near nearly complete powerlessness in

138
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,359
the face of the scaling of greed ha and

139
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:46,040
delusion sometimes our heart gets frenzied sometimes it

140
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:53,079
collapses sometimes for me it Sparks a kind of

141
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:59,560
um dabbling with a certain kind of nihilism just of

142
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:09,240
like not nihilism in the sense the Buddha used it but just the the sense of just like get me out get me out of some

143
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:14,920
sorrow and on the one hand it's a very good thing to have confidence that you

144
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:21,839
can be very happy even amidst very difficult circumstances practice

145
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:29,240
engenders that confidence happiness independent of

146
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:35,359
conditions it's a reasonable way of talking about

147
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:41,880
Freedom shinen yangang would often use a phrase like

148
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:48,800
that but still I don't even want to flirt with

149
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:54,800
nihilism you know and so

150
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:01,400
um sometimes we do say step step out of the realm of Hope and fear that's often an

151
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:09,880
instruction we say to hope is to hope for the wrong thing TS Elliot I said to

152
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:16,440
my soul be still and wait without hope for hope would be hope for the wrong

153
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:24,720
thing wait Without Love For Love would be love for the wrong thing and so yeah

154
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:32,838
step out of Hope and fear but sometimes times and today was one of those

155
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:39,880
times I need hope I need

156
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:46,560
hope but the time scale of My Hope might need to

157
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:53,839
expand I need to expand Beyond the Horizon of our

158
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:59,318
lives and maybe

159
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:08,599
you know maybe our love can't quite dispel misery right

160
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:15,400
now but uh nevertheless let us steadfastly

161
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:21,119
plant seeds wisdom and compassion they've been

162
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:26,560
planted through time we are enjoying the

163
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:32,960
fruit of that now and so I want

164
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:39,800
to to be uh part of a group that is

165
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:45,839
committed to love to nonharming to heedfulness

166
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:51,440
care even if that fruit is not

167
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:58,079
born now even in this lifetime we do need the momentum

168
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:04,680
of goodness to continue

169
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:11,880
and I want to be part of a uh an endless

170
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:17,280
stream of wisdom and compassion that predates the

171
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,400
Buddha continues after

172
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,760
us do doing no evil engaging in what's

173
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:37,720
skillful and purifying one's mind this is the teachings of the Buddha of the

174
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:45,760
buddas plural from the dhap doing no evil engaging in what's

175
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,839
skillful purifying one's

176
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:58,200
mind I go back in moments to the fundamentals when things get

177
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:06,359
staticky maybe that's clear enough maybe just that is enough let us do that even

178
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:10,559
though it feels insufficient let us do

179
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:21,280
that this from um uh local San Francisco paper I saw today

180
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:27,640
um in December uh Rangers from the US Forest servants uh

181
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:33,040
encountered an unexpected climber a goose attempting to Summit Mount

182
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:39,920
chesta Forest Rangers Nick Myers and Eric Falconer of the mount chesta Avalanche Center were on routine Patrol

183
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:46,760
when they came upon their first uh their first attempted Ascent of Mount Shasta

184
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:52,240
by a goose found at about 10,000 ft uh Meer

185
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:59,440
said the first step was to catch it I didn't think I'd actually catch the goose but as boys being boys we

186
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:04,800
tried rescue proved more challenging than expected with the goose initially

187
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:12,280
trying to escape at first the goose tried to fly away but couldn't its head and eyes were

188
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:19,440
crusted in ice Wings battered flopped its way down the slope we chased after

189
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,559
without success Eric and I were about to give up but I said I'm going to try one

190
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:31,760
more time and I ran up from behind and Dove on top of it and caught it honestly

191
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:39,359
I was surprised I caught it and my next thought was what do I do what do we

192
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:44,640
do now and that's when we're like well I

193
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:50,720
guess we try to take it down the mountain I tucked its wings and stuck it

194
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:58,119
under my arm like a football I expected a big fuss and fight as I started the snowmobile

195
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:03,920
and began riding down the mountain uh this is when uh I began to

196
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:10,880
to feel uh real connection of the spirit with the goose as its demeanor

197
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:17,240
relaxed and tucked its head into my jacket the goose most certainly

198
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:24,559
understood uh we were helping it as it warmed up in the truck it got a

199
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:30,000
little feisty but nothing

200
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:46,400
crazy started to talk angry but

201
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,079
um tender

202
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,039
now and um

203
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:08,160
um as I wrote up the notes sort of cried and unusual way for

204
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:15,160
