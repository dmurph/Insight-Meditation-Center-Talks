00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,359
so um yeah good day good morning good

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,280
day it's good to be with you all this

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:22,560
week yeah thank you for letting me know this is sometimes a easy to forget

4
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:36,819
um for [Music]

5
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:22,439
I have the sense that uh quietly seeing the chat messages flowing in really have

6
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,960
the sense of kind of meeting you all uh

7
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:36,079
think some um kind of mysterious ways

8
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,280
yeah so we'll start

9
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:50,880
um we're coming to uh the last session of this week uh this 5

10
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,320
days we've been exploring the Sim of the

11
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:04,840
five Aggregates and today uh were culminating um at the last

12
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:12,319
one which is um about this aggregate of

13
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:21,519
Consciousness or uh the poly term is uh Vaya um the translation is consciousness

14
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:27,080
uh often it's a hard to know exactly what

15
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,319
the Consciousness is um and many people are

16
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,599
still kind of exploring reflecting about this

17
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:46,680
and and I also don't know exactly what Consciousness is and and yet um the

18
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:53,239
Buddha is pointing out to something we can know

19
00:02:53,239 --> 00:03:02,200
um what I will say is that we can know there is an aspect of the human capacity

20
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:08,799
that is able to know uh experiences in different domains

21
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:15,400
so for example oh we hear a sound you're hearing sound right now and you know

22
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,239
there sound and um maybe you feel

23
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:29,040
temperature and there is a Consciousness that knows that and um maybe there are some tactile

24
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,920
Sensations in the body and there is something that knows that and so there

25
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:41,040
is this different domains of capacities that's able to

26
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:48,599
know in this range in this different ranges of our experience um you know

27
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:55,000
often in the Buddhism we speak about the six sense uh context that's are kind of

28
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,840
a six domains of experiences that we all have and there is this Consciousness

29
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,519
that kind of can Spotlight on the experience and get to know that get to

30
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:12,840
know the experience and the Buddha kind of has

31
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:21,280
this a Mastery of um using Sim um used magicians

32
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,040
Illusions as the way to describe how this aggregate of

33
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,280
Consciousness works I to say it feels like you know in the

34
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,479
magician show um they Spotlight on different things and then it gets lit up

35
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:46,840
and you see them and they got put together in some way

36
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,360
um that captures um people's audience

37
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,680
mind in a way that's a little bit like how the

38
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,680
Consciousness work at the spotlight for our experiences to

39
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:13,080
be known and then being a cleaning aggregate we can get pulled into

40
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:22,039
them and so we'll practice with this and then we'll uh explore this um uh this

41
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:31,638
assimile in some more details so let's sit I'm going to uh start the Bell

42
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:38,649
[Music]

43
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,960
coming into a meditative posture

44
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:06,840
again entering into this Temple

45
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,400
within a metaphor I've been using this

46
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:23,560
week entering the Temple of this body mind and heart

47
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:40,039
just like entering into the temple we're not in a big

48
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:50,880
rush or arriving at a Here and

49
00:06:52,560 --> 00:07:01,520
Now where the kindness where the rist

50
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,960
back with the pace that allow us to

51
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:33,120
settle maybe it's this momentary

52
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:44,280
mindfulness being present with the

53
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:55,159
sound the global sense of the body sitting or lying down

54
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:22,599
there is no rush to get to

55
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,319
anywhere or steady

56
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:38,080
one moment of mindfulness and

57
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,120
another and another

58
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:26,040
at some point you may find

59
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,040
yourself studying

60
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,480
in a kind of

61
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:47,480
presence a continuous stream of

62
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:00,399
mindfulness maybe a kind of resting

63
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,519
in the field of

64
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,959
knowing and the experiences began to emerge

65
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,959
from this field of

66
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:53,160
knowing movements of the breath

67
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,000
Sensations in the

68
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:20,120
body being available

69
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:51,360
it's a mindful knowing itself doesn't have to move

70
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:04,160
it's available

71
00:12:55,079 --> 00:13:00,680
you can start with the embodied experience

72
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,519
the flow of the

73
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,959
breath is

74
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:31,120
known as the flow of the breath

75
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,839
happens and there is also a Consciousness that can

76
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:43,399
know the moving

77
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,240
breath it's like the

78
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,720
spotlight lights up

79
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:08,560
the sound emerges it's

80
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,360
SN either the

81
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,639
Consciousness lit

82
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:31,040
up Sensations in the body

83
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,639
are know lit

84
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,000
up e

85
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:39,279
the floating thoughts are

86
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,880
know L

87
00:15:55,399 --> 00:16:01,880
up repos or waves of emotion are

88
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,680
known and lit

89

up e

90
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:34,640
then drop a below the narratives the

91
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,760
stories staying with the felt

92
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,799
sense e

93
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:59,280
when you're [Music] resting in the quiet

94
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:07,880
quiet peaceful field of mindfulness mindful

95
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,640
awareness you can begin to feel and to

96
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,880
see how the different sense

97
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,559
Consciousness are lit up

98
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:43,320
one moment of a sound to a moment of

99
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,720
sensation a moment of a mental

100
00:19:52,679 --> 00:20:00,640
activity like a dazzling magician's uion

101
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
husary

102
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,559
e e

103
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,679
when the mind is not pulled

104
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,158
into a magic show

105
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:08,000
a natural disenchantment and the

106
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,960
dispassion can become

107
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:30,159
available or maybe a sense of mind and heart

108
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,120
resting deeper

109
00:22:51,799 --> 00:23:00,440
within quiet peaceful

110
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:14,880
undisturbed by the movements of the heart and

111
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,559
mind or in the body

112
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:37,000
like a still flowing

113
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
water

114
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360

e

117
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
for

118
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

119
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240

e

128
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,880
e e

129
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,200
each of the five BND five

130
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:31,320
Aggregates the humanly processes that way being exploring this

131
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:37,200
week can be seen

132
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:46,080
felt just as they are the foaminess of the

133
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,840
body the water bubbles of the feelings

134
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:07,120
a perceptions like a

135
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:19,240
mirage the forces of a mental activities that likes to

136
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,240
construct

137
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,600
realities and The Magicians

138
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,398
Illusions a spotlight of the

139
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:44,200
Consciousness they are just what they are

140
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:07,720
by seeing them as they are we shift and change our

141
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,919
relationships with

142
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:26,720
them we can soften and loosening up our

143
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:35,598
grip the cleaning of this few humanly

144
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:47,560
processes and offer our respect and

145
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,280
care for what they

146
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:00,680
are for

147
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:33,399
[Music]

148
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,960
so I'd like to read this part of the sutta this last

149
00:35:53,960 --> 00:36:01,880
assim from the Samaya it says suppose

150
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:09,800
practitioners that a magician or a Magician's Apprentice would display a ma

151
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:18,240
magical illusion at a Crossroads a man with good sight to

152
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:25,680
change a person with good sight would inspect it ponder it and carefully

153
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:33,880
investigate it and it would appear to them to be void Hollow sub

154
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:40,400
insubstantial for what substance would there be in a magical

155
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:46,400
illusion so to practitioners whatever kind of

156
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:55,160
Consciousness there is whether past future present internal or external

157
00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:04,560
gross or subtle inferior or Superior far or near a practitioner

158
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,599
inspects it Ponders it and carefully

159
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:17,359
investigate it and it would appear to them to be void Hollow

160
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:25,000
insubstantial for what substance would there be in consciousness

161
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:37,079
and so I just I really love this similes and I don't know what's in Buddhist

162
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:43,040
mind and how he relates sees um this

163
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,720
kind of humanly processes and you know but the way that

164
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:55,800
he's articulating it uh using similes are so powerful right and if we just

165
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:03,400
imagine ourselves in the magic show that magicians are using all kinds of props

166
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:11,359
to capture the audience attention sound smell visual you know all of this and

167
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:18,040
and it's in the midst of the dazzling movements that the magician creates an

168
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:23,720
illusion of something a rabbit comes out of an empty

169
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:32,960
hat or a person is cut up in half in an enclosed the box and Etc and

170
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:39,119
Etc and The Magicians are utilizing their understanding of kind of

171
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:46,920
some of this humanly processes uh to uh create this kind

172
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:52,200
of Illusions right but then for us we

173
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:57,960
know you know this is a magic show so it's Elusive and we don't really believe

174
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:04,319
them so much we're just having a good time you know we're getting captured by

175
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:11,480
uh the effects of them and so

176
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:17,440
um and this is is such a wonderful simile to

177
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:23,079
illustrate how this aggregate of a Consciousness might

178
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:30,960
work that when all of this different dimension of Consciousness gets lit up

179
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:37,119
and the moment after another and the a Sanara that we talked about yesterday

180
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:42,560
can begin to create something real for us like a magical

181
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:49,519
illusion except that we don't quite always see it that way we see it quite

182
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:56,079
real and we get um hooked by the content

183
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:04,000
of the illusion and the you know dream like thing but when we're in the present

184
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,839
moment we can began to tease apart and see

185
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:15,920
oh this is not as substantial or as real as I had

186
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:23,920
thought there is a very famous uh line in the uh Chinese Sutra called The

187
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:30,480
Diamond Sutra then it says something like all conditioned the phenomenon are like

188
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:36,000
a dream an illusion a bubble a shadow

189
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,160
like a de or a flash of

190
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:51,359
lightning that gets kind of you know pointing to um similar aspect of our experience

191
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:56,800
the conditioned experience I remember many years ago I

192
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,839
went to to an outlet um on the Thanksgiving day you

193
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:08,760
know shopping day and when I got to the parking lot I got out of the

194
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:16,440
car there was so many people and the the stores were dazzling with lights and

195
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:23,319
sounds and very strong smells and you know fragrance and it just very load up

196
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:28,640
you know loaded up and for a few moments I remember

197
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:36,200
standing there I felt so disorienting it's really this kind of

198
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:42,760
elusive feeling and I thought to myself is this really

199
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:49,440
real what's really real you know so I ended up getting one thing

200
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:56,119
from a store and immediately left I I I I can't remember doing the Thanksgiving

201
00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:01,920
shopping after that that again

202
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:13,599
so and so this is the elusive nature of uh this Aggregate and and the Buddha

203
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:23,160
seems to have a real kind of insight and immediate experience of how this

204
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:29,280
works and this uh m magic illusion has

205
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:38,000
two aspects um that I felt like was being pointed out that one is that um

206
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:46,760
one can see through the magic Illusions and become disenchanted and not so

207
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:54,319
interested in it and yet magic show being magic show they also have this

208
00:42:54,319 --> 00:43:00,920
alluring quality to it so people get hooked by them the

209
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:06,400
Illusions gets real and so that's that that forces the V Sankara that can come

210
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:11,680
in and pull us into it and

211
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:16,920
sometimes we end up and maybe a lot of times so when we're not paying attention

212
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:23,119
to what's happening we end up living in the movies that we're constructing for

213
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,119
ourselves

214
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:38,720
and through this practice what can happen is that um the

215
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:47,119
Buddha also knows when we begin to see through and unpack see through teas

216
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:53,520
apart seeing uh the uh as is Natures of this

217
00:43:53,520 --> 00:44:00,760
kind of humanly phenomenon there is a natural arising or

218
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:06,280
natural um emergence of disinterest in

219
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:13,960
them and so can say oh this is just how it is you know how much more can I watch

220
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:21,599
this can I get hooked by the magic show you know after you watch it for a while

221
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:28,240
there is a natural disinterest in them and so this is later on what the

222
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:37,240
sutta began to point out that one naturally get disenchanted in them and

223
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:43,400
dispassionate and eventually that alluring effect

224
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:50,640
that attachment that is there began to soften and

225
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:57,440
loosen and maybe dropped released momentarily

226
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:06,240
and so you may all have had experiences like this and what becomes available to us is

227
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:13,400
this deeper kind of a peace and a well-being that's there that is not

228
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:18,839
based on being stimulated by all of our sense

229
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:24,480
Consciousness sense contact they can still be functioning

230
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:30,520
those are the functional uh capacities of a human

231
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:39,800
beings but the clinging to them the attachment to them and that the

232
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:46,880
um uh ongoing kind of a construction based on the Illusions

233
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,000
began to soften began to loosen

234
00:45:51,960 --> 00:46:00,040
up and that's the power of a practicing um uh with the immediacy of

235
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:07,400
our experience so I like to read um the last

236
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:12,559
verses of the suas maybe as a way to

237
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:17,640
inspire or um you know cheer up uh

238
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:25,000
through the practice for all of us and so this is what the Buddha said uh at the final

239
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:31,240
verses says a practitioner with energy aroused

240
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:38,559
should look upon the Aggregates thus and that is you know he used the words avoid

241
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:46,800
Hollow insubstantial and just as they are whether by day or at night

242
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:52,559
comprehending ever mindful they should discard all the

243
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:58,480
feeds as cleaning attachments and the make take a refuge

244
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:04,520
for themselves let them fear as with aead a

245
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:09,559
blaze yearning for the imparable

246
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:16,760
state I don't know quite how we relate to the last words it feels pretty uh uh

247
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:22,000
dramatic but maybe I will soften this by inviting

248
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:30,280
us um to practice when with um care and

249
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:35,359
respect for a Being Human for the humanly

250
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:42,000
processes and really allow ourselves to soak in the in the immediacy of our

251
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:48,839
experience and let that inform us let them guide us in this

252
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:55,400
way and so may this week's practice and um

253
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:02,800
Dharma reflections benefit ourselves and benefit all beings

254
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:11,400
everywhere thank you friends have a wonderful rest of the day

255
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:21,630
