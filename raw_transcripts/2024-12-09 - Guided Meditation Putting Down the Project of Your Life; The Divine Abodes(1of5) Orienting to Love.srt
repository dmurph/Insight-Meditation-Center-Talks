available for

15
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:17,280
don't be in too much of a rush to assume your inner Dharma posture just

16
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,520
uh just give yourself a little

17
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,720
time e

18
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:19,280
be uh patient in other words with the the process of um settling with the

19
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:26,880
Wayward longings with

20
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:34,160
the ways in which um before we settle it feels

21
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:41,120
like we have to worry just be

22
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:49,800
patient with your mind as it gets enough reassurance from

23
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:56,440
samsara that it's okay to

24
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639
relax

25
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
for

26
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,560
e e

27
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,560
and then we we use our breathing to speak to

28
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,560
our

29
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:22,800
vigilance we breathe in such a way to

30
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:30,400
uh signal to our body that's okay

31
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,518
to put down the

32
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:56,640
defensiveness to signal to our body that are are clinging is not what's keeping us safe

33
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,440
in this moment

34
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
for

35
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
e

36
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,320
e e

37
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:12,720
almost anything you your worry can do your

38
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,279
breath can do

39
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:29,920
better our whole life looks different from the

40
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,680
perspective of

41
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:49,440
Tranquility it's very hard to determine what's actually worth

42
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:56,440
worrying about when we're in a state of hyperarousal

43
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:17,199
so we breathe we keep surrendering to the sensations of

44
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:23,920
breathing keep surrendering to silence to not

45
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
knowing

46
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

47
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

48
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

49
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,079
e e

50
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:22,399
being alive is amazing but the project

51
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:30,880
called my life is a burden

52
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:43,000
it's a burden at least to hold it as a project in all moments

53
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:04,680
and so we keep surrendering into the Simplicity of the

54
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:14,759
moment knowing yeah we will pick up the weight of the project called my

55
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:17,639
life

56
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:27,680
again but we don't need to carry it in all moments

57
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:52,720
what would it be like to be alive to

58
00:16:53,959 --> 00:17:00,199
breathe without any sense of uh project

59
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:03,279
meditative or

60
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,240
otherwise just put it

61
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
down

62
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

63
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

64
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

65
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

66
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

67
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

68
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

69
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

70
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

71
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

72
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

73
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,480
e e

74
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:14,919
as we uh seclude ourself in the

75
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,240
moment and settle even just a little

76
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:31,600
bit the Tranquility connects us with the the whole homeness of the

77
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:44,360
Dharma the burden of holding on the

78
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:51,720
relief and letting Go the

79
00:24:51,720 --> 00:25:00,120
fire of hatred this

80
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:06,720
soothing tenor of uh love

81
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:18,320
kindness we settle down a little bit and we can start to sense how actively

82
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:26,120
our nervous system Longs for the Dharma

83
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:35,200
for forgiveness and love

84
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,640
sensitivity

85
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,278
care for

86
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
peace

87
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

88
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

89
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,159
e e

90
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:02,159
[Music]

91
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:11,390
[Music]

92
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,120
for e

93
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:33,720
okay it's good to uh good to sit with

94
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:41,240
you sort of feel my brain coming online as the meditation

95
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:48,279
unfolds 7:00 is a little early uh the caffeine drip started a

96
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:53,760
little late but uh I'm getting the hang of the

97
00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:01,679
the hour and um yeah happy to uh to practice with you

98
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:07,320
feels good so

99
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,320
okay

100
00:30:13,399 --> 00:30:24,640
um when you um when you become committed to uh to

101
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:31,440
love it matters a little less how everything is

102
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:38,840
going still matters but it matters a little

103
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:46,320
less and for sure you root for things to go

104
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:55,600
well but when they don't and you know they won't uh you you know you have um a

105
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,919
Secure net to fall back

106
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:09,039
into and when you know I'm going to have to love my way

107
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:15,200
through this life when you really know

108
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,600
that things actually change the

109
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:29,200
the texture of life changes but you have to know that that

110
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,720
deeply you have to know that in your in your

111
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:42,519
bones and yeah I often ask myself the question

112
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:48,039
How Deeply entrained is love in my

113
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:54,320
heart you can't always tell sometimes it's hard to know how deeply you've

114
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,360
trained the love into your heart until

115
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:05,559
you have a a fantastic opportunity for

116
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:11,360
hate and maybe you've had such a

117
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:23,919
moment some some s this this realm human realm is not is not

118
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,440
Utopia there will forever be things to object

119
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,279
to Forever there will be things that might

120
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:43,639
be hated and the truth is even if

121
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:52,240
we we're not in a highly imperfect world even if somehow some way we managed to

122
00:32:52,240 --> 00:33:01,120
find our way into Utopia we'd literally start hating

123
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:07,799
rainbows no no I love rainbows we'd start hating

124
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:13,919
rainbows we'd start hating rainbows because it feels

125
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:22,000
like that's not the title of this Dharma talk hating rainbows but we'd start hating them or

126
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:30,480
something like them because it feels like our problems find us but that's often

127
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:39,240
merely illusion often it's our pain finding a

128
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:48,720
placeholder it's got to be placed somewhere and the best thing I got is

129
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:59,480
rainbows so I'm beginning to talk about uh um non

130
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:07,760
nonh hatred non-h hatred non-h hatred lies at the the

131
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:15,040
intersection of many Buddhist teachings and

132
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:21,720
uh non- clinging the teaching on on non clinging un Letting Go

133
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:27,919
hatred we sense this this is what I was alluding to in the

134
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:33,240
the sit that when we get a little bit quiet a little bit

135
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:39,720
still we can sense that hatred requires us to hold

136
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:46,200
on love is fully compatible with letting

137
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:54,919
go non-h hatred intersects with relatedly with renunciation the F flavor

138
00:34:54,919 --> 00:35:01,440
of relinquishment is is quite alien to

139
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:10,000
hate the pain the pain of

140
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:17,720
hate becoming truly sensitive to aversion to the state of aversion

141
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:24,400
sometimes there's sometimes aversion is is the best we can do in a moment but it's

142
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,640
never the last word and start to become more and more

143
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:35,760
sensitive to the pain the burden on the heart that's created by

144
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:44,079
it non-h hatred is illuminated by the teachings on on Sila on

145
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:54,920
Sila um Sila uh ethical conduct and the the

146
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:01,920
indivisibility of goodness and well-being not not

147
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:08,200
separable as much as it might look like it people are pulling a fast one on Mother

148
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:15,160
Nature looking like they're happy even amidst

149
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:25,160
shamelessness no it's not possible actually given or nervous system

150
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:36,880
and then the there are all these teachings um about love all the species of

151
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:44,480
love you know uh usually kind of Brahma Brahma

152
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:50,119
VOR and so here's here's um Ain saito's

153
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:56,680
idiosyncratic description um met loving kindness

154
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:03,480
willing something which comes forth is willing it's offering

155
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:08,720
itself compassion Corona senses something to be

156
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:14,599
protected here something to be protected so it's

157
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:19,839
quieter spread over strong

158
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,640
sensitive mudita sympathetic Joy

159
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:31,079
mingling mingling you can enter into something play

160
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:36,160
happily in it the quality of swimming body

161
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:43,280
swimming mudita in the water celebrates itself celebrates the

162
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:50,839
medium and here of course we're looking at the medium of skillful

163
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:58,280
qualities doesn't matter who where they are we light up

164
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:05,040
equinity Serene Stillness still but not rigid

165
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:11,319
gently the open wing of a bird when it's hovering sensing the

166
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:18,800
currents turbulent or quiet sensing like the wing of a great

167
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,920
bird spread over hovering wide

168
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,920
span equinity

169
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:37,720
so yes meta willingness

170
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:46,000
willingness sense of um very gentle offering da Donna it's

171
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,400
the generosity the spirit of of Donna and

172
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:58,680
compassion um something needs protection what is

173
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:05,000
vulnerable needs protection and so compassion is this

174
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:11,520
kind of strength but sensitive attuned not

175
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:21,599
intrusive and mudita the celebrating the medium of the skillful qualities

176
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:31,520
rejoicing rejoicing in that and uh unthreatened by the welfare

177
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:38,400
of others and then uh then equinity sensing

178
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,440
the currents hovering poised

179
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:53,960
open this is um a beautiful

180
00:39:53,960 --> 00:40:00,160
list and um and is meant to be not some

181
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:07,040
kind of Hallmark idealistic you know

182
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:14,359
um values that we just sort of um Elevate in some artificial way it's like

183
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:20,079
no this actually meant to be where our mind comes to rest

184
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:29,079
increasingly where does our mind rest what is the default position of our attention where where do you return to

185
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:37,680
when you're done paying attention to me or to life or to where do you go back to

186
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:43,520
what's the default position of attention when you don't need to do your

187
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:52,640
life where do you go where does the mind go and the Buddha says we train in such a way so that it

188
00:40:52,640 --> 00:41:01,318
rests with these species of love that it returns to the Brahma

189
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:07,599
voras and to do this we actually have to train in

190
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:15,000
love Buddhism you know you can get the sense that we're having to make effort every moment of every day no matter what

191
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:21,119
we're doing to be mindful to be loving to be tranquil to be patient to let go

192
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:27,000
of hate all this stuff it's too much it's too much can't I can't sustain that

193
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:34,000
effort efor we actually have to entrust our life to the momentum of good

194
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:44,599
habits and so we train in love such that hate takes much more energy than

195
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:53,079
love these places of uh dwelling are meant to be varied enough so that uh one

196
00:41:53,079 --> 00:41:59,760
of them is often a good resting place no matter what's happening in the moment

197
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,319
one of those species of Love is

198
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:12,400
medicine a a birth or death a marriage or divorce a a

199
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:18,160
war or a piece one of the Brahma

200
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:27,760
voras uh has you and like the path um Love has a

201
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:33,079
depth Dimension and a breadth Dimension and the the depth Dimension refers to

202
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:41,400
how radical love might be experienced in a moment our mind pervaded by love the

203
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:48,440
only thing of which we're aware and there are Janna you know I

204
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:55,640
this you know samade Jas meditative absorptions the Pana janas that kind of

205
00:42:55,640 --> 00:43:02,319
insight uh Jas and perhaps we need like love Jas

206
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:09,559
you know of course love can be an entry way into the the Stillness but um but

207
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:16,520
maybe we need something like that so there's depth and then breadth

208
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:23,680
how many spheres of our mind and our Behavior remain encumbered by aversion

209
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:30,240
by apathy hate and so we spread the love downward to

210
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:36,200
the depths and outward in all directions the

211
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:44,839
breath and this is Grand but not grandiose this is um not idealistic not

212
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:52,880
moralistic in fact the more loving we become the less judgmental we are of

213
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:59,440
non-l the more loving we become the less judgmental we are of

214
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:08,359
non-l so this week um you're invited to

215
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:14,000

216
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:20,839
mind and be flexible in how you meet it have to be we have to be

217
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:26,119
improvisational we have to be willing to learn to be surprised by our own minds

218
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:32,559
to be surprised by Love by Hate by all of it and this
