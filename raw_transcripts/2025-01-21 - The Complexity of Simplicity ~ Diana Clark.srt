1
00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:07,000
welcome welcome everybody nice to see you

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,599
all I'll just say those of you sitting in the back on the floor you're perfectly welcome to stay there but

3
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:21,080
you're also welcome to come up here if it's a little bit easier to not be behind chairs so you can do whatever you

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,000
please so I'd like to begin tonight by just telling a little story that's uh

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,320
captured in the early Buddhist literature and it's the story of a king

6
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,840
who had decided maybe I'll back up and say King sometimes we

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,280
can think of them they are lay people they're not monastics and they have a

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,680
lot of power of course they do and they have a lot of wealth so they just represent at least in my mind those

9
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,399
individuals have power and wealth so there's this king who uh

10
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,439
decided to renounce being a king and he was going to be a monastic underneath

11
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:12,000
the Buddha and he took the name badia

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,240
badia and so he would do what monastics do at this time of the Buddha they spend

13
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,320
time meditating and so they would be like a group of uh people practicing

14
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,640
together and they could hear him saying something like while he was

15
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:38,799
meditating and he would be if they listen they could hear he would be saying oh what happen

16
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:45,920
us oh what Bliss and so it didn't matter where

17
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,479
badia this former King now a monk uh where he was he was often doing this whether he was out underneath a tree

18
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,600
whether he was in some Hut or what just in different places he was uh saying

19
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,640
this What happiness what Bliss oh while he was meditating and so the other monks were

20
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,239
saying you know this guy budy uh clearly he's just he's not really meditating

21
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:16,640
he's just remembering his former life he must remember like how it was so great

22
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,680
to have all this power and all this wealth that clearly must be what he's uh

23
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:31,200
doing and they went to talk to the Buddha and say there's this guy budya who keeps on saying and maybe what Suka

24
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:38,239
I'll just say that word in poly is Suka it's the opposite of Dua Dua is you know

25
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:45,239
suffering and I'm going like this with my arms because it's encapsulates so such a wide range of things and Suka

26
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:52,959
also does a wide range gets translated as happiness I'm doing it as happiness and Bliss here we could say Joy some

27
00:02:52,959 --> 00:03:00,080
people could say pleasure you know Suka gets a just you know that family of things family of words to the they go

28
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,120
tell the Buddha and uh and then the Buddha says

29
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:14,760
well um ask him to come talk to me so badia goes to talk to the Buddha and the Buddha says is it true badia that even

30
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,920
in the wilderness or at the foot of a tree or in an empty dwelling you

31
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,080
frequently Express you're frequently saying Oh What happiness oh what

32
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:32,599
Bliss Bia says yes and then the Buddha says but why do

33
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:38,760
you say this and badya the former King says

34
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:46,439
formerly as the king ruling the land my guard was well organized within and

35
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:53,200
without the Royal compound without meaning like on the outside and on the inside on the inside and outside of the

36
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,680
royal compound it was well guarded it was well guarded on the

37
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,200
inside and the outside of the City and on the inside and the outside of the country it was well guarded but although

38
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,599
I was guarded and defended in this way I remained

39
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:16,440
fearful scared suspicious and

40
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,120
nervous but these days even when I'm alone in the wilderness meditating or at

41
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,320
the foot of the tree or an empty dwelling I'm not fearful I'm not scared

42
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,720
I'm not suspicious I'm not nervous I have

43
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:39,840
relaxed I Live Now unruffled and my heart free as a wild

44
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,000
deer it is for this reason that even I when I might be in the wilderness foot

45
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,320
of the tree or an empty Hut when I'm meditating I'm frequently saying Oh What happiness oh what

46
00:04:54,039 --> 00:05:01,520
Bliss there's a lot that we could unpack in this story there's a lot of things there but I want to

47
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:08,600
emphasize that it's this movement towards right he had a pretty simple life going from having all this wealth

48
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:15,680
and power that he had to protect and was feeling anxious right somebody's going to take it or maybe I

49
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:22,520
have to uh prove that I deserve this kingship and you know fix these problems

50
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:28,319
there or you know do something so people don't Revolt or whatever it might be I don't really know what Kings do but I'm

51
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:35,240
sure it's something very important so he we could say that he

52
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:41,319
just like drastically simplified his life and realize oh this is where the

53
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:47,479
ease is and often we're not noticing how much like tension there is and this kind

54
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:54,759
like this protecting in so many different ways and so we could say that

55
00:05:54,759 --> 00:06:02,520
we could maybe simplify some of the teachings in this tradition is pointing into the value of

56
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:10,240
Simplicity this is not a movement towards you know getting more and more and more not like acquiring more stuff

57
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,400
or not making things more and more complicated or you know getting more and

58
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:22,759
more uh experiences it's not about that it turns out that

59
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:28,199
it's there's these Basics that we refer to again and

60
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:34,120
again they get You Know spoken about in a number of different ways and you know

61
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,960
there's some complications right if you want to you can dig down into the sutas

62
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,479
and learn poly or you know something like this but for those of you who don't know poly

63
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:50,840
is the language that the early Buddhist literature is preserved

64
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:58,160
in so there's these Basics with this practice and we could say one being

65
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,520
present for what's actually happening

66
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,560
now not what the mind is saying and making up and fantasizing or remembering

67
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,400
or something like this but what's actually happening right

68
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:22,120
now turns out to be pretty powerful something that's simple turns out when we start to pay

69
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:29,199
attention we notice how much we're not actually here but we're elsewhere so we could say that's one

70
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:35,759
thing that it's a simple a poting to Simplicity we might even say Budd of this King when he was

71
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,440
thinking like oh what happened as what Bliss that he was just feeling into like

72
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,120
oh yeah right now I just have to be here experiencing this

73
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,759
moment I don't have to be worried about whether the kingdom next door is going

74
00:07:52,759 --> 00:08:00,479
to try to throw me o throw it over throw this Kingdom over or something like that

75
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:09,360
and then we might say a second thing first is maybe just to be present here and a second basic simple thing that we

76
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,560
return to again and again in these teachings is notice what's leading to

77
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:22,960
more freedom and what's leading to less Freedom what's leading to dooka and what's leading to Suka what's leading

78
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,639
to what words were here fearful scared suspicious nervous like what kind of

79
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:37,599
leads to that Direction and what leads to well-being and ease peace

80
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:45,399
freedom Awakening and so part of the practice is to just be sensitive and notice

81
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:52,600
this and then this gets you know fleshed out in so many different ways but we could kind of boil it down to just this

82
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,920
simpleness we don't have to adopt some beliefs instead there's this invitation

83
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:05,200
like oh good go figure this out for yourself go experience it for yourself don't don't take what my word or Dharma

84
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,399
teacher's word for what's being said here but maybe what's gets said here what you hear whether it's in drma talks

85
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:20,480
drma books dma friends test it out for yourself by being present and noticing

86
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,000
what's leads to more ease and what leads to less [Music]

87
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:34,480
ease so you could say that this practice so much is about letting go of what's

88
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:43,000
extra letting go of you know some of these complications quote unquote that we like to do and maybe an example could

89
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,959
be something maybe you are um attending a potluck I'm just this example and

90
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:55,640
let's say that you show up and you forgot to bring something not that this person actually

91
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:01,640
ever did that no I have I have showed up like oh whoops shoot I was supposed to to bring I left it back at

92
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:07,720
home so let's say you show up and like oh no I forgot this uh dish that I was

93
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,720
going to bring and I was going to share with others and then the mind we could do

94
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:21,160
something like oh I can't believe I forgot it I'm forgetting so many things maybe dementia is setting in and yeah

95
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:26,399
cuz I forgot where my keys were the other day and like maybe what am I going to do about this maybe I should go talk

96
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:32,079
to that my friend she knows a lot of medical stuff she would know yeah but the last time I talked to her she kind

97
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:37,360
of looked at me a little bit weird and now I'm not sure that I want to reach out to her and okay well maybe I should

98
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:46,680
go have therapy because clearly I'm like so messed up and you write the mind right just can go just can go we make

99
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,839
stories there is not a lot of freedom when we get stuck in those stories I don't want to demonize them and say it

100
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:59,839
wrong it's a human tendency to do this and this practice is how we just

101
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:06,800
recognize like oh yeah this is the mind's habit we don't have to believe everything it's saying we don't have to

102
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:13,839
go off and uh let it push us around and do things that uh it's uh trying to tell

103
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:19,560
us that we have to do precisely then but maybe an alternative when you

104
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,959
realize that you forgot something bring into a potluck is just recognize oh yeah

105
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:32,000
this this feels uncomfortable yeah I I really wanted to share this

106
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,519
with others now I can't share it yeah and now I'm going to be here and

107
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:44,399
maybe everybody else bought something and I didn't and I'm going to feel a little bit uncomfortable there it's going to be a little bit

108
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,120
awkward I don't like to feel awkward feels awkward to imagine I'm

109
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:57,480
going to feel awkward and then maybe there's this way

110
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:04,000
that uh oh yeah I can maybe when you notice this to you could like oh yeah my mind wants to make me into a terrible

111
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,240
person because I forgot but you know people forget things and I forgot things

112
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,279
I forgot this can that be

113
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:19,519
okay and then maybe you depends the event go to the host and say and I

114
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:25,800
apologize you know I really wanted to bring this I was looking forward to sharing this with others and now I'm

115
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:32,040
showing up empty-handed I I hope that's okay and if it's not okay the host is going

116
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:39,000
to tell you nope sorry and if it is okay they're going to say oh don't worry about it there's always always so much

117
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,199
food here we're just happy you're here and there you're done right it's

118
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:50,199
not a big complicated thing it doesn't have to be worrying about our mental health or what things that we should do

119
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:57,360
or something like this so this idea can we just be with what's happening including feeling the

120
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,720
uncomfortableness of when we forget to bring something when we don't do something we say we're

121
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:09,800
going to do it's human nature to forget things

122
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:17,600
it's also human nature to not want to feel uncomfortable but we do we do feel

123
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:25,600
uncomfortable maybe we could say part of this practice is to feel comfortable with not being feel feeling comfortable

124
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,120
with being uncomfortable

125
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:36,560
so maybe I can point out that there's this way of pointing to Simplicity of

126
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:43,079
just being with what's actually happening in this

127
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:48,399
moment and then this other moment just returning

128
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,959
again planning will happen taking care of things will happen

129
00:13:53,959 --> 00:14:00,000
thinking that we have to figure things out it's going to happen but can we just

130
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,560
be present with feeling the pressure of the chair or the cushion against the

131
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,120
body hearing of this voice this

132
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,360
moment feeling your feet on the

133
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:24,639
ground this is always available this is always available the

134
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,959
Simplicity of what's Happening Here don't worry you will take care of the

135
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:35,399
things that need to be taken care of there's a part of us that thinks like oh no no no I have to go figure this out

136
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:41,720
and a lot of the figuring it out is just a distraction from feeling

137
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:48,920
uncomfortable so this idea of just simplifying just

138
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:58,199
simplifying because simplifying really supports a sense of contentment and a sense of well-being

139
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:07,360
and it's not that this practice is only about chasing contentment and well-being or chasing good

140
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:15,040
feelings but there's this way in which if we have a certain amount of ease it's much easier

141
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:23,440
to not get uh it's much easier for the the wisest version of ourselves to show

142
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,639
up and to maybe like see the bigger picture and not get caught up on small

143
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:35,040
things that are happening that maybe aren't so helpful that turn

144
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,920
out to be extra all of us probably have this sense

145
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:49,000
of relief uh if there's a let's say for example there's a a drawer in the

146
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,160
house a lot of households have like the junk drawer you open up if you can open

147
00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:00,759
it up like sometimes there just so much stuff in there you open it up and there's like this mess in there and then for whatever reason you feel like okay

148
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:06,160
you know what there something needs to be done with this and you just clean it up and organize and throw things out and

149
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,720
like oh wow here's this I had thought seen this for a while you know this kind of stuff and then you organize it maybe

150
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:18,800
you donate some of it maybe you fix the thing that was broken that got shoved in there whatever it is there's a sense of

151
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,319
like ah that feels good right kind of like when there's a little bit of a when

152
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:29,720
a mess is gets have some semblance of organization to it when it gets kind of

153
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:37,160
like simplified in some kind of way we all have this experience of what a good feeling it is this relief when things

154
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:43,839
that seem messy get simplified so this movement towards

155
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:51,759
making things simpler simpler whether it's our actual experience we make them

156
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:58,160
simpler by just being with the experience of the moment which I'm

157
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,240
pointing to the body the usually the bodily experiences or the simplification

158
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:10,558
is It's usually the mind that is uh making things more complicated or maybe there's this way in

159
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:17,678
which we just find ourselves being busy a lot doing one thing after another it's not uncommon for it to feel

160
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:24,079
like you know being busy is a spadge of Honor semblance of how important we are and how people need us or something like

161
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,600
this to be busy

162
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,640
so this pointing towards [Music] Simplicity this movement towards

163
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,200
Simplicity because it's supports well-being and

164
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:47,760
ease but there's also an unhelpful side of

165
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:56,640
Simplicity there's this way in which it can be really help with tremendous support and then there's a way in which

166
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:02,360
there a certain type a certain way in which we might do doe Simplicity turns out to not be helpful

167
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:07,559
at all in fact kind of like take us away from greater peace and

168
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:13,799
ease and that is when we bring this idea of Simplicity or this wish to make

169
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:19,200
things less complicated in some way and that uh supports us kind of propels us

170
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:27,640
into having this dichotomous thinking or this way in which we have

171
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:33,039
this um just bifurcated thinking okay there's

172
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:38,799
good and bad there's only two things and if it's not in the good it's

173
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:44,080
in the bad or if it's in the bad it's certainly not anything good about it

174
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:50,280
there's this way in which we can have this polarized thing like things are

175
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:55,760
either you know at the ends of if we wanted to say a spectrum there's nothing

176
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:05,840
in the middle there's no nuances or gradation it's just good or bad right or wrong yes

177
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:12,240
or no you know these ways we do this this is a simplification and often humans we like

178
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:19,919
to do this when sometimes when we're feeling uncomfortable like oh that's

179
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,880
bad they are bad and this over here is good and we

180
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,960
are good this terrible thing that can happen when

181
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,600
we do this this way in which there's like yeah

182
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:42,960
we know what's right and all those knuckleheads over there I don't know there they clearly don't know what's

183
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:51,039
right yeah we got it all figured out and you guys I don't know you have some problems clearly right it's this

184
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:57,840
sense and then as soon as that starts to show up and Us Versus Them me versus the

185
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:04,760
world versus you then this is where nervousness and

186
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:11,799
anxiousness and fear and scared comes in in a subtle way in some ways we like to

187
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:19,320
have this self-righteous feeling like yeah we know what it is but it also requires in a subtle way that we're not

188
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:24,679
paying attention to there's so much data about this how

189
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:30,240
humans they will like just um ignore information that doesn't support the

190
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,640
sense that they are the good guys and everybody else is the bad guys they will just like completely ignore and forget

191
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:40,720
it or they'll make up some Twisted logic to explain away something that doesn't

192
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:47,840
quite work this simplification is not the way

193
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:53,799
forward it's never quite like this that we are the good guys and they are the

194
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:58,960
bad guys how could it be humans we are we

195
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,640
have complexities we have ranges of things in our

196
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,720
life and so ear earlier I was talking

197
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:15,440
about Dua versus Suka like leading to well-being and not leading to well-being

198
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:22,240
this also is kind of you could say is a dichotomy and a bifurcation but it's this is pointing to

199
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:30,600
like what leads to Greater freedom and ease and what doesn't that's different than this

200
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:36,960
person is a good person that person is a bad person this what leads to Greater ease

201
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:45,039
is for all of us to discover there doesn't have to be a value judgment on an individual or a group of

202
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,640
individuals but when we start to have like these binary perspectives

203
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:59,279
about ourselves and others it's a way in which there's

204
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:05,520
this we kind of like let go of any idea that there things could be new uh the

205
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:12,720
Nuance of things or we let go of things that are that uh not

206
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:19,200
extremes and uh there's somebody on YouTube that sometimes says yeah yeah

207
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:26,240
I'm the alt middle like this feeling right you know just the fact just to be in the middle

208
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:33,640
is a is to be an alternative inad instead of a on these ends of these political

209
00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:41,600
spectrums and there's something that happened to me uh a number of years ago that had a really big impact uh on me

210
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:47,159
regarding this and I want to share this little story when I was in graduate

211
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:53,120
school it's uh common and like in the sciences and probably in other fields

212
00:22:53,120 --> 00:23:00,919
too that uh we would get together and discuss the latest literature you know the latest findings and every week the

213
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:07,200
the students and the professors would get together and we would choose one paper and we would uh evaluate the

214
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,720
experiments that were done and the data and how they interpreted the data and stuff like this right just to keep a

215
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:20,279
breast of the field and to learn about what other uh Laboratories are doing so this had such a big impact on

216
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:26,120
me that I remember this that uh we were looking at the paper that was discussing

217
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:31,159
preons some of you might remember there was mad cow disease this was uh in the

218
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:37,559
early uh 90s and I remember in the UK they had to like kill all their cattle or something

219
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:43,440
like this it was like a it was a really big deal and it was um people were dying humans were dying and the cattle were

220
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,480
dying and people didn't understand and we were looking at this paper that was

221
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:56,120
talking about prons which is like a novel infectious agent that has this novel mechanism of action not a not a

222
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:04,120
virus not a bacteria nothing like this it was something completely new that we had never heard of before but all of us

223
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:12,360
I remember us reading this paper that was published in the most prestigious Journal we were making fun of them we

224
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:18,919
were laughing at them oh my gosh they did this experiment but they interpreted this way oh my gosh I can't believe it

225
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:26,320
clearly this data really points to that we just couldn't get our minds around that something new was happening and

226
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:34,360
right we were all scienti that were had dedicated Our Lives to trying to help cure human diseases smart people that

227
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:39,919
were just you know trying to work things think about things and work with it but

228
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:46,799
we had this this bias that here's something new that we hadn't thought of before we hadn't seen before and it

229
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:53,279
clearly was wrong and we were mean I remember in this we were the people that

230
00:24:53,279 --> 00:25:00,320
weren't in the room but were like oh my gosh I can't believe how did they get this published it blah blah blah

231
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:07,320
the person won the Nobel Prize a few years later for this right but we were

232
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:12,640
like so sure of ourselves because I of just something

233
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,960
different and so this made me really realize all these times in which I think like okay I clearly know and all my

234
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:26,919
friends clearly know too we're all in the same maybe we don't maybe we don't know

235
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:32,480
maybe we're not so sure so when we get into this dichotomous thinking like okay we're the good guys

236
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,399
and those are the bad guys Maybe not maybe it's not so clear maybe there's

237
00:25:38,399 --> 00:25:44,440
something that we don't know yet or maybe yeah we just don't

238
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:50,720
know and it's not the way forward it's not the way forward instead in order to

239
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:57,080
help us support that we're the good guys and they're the bad guys that uh this kind of gross

240
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:03,039
simplification that and we have to start attributing all kinds of terrible stuff to whenever they do something good and

241
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:08,200
helpful we have to dismiss it or say oh they only did that because their motives

242
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:14,559
must have been something terrible or something like this and we have to dismiss when our motives turn out to be

243
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,679
not very good or something like

244
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:25,640
this so there's a poem that points to this that's not by Rosemary

245
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:34,000
traumer surpris I'm often citing her poems this uh poem that I I it's a short

246
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,240
poem that I found really powerful really powerful it's by yakuda

247
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:46,720
amahai I think I'm pronouncing that correctly and it's translated by Byron

248
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:53,919
Kat's husband Steven Mitchell it's by yahuda amahai and it's

249
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:59,240
called the place where we are right

250
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:07,120
from the place where we are right flowers will never grow in the

251
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:14,360
spring the place where we are right is hard and trampled like a

252
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,559
yard but doubts and loves dig up the

253
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:26,559
world like a mole a plow and a whisper will be heard in the

254
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:31,278
place where the ruined house once

255
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:39,200
stood I'll read it again the place where we are

256
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:46,679
right from by uh Yuda amahai from the place where we are right

257
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:53,320
flowers will never grow in the spring the place where we are right is

258
00:27:53,320 --> 00:28:02,720
hard and trampled like a yard but doubts and loves dig up the world

259
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:08,480
like a mole a plow and a whisper will be heard in the

260
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,679
place where the ruined house once

261
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:22,720
stood right in this place where we are right implicit in that is there's that

262
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,120
other place where you are wrong if we have we are right this place then there

263
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,360
there's that other place where they are wrong and this creates the conditions

264
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,559
for fear and hatred for those people that are wrong over

265
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:44,519
there this is not a world we want to live in that's full of fear and hatred and this is what happens when we're

266
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:52,640
making this uh they're wrong over there I'm not saying that everything they're doing is perfect I'm saying the simplification of

267
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,720
we are right and you are wrong is not the way forward

268
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:07,840
I love that this line but doubts and loves dig up the world like a mole a

269
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:14,880
plow so doubts maybe there's like this room for H I'm not so sure it seems like

270
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:21,640
this right now this is what makes sense to me I think this is I my

271
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:29,200
understanding I can't see any other way to interpret it but this way this is my current hypothesis but this is very diff

272
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:35,080
all these things I'm saying are alternatives to I'm right you can say there's when there's doubts there's this

273
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:40,360
feeling you know this makes sense to me but it's leaving some room for like

274
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:46,398
well maybe there's some other data I'll have or something else that I'll learn that'll make a

275
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:54,519
difference and the poet is saying like a mole so moles

276
00:29:54,519 --> 00:30:00,760
are quiet underneath unseen sometimes we think like oh these are

277
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:07,480
pests and if you're a gardener you might think that they're pests but they also serve a really important function right

278
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:13,880
they are underneath like breaking up the soil and ating the soil they're important they're an important part of

279
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:21,360
like the ecosystem but they were underneath kind of like invisible breaking up the soil

280
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:28,039
and then there's plows that are like on the top of the soil they doing the same thing like breaking them up and this is

281
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:34,200
like very intentional a farmer or somebody who wants to cultivate a particular plant for example like

282
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:43,799
intentionally goes in and has a plow also from above so this way that

283
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:49,600
that place that gets hard and trampled like you know when I think the the poem

284
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:56,919
the poem has this word um the place where we are right is hard and trampled like a

285
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:02,600
yard I'm thinking like School yards prison yards you know this place where

286
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:09,200
there's a lot of uh people trampling maybe behaving in so many

287
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,919
different ways but the ways that they get broken up and

288
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:20,600
where the trampling doesn't lead to hardness and

289
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:26,880
stuckness is with things coming from below and things from coming above moles

290
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:33,279
and plows and it might be that some individuals

291
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:38,480
maybe in the world out in the world not just in their personal life but out in the world they want

292
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:44,279
to they feel like yeah there's something that's not right and I want to make a difference maybe they are people who

293
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:53,480
will be like plows who will in an obvious way break up the soil they will make big

294
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,559
changes and then maybe there will be people who are in the

295
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:04,480
in the greater world who are just quietly like the moles

296
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:10,240
underneath just breaking up the soil and air rating and allowing the soil to make

297
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,039
room for flowers where flowers you know something beautiful

298
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:22,559
and um of course an essential part of plant's life cycle but maybe there's

299
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:27,960
some happiness or joy and flowers

300
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:35,760
so whether this we're talking about um we are right and they are

301
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:41,760
wrong maybe there's something that we feel like oh there's I I don't want to

302
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:48,240
say that everybody's right and everything is perfectly fine I just don't want us to simplify

303
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:55,240
things and just slap a label on them and then be dismissive of them but if we feel like oh there's

304
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:01,760
something that could be better that could be changed that uh maybe needs needs something maybe it's clear to us

305
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:08,760
what is needed then maybe there's some obvious thing that we can do in the

306
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:14,240
world or maybe we're the type of person I I happen to be one of these type of

307
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,600
people I'm a little bit more quiet and introverted and I'm a little bit more kind of like underneath trying to like

308
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:26,840
plant seeds breaking up soil and I kind of view giving dermat talks is this is

309
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:36,200
my way of like okay maybe this is a way in which can help uh create the conditions in which uh new things can

310
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:41,840
grow which uh something new can happen so that the yard isn't just hard and

311
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,158
trampled in this place where we are

312
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:54,639
right because there's a RAC you know there's these um Awakening

313
00:33:54,639 --> 00:34:01,080
factors these uh qualities that have we all have that really support

314
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:08,440
Awakening investigation is one of them investigation this looking into

315
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:15,919
getting curious about engaging with we need

316
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:22,200
that that's different than we are right they are

317
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:28,440
wrong and today of course is MLK Day

318
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:34,200
Martin Luther Dr Martin Luther King Jr he was in his way working with uh the

319
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:40,398
ways that there was just terrible terrible oppression of people it's so so many

320
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:46,960
terrible things happening and in his own way he was trying to address this let's not just say okay black people are this

321
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,760
way and white people are that way or simplifying things in that

322
00:34:53,720 --> 00:35:00,599
way so as humans we like to simplify things it feels better and sometimes it

323
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:06,119
feels better in the short term to say like oh they're wrong but it

324
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:13,760
also kind of creates the conditions in which there's this

325
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,680
um way in which then we have to be always supporting like they are wrong

326
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:25,520
and I'm right and maybe like this uh King in the beginning of the story he

327
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:32,400
had this certain amount of anxiety or I'll just say in my own experience as

328
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:38,720
soon as like I make other people like they're wrong then I'm afraid of them like I feel like I have to get away from

329
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,880
them I don't want to be near

330
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:52,319
them and then I stop like listening or respecting or caring

331
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:59,119
about hatred never ends with hatred

332
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:05,119
this is an ancient law in the dapa and Martin Luther King

333
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:11,240
said a version of this hatred never ends with hatred how could

334
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:21,000
it so maybe the complexity of Simplicity it can be simple in terms of coming to

335
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:28,400
what our experience is not no not getting lost in what's

336
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:35,720
extra noticing what's extra and but not allowing our to

337
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:41,280
simplify things into where we are just uh slapping a label on people or

338
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,319
ourselves and then just thinking that's sufficient and not really being present

339
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:54,319
for what's happening or being Nuance recognizing nuance and complexity that's

340
00:36:54,319 --> 00:36:58,200
there with people

341
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,839
maybe I'll read this poem one more

342
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:12,839
time the place where we are right by Yehuda

343
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:20,359
amahai from the place where we are right flowers will never grow in the

344
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:27,920
spring the place where we are right is hard and trampled like a yard

345
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:34,400
but doubts and loves dig up the world like a mole a

346
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:42,799
plow and a whisper will be heard in the place where the ruined house once

347
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:49,920
stood so I'll end there and I'll open it up to see if there are any questions or

348
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,838
comments thank you

349
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,359
any comments or

350
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:32,800
questions well di yes you're thank you for your talk it reminded me I used to

351
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:40,359
have a poster in my office that said everything should be made as simple as possible but not

352
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:45,400
simpler there you go it's by Albert Einstein nice okay there you go there

353
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:50,480
you go but not

354
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,560
simpler yeah

355
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:10,319
um I'm not sure I got the last line uh in the meaning is the ruined house the

356
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:16,119
are destroyed preconceptions yeah this is such a thank you Jay this is a good question and a

357
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:21,520
whisper will be heard in the place where the ruined house once

358
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:27,400
stood um you know it's this is how I'm interpreting it it's well actually

359
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:34,560
should ask you do you have an interpreting that the ruined house is that's where I went meaning like once I give up all that like all my

360
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:40,839
preconceived notions which is the bad house or if you want to think of it that way then I'll hear the true Inner Voice

361
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:45,960
come through and that's the whisper that I'm hearing for you know it's always the the true voice is hard to hear so the

362
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:52,960
whisper from me I'm reading it that way I know if that's yeah yeah I like it I like it I was also thinking that uh the

363
00:39:52,960 --> 00:40:00,480
shouting will have stopped so then you can hear a whisper also right you know people yeah I I I I was like thought

364
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:07,160
well there's a number of ways I could go with this or I don't know if there's some other ways too probably have you

365
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:13,079
read his uh his translation of T Chang um you know I read that so many years

366
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:21,480
ago but it's so it's not in my head now he has one of the best translations for the T JS y y okay thank you Stephen

367
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:26,560
Mitchell translating the da ching and I apparently he done translates a number

368
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:35,318
of different languages so I didn't know this any other

369
