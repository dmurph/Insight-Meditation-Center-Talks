3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,320
um time our presence supporting each other

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,359
in this practice so i thank you all of you for showing up

5
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:30,080
uh whether it's in real time or whether later you're listening to this on audio

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,600
dharma so so for today's practice i wanted to

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:44,719
to bring our attention um to to practice that sometimes we um engage

8
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,640
with here and and happier and i i think they did last a week and

9
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,000
and someone um uh said that oh if we did

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,399
appreciation turning our mind turning our awareness to

11
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,960
to what's good what we often don't take uh in fully in

12
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:16,159
what is good i could do that forever so i thought okay maybe for a while i'll do that once a week at least

13
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,840
as i teach happy hour three times a week maybe once a week we'll engage with the

14
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,720
um heart lifting practice of of joy of joy joy and

15
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:36,000
which can show up in different ways gratitude can lead to joy vicarious joy happiness for happiness of others

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,320
can lead to joy appreciation for what's good about ourselves about others about

17
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,439
um cause and conditions about the world so there's so many ways

18
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:54,799
to to turn our hearts and minds towards what's good towards what's joyous and as

19
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:01,280
i said before again it's not in a way to to just be pollyanna's la de da yeah i'm

20
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:08,560
just going to be you know turn a blind eye to what's challenging the world quite the opposite actually

21
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,319
if we have a reservoir of joy of gladness

22
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:21,120
it serves us it helps us to face and be with what's difficult

23
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,879
more easily for ourselves and for the world so

24
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:33,680
it's it's not an avoidance it's actually a way of balancing it's a

25
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:41,519
way of balancing the 10 000 sorrows of the world with the 10 000 joys because they're it's all

26
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,920
present it's all here but we often because of our evolutionary

27
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,680
um conditioning uh we often turn to what's challenging

28
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,959
what's difficult what's not going right and we ignore

29
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,480
we just don't see as if we have blinders on

30
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:11,120
we get accustomed too easily to what's actually really really wonderful

31
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,560
really amazing [Music]

32
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,599
my paraphrase sam harris he has a quote about

33
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:27,040
you know when something really really catastro catastrophic happens in our

34
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,560
lives we and and any of us in some ways we're

35
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:40,480
just a phone call away perhaps from you know bad news from a doctor or difficult um diagnosis

36
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:48,080
you know we never know what's going to happen in the future but at those times we turn back we turn back and think oh

37
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,720
when time when life was normal when life was normal or normal enough

38
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:02,159
normal enough and consider this is when life is normal or normal

39
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:10,080
enough of course you might be dealing with challenges but of course what i'm saying i'm offering it in general ways

40
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,920
when life is normal enough and instead our minds when life is

41
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:22,240
normal enough it it turns to finding fault with what seems boring gosh it's

42
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:29,040
boring nothing is happening in my life or everything that we want everything that

43
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,960
we lack that oh if i had that i would be happier or i would be happy if

44
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,160
so and so and x y and z were in place instead of turning our minds not to say

45
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:47,440
we give up our aspirations of course keep your aspirations aspirations for

46
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:55,040
continuing to develop continuing to serve in the best way you can is being who is

47
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,800
you and all beings everywhere continue to aspire for the best

48
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,080
being you can be and let go of the the

49
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,360
the clinging

50
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,720
if i only had that if i only there's a very different feeling between

51
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,320
clinging which has an ouch to it which is kind of painful

52
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:30,080
versus aspiration that that lifts the heart that inspires that motivates

53
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,800
so i've said plenty and more will come more will come of

54
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,560
course with the guided meditation and whether you're new to this practice whether you're new to

55
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,840
happy hour whatever you need to know will be shared with you so [Music]

56
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:55,600
relax enjoy the ride so at this time having set the frame

57
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,639
for our practice a bit tonight i'd like to

58
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:07,919

59
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:15,720

aliveness here here

64
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,479
as always we start with just

65
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,000
sitting being breathed

66
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,720
sitting and being breathed

67
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,960
with each breath softening

68
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,280
releasing releasing the body

69
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:29,360
releasing thoughts releasing into what is here right now

70
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,720
however it is not wanting it to be otherwise

71
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,520
even if there is unpleasantness in the body or mind pleasant

72
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,639
can we release into it release into

73
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,960
the totality the spaciousness

74
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,840
greater larger more spacious

75
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,360
all encompassing

76
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,839
letting awareness connect with the breath the entirety of the breath

77
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:08,480
sweet comforting breath however it shows up however it's

78
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,920
breathed in the body

79
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,800
if there are a lot of thoughts

80
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,519
distractions might be helpful to attend to become aware of the breath

81
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:36,760
in the lower abdomen that can help settle ground

82
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,640
us

83
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:56,720
as if deep in our belly in our lower abdomen

84
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,800
deep resonances of the breath calming soothing

85
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,200
settling

86
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,480
when your thoughts are arising it's okay

87
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,079
smilingly smilingly

88
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,760
without any judgment release let go

89
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,839
as if blowing on flower petals

90
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,199
gently gently come back later

91
00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:01,120
giving my heart to this practice right now and letting the sensations of the body

92
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,040
and the breath be center stage

93
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,600
calming soothing

94
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,920
you

95
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:03,920
you

96
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,040
the buddha says whatever free will you frequently think

97
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,880
and ponder upon that becomes the inclination of your

98
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,880
mind so instead of

99
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,880
pondering pondering upon what is lacking what is

100
00:14:52,160 --> 00:15:01,600
missing what we want want want endless desires

101
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:08,399
with clinging and grasping let us turn and ponder upon

102
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:18,000
the goodness the goodness in our lives

103
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:26,720
the sources of goodness and let us first turn

104
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:34,360
to the goodness within our intentions our aspirations

105
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:43,680
for loving caring being kind

106
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,000
being generous being of service

107
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,319
being truthful not causing harm

108
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,079
whatever your values might be

109
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:13,040
taking a moment to perhaps touch into the top three

110
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:21,120
if there are more rising it's okay feel feel the goodness

111
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,320
the wholesomeness of these intentions in your heart

112
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:38,720
this is not a time for judgment and thinking of all the ways you lack

113
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,759
but to bring attention awareness to connect

114
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,880
with your goodness

115
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:58,800
the wholesomeness the more we connect with the wholesomeness the more it will increase

116
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,399
becomes the inclination of our minds

117
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:15,720
what inspires you what inspires you

118
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,799
now i would like to invite you

119
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:37,799
to imagine [Music] an earlier version of yourself

120
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:49,520
in some ways this earlier version maybe a few years ago or decade ago

121
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,840
this earlier version of you

122
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:01,280
in some ways we could consider

123
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,000
a better earlier our younger self

124
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:15,760
has sent us into the future in some ways we are

125
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,520
the progeny the the child

126
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:30,720
of this younger version of ourselves we are living the hopes and dreams the

127
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:37,039
aspirations the goodnesses

128
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,158
of a younger version of ourselves

129
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,559
our younger version might have had challenges gifts

130
00:20:53,200 --> 00:21:01,400
can we have a sense of gratitude as if we were turning turning around in time

131
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,440
i'm thanking an earlier version of ourselves

132
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,720
a younger version of ourselves

133
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,840
for their dedication for their perseverance

134
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,440
for hanging in there for their cultivation

135
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,000
maybe for their hard work

136
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,120
maybe for setting the direction so that we are right now

137
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,880
practicing the dharma there was something about this younger

138
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,640
version of ourselves some aspiration for goodness

139
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,760
maybe it was their suffering maybe it was their sorrow their

140
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:11,120
challenge that drove them [Music]

141
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:18,880
that inspired them to seek to seek practice to seek

142
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,760
meditation to see community

143
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:38,760
can we turn around and with an open heart appreciate and think

144
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:51,919
our younger selves again this is not a time for

145
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:58,960
self-judgment but intend to turn your mind your heart

146
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,480
to goodness you can choose appreciation goodness

147

148
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:27,919

149
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,240

awesome words

160
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:57,440

161
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:04,919
their goodness their wholesome actions deeds

162

now i'd like to invite you to imagine

174
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,278
the future version of yourself

175

176
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:51,679
but for the purpose of this exercise this practice

177
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,840
imagine yourself some time into the future

178
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:06,840
and this future being future cell

179
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,640

233
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,760
might have come up from your own benefit the benefit of

234
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:31,599
others offering them as gifts you can type them in chat

235
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:37,520
if only type to me privately i won't read your name just your reflection

236
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:43,200
and if it's typed to everyone i'll read your name you can also raise your hand

237
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:50,800
fazel am i saying your name right um it's it's fuzzling

238
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:57,040
um yeah so i've made a lot of mistakes in the past and i've

239
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,320
actually i've been doing the five contemplations every day

240
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:08,079
and it's kind of like thinking about how those affect my current situation so this is like a

241
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:16,079
nice balance that was very nice thank you hmm thanks to the contemplation on the

242
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,760
uh you know karma from past actions yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah thank you for that i

243
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:27,280
appreciate you bringing that in because with the five contemplations and just to catch

244
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:34,240
people up the fifth one for anyone who's not familiar with is um

245
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:40,560
acknowledging that i am the owner of my actions

246
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:45,760
i'm the owner of my actions my actions are

247
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:53,920
my arbitrator and protection and we often as you said we focus on the

248
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:01,520
negative reverberations of our actions and it's just as important to focus on

249
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:09,680
the positive to balance it with the positive and not just in the past but in the present that yes i'm the owner of my

250
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:16,240
actions and i have to say that with the five contemplations the fifth one is for me for different people different ones

251
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,839
are really alive and for me all of them but especially the fifth one wow i'm the owner

252
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:27,440
of my actions whatever do whatever i do for good or

253
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:34,640
for evil i am the owner i am born of my actions

254
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:41,599
i'm heir to my actions it's such a rich contemplation so so i appreciate you

255
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:49,280
yeah realizing oh yes bringing the goodness like yes if i do goodness in the world that's going to percolate

265
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:56,960
now i will say okay one more catherine

266
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:03,520
um i just had a really sweet experience of

267
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:08,720
seeing myself through my younger self's eyes and being like

268
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:16,000
i would be so proud of myself it brought tears of joy to just be like

269
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,359
oh my younger self would be really into who i am now

270
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:32,319
sweet sweet thanks so much for sharing that yeah that is very very yeah beautiful

271
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:39,680
yeah to connect yeah thanks for sharing that katrin yeah

272
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:49,440
yeah um [Music] so a couple of questions are coming so i'll

273
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,720
answer the questions that and then i'd like to go into the um

274
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:01,839
practice into the groups and reserve time at the end so one question that's coming up is how

275
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:07,599
to fit with contemplation of death yeah both and

276
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:13,359
both and as i said when i let this contemplation

277
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:19,040
future is uncertain we don't know what's going to happen tomorrow we don't know what's going to happen the next moment

278
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:26,400
absolutely and yet there is there is both and we don't just give

279
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:32,400
away and stop doing cultivation because we might we'll die we

280
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,680
live fully we live completely giving our gifts into the future knowing

281
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:44,720
that life can end at any moment so we have to be able to hold really complexity both this moment could be my

282
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:51,839
last breath and oh yeah i might live another decade and how what do i want to send into the future

283
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:58,400
another reflection on youtube that i really struggled with this meditation

284
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:04,240
anger seems to arise on me so how can i appreciate my goodness yeah

285
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:11,119
in this case might be need the need for forgiveness practice

286
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:17,760
forgiveness practice for forgiving self in the past for

287
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:23,680
forgiving letting go letting go and maybe even turning to

288
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:29,359
the self that is struggling right now with compassion with compassion

289
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:35,200
to the self that's really angry right now to hold this present self with compassion and

290
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:40,800
make some room make some room with kindness with kindness

291
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:47,119
so i do see your hand clear but i would like to turn right now to the to small groups so that we don't

292
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:54,560
run out of time so with small groups um i like to spend a little bit of time

293
00:44:54,560 --> 00:45:00,640
setting them up and asking you first of all the reason where

294
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:07,760
we go we practice in small groups is to bring our practice from the cushion from

295
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:14,240
our eyes closed meet others meet the world in the space

296
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:20,319
of practice in the space of kindness the space of tenderness it's not about

297
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:25,520
impressing them it's not about educating them it's not about

298
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:32,800
managing other people's experience or facilitating the group please only

299
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:39,119
speak from your own authentic experience not commenting not probing

300
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:45,280
um others and holding silent

301
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:50,400
space for yourself and for others when your turn comes you can say pass or you

302
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,760
can share a nugget and please share one nugget we're gonna do the

303
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:03,440
format that's called the spiral so instead of a long monologue you share if you have five nuggets you only share one

304
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:08,560
one nugget one thing that came up for you then you pass it on to the next person

305
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:15,280
they might say past they might share one nugget one thought then the third person and then it comes back to you and then

306
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:21,920
you go around around a few times sharing from your own experience and sharing

307
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:27,200
holding space with kindness

308
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:33,040
for each other it's not just go and talk amongst yourself it's a very sacred space it's a

309
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:38,800
very it's a ritualistic way of participating this way

310
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:46,400
so with that i'm going to create the rooms and invite you to uh

311
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:51,920
be kind to yourself take care of yourself take care of others

312
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:58,400
let there be a lot of um yeah care let there be a lot of care

313
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:04,240
so so i'm going to open the room take care be kind

314
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:09,280
here we go welcome back everyone we have just about

315
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:14,319
a minute or two for any reflections that might have come up

316
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:19,710
during your practice in sangha you're welcome to ru to um

317
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:25,839
[Music] raise your hand or type in chat

318
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:40,640
bill hey uh i wanted to ask a question

319
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:47,599
and maybe the answer would be too long to fit in at the hour but i'm gonna ask it anyway we we talked

320
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:53,599
about you know aspiration at what point does aspiration become striving

321
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:59,839
because there seems like there's a gray area there where i aspire for things but i really want these things you know i

322
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:05,760
