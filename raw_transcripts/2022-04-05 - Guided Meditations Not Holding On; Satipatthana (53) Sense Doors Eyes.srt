1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,600
so hello everyone and

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,960
i'm happy to be here and and to be heard

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:22,240
i think we have the sound equipment everything working again

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,760
so um it gives me the

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,680
luxury of repeating myself which i don't like to do so much but

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,480
i'll say what i said yesterday that you didn't hear

7
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:47,600
so imagine that you're going down a creek someplace in a canoe

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,000
and there's a wonderful gentle pleasant current which is just carrying you

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,440
to your destination where you're going

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,880
but it's a narrow creek and lots of trees uh on the bank and overhanging and

11
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,280
and as you go down it's easy to reach out and touch the branches and even hold on to

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,479
the branches above to the side and you have a passenger you have someone along with you on the trip

13
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:26,799
but this person every occasion reaches out to hold on to a branch

14
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:33,759
and holds it for a while until the canoe stops and then let's go and you go a little bit further and hold on

15
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:42,000
and you go and hold on and you go and and in this way it takes a really long time to get anywhere and

16
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:49,759
so um this is an analogy how we can be in our lives then for now we'll look at it in

17
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:56,320
terms of meditation that there's a current that we're in the current of the present moment

18
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,600
that's always occurring that in a sense the future

19
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,520
comes into the present and flows into the past and the present moment is where

20
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,560
we witness this constant change constant transformation

21
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,319
and this unfolding of time and

22
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:24,080
and we could stay there in that current and let it take us where it goes

23
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,200
or we could hold on to the branches and the branches are our thoughts our

24
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:36,959
ideas our feelings that we hold onto and end up having retrospective thinking

25
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,160
something happens and we start thinking about it and then that's holding on to the branch we've lost we're not in the

26
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,440
current anymore or we start thinking about something that is completely unrelated in the past

27
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,480
or in the future the past branches the future branches

28
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,519
or we start making uh commentaries and stories and judgments about what's in

29
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:04,480
the present and those are commentary branches and story branches judgment branches

30
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,560
and as soon as we hold on to them we're no longer flowing in the current

31
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,000
and in meditation we're teaching ourselves training cells to stay in the current

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,400
and not to hold on to anything that interrupts our ability to stay present for what's happening in the

33
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,720
present moment and one place to train ourselves in this is in

34
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,640
the breathing it could be with other things could be sounds all right but the breathing is a classic place to

35
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,720
train us and to consider that the that the constant flow of sensations

36
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,239
connected to breathing in the body that those are the the current of the

37
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:53,280
present moment as you experienced it physically and the idea is to be present to rest in

38
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,840
to float in those uh sensations as they flow through flow by

39
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,159
that's the place where we tap into the present moment and the constant change

40
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:12,080
and then notice when we get pulled away into thought we're holding on to a branch

41
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,519
and how there's a disconnect if we get lost too much in those thoughts

42
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,040
and the idea is to kind of stay feeling sensing resting um

43
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,280
knowing cognizant of the the current of breathing

44
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,120
the flow of sensations that come with the in-breath with the out breath wherever in the body

45
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,160
you feel the breathing it doesn't mean you have to stop thinking entirely

46
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,199
it means that the the the weight of attention

47
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,680
is on the breathing not holding on to the branch some of sometimes the breathing can just

48
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,720
be like a branch on the side of the creek that you see and it just goes by

49
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,720
maybe it brushes against even against your uh your shoulder as you go by if it's a narrow creek

50
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,840
but you don't stop for it you know it's there but you don't you're you're staying

51
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,039
and for a canoer it stays nose they're floating in the river just feels the

52
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:20,400
current stays in it and there's that's the center of gravity that's where the weight of attention is

53
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:27,919
so assuming a upright meditation posture

54
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:35,039
and gently lowering your gaze

55
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,080
to about 45 degrees to the floor

56
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:47,520
and letting your gaze be relaxed not focusing on anything in particular

57
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,840
and then gently closing your eyes

58
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,639
and gently establishing a connection

59
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,479
to the body breathing

60
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:23,240
feel the rhythm of the body breathing in and breathing out

61
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,080
breathing in and breathing out

62
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:56,918
in feeling knowing the beginning and the end of the inhale

63
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:12,199
aware of the beginning and end of the exhale

64
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:30,880
being aware of the current of sensations between the beginning and the end of the

65
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,880
inhale

66
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,520
knowing the current of sensations between the beginning and end of the

67
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,520
exhale

68
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,960
so

69
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,520
and feeling the changing sensations of breathing

70
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,720
take a little bigger breath than usual

71
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:29,440
and as you exhale settle into the body breathing

72
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,800
relax the body as if you're relaxing around the

73
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,518
experience of breathing

74
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,839
let anger breathing come to normal

75
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,199
and for this meditation trusting

76
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:27,200
attention to breathing trusting floating in the current

77
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:33,000
of breathing in and breathing out

78
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,639
noticing if you grab the branches of thoughts

79
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:53,680
and you're no longer floating no longer flowing along

80
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:07,200
with the whole experience of breathing in the whole experience of breathing out

81
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,320
staying there resting sensing knowing

82
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:29,639
the full experience in time of breathing as it's occurring

83
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,640
so

84
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:09,279
thinking has a flow and a movement from one thought to the other

85
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:18,640
see if you can switch your allegiance from the flow of thinking

86
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,080
to the flow of breathing letting thinking recede to the

87
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:32,000
background and let yourself be carried along

88
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,760
in the current of the present moment

89
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,840
that appears with every sensation of breathing

90
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,720
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

91
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:16,000
and take a few moments to appreciate whatever degree of calm

92
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,679
peace you might feel and if there is no calm in peace

93
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:31,240
what what you might have understood about your mind's tendency to hold on to branches

94
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:38,679
and what you might learn from led to letting go of the branches even if it's momentary

95
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,720
being present the flow of the present moment

96
00:28:52,320 --> 00:29:00,398
and letting that be a place upon which to gaze upon others kindly

97
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,320
to look upon the world with the calm peaceful eyes

98
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:13,159
not filtered by the attachments and fears we might have

99
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:21,000
to feel fortunate to have the ability to sit quietly and meditate

100
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:33,360
and think of this meditation as a foundation for going into the world

101
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,799
with care and love kindness

102
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:46,000
friendliness may this meditation practice we do

103
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,480
be a preparation for living a wise and caring life

104
00:29:53,600 --> 00:30:01,679
may the peace of our meditation spread from us out into the world

105
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,200
may all beings be happy

106
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,840
may all beings be safe

107
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,360
may all beings be peaceful

108
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,158
may all beings be free

109
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,649
[Music]

110
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:47,279
so today we come to the next exercise of the discourse on the

111
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:53,840
establishment of awareness for establishing awareness

112
00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:02,000
and this is called sometimes it's called the six scent spheres

113
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:09,200
and um it refers to being mindful at each of the sense doors

114
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,480
so the sixth sense doors are eyes ears

115
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:20,799
nose tongue body and its tactile abilities to know to feel

116
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:26,840
and uh the mind door so it's as if we have an eye or

117
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:33,840
a organ of perception that recognizes what we're that we're thinking that we have emotions the

118
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:39,039
activities of the mind and um that organ of perception is considered

119
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,840
one of them one of the six senses

120
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:50,640
and um and so the text itself begins with a very

121
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:56,399
simple statement it builds on it it says that

122
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,960
one knows there are sight objects things that we can see

123
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:09,279
and we know that there's the eye and in this simple

124
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:15,360
statement is the beginning of mindfulness a kind of certain kind of emphasis of

125
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,480
mindfulness which is very much centered in the present moment in the

126
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:26,320
direct experience of the senses so not anticipating the future or

127
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,760
remembering the past but right here in the moment so that um

128
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:37,240
if they if you're hearing you might hear the spell

129
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,799
if you're seeing you're seeing what's in front of you in the moment that you're seeing

130
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:50,399
and and it begins with uh sight

131
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:56,480
many years ago when i was um heading to going to the monastery i went to the

132
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,780
monastery at the zen monastery at tassajara i was there for a little while

133
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:09,358
[Applause] and and i noticed something unusual about

134
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:14,878
seeing and that was that um

135
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:20,960
i could look at a tree and i saw the tree kind of

136
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,480
and i was aware of myself looking i was aware of the eyes kind of engaged

137
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:34,398
in the process of looking and and then i noticed that in between

138
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:41,599
maybe it's almost what it felt like in between was my ideas of the tree

139
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:47,440
it was almost as if i was painting the concept tree on top of the tree

140
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:54,720
the concept was accurate enough so ordinarily i would have not not have thought twice about

141
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:00,320
you know there was anything more than seeing that tree but i became acutely aware of how there

142
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,680
was an act of conception act of interpretation act of

143
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,200
projection onto the tree and

144
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,400
and so there was the see the object of seeing the eyes that see

145
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,680
and something in between and it could be the judgments it could

146
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:27,760
be our stories we have our ideas we have what's there it could be our bias that we project

147
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,200
onto something and uh and so we don't see things

148
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:39,839
directly as they are we often see them through the filter of something

149
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,119
so uh in mindfulness practice it's possible to become aware of this filter

150
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:53,040
this thing that's in between but it begins by learning to

151
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,320
appreciate as the simple moment of sense awareness

152
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:04,400
that and so one of the sense stores is seeing and it's a wonderful exercise a

153
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:10,960
wonderful capacity to learn how to look with quiet eyes

154
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,720
relaxed eyes and and to look without

155
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:22,079
the agenda without the wanting mind looking for something

156
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:28,160
or the scared mind looking for danger looking how to be safe

157
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,359
but to have a very cool calm quiet

158
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:40,320
eyes that gaze in a relaxed way and and uh

159
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:46,880
i believe in the ancient world in the ancient buddhist world they sometimes had the idea that the eyes

160
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,400
rather than light coming to into the eyes it's more like somehow the eyes go out

161
00:36:52,400 --> 00:37:00,160
to touch the object out there to grab the object and certainly i felt sometimes with uh

162
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,760
if i'm really intense on wanting something or or afraid of something or curious about

163
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,200
something i can almost feel like you know my head goes forward the almost like my eyes open more

164
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:17,280
and and like my eyeballs are kind of like popping out a little bit to see what's that

165
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,440
and or i might be straining trying to really look at something carefully and and

166
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:30,880
minutely and try to make sense of it and and i could feel the strain in my eyes

167
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:38,160
one of the wonderful ways to practice mindfulness is to under have a reference point is to learn how to let awareness of

168
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:44,800
seeing be become be useful

169
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,240
and generally a relaxed easy eyesight

170
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,760
their eyes you know it doesn't have to be conscious even but their eyes are slightly moving

171
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:01,359
around their eyes are not held fixed fix

172
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:07,119
fixedly held eyes strain and get tired but relaxed eyes

173
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:12,160
our eyes are kind of it's kind of like they float in this in the eye socket and

174
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:17,520
they're kind of like looking a little bit here and there or looking at a particular object is kind

175
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:24,400
of maybe looking at the perimeter looking different pieces of it just kind of roamed eyes roam around

176
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:31,440
and to allow the eyes to roam gently can release a lot of stress

177
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,720
a lot of fixation in the mind because when the eyes roam

178
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,960
it's kind a little and kind of look at different things it's kind of more difficult for the mind to stay fixated

179
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,960
on his preoccupation and the more fixated we are in our inner

180
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,480
concerns our thoughts the more the eyes tend to be held tight or don't don't have this that

181
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:00,720
floating feeling and so one of the ways to do this in mindfulness of seeing

182
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:06,000
is to settle back and allow sights to come to you

183
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,560
don't go looking for anything and see but don't look

184
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:18,240
the difference being that looking is an active intentional act to look for

185
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:25,440
something someone might say look over there and then you look if people don't say see over there they might say what

186
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,800
do you see and and it's not necessarily a request to go

187
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:36,400
looking but just to if your eyes are in that direction what comes to your eyes what comes into

188
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:43,760
awareness so one of the ways to cultivate mindfulness and develop it is at each of

189
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:49,599
the six cent stores and begin to appreciate a relaxed quiet

190
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:54,960
way of receiving the sensations at the particular sense doors so today

191
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,400
through a seeing and uh and just that is a wonderful exercise

192
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:07,359
if you're have the fortune of maybe being a passenger in a car for me it's even better a bus or a train

193
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:14,000
and just let the eyes gaze out in the countryside as you could or the scenery around yours are driving and

194
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,839
let the eyes just kind of be float and look and relax and don't hold on to anything don't

195
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:26,319
just keep the eyes soft and it's uh when i was a teenager i used to get very calm

196
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:31,280
looking at trained windows and just looking at things going by

197
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:38,560
so um so that's very nice maybe and then the exercise

198
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:44,960
in this in this uh exercise on the six cent stores

199
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,079
is to know the object that we're seeing to know we're seeing something to know

200
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:55,440
the eyes and to do and be able to see in a relaxed way

201
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:02,000
but then to notice one of the things that's in between and the particular thing that this

202
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,000
exercise is about is to notice the not the k-n-o-t

203
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:14,000
it's sometimes translated into english as a fetter but i think the word in poly i think

204
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,880
it's better rendered as the word not um and federer kind of implies that

205
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:27,920
we're fettered we're hindered by something which is true and not means we're knotted up in it we're entangled with it and i myself

206
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:34,400
personally uh prefer the language of entanglement or being knotted up in something

207
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:40,560
and so if i you know have some

208
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:45,839
problem with my computer my eyesight is knotted up tangled in

209
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:53,040
trying to figure it out then what's going on here and looking and my eyes are not relaxed i'm not just get gazing

210
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:59,520
at the issue and letting the some kind of quiet the inner exploration try to figure it out i might

211
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:06,720
be entangled and caught in the issue that i have and now so it's possible to become aware

212
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,760
that there's the object we see there's the eyes that are seeing

213
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:18,240
and then there's kind of in between some of you might have more sense that it's in the mind behind the eyes or something

214
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:23,760
but in the tr um between the two there's the or in addition to the two

215
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,559
there's the way we're knotted up those things are

216
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,839
entangled with each other that our ways the way that we're looking is not

217
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:39,119
relaxed and easily useful but we're looking in a way that is caught or

218
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:45,599
preoccupied or concerned with what we're looking at and

219
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:52,079
and then and it becomes stressful in the eyes eyes become locked they get tight they'll get tired

220
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:57,359
they've lost this relaxed way of being so one of the reasons to cultivate

221
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:03,040
mindfulness of seeing is to learn develop capacity for this

222
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:08,160
relaxed gaze so that we become more sensitive

223
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:14,720
to the knots when they occur and and so

224
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:21,839
this is not like an incidental exercise that the buddha is giving but rather it's another perspective

225
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:27,280
from which we can become aware of all the ways we get attached

226
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:33,200
all every attachment is an attachment that at scent stores

227
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:40,319
at some particular scent store and as we become aware of each of the different scent stores it's a different kind of

228
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:46,800
angle to become aware of attachment itself so it's sometimes it's with what we see

229
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:55,680
sometimes with what we hear taste smell touch and then the mind door is a big one and

230
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:01,359
and so uh in this particular exercise satipattana it's going through very

231
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:07,520
carefully repeatedly each of the six of these scent stores

232
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:14,319
and talking about uh seeing the scent store seeing seeing the object

233
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:20,560
now for this first one side object knowing the eye that's seeing

234
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:26,720
knowing the not that that's between them and more than that in

235
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:32,640
in the in style of how this teaching goes it's also knowing the manner in which

236
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:38,240
that that um that of seeing it appear

237
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:43,680
and see and then letting go of it and the seeing

238
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:51,920
the appearance of a knot is uh when it first occurs is this amazing uh vantage point

239
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:57,440
where it's easier to let go so relax seeing

240
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,480
noticing how the eyes get locked in knotted up

241
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:09,520
but noticing just as it occurs and then letting it go so for today as you go about your day

242
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:15,359
next 24 hours you might give a special attention to seeing

243
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:21,280
and see what if you can learn greater ways of looking

244
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:26,800
in in a relaxed way calm looking relaxed looking

245
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:31,839
where the eyes can kind of look at things and study them even but do it in a very

246
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:37,119
relaxed receptive mode and that as you kind of get a hang of

247
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:42,400
that maybe then you can start noticing when the eyes are not that way when they're

248
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,599
locked in or straining or something and that is the knot

249
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:52,880
and maybe you can let go of it so

250
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:59,200
that's the introduction to this topic of this week the mindfulness at the six

251
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:04,599
cent stores so thank you
