1
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,920
so

2
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,559
uh so warm greetings

3
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:42,320
and i hope this uh finds you well and and that you are

4
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:50,559
comfortable and safe and somewhat contented to be here now for

5
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:57,039
meditation time together it's a considered to be one of the really great

6
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:03,039
things in life to meditate and meditate in community knowing that

7
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:09,200
there are people throughout the world with youtube but also in other ways who

8
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,680
are involved in meditation and the dharma and people have been involved in it for

9
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:25,680
centuries and we continue in a lineage of practitioners and in a sense we are

10
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,960
the recipients standing on the shoulders of all the people who have practiced before

11
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:38,560
us and that our shoulders hopefully are broad enough and stable enough so that the meditators who

12
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:46,479
follow us will feel inspired and feel like they are part of a wonderful

13
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,360
lineage that uh traveled through us

14
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,439
so there's an ancient uh teaching that faith or confidence

15
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:06,159
is um or refuge maybe is like a magic stone

16
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,400
that if dropped into muddy waters it immediately clears the muddy water

17
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:19,760
the mud just settles out and in the same way the

18
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:29,599
faith in the dharma faith in the practice faith in oneself in the practice the confidence that

19
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,720
comes along with that when we evoke it or touch it or let it drop

20
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:41,040
really deep inside settles the places of doubt

21
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,879
worry distress settles the places where we feel like

22
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:53,440
we're lost or that the world doesn't make any sense or there's no way forward

23
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:01,200
and all these ways in which we kind of have this centrifugal force away from ourselves when we drop

24
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:08,959
faith into our hearts faith or confidence the dharma in then

25
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:18,800
something that is extra within us extra agitation um gets settled

26
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:26,640
gets reassured and one of the functions of refuge is a deep inner reassurance

27
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:33,440
to have a sense of assurance and wonderfully

28
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:40,239
the word for assurance can also in poly can also mean breathing

29
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,159
or breathing easily and so to really connect the sense of assurance

30
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:52,080
of faith of real sense of being settled in our confidence

31
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,239
with our breathing is kind of to the point to be able to come not to some abstract

32
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:07,760
idea of confidence or faith but a way of being that allows us to breathe easily at ease

33
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:17,280
so to begin this process of meditation and assuming a posture that

34
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:25,759
gives you both a sense of ease but also expresses confidence expresses

35
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:32,240
the body expresses a sense of assurance even if the rest of you doesn't feel

36
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:42,880
that and to then gently close your eyes

37
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:50,720
in a way that maybe for you is friendly caring loving

38
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,520
take some deeper breaths than usual

39
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:04,240
the life-living air oxygen comes in

40
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:16,880
filling your lungs and then as you exhale to relax your whole body

41
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:27,360
taking deep breath in maybe three quarters full and as you exhale

42
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:36,639
release the whole body in some way maybe as if all the edges of your body

43
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:44,800
are released outwards into space where the places where you touch your

44
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:53,840
chair or your cushion the floor you release yourself into the support

45
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,758
and then to let your breathing return to normal

46
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:15,840
and again as if you really can if you have doubts

47
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,840
lovingly with goodwill for yourself

48
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,240
on your exhale continue to continue to relax your body

49
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,160
softening the muscles of your face

50
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:41,919
releasing your face from all the work it has to do throughout the day of expressing itself

51
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:49,120
responding to the world

52
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,240
so the muscles of the face fall away from the bone

53
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,840
on the exhale softening around the shoulders

54
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:17,840
for some of us those shoulders work a lot and being tense and being held up

55
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:30,400
and to soften the belly perhaps one of the

56
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:37,840
ways of being deeply at ease in this world

57
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:46,400
is to have the belly be soft that in these few minutes of meditation

58
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,639
there's nothing we need to do to defend ourselves or protect ourselves or

59
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:59,360
push ourselves prove ourselves in ways that tighten up the muscles of

60
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,478
the butt of the belly

61
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:13,840
we can allow ourselves the opportunity to be at ease

62
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,200
and if you have some degree of confidence or faith or assurance

63
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:41,680
in this practice of meditation even if it's quite difficult for you

64
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:49,200
sometimes when it's difficult for people they're actually getting the most benefit from it

65
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:58,720
to have faith whatever your faith is see if you can drop it into

66
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,639
the waters of your heart

67
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:13,360
and as that stone of faith drops

68
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:21,200
see if there can be one more big feeling of release and relaxation here

69
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,839
now

70
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,600
and then as waves on the surface of that

71
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:41,120
body of water is your breathing

72
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:51,200
gentle waves that move across the water

73
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:58,880
and in a sense your body your mind your awareness floating on the waves of breathing up

74
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:06,240
and down expanding and contracting

75
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:22,320
trusting simplicity of floating on your breathing

76
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:34,880
entrusting yourself to breathing as if it's the only thing to do for now

77
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:47,839
as if it's the most valuable and protective and deepening way of being

78
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:15,839
is to rest in the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

79
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:25,120
maybe for the next three breaths you can relax your body further

80
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,840
release and release the grip of your

81
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:47,840
thinking soften in the mind

82
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,840
so

83
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,840
so

84
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,240
and then as we come to the end of the

85
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:44,158
sitting recalling the best that you can

86
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,440
the state of being deeply reassured

87
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,840
may be deeply trusting

88
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:07,520
with the feeling of being at ease safe may be contented

89
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:15,679
and maybe with the remembering the feel those feelings of a time such deep reassurance

90
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:23,600
to breathe with that we through it for two or three breaths

91
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:38,000
and then perhaps imagine that the people around you have the ability to also feel

92
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,159
deeply reassured in this life deep trusting sense of peace and

93
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:51,600
contentment to be able to breathe with ease

94
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:59,520
have breathing room and space and ease

95
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:07,440
and imagine how good it would be for others all around you throughout the world to breathe this way

96
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,480
to feel this way

97
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:20,159
and perhaps from the depth of your heart you can wish it were so an open-handed open-minded

98
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:28,320
wish without questioning it or doubting it or

99
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:35,919
it's just a simple wish may all beings be at ease

100
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,240
may all beings breathe easily

101
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,120
breathing room

102
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:59,840
may all beings feel safe and reassured

103
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:06,559
may all beings be peaceful and contented

104
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,000
may all beings be free

105
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,679
without oppression or

106
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,840
hostility

107
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:41,840
may all beings

108
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:49,440
be deeply reassured of their place here on this planet

109
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,840
harmonious peaceful contented

110
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:02,640
so they too may live for the benefit and welfare of

111
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:09,840
all beings may all beings be free

112
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:23,840
and may all beings live in mutual respect and care

113
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,720
[Music]

114
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,879
so allow me to make an announcement at the beginning of this talk

115
00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:02,480
that as we continue these 7 a.m sittings

116
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:08,080
in weekdays that there will be a change for the next

117
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:14,960
three weeks starting on monday i'll i'll be here next week and

118
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:21,919
and then the following two weeks we have two wonderful zen teachers friends of mine who are going to teach

119
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:27,760
first paul howler we'll teach on the following week so the week of the

120
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:34,000
26th i think and then the following week um the abbess of the green gulch zen

121
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:41,120
center fou schrader will uh do this five five talks in the morning

122
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:47,600
and um and the reason uh for this what's happening is that um i was

123
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,200
invited or asked to teach um as a support for zen center i teach

124
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,880
what's called a zen intensive for three weeks and the three of us who are wonderful friends and have

125
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,399
wonderful dharma discussions among ourselves and wanted to share some of these dharma

126
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:10,720
discussions with other people and so we're doing what's called the zen intensive

127
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:16,880
with a schedule of sittings and teachings at san francisco zen center and since i'm doing these 7 a.m

128
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:23,200
teachings anyway i thought i would fold it in as part of the intensive

129
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,840
and the intensive is about the harmony of zen and vipassana that's the theme

130
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:36,080
and then once i thought of folding it in then i said well i should also ask my colleagues to participate in this as

131
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:43,679
well so i'm not sure what i'll be teaching next week but it'll be probably something something

132
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:50,240
basic about vipassana practice but perhaps presented in a way that is in harmony with zen

133
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:57,679
and then the following two weeks uh you'll certainly get some zen teachings uh zen approach to meditation um and other

134
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:04,559
things uh zen wisdom and things from my two friends so um

135
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:12,800
so um and uh so anyway so you can expect that change

136
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:18,878
and uh some of you might want to participate in the zen intensive uh the harmony of zen and

137
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:25,679
vipassana that san francisco zen center is offering and i think that today is the last day to sign up if you want to be part of

138
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:31,118
that and you can see there's a schedule there of

139
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:37,919
what's what's being offered and things like that it's all on zoom so

140
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,280
so thank you

141
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:49,838
so um

142
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,000
so this topic this week is refuge and um yesterday i talked about refuge

143
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,200
in the buddha dharma sangha it's called the triple refuge and now

144
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,320
one of the peculiar things if you study the ancient teachings of the buddha

145
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:13,280
he never actually actively suggests that people should go for refuge

146
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:20,160
a few times he speaks favorably about people doing so and and talks about the value of doing

147
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:27,920
so but there's never the instructions to go for refuge but he gives a go for the triple refuge

148
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:33,920
he does but he does give instructions for a different kind of refuge in the triple refuge

149
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:40,480
and and but to the background for this the triple refuge the idea of a triple

150
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,599
refuge is a term predated the buddha

151
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:51,200
it was a custom in ancient india to go for have the triple refuge in three

152
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:58,400
of the gods of the indian pantheon and and so ancient texts talk about this

153
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:04,000
triple refuge that people would do and going for refuge in the ancient gods so

154
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,880
there was already a custom in ancient india to people do something called the triple refuge and when

155
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:17,040
the buddha came along that language that ritual or that article a way of

156
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:22,880
expressing faith was then directed towards the buddha dharma and the sangha and that became

157
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:28,880
the new triple refuge and most literally it's an external refuge the literal

158
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,960
buddha the literal his teachings perhaps and then the community

159
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:41,119
and as i said yesterday can also be an internal refuge we can find the what corresponds to that

160
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,960
within ourselves now uh when the in the buddha gave

161
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:52,079
instructions for refuge he gave on one place it's a

162
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:59,520
very significant place right near the end of his life he knew he was dying so his teachings now became particularly

163
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,838
significant and he said i gave the instructions

164
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:14,880
make yourself uh dwell abide with yourself as an island with yourself

165
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:22,720
as a refuge with no other refuge with the dharma as an island with a

166
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:32,960
dharma as a refuge with no other refuge and the metaphor of an island

167
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:41,119
they uh the metaphor for an island is that of a place that's safe

168
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:46,400
from the floods and swirls of the world uh the floods of the floods

169
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:52,960
the strong currents the strong waves that the strong tides like i hear on the coast here you can't

170
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:58,960
really go swimming very many places in the ocean because of the strong rip currents that exist

171
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,720
so an island is a place from safety so make yourself a place of safety

172
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:10,240
make a refuge of yourself and then he goes on to say do the same thing

173
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,599
with a dharma with no other refuge and the only way to

174
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:21,680
kind of harmonize these two statements is that the self and the dharma are

175
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,440
somehow becoming the same the dharma isn't out there but the dharma is found

176
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:34,640
somehow in oneself with oneself and um and it's a very strong

177
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:41,920
affirmation of one's own personhood as a place of practice and a place of

178
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:48,880
religious value and to call this person that you are the place of the dharma the dharma itself is an

179
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:54,720
affirmation and that often is not captured so well

180
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:02,000
if we emphasize uh too much that buddha's teachings are not self

181
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:09,280
teachings on not self teaching and emptiness sometimes involve a kind of as profound as they

182
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,720
can be to overemphasize sometimes um dismisses

183
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:21,520
the ordinary phenological world that we live in the ordinary uh experiences of how we are and how we

184
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:27,520
live and and i've seen plenty of people dismissed the value of their emotions their intentions their

185
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:33,839
own safety sometimes and well-being their health by over emphasizing that this some idea

186
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:40,079
that there is no self or or everything is empty or something like that and

187
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:47,280
but here we have the buddha the end of his life saying make yourself a refuge make yourself

188
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,400
an island a place of safety and then he goes then he asks a

189
00:39:52,400 --> 00:40:00,000
rhetorical question he says well how do you do this and then he explains he says you do it

190
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:08,160
by practicing the four foundations of mindfulness that one dwells observing

191
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:14,880
the body and the body ardent aware and clearly comprehending having

192
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,640
put aside greed and distress for the world

193
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:27,280
one abides observing feelings and feelings

194
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:34,160
ardent aware and clearly comprehending having put aside greed and distress for

195
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:39,680
the world one abides aware by

196
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:46,400
observing mind and the mind ardent aware clearly comprehending

197
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:56,400
having put aside greed and distress for the world one abides observing dharmas and dharmas

198
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,960
ardent aware clearly comprehending having put aside

199
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:10,160
greed and distress for the world so here the way to make oneself a refuge the way

200
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:15,520
to make the dharma the refuge is the practice of mindfulness there's

201
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,560
something about uh mindfulness is the real refuge

202
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:26,880
mindfulness is the place that we really find our safety and uh and part of the task of

203
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,160
mindfulness is to do it long enough dedicated enough sincerely enough

204
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:40,319
to discover how it provides a tremendous place of safety of assurance of value of wisdom

205
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:47,440
and a freedom and and so it isn't pointing even though the buddha is pointing to self

206
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,560
it isn't the conventional idea of self and what we identify as a self or self identity or

207
00:41:52,560 --> 00:42:00,480
conceit but rather it's what opens up when we have this uh powerful form

208
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:09,040
of awareness and it isn't that awareness is the self but it's almost as if awareness

209
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:16,079
is the closest thing that just taking refuge in self taking refuge in the dharma

210
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:23,119
take refuge in your awareness but not awareness kind of in the abstract but awareness that

211
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:30,960
arises out of or is established in the body in our feelings

212
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:36,000
in our mind and mind states and in the dharma in the dharmas which here in this co

213
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:43,520
this context dharma means the mental processes of our inner life so there's a clear grounding a clear

214
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:49,359
connection to the specificity of our life the details that what's actually going on within us and

215
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:56,960
around us really be aware of that to be established in it so we're not distracted or reactive or

216
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:03,680
caught up in things but clearly aware to the point that we dwell

217
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:11,200
independent not clinging to anything in the world where the ability to be mindful

218
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:19,040
is not caught or dependent on anything at all but it's clearly established in this

219
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:27,200
world of ours this experience of ours here and this personhood that we are and

220
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:33,200
and not clinging to anything in the world so this is how we make ourselves a refuge

221
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:41,440
is by being aware and the word refuge sauron saruna s-a-r-a-n-a

222
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:48,800
is one of the most powerful expressions of faith of assurance of

223
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:55,680
trust of confidence that religious confidence religious

224
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,800
inspiration a kind of sense of religious enthusiasm

225
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:07,839
that i think that buddhism really honors and has a place for and have all

226
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:14,640
that kind of religious feeling if you will faith associated with awareness

227
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:21,760
and uh not to gods outside of us which was with the custom before the buddha there is not a

228
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:28,400
savior out there who's going to save us protect us but there's something here within

229
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:36,640
ourselves that is the protection that is the savior that is the place of safety and

230
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:42,240
and so we do that through practice it's not wishful thinking but by

231
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:47,280
practicing the four foundations of mindfulness the practice of mindfulness

232
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,400
and that includes anapanasati that we just finished going through

233
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:59,680
so this is another way in which the buddha talked about refuge and and then we'll continue with other

234
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:05,599
ideas of refuge this wonderful quality that supports our

235
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:19,839
practice we'll continue with that tomorrow so thank you
