1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,960
hey maybe we'll get started

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:14,080
here wanted to say something in general about poems

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,920
and I said this a little bit before but there's this way in which poetry can be

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,359
a doorway can be a uh entry point to

5
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:35,079
shifting our relationship to experience for me I'm fascinated by this by how

6
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:41,160
poems and they're use the same old words we use all the time for the most part

7
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,520
but it's their Arrangement it's the way that you guys

8
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:53,239
can't see this but the way that there's line breaks you know in a poem that's different than often we would do with

9
00:00:53,239 --> 00:01:00,600
Pros that encourages uh just a different way of um

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:07,600
maybe shakes up expectations or something that there isn't a period at the end of each line instead there's a a

11
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:15,799
way that the line goes to the ne the words go to the next line and then their Punctuation is there or way and we have

12
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:22,880
to kind of like lean in and pay a little bit more attention because things aren't exactly as we expect them to

13
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:29,360
be and it's this power of them of us having to pay just a little bit more

14
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,479
attention and them and the words not precisely meeting our

15
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:43,680
expectations that I think is part of the power of poetry of how it can not only point with

16
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:51,520
the content point to practice but it's a way of practicing to read poetry itself

17
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,960
independent of what the content is so in this that way I think poetry can be

18
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:07,800
quite powerful maybe it helps us to be more aware more

19
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:14,160
connected to what's actually on the page in my case now right what's

20
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,640
actually on the screen as I'm reading these on the

21
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:26,000
screen so maybe an invitation here to let the

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,400
words wash over you as a drop in a poem during our

23
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,560
guided meditation this morning please don't feel any sense that

24
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:46,159
you have to get it that you have to like it that it has to be some profound

25
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:55,000
experience just let it be what it is and it'll be what it is for

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,159
everybody so I don't want to like have this tyranny if poetry is supposed to elicit

27
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,799
some particular response or be a support for practice or anything like that can

28
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:13,560
it just be what it is including a yeah I don't get

29
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,280
it really poetry there could be such a wide range of

30
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,440
experiences and I know some of you are putting things in the chat that it's helpful I appreciate that I find it

31
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,799
helpful but I also want to acknowledge there's plenty of people who are kind of scratching their head going yeah

32
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:38,879
whatever and uh I used to be one of those people maybe some of you know I'm trained as a research scientist I used

33
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,840
to hate poetry I thought it was

34
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:53,360
silly okay [Music] so we will just

35
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,519
uh if you haven't already to take a meditation posture

36
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,239
and allowing the attention initially to kind of like

37
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:22,759
tune into the sounds around

38
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,160
you if you'd like you can even maybe even open Open the Eyes for a moment and

39
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:39,759
just to orient to the location where you are there's

40
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,400
sounds there's things in the visual

41
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:53,560
field you're here things are just as they

42
00:04:53,639 --> 00:05:00,360
are and closing the eyes and again maybe can I

43
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,680
with any sounds not in so much a way that you have to label them identify them figure

44
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,479
them out but receive

45
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,160
them receive the

46
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,560
sounds we don't have to push them away

47
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:44,440
and then tuning into the experience of the body as it's in this location in this

48
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,800
ge I like to start with feeling the pressure against the

49
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:01,639
body the pressure where the body meets the sitting surface that cont

50
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:10,759
contact this is often an obvious sensation once

51
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,080
we turn attention to

52
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:30,160
it it helps support a sense of groundedness connectedness

53
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:37,080
the foundation upon which we're meditating

54
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:13,120
bit of a body skan starting with the sense of contact

55
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,360
with our sitting surface back of the

56
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:24,319
legs the feet the

57
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,000
bcks the back

58
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:54,840
the sensations don't have to be otherwise they just are what they are

59
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,759
staying in the Torso and there be some

60
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:21,120
ease in the belly

61
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,000
maybe some warmth and

62
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,000
tenderness the

63
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,959
chest holding shielding our Tender

64
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:13,600
Hearts and there'll be a little bit of a softening for some of you this might be

65
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:22,320
just this tiny movement of the shoulders going back behind you that brings just a

66
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:29,240
tiny bit more openness in the chest

67
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:05,000
and a lower back does so much work for

68
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:15,440
us some people it's uncomfortable painful some people they don't even

69
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:25,880
notice whatever your experience is can we tune in the lower back

70
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,760
want some

71
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,759
kindness the upper back

72
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,360
shoulders

73
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,560
the face

74
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,480
bringing a sense of aliveness to the

75
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:15,720
body sense of presence

76
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,639
and resting attention on the sensations of

77
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:49,360
breathing ordinary always

78
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,360
available

79
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:03,680
breathing maybe I should say always occurring not always available for lost and

80
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,120
thought e

81
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:28,240
inhabiting the breath the experience of the body moving

82
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,040
as it breathes

83
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

84
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

85
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

86
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,880
e e

87
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,480
now I'd like to drop in a

88
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,880
poem again you don't have to figure it

89
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:56,000
out don't have to do anything with

90
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:06,080
it and you just re receive and allow the words to wash over

91
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:14,919
you maybe you like it maybe you don't that's not the point

92
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:23,320
here a new experience hearing a poem

93
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:42,200
m is called No More same old Silly Love

94
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:51,039

Songs by Neil carpathio

96
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:06,919
when the radio in my car broke I started to notice the

97
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:14,200
trees I began to stop exaggerating the color of leaves other the Reds and

98
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,639
oranges needed no wordy

99
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:29,440
embellishment I started to open the window and smell the wet pavement

100
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:36,240
after Morning Rain grows on the phone

101
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,360
line their Blackness and stubborn

102
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:51,360
dignity I even noticed my hands gripping the wheel the small dark

103
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:59,360
hairs the skin the knuckles and the perfect blue

104
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,360

e e

130
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:06,759
thank you thank you for your

131
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,120
practice maybe I'll start by saying a number of years ago quite a few years

132
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:25,720
ago the radio in my car broke and it only play cassettes so this

133
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:31,960
gives you a sense of that era right this was the cassette era so you know I put a cassette in the

134
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:40,519
car in the car radio and I listened to that single cassette for at least a year

135
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:46,760
just every time I was in my car just the same I said over and over and over and

136
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:54,519
over it's quite something quite something when I think back on that and also when I reflect back on my

137
00:30:54,519 --> 00:31:03,159
life I can see that there was a way in which I was kind of a dis connected from myself from my life I was

138
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:10,399
just trying to be so busy busy busy all the time and trying to do do do and

139
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:16,320
feeling like uh whatever I was doing just wasn't enough and I had to do more

140
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,720
and quite something when I think about this and to be honest I mean there was

141
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:27,960
this certain amount of comfort of listening to familiar music over and over again right I knew the words to

142
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:33,279
every single song you can imagine but there's a way in which just

143
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:38,360
listening to the same thing driving to work and the same way every day this

144
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:43,880
type of thing well there was a way in which encouraged a type of

145
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:51,440
autopilot you know just going through the motions and so I like to say that poems

146
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,480
are a way that they're encouraging us to connect

147
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:04,399
and I don't know maybe the word is connect with the words because it's not the usual way of

148
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:10,080
words the usual way that we communicate and so we kind of have to bring um all

149
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,600
of us or a bigger portion of ourselves in order [Music]

150
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:21,679
to let me feel into what the poems are pointing to because I would say that's

151
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:29,320
part of the power of poetry is that they are very uh clearly pointing so the

152
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:37,360
content is just used to um suggest a direction suggest an

153
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,840
orientation it's not so much that the words the literal words themselves are

154
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:51,639
where the what the poem is about so maybe there's this way that

155
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:58,760
um we can allow poems some poetry to really support support

156
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:04,120
us um Orient us to just be to feel into

157
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:10,360
to be connected be embodied so in the guided meditation I

158
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:17,880
offered this poem I'll say it again it's no more same old Silly Love Songs by

159
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:25,039
Neil carpathio and occurs to me there's so many different ways I could do this title No More same old Silly Love Songs

160
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:30,799
right that has this kind of a rhythm to it but I'll do it as no more same old

161
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,360
Silly Love Songs by Neil

162
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:42,279
kathio when the radio in my car broke I started to notice the

163
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:48,200
trees I began to stop exaggerating the color of leaves how the Reds and oranges

164
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:54,159
needed no wordy embellishment I started to open the

165
00:33:54,159 --> 00:34:00,279
window and smell the wet pavement after Morning

166
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:07,079
Rain grows on the phone line their Blackness and stubborn

167
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:15,520
dignity I even noticed my hands gripping the wheel the small dark hairs the skin

168
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,720
the knuckles and the perfect blue

169
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:27,919
veins I don't know there's something that I want to smile every time I read this poem

170
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:36,358
and maybe I'll just start by saying generally there's just so much in our culture that is designed specifically to

171
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:43,480
distract us there's this way in which like there to pull our attention away from what's

172
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:49,599
actually happening and we might say well you know to uh live with some

173
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:56,919
mindfulness or to experience some mindfulness and awareness is a way in which we can feel more relaxed feel a

174
00:34:56,919 --> 00:35:04,000
bit more restful but it's also enlivening and

175
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,240
energizing because instead of being pulled or thought or dragged into

176
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:17,440
thoughts and just entertainment infotainment dragged into tomorrow

177
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,920
dragged into the fear of uh of what the media often wants us to feel outrage or

178
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:30,560
fear or something they they know that these human conditions are what to get people to click more right so this is

179
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:37,920
their business model but we might have our own like concerns or distractions completely

180
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:47,200
independent of the media but there's this way it can be energizing or enlivening to actually be

181
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,760
connected with what's actually happening in that

182
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:58,400
moment because there's this way in which we might say that uh feeling

183
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:06,599
disconnected from our experience our life experience is a way of suffering

184
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:11,640
could say it's a type of Dua this feeling as if everything is behind some

185
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:17,920
glass or that we're only touching it with a 10- foot pull again using

186
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:25,440
metaphors and imagery perhaps to help us point to that uh we're not often really

187
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:31,760
with our experience instead there's this a way in which

188
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:37,240
we're disconnected in the same way that I would just be listening to the same song

189
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:43,760
driving the same route to the same job doing the same thing you know there's

190
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,880
this way in which this kind of autopilot can show up so we might say that one of

191
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:56,079
the functions of mindfulness is to connect us with

192
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:05,400
life have a be intimate with life have us be embodied have us

193
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:11,680
inhabit our lives and we grow actually to love this connection this intimacy

194
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:20,680
with our experience because there's this way we start to feel like oh this is my life we

195
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:28,040
start to feel like we belong we start to feel

196
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:34,560
less disconnected less Dua and that's a Priceless feeling there's a maybe a

197
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,680
preciousness to this connection and then we start to have a

198
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:45,920
feeling like oh this is what it means to live

199
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:52,800
life this is what instead of feeling like wow another year is passed us by or

200
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,880
another season has passed us by we start to feel like oh yeah I'm living life

201
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:04,359
doesn't mean that all of our preferences are being matched it doesn't mean it's easy it doesn't mean it's Pleasant it

202
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:11,160
just means that we're have a sense of aliveness can be a way in which there's

203
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:18,119
this deadening and maybe even a certain dullness that can arise because as we

204
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:23,480
start to practice mindfulness just being with what's being experienced there can

205
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:28,560
be this way in which we like wash the dullness from the

206
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,800
senses maybe some of you who have been on meditation Retreats whether they're

207
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,839
online or in person you might have had this experience I know I've had this

208
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:45,240
experience many times where the kind of the grass really does look Greener and

209
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:51,280
the sky really does look Bluer and the food is fantastic it's quite

210
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:57,480
something how with a meditation practice the sense of dullness that's been over

211
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:05,280
over our senses gets washed away I like maybe the the screen the windshield gets

212
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,400
cleaned like wow there's a things

213
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:17,240
they're ordinary but there's a beauty in the ordinariness and with that there's also

214
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:23,680
this sense of connection the sense of beauty there also the suppor of aliveness that

215
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:29,359
arises the sense of maybe we might say brightness

216
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:38,960
and then as we pay attention to walking the breath in the

217
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:46,200
body what's being heard what's being seen where the hands are on the steering

218
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:51,760
wheel so we might say that with mindfulness practice there's a we could

219
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:58,839
use this language maybe a sensitization that starts to occur there's this way in which we start

220
00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:04,319
to feel connected and there a sense of aliveness and I don't want to say that

221
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:13,520
it's all joy and happiness because sometimes what we're connected to is painful it's really is I

222
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:21,480
don't want to pretend like it isn't there is really terrible stuff that happens in people's lives or even if

223
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:28,599
it's not an obvious event there's this low grade constant feeling of things not being

224
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:33,880
quite right so with practice though is a way

225
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:39,680
in which we can feel like we're alive we're

226
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:47,800
living we're connected we're embedded there's this way in which that

227
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:54,280
feels a certain amount of Freedom as I said I'm not saying

228
00:40:54,280 --> 00:41:00,520
everything's good all the time there can be tremendous Joy with us no doubt but

229
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:06,400
sometimes there's a way in which we've disconnected because there's

230
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:14,200
uncomfortableness and the way forward often is just to be with this uncomfortableness but as we start to

231
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:20,359
connect as we start to be sensitive to what's actually happening as we start to

232
00:41:20,359 --> 00:41:26,319
stop distracting ourselves then there's a feeling of

233
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:34,040
perfection oh yeah things are this way because

234
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:40,319
there's no other way they could be they're this way because causes and

235
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:47,440
conditions came together it couldn't be otherwise I don't like it

236
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,680
necessarily but I can appreciate the Beauty and the

237
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:58,200
lawfulness of what's being experienced

238
00:41:58,839 --> 00:42:07,240
sense of perfection and there's a way that the heart sings When It aligns with the I'll

239
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:16,000
call it the Dharma the Dharma oh here we go here's this

240
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:23,519
poem no more same old Silly Love Songs by Neil

241
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:32,359
kathos when the radio and my car broke I started to notice the

242
00:42:32,359 --> 00:42:38,960
trees I began to stop exaggerating the color of leaves their Reds and oranges

243
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:45,240
needed no wordy embellishment I started to open the

244
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:50,920
window and smell the wet pavement after Morning

245
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:57,760
Rain grows on the phone line their Blackness and stubborn dignity

246
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:07,160
I even noticed my hands gripping the wheel the small dark hairs the skin the

247
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:12,400
knuckles and the perfect blue

248
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:24,599
veins I love how this poem kind of like starts with external senses and then comes closer and closer more and more

249
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:30,599
intimate went from the external all the the way we might even say to the

250
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:38,520
internal perfect blue veins noticing the Perfection of what's being experienced

251
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:45,000
how could it be otherwise so thank you thank you for

252
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,559
another day of exploring the Poetry of practice wishing you all a wonderful

253
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:57,280
rest of your day and may you notice the perfection

254
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:03,680
that's arises in each moment without making that feel ooey

255
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:08,760
gooey making that feel the tyranny of trying to find the

256
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:15,680
Perfection the I don't know without it feeling

257
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:21,559
oppressive and you just notice yet of course things are the way they are how

258
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:27,359
could it be otherwise thank you
