or whatever your time zone might be for this moment in time um

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,480
i was thinking it's given that in the united states right now is um

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,760
the week of thanksgiving holiday which of course has its historical complications

8
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:51,360
as we know make and acknowledge and with the theme of giving thanks

9
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,280
let's let's bring in the theme of giving thanks

10
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,359
as it is a beautiful practice it's a beautiful practice in buddhism it's a beautiful practice and

11
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,920
so many traditions um so many traditions to give thanks

12
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:17,280
to be grateful to have a grateful heart to land into appreciating the

13
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,880
the goodness all the gifts that we receive as human beings

14
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:30,960
in this life that often we don't acknowledge often we focus on

15
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:38,799
what is lacking what is missing [Music] what we don't have what is not going

16
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,880
right and instead turning turning our hearts

17
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,119
turning our minds to so many gifts

18
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:59,200
every moment every moment that we receive that sustain us

19
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:09,599
and so many different to do this practice of gratitude so with the guided meditation today i'll

20
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,620
introduce a couple of ways for us to engage with and um

21
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:22,560
[Music] what else do i want to say oh yes um now there is so much research

22
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,319
um on how prac on how the practice of gratitude

23
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:35,680
makes us happier makes us feel more connected to others

24
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,879
to this flow of goodness the giving and receiving circle the sense of

25
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:48,560
interconnection and practice of gratitude also

26
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,640
makes us feel more abundant so we become more generous

27
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:02,239
and in turn share our our abundance with others

28
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,879
so there are so many beautiful aspects to

29
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,800
this practice of gratitude it's not just oh we only do it to make ourselves happy

30
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,959
well that's good too it's not it's it's nice too it's lovely to nourish the heart

31
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:28,319
and mind so that we can contain more joy and be available for

32
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,840
more challenges more suffering which is every one of us has plenty of that in

33
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,760
our lives so so let's have more joy to be more available for that for more

34
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,760
be able to more be with challenges with more grace when

35
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,440
our heart is full when we turn when we're aware of what is nourishing and what is

36
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:59,360
[Music] what is good in our lives and also

37
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,480
um has this other dimension not just the

38
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,000
obvious dimension of gladness and goodness and generosity but i want to point out

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,079
for us to become aware of this other dimension of gratitude that

40
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,639
is a liberating it it's sustained it supports our freedom

41
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:29,840
instead of our vision being tight and just focusing on what is challenging

42
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:37,440
what is difficult it expands our vision it expands our capacity

43
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:46,080
so that more insight can arise freedom liberation

44
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,680
nibbana arose by any name so

45
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:57,479
so with that as the

46
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:02,720
invitation for tonight or setting the stage

47
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,800
let us land let us begin the practice of meditation so

48
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:15,600
let us land in our bodies see what your body needs maybe you need to move shift a little

49
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,840
bit left and right land in this body

50
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,160
land in your seat in your chair

51
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:35,160
hello body ah

52
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,560
and as always we start with tilling the soil

53
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:52,080
collecting collecting the mind the heart before we turn

54
00:05:52,080 --> 00:06:00,479
to our cultivation practice we start we start by landing

55
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,120
just arriving arriving

56
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:27,039
turning our gaze inward inviting our body to relax to soften

57
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,880
to offer its weight

58
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,680
to the earth to the chair of the cushion

59
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,400
in lieu of the earth

60
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:33,360
ah letting the feet letting her sit bones

61
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,599
connect land rest

62
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:47,360
as if sponges soaking

63
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:56,240
soaking up the sensations of contact connection

64
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:03,120
so grounding so groundingly

65
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,120
delicious

66
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:50,200
and inviting every cell of the body to unwind

67
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,079
invite fight every cell

68
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,720
to let go of any tightness or tension

69
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,080

72
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,360
hmm

73
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,920
letting the breath be received

74
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,839
the lower abdomen

75
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,320

76
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:49,839
cradled cradled appreciate it

77
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,160
and when each breath in its entirety is appreciated

78
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,959
notice how the mind the heart settles becomes

79
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:13,959
filled with gladness now hello dear breath hi

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,480
or a bird into the sky ah

88
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,360
sense of ease letting go

89
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:28,720
picking up picking up this cradling of the breath

90
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,160
in breath and a breath with awareness

91
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,399
with appreciation

92
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,240
can there be a sense of appreciation

93
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:56,240
for this moment of just sitting and breathing

94
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,400
this moment of refuge

95
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:17,520
what if we allow our hearts to light up to be ignited

96
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,640
with the goodness of just this moment

97
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,919
here just

98
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,320
taking refuge sitting and being breathed

99
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:02,240
maybe you've had a busy day a full day

100
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:09,360
or you've had a day without sangha and now you're sitting

101
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:15,280
with sangha where you have a moment to yourself

102
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:24,120
this moment of connection of awareness

103
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:33,679
expansive filled with grace

104
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,320
just as it is

105
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:32,399
this moment has never been

106
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,679
this moment of my life

107
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,279
has never been and never will be again this moment

with gratitude

112
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:42,399
knowing that all things are impermanent all things are impermanent

113
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:50,320
this moment this life the way things are right now in my life

114

it will change

115
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,039
even if there are challenges this period can i meet this moment with

116
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:11,679
gratitude as a stepping stone

117
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:19,039
for opening and if there is there are things that are going well in this moment

118
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:27,080
can i open up wholeheartedly recognizing their goodness

119
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:20,480
what what is the blessing right now

120
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,840
in this moment

121
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,600
can i open my heart to it breathe it in fully

122
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,520
deeply appreciating

123
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,320
what is one thing in my life

124
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:11,000
that i take for granted a blessing that i take for granted

125
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,720
that perhaps there are other beings in this world

126
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:25,760
wishing for that i take this for glad granted can i

127
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,640
appreciate this blessing

128
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,799
not with shame or guilt but let it nourish my heart

129
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:47,919
my body my mind not to be not to be taken for granted

130
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:57,840
let my heart know goodness appreciate blessings

131
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:19,679
as fullness of our heart with gratitude can inspire generosity can i be grateful for this

132
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,640
really let it in

133
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,679
can you imagine this this thing that you are grateful for

134
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:30,720
this blessing what if it wasn't in your life imagine your life

135
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,559
in this moment without this blessing

136
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:44,919
what would your life be like without this use your imagination

137
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,240
yeah squeezing your body squeezing your heart

138
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,679
and now whenever you're ready remind yourself

139
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,080
goodness this blessing is in my life

140
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:20,000
letting yourself open up to it even more to the goodness of it

141
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,639
having had a vision of life without it

142
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:38,559
often we can bring more appreciation and gratitude

143
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:46,480
if we imagine this blessing not being here

144
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:55,480
say we could imagine our arm or leg being in a cast

145
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,398
not being able to walk not being able to take care of ourselves

146
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:09,840
to feed ourselves to walk around

147
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:17,039
but whatever is a lie for you you can imagine that also

148
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:24,720
so let's say after this practice period he wouldn't be able to get up

149
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,720
without crutches unassisted

150
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:37,840
from your seat moving around how difficult that would be

151
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:55,840
imagine going through the day

152
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:02,200
with your arm with your leg in a cast

153
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,399
i was both in a cast why not

154
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:47,120
preparing a meal taking a bath

155
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,320
or a shower grooming yourself brushing teeth

156
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,240
the impossibility of going out for a walk

157
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:11,519
how limiting your life would be perhaps how painful

158
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:18,158
and guess what your arm your leg is not in the cast

159
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:29,840
you can get up unassisted after the sit can make yourself tea

160
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,720
brush your teeth go for a walk

161
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:01,440
your arm and leg are not broken they're not in pain

162
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,840
so much to be grateful for

163
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:55,919
in the last minutes of the set perhaps considering the gift of your

164
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:01,600
practice the gift that your practice has been in

165
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:09,359
your life as support best practice

166
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:18,839
this opportunity this sangha this medium

167
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:26,919
what if none of this was in your life

168
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:46,838
no practice no degree of freedom

169
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:55,040

[Music] what if the sangha wasn't here what if you had never come across the practice

austin please

215
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:15,119
hey everybody thank you um yeah reminded me of a stoic practice of

216
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:21,599
like picturing yourself without something i forget the name of it some

217
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:28,400
stoic meditation but yeah really reflecting on my health and

218
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:35,280
gratitude for it and i'm really healthy and i don't think about that like hardly

219
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,640
ever um but i i wanted to ask you

220
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:46,839
i remember being on retreat with you and you had talked about how

221
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:53,839
you lots of people when they go to work they get kind of drained from work and then they come home and they say that

222
00:41:53,839 --> 00:42:00,240
they need to like recuperate and kind of fill their cup so that they can go back to work and then kind of

223
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:06,079
almost like empty their cup and i remember you being on retreat and you were saying

224
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:12,480
how you gain energy from you could see like 10 yogi's

225
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:18,480
a day and that you actually gained it i remember you were saying that was mainly through mindfulness of

226
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:24,319
the body but i was wondering if you could talk about that again

227
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:29,599
yeah yeah thanks austin first i so appreciate you

228
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:34,800
sharing and reflecting on on the appreciation for your health that you're

229
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:42,400
very healthy yay may you continue to be healthy all the time and how you take it for granted and just

230
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:50,800
really appreciating that that's beautiful [Music] and the sense of being drained

231
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,800
and how you remember me sharing with you that

232
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:02,560
that the sense of um being nourished from my

233
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:07,680
work quote-unquote work being with the yogis and seeing many yogis and being nourishing

234
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,760
it is true i i have said that oh it rings a bell it's something i would say

235
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:20,960
um and that and in fact as you remember well it does come from a sense of mindfulness of the

236
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:26,880
body really being connected with my body connected here

237
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:33,520
connected resonating with the person so now the times if i get in my head and to

238
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:39,920
and energy comes too high up thinking and and engaged too much falling into

239
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:45,040
emotions then i can lose my balance with being embodied really with the sense of

240
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:50,880
embodiment emotions thoughts all can be held it can all move

241
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:58,160
through and there's a sense of um how should i put it there can be a sense

242
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:05,359
of opening there's a sense of um it's not me not mine

243
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:12,240
sense of open i guess in some other practices could be called chi or energy kind of moving it's

244
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:18,800
as if the body is grounded is well you know my mind is grounded in the body and

245
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:25,520
the body is grounded with the earth so the sense of um yeah the mindfulness of the body

246
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:31,359
as a friend so and um also being in meetings you know

247
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:38,400
various things i've noticed the difference if i lose my mindfulness of the body if i unzoom

248
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:45,200
whether if i have mindfulness of the body and i'm well grounded in my body

249
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:50,880
being on zoom it's very different for me one is can be very tiring and the other

250
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:57,359
one can be yeah grounding noticing just letting go of the of the energy as if it's getting

251
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:04,400
grounded into the earth so those are a few things i can say about that there's so much more to say about my electrons

252
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:11,839
of the body but is that uh is that okay for now austin

253
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:17,440
yeah thank you yeah thank you so

254

257
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:40,640

259

around so one person will say one thing they're grateful for the next person says another thing and

260
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:58,400

269
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:55,599
so we have a couple of minutes for any reflections either from the practice or from being in groups

270
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:01,040
what you notice what it was like to share and hold witness

271
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:07,839
what you and others are grateful for so please debra

272
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:15,359
i i just realized i really enjoy practicing gratitude and in my family i

273
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:22,559
was always the control freak at the thanksgiving table wanting everyone to go around

274
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:28,480
and every year my brother hated like a few people hated it and my mother just

275
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:33,520
loved saying how much she was grateful about the children and she'd cry and it

276
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:38,720
was just beautiful so i just feel kind of like maybe vindicated or something i don't

277
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:44,640
know what the word is but thank you thank you thank you for this practice

278
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:52,319
thank you debra oh that is sweet it's sweet to to hear and and and also to

279
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:57,839
appreciate you know the particularities of of all family members right they're

280
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:03,359
just the way they are so it's it's pretty sweet yeah thank you for that

281
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:09,040
and please okay um yeah i changed my zoom setup so it might

282
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:15,119
be like 10 times more reliable than it used to be see um i also am really grateful for a

283
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:21,200
moment that sounds similar to what i understood of debra's a teacher who probably several people

284
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:27,760
here might know oren sopher um sort of gave a talk that like was my clicking point to

285
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:35,119
um to not experience gratitude as being a performative thing i just like it's

286
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:40,559
amazing how much i completely at the age of 24 maybe

287
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:46,160
thought that just like the my whole life gratitude had been this you should be grateful for that or you know let's go

288
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:54,640
around say we're grateful for as a chore that like you're performing for other people and oran like gave a gave the

289
00:48:54,640 --> 00:49:01,680
metaphor of of just like gratitude is like ringing a bell and i won't go into the the three steps of that except for

290
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:08,319
the last one which is let it ring which is just to say feel good about good stuff in your life and that's like so

291
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:13,680
relatable and so much better than i thought before so i'm like super

292
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:20,319
grateful for that moment and then like over the years since then gratitude has been a really fundamental

293
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:26,160
practice in my life beautiful thanks so much for sharing

294
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:32,160
that then that that gladdens my heart so much yeah it's it's a thing as you

295
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:39,440
brought up it's really that performative it's the should aspect that you should be grateful or we feel like

296
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:46,240
we should be grateful it's the shirt that really takes the joy out of gratitude it's the show but you don't

297
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:53,119
have to be grateful you really don't it just it feels good to be grateful you can you

298
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:58,880
can be if you want to but there's no should um so i think that really makes all the

299
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:07,280
difference so thanks so much for for sharing your aha moment so beautifully yay yay that is so lovely
