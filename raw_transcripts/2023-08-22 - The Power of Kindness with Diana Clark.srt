welcome welcome everybody nice to see you all

4
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,198
and we'll sit for 45 minutes

5
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:26,180
maybe I'll do a little bit of guided here

6
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:37,160
just an encouragement to feel the experience of breathing

7
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,800
in a relaxed way trusting that the body knows how to breathe

8
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:54,480
and it can be helpful to put our hands on our belly

9
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:01,820
and just feel the movement we're not forcing the breath we're not

10
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:08,699
manipulating the breath we're just feeling the body

11
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,360
breathes

12
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,480
in a very simple way

13
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:48,240
trusting that the body knows how to breathe and we're just noticing

14
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:39,440
no need to change the breath

15
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,660
to allow it to be natural

16
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:58,380
and when the mind wanders we just very simply

17
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:06,798
gently Begin Again with the sensations of breathing

18
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,660
feeling the movement the stretching

19
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:22,100
and the release of the stretch

25
00:52:20,099 --> 00:52:25,800
so tonight I'd like to build on this theme that I did

26
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:31,079
um last week on Friday I ended with a theme on kindness

27
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:37,020
and I like to kind of uh maybe build on that this idea of kindness

28
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:42,900
and I'm influenced by Sharon salzberg she has a book

29
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:48,780
if I remember correctly it's called the force of kindness so many of you may know that she's well

30
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:55,140
known for loving kindness practice she's one of the main people that brought it to the west and popularized it here in

31
00:52:55,140 --> 00:53:01,140
the West a Sharon points out that we may think

32
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:06,599
that kindness rates pretty low on these

33
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:12,300
characteristics that we think people should have I mean it's we all think that maybe like

34
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:20,640
an intellect or a sharp wit or beauty or invulnerability or power or authority or

35
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:26,819
you know all these other things but certainly must be more important than kindness

36
00:53:26,819 --> 00:53:32,460
and if you look at you know our media what we see and all kinds of media right

37
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:39,420
we get this message that kindness that's not really valued

38
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:46,140
but it is right in our lives it's valued but in so many ways we get this message

39
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:53,160
that it's somehow maybe it seems wimpy like kindness is

40
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:58,680
something that you do if you can't have a sharp intellect or uh wit or a beauty

41
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:05,460
or power or something like this like okay well at least this person is kind at least I can be kind

42
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:12,420
kind of the message that we see showing up in so many different ways I know that sometimes I've felt that what you know

43
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:18,720
the movies or TV shows you know sometimes like the uh

44
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:24,720
the sidekick of the really powerful person in media is kind but you know the

45
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:30,380
the protagonist the main person is powerful or something like this

46
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:38,880
so maybe there's a way in which we might delegate kindness It's like oh

47
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:47,000
that's a nice old-fashioned virtue and maybe it's something that uh

48
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:54,780
maybe I'll say this if we think about the people in our lives who I've really touched our lives

49
00:54:54,780 --> 00:55:00,059
and whom we respect we'll see that they were kind these are

50
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:05,180
the types of people who actually make a difference in our lives

51
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:12,839
and I know that when I was trying to figure out exactly how old I was I don't know maybe 9 10 11 somewhere in that

52
00:55:12,839 --> 00:55:18,540
range I had a swim coach who one time asked me you know what did I want to be

53
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:24,900
when I grow up you know one of those types of questions to ask a kid and at that time I said oh I want to be

54
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:30,980
a stewardess right and that was the word that we used back then right to be a flight attendant

55
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:36,119
and this coach said are you sure Diana do you are you sure that you want to

56
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:42,180
just uh do something that you that you really

57
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:48,059
not he was trying to encourage me to be think big I don't want to put down

58
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:54,720
anything about flight attendants or stories this is fantastic and somebody in my family is a one of those but he

59
00:55:54,720 --> 00:56:01,859
wanted me oh now I'm remembering it was because there was this cute commercial that was on TV and that was why I wanted

60
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:07,260
to be a stewardess because commercial and he was really encouraged me to like

61
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:14,520
why not think bigger and somehow that stayed with me

62
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:21,780
I can't say that's exactly why I have a PhD in Biochemistry but it's you know maybe it's part of the reason why I did

63
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:28,500
think that you know maybe there's something more than just what I thought was cute on a TV

64
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:34,740
commercial but I remember the kindness that he

65
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:40,680
showed me that he asked and listened to what I had to say and

66
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:46,800
encouraged me to think big and I think that was something that uh you know all

67
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:54,300
these years later I remember so maybe all of us have somebody that touched our lives and it was done with

68
00:56:54,300 --> 00:57:01,920
some kindness so even though like we often get the message that okay kindness it's nice to

69
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:08,579
have and maybe it's if you can't have these other qualities you can be kind but actually it turns out to be quite

70
00:57:08,579 --> 00:57:13,880
powerful and meaningful and impactful

71
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:22,380
so but not only that what if it turns out that kindness

72
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:29,180
is the daring bold powerful thing to do

73
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:36,000
what if kindness is actually what turns out to require a lot of strength

74
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:44,339
requires maybe some autonomy and some knowing like what's important

75
00:57:44,339 --> 00:57:50,960
what if kindness actually turns out to be really bold

76
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:57,359
because we all know it's so easy right when somebody else is putting a third

77
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:05,579
person down like oh yeah they annoy me too and then blah blah blah blah and you're down we go or maybe there's a

78
00:58:05,579 --> 00:58:11,460
social media right we just know it's like practically designed for people to be unkind

79
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:18,420
it's just ripe with all of that and what if it's you know to be

80
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:25,319
stand up for that person and say well you know I think maybe forgive them the benefit of the doubt and in this context

81
00:58:25,319 --> 00:58:30,660
what if they really meant that and they didn't mean what's being interpreted to

82
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:36,319
be harmful or whatever it might be

83
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:42,839
so what if rather than jumping into blaming when

84
00:58:42,839 --> 00:58:47,880
things don't go well which is easy to do we blame ourselves

85
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:55,980
we blame others the all the news I keep on going on about the media I'll stop after this but I do

86
00:58:55,980 --> 00:59:02,640
notice that this sometimes our news agencies are designed just about finding who's to blame that's kind of there

87
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:10,920
a reason for existence in some ways but rather than jumping into blaming

88
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:16,200
what would it be like to have some kindness and to have some openness and

89
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:25,079
some warmth and maybe if we can't have openness and warmth maybe to not have disdain

90
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:32,160
to not have this quiet aggression or quiet hostility that's often shows up

91
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:40,500
when things aren't going the way that we want it to go or people aren't behaving the way we want it to behave

92
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:46,859
we want to sometimes you like shake them don't you understand ah

93
00:59:46,859 --> 00:59:54,020
what if we just like notice maybe that thought arise in the mind and then just let it go

94
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:02,819
so what would it be like to have a commitment to kindness as part of our

95
01:00:02,819 --> 01:00:08,660
practice or maybe that is our practice this commitment to kindness

96
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:14,579
which means of course kindness to ourselves so often there's this inner

97
01:00:14,579 --> 01:00:21,240
critic that's berating us making us feel inadequate and that just spills out

98
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:27,240
to others they're inadequate and insufficient and not doing it right

99
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:33,540
and there's this flavor of a bit of aggression or hostility there whether it

100
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:38,940
gets acted out but the point is that it's kind of there's a

101
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:47,339
way in which there's this closing this contraction I know what's better and you are doing

102
01:00:47,339 --> 01:00:53,819
it right me versus the world US versus them I

103
01:00:53,819 --> 01:01:00,680
know it's right and you don't it's not a comfortable place to be

104
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:05,880
for a moment there's this thrill of self-righteousness but then we always

105
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:13,079
have to prop it up and oh my gosh this is not a good life this is a life filled with trying to

106
01:01:13,079 --> 01:01:22,020
make sure everybody sees us exactly the way that we want them to this is a life of never maybe extending

107
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:28,200
ourselves or Taking Chances because we want to make sure they're always looking good so maybe we might not look good if

108
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:33,660
we try something new so what if we have this commitment to

109
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:39,558
being kind to not harm

110
01:01:40,859 --> 01:01:46,380
when I was uh studying Buddhism I remember this so clearly

111
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:51,780
that being in a class where I was the only person that practiced this lineage

112
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:57,180
this tradition of Buddhism everybody else they were Buddhists but in all other Traditions probably every other

113
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:02,760
tradition you can imagine and then Professor asked us so if you

114
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:08,460
had to sum up one word

115
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:15,240
for Buddhist practice what would it be it was surprising that everybody from a

116
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:22,500
different tradition had something different to say but for me at that moment I felt like non-harming

117
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:28,740
so much about practice is about non-harming and this non-harming is kind of like

118
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:34,799
there's a lot of Letting Go that has to happen and the way that we view ourselves and view others there's all

119
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:40,200
these things that are part of non-harming I'm not sure I would say the same thing today but at that time I

120
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:47,880
thought it was it's such an important part of practice well these subtle ways

121
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:53,400
in which we are not kind to ourselves sometimes the most

122
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:59,819
and to not others even if it's not something that we're doing with our overtly with our Behavior maybe it's

123
01:02:59,819 --> 01:03:06,299
something with our mind that we're doing and you know as I said kind of we get stuck

124
01:03:06,299 --> 01:03:11,760
with I know it's better but we might hear this something like a

125
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:17,220
commitment to kindness and we might hear like oh okay I guess I have to be overly

126
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:22,680
nice this way in which we might have this

127
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:28,319
saccharine sweetness like oh yeah everything's fine you can do whatever

128
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:35,760
you want yeah that's fine it's all okay but there's this overly niceness that

129
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:42,900
actually is not what's being pointed to here an overly niceness is a way we might

130
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:50,220
understand is this spiritual bypassing it's this way in which we don't want to

131
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:57,960
be with the difficulties we don't want to acknowledge what's really happening

132
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:05,760
there's a way that we kind of like get a little bit disembodied and we're just like on this surface oh yeah it's fine

133
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:12,119
not recognizing maybe when boundaries have been crossed maybe somebody's taking too much of our time or they're

134
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:17,460
taking too much of energy from us or taking what's not

135
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:22,920
like just crossing boundaries in a way maybe it's not even clear to us

136
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:29,400
but because we want to be overly nice we'll just say oh yeah it's fine oh yeah sure I'll take your dog to the vet and

137
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:36,720
drop you off at the airport and water your lawn and you like all these things and we don't hardly even know them maybe they're not even friends of ours or

138
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:42,420
I'm just making these up but these stories but so I want to make clear that when I'm

139
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:49,020
saying this commitment to kindness I am not saying being overly nice and in fact if we do find ourselves

140
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:54,240
being overly nice then we can just maybe gently ask ourselves

141
01:04:54,240 --> 01:05:00,980
is there something that I'm avoiding is there something that I don't want to see

142
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:06,900
and it might be that we might be something that's uncomfortable that comes up and maybe we could just

143
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:13,680
acknowledge it with like okay that's there I'm not saying that we have to jump into the most difficult the most

144
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:19,799
uncomfortable there can be some skillfulness in not being with it

145
01:05:19,799 --> 01:05:27,000
there's a way in which we might need to behave so that we're not always like holding grudges or that

146
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:32,579
we're not always being filled with bitterness so can we conduct Our Lives

147
01:05:32,579 --> 01:05:40,980
in a way that we can have kindness and take care of ourselves

148
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:47,040
and it turns out this is not so easy it turns out this takes real skill and

149
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:53,298
practice and is a whole practice on itself

150
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:58,500
and maybe it starts with being kind to ourselves recognizing oh yeah this is

151
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:05,280
hard I don't know how to set boundaries I don't know how to say no to whomever I

152
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:12,420
I don't know how to be anything except trying to please everybody all the time or and just maybe

153
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:17,579
feel that that's why the kindness starts this is a recognition of the difficulty

154
01:06:17,579 --> 01:06:23,000
of maybe not being overly nice

155
01:06:24,839 --> 01:06:32,160
but there's a way and also that this commitment to kindness as a way of practice

156
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:39,599
can be a clear like it can be a North star it can be a clear intention of a way

157
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:45,059
that's that can be a thread throughout our life like when we feel confused or we don't

158
01:06:45,059 --> 01:06:51,799
know what to do or it's lots of difficulties or whatever is happening in our life

159
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:57,720
this idea of okay if kindness what's the kind thing to do

160
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:06,900
for myself and for others without indulging and without being overly nice

161
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:12,240
this is a practice itself how to be kind without just indulging

162
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:19,020
yeah I'm not going to do that thing that's difficult because I want to be kind to myself and

163
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:25,319
not acknowledging maybe the fear that's there or the

164
01:07:25,319 --> 01:07:31,799
maybe it's fear about all kinds of things what might happen or what if we fail or what if it

165
01:07:31,799 --> 01:07:40,200
gets really awkward and uncomfortable so this to have this generosity of heart

166
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:46,440
towards ourselves and towards others this can be a real like direction for

167
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:52,920
our life and our practice because maybe there will be seasons of our life in which we don't have a meditation

168
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:58,380
practice for whatever reason we don't have time we

169
01:07:58,380 --> 01:08:05,280
don't feel like it fits in our life so maybe our spiritual practice shows up

170
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:11,819
this way as using kindness as a Direction and there's a way in which that can

171
01:08:11,819 --> 01:08:20,000
provide some stability in our life too sometimes we might feel like I feel so confused I don't even know what to do

172
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:27,838
but kindness can be like okay this can be like a touchstone if I wanted to be kind

173
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:33,560
what would I do authentically kind

174
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:41,818
embodied kind this kindness that comes from a embodied Place Not Just Thoughts

175
01:08:41,819 --> 01:08:50,059
but to place that feels like maybe a mature is a little bit more settled way

176
01:08:52,199 --> 01:08:58,980
and there's a way in that if we were to take kindness a commitment to kindness as a

177
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:04,140
direction of our life it's a way in which I

178
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:09,778
there's a way I'm trying to remember if I have this quote exactly right and I might not but

179
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:17,100
this idea is like being the change you wish to see in the world both of us

180
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:21,080
don't want it meanness

181
01:09:22,819 --> 01:09:28,020
fear-mongering we don't nobody really wants that

182
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:33,600
so even if we take this kindness on as a practice this is a way in which we can

183
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:39,000
be the change we want to see in the world if we're waiting for you know all the

184
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:44,778
decision makers in the world to be the ones like okay we're going to be kind in fact there is an international

185
01:09:44,779 --> 01:09:51,060
kindness day I'm not sure if people are more kind on that day but you know there have been authorities that got together

186
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:56,960
and say okay kindness is important let's make a day where everybody's going to be kind

187
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:05,600
why can't it start with us why can't we be the ones

188
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:13,620
that show up with some kindness maybe to demonstrate what it looks like to be kind to ourselves to not always be

189
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:20,880
berating ourselves sometimes people get together and they that's kind of what they talk about is they're berating

190
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:27,000
themselves in some kind of way oh I didn't do this I should have and something like that there's nothing

191
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,760
wrong with sharing the difficulties in your life but is there a way that

192
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:38,000
folded into that can be this quality of care

193
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:45,000
quality of warmth and so this commitment shows up in the

194
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:50,280
of course how we Act on the things that we say

195
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:58,040
and the things that we think body speech and mind

196
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:04,560
and so of course the things that we think think about others think about ourselves

197
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:10,820
I think maybe it's obvious things that we act we don't do unkind things

198
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:16,739
even when we're driving there have been times that when I've been driving and you know somebody is uh

199
01:11:16,739 --> 01:11:22,980
like drifting into my lane and I don't have anywhere else to go and I just can feel like you know what I feel like oh I

200
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:30,480
just you know I hit the horn but I I just feel like this Rush of uh fear maybe I don't know what it is but

201
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:36,360
I'm not feeling kind I'm feeling maybe afraid at that moment but

202
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:44,400
if we recognize okay this is what humans do humans make mistakes humans aren't

203
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:51,420
perfect maybe if we make this commitment to kindness doesn't mean that we will always be kind

204
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:58,320
it's something about in the same way with our meditation practices we set the intention to be with the sensations of

205
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:04,320
breathing and that really highlights what the Mind does we notice oh yeah the Mind likes to

206
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:10,560
do anything except be with the breath we should come back to the breath be elsewhere come back to the breath in the

207
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:15,600
same way this commitment to kindness kind of highlights everything that isn't kind

208
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:22,260
in our lives kind of shows up the way that we might think about ourselves and think about

209
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:30,360
others and of course the right speech-wise

210
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:39,420
speech includes this idea of you know we say things that are truthful a beneficial timely and kind

211
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:46,920
and sometimes to be kind and timely goes together sometimes we don't say things right then

212
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:55,260
because we know the person is really sensitive or they're in a place of trying to work things out and they just

213
01:12:55,260 --> 01:13:01,639
aren't in a place where they could hear something new or hear something different

214
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:09,540
but I'd like to share a poem that was inspired by kindness

215
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:18,960
and this poem it's written by Naomi shihab Nai who's a fabulous poet and she grew up in

216
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:27,239
Texas and Jerusalem and Palestine three really different places

217
01:13:27,239 --> 01:13:33,540
you know with a lot of different cultural influences and

218
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:41,219
she went on her honeymoon she went down to South America and she she and her bus her she and her

219
01:13:41,219 --> 01:13:48,360
husband were on a bus taking a bus ride down there and the bus was attacked and

220
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:56,159
robbed everybody was robbed and one of the passengers died in the with this robbery so they're on

221
01:13:56,159 --> 01:14:02,120
their honeymoon and this terrible event happens

222
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:09,060
so afterwards a kind stranger helped them

223
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:14,880
and her husband hitched hiked back to a nearby City to get Travelers checks

224
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:22,860
because they didn't have anything and it's Naomi she had knives she was waiting for her husband to come back she

225
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:30,000
wrote this poem so she's a poet and I guess this is what poets do when they're in distress but

226
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:38,600
maybe you've been touched by some kindness so this poem is called kindness

227
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:44,640
and it goes like this before you know what kindness really is

228
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:50,280
you must lose things feel the future dissolve in a moment

229
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:57,239
like salt in a weakened broth what you hold in your hand what you

230
01:14:57,239 --> 01:15:03,480
counted and carefully saved all this must go

231
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:10,500
so you know how desolate the landscape can be between the regions of kindness

232
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:17,219
how you ride and ride thinking the bus will never stop the passengers eating Maize and chicken will stare out the

233
01:15:17,219 --> 01:15:23,159
windows forever before you learn the tender gravity of

234
01:15:23,159 --> 01:15:29,280
kindness you must travel where the person in a white Poncho lies dead by

235
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:35,460
the side of the road you must see how this could be you

236
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:40,500
how they too were someone who journeyed through the night with plans and the

237
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:48,659
simple bread that kept them alive before you know kindness as the deepest

238
01:15:48,659 --> 01:15:54,300
thing inside you must know sorrow as the other

239
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:59,400
deepest thing you must wake up with sorrow you must

240
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:05,280
speak it to it till your voice catches the threat of all sorrows

241
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:12,600
and you see the size of the cloth then it is only kindness that makes

242
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:19,860
sense anymore only kindness that ties your shoes and sends you out into the day to mail

243
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:25,739
letters and purchase bread only kindness that raises it its head

244
01:16:25,739 --> 01:16:33,060
from the crowd of the world to say it is I you have been looking for

245
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:39,260
and then goes with you everywhere like a shadow or a friend

246
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:46,320
this poem is I love it it's powerful in some ways and it has like some ordinary

247
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:52,320
things like oh yeah before you tie your shoes and male letters and purchase bread or

248
01:16:52,320 --> 01:17:00,659
just you're on the bus thinking you're just like everybody else going to wherever you're going

249
01:17:00,659 --> 01:17:06,719
and then she says so you know how desolate the landscape can be between

250
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:11,880
the regions of kindness sometimes it's when they're in our

251
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:18,420
greatest difficulties and the greatest distress is that throws in to highlight some of

252
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:23,820
the kindnesses that we've had in our lives sometimes we

253
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:29,239
maybe are taking some of them for granted or not even noticing them

254
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:35,580
so she starts with saying before you know what kindness really is you must

255
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:42,960
lose things this idea that the kindness of people to maybe restore

256
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:49,040
what you thought you had lost and what you really need what's important to you

257
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:54,900
and she's talking about literally you know money

258
01:17:54,900 --> 01:18:01,620
but there's a way also in which sometimes maybe we felt like we've

259
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:07,320
feel despair or we can't see how we could solve a particular problem we just

260
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:13,260
can't find our way forward with it maybe kindness is a way of maybe helping

261
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:18,780
somebody to see a little bit bigger or to see something that they hadn't seen before

262
01:18:18,780 --> 01:18:23,840
that's maybe a little bit smaller a detail

263
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:30,900
so this idea before you know what kindness is you must lose things

264
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:37,140
maybe there's a way in which having a commitment to kindness we have to lose

265
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:43,320
some of our beliefs our belief systems are thinking that kindness is wimpy or

266
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:49,080
maybe we have to think lose this idea that only certain people deserve

267
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:54,360
kindness or maybe we have to lose the idea that I

268
01:18:54,360 --> 01:19:02,219
don't really deserve kindness or maybe we have to lose the idea that

269
01:19:02,219 --> 01:19:08,580
other people won't be kind to us maybe we're expecting the absolute worst

270
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:15,060
of everybody so we have a chip on our shoulder and people are maybe even frightened of us or don't even want to

271
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:21,659
talk to us so this commitment to kindness maybe we have to lose

272
01:19:21,659 --> 01:19:30,360
some of the beliefs or ideas or Notions that we have maybe we have to like accept

273
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:40,099
that's life has good things and bad things it has awful things and beautiful things

274
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:45,540
and can we accept the reality of the moment

275
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:55,760
it's like this right now not what I want not what I wished for but it's like this

276
01:19:56,580 --> 01:20:01,920
and there's a way of kindness to ourselves maybe in an abstract way could even say

277
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:08,100
kindness to reality to stop denying it to stop turning away like actually it's

278
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:12,500
like this right now I feel awful

279
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:21,000
sometimes we might even like turn towards experiences maybe we don't feel awful maybe there's just something

280
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:27,960
that's you know a little bit annoying a sound that's a little bit annoying

281
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:34,140
when we're trying to meditate don't they no this is my time to meditate why are there those sounds

282
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:40,620
maybe there's a little bit of a hostility or some disappointment or

283
01:20:40,620 --> 01:20:46,140
aggression or something like this maybe a commitment to kindness is

284
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:51,300
having this acceptance or this allowance like yeah okay there's even things that

285
01:20:51,300 --> 01:21:00,539
we don't prefer things that show up the way they show up uninvited

286
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:09,139
or maybe some of this acceptance is part of

287
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:14,820
due to discouragement when we can't help somebody else in a way that we think

288
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:22,400
that would be the most helpful or in a way that feels comfortable for us and we feel discouraged

289
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:28,580
maybe it's a family member somebody really important to us

290
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:37,500
we can come back to remembering that we can be kind

291
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:45,659
to ourselves and to them to them and to ourselves and maybe the kindness is just listening

292
01:21:45,659 --> 01:21:51,140
maybe the kindness is not leaving

293
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:59,780
and having a commitment to kindness requires finding out if can we be strong

294
01:21:59,780 --> 01:22:05,900
and be kind can we be powerful and be kind

295
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:13,739
is there a way that we can be smart and know actually what's the answers and be

296
01:22:13,739 --> 01:22:19,260
kind I have a

297
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:27,239
a friend who knows a lot about the computers I I'm I know enough about computers too

298
01:22:27,239 --> 01:22:33,239
but this my friend is really kind except when it comes to computers

299
01:22:33,239 --> 01:22:39,360
this person is like no it's like this and then do that and then click and then oh my gosh don't you know so there's is

300
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:45,480
there a way in which you can recognize that okay you have a body of knowledge that maybe somebody else doesn't know

301
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:52,679
but can you share it with kindness instead of impatience or insistence like

302
01:22:52,679 --> 01:23:01,080
why don't you know this gee or something like this so this commitment to kindness can we be

303
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:07,020
kind to ourselves at the same time being kind to others not having to choose

304
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:14,520
one or the other but to take the time and maybe the I'm

305
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:22,800
going like this with my hands because it requires some spaciousness to to lean into and figure out what is kind to both

306
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:28,560
me and them sometimes we feel like we have to choose

307
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:34,560
okay well to be kind to them I have to sacrifice what I want or sacrifice ideas

308
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:41,460
I have my preferences which is true right sometimes we do compromise that's

309
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:49,219
entirely appropriate but is there a way in which we can feel what's kind for everybody here

310
01:23:49,980 --> 01:23:56,760
and having this commitment to kindness as I mentioned makes you know just recognizing that we won't do it

311
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:02,820
perfectly of course we want humans make mistakes humans can be

312
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:10,860
unkind to others we can be unkind to ourselves we don't always know the right thing to do

313
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:16,739
and we can be impatient and we don't always remember the lessons that we

314
01:24:16,739 --> 01:24:22,340
learned yesterday some of these lessons we have to learn over and over again

315
01:24:23,159 --> 01:24:31,820
and sometimes you know we do have reactions and we just get caught up in them and kindness just isn't available

316
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:39,540
so having this commitment to kindness means that when we realize that we haven't fulfilled that commitment that

317
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:46,620
we are kind ourselves when we don't have me maybe meet expectations we've

318
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:52,800
had for ourselves so can we just recommit

319
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:58,980
okay yep that wasn't kind okay I'm gonna try this again or I'm

320
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:05,400
going to keep going I'm not going to abandon this whole idea of having kindness as a North star or a direction

321
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:14,460
to go and then maybe I'll end with this poem

322
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:20,820
and the title is on International kindness day so that's how I know there's an international kindness day

323
01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:27,600
that's the title of this poem the poet is Rosemary traumer

324
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:34,860
and it goes like this kindness went out and got itself a new

325
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:40,920
engine a twin turbo premium unleaded V6 cylinder engine something with real

326
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:47,400
oomph something that provides a bit of giddy up when the going gets tough

327
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:54,060
turns out kindness likes horsepower a lot of horsepower

328
01:25:54,060 --> 01:26:00,719
plus it sprung for a direct fuel injection to maximize its power output

329
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:07,800
everyone thinks kindness prefers things quiet and calm but kindness is ready for

330
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:14,639
action ready to Take On The World ready to travel every back road every Highway

331
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:20,280
every Main Street and get this ever loving show on the road there's a whole

332
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:26,699
lot of work to do so I kind of like just the playfulness

333
01:26:26,699 --> 01:26:32,760
of this right or sometimes we do I started saying well sometimes we think it's wimpy or sometimes we think it

334
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:41,040
always has to be calm and quiet but maybe there's a way that you know this power or strength to kindness

335
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:46,139
so maybe I'll end with that and if you I'll open it up if there's

336
01:26:46,139 --> 01:26:52,159
some questions or comments if anybody has something they'd like to say

337
01:27:03,739 --> 01:27:08,940
and Dan there's a comment in the chat

338
01:27:08,940 --> 01:27:15,420
it's just a quote and it doesn't say where it's from it I assume it's the Buddha it says monks

339
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:22,500
these two people are hard to find in the world which too the one who is first to do a kindness

340
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:27,900
and the one who is grateful for a kindness done and feels obligated to

341
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:33,780
repay it can you say can you read it again

342
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:39,179
yes monks these two people are hard to find in the world

343
01:27:39,179 --> 01:27:46,320
which two the one who was first to do a kindness and the one who is grateful for a

344
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:52,620
kindness done and feels obligated to repay it hmm interesting

345
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:58,320
yeah I'm not familiar with this quote and I'm not sure that would be in the poly Canon but maybe it is I'm not even

346
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:05,520
sure the word kindness in poly yeah I'm not sure that I know but thank you for the quote

347
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:12,440

348
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:18,440

349
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:25,219
okay okay oh you you yes you

350
01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:33,120
when you're talking about the influences when you're young this summer I've been watching many many

351
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:39,500
Cary Grant movies at the Stanford theater I love it and they're mostly

352
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:44,940
romantic comedies but as I think about it one of the

353
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:50,280
qualities that his character is almost all the time have is a certain kindness

354
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:55,679
and a very strong kindness you know he isn't sort of a milk toast

355
01:28:55,679 --> 01:29:01,739
character by any means in any of the movies but you know he never

356
01:29:01,739 --> 01:29:09,480
um it's sort of mean just for the point of being mean you know so

357
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:16,920
I think he's been one of my early mentors in kindness from watching all

358
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:24,179
those movies but that's a fantastic Cary Grant I love this thank you thank you Tim for who is

359
01:29:24,179 --> 01:29:31,560
there any quote that you want to bring from a movie or just in general or just this has approaches kindness yeah in

360
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:36,960
general I don't want to put you on the spot but I I can't remember one right now

361
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:43,820
it's great I feel like I want to watch a Cary Grant movie I haven't seen one in ages that's very nice

362
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:52,320
thank you all and I wish you a good rest of the evening and safe travels home
