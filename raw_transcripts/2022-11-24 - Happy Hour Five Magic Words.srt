1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,759
there ah so hello

2
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:14,519
good to see you good to be with you this uh in the U.S the eve of

3
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:20,939
this holiday we call Thanksgiving giving thanks giving thanks and there's

4
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:27,119
so much to say about this holiday and of course it's complicated and and

5
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,220
um challenging history um

6
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:38,579
just give a nod to that acknowledge that and uh

7
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:44,280
what I'd like to perhaps um

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,739
bring in tonight for our reflection is this practice of

9
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:55,280
of appreciating appreciating appreciating

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,320
giving thanks gratitude

11
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,360
um or affirming goodness affirming goodness that's one way we can think of

12
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,960
the practice of appreciation gratitude affirming goodness

13
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:18,780
are appreciating and and we can also appreciate

14
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:27,060
um what you know we we often we often um tend to like or appreciate or be

15
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:34,320
grateful for what is good what is Pleasant but it may not necessarily always be

16
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,680
that way can we also be can we open up and appreciate what is

17
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,460
even if it's not pleasant if it's not [Music] um

18
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,860
if it doesn't feel good in the moment so so just to give you an example I just

19
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:59,579
recently been sick with the flu as I shared earlier and still recovering still you might hear it in my voice a

20
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:06,420
bit and um and I want to relate also another practice in this story so let me just

21
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,819
bring in another yeah so so I want to bring in the theme of of appreciation

22
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:16,980
given that in the US at least this is the week of Thanksgiving so this holiday

23
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:23,700
of giving thanks appreciation turning our mindset so I want to bring another theme in and

24
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,800
um this is um uh thanks to Christine one of the

25
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,840
regulars at happy hour who sent me an email and I think she also sent an email

26
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,440
similar email to to happy hour with a local

27
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:46,860
singer songwriter that she likes and the name of the songwriter is Leah and

28
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,739
her Channel on YouTube because I am Leah and and Leah has a lot of songs on on

29
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:59,640
gratitude and on love and and uh her song so many of them are like mini

30
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:06,239
Dharma talks so so um so one of them that Christine sent and you can look at your mailbox later

31
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,599
please don't do it now oh is this song that inspired Christine and I did watch

32
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:18,000
it too and it's quite lovely so this this singer-songwriter as this song about

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,480
um that's the what's called three three magic words and uh

34
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,700
um in many ways we talk about this theme we teach this thing we practice it

35
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:37,319
together and these three magic words not surprisingly are I love you I love you

36
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:42,959
foreign and and the idea here with this practice which I want to bring in actually and

37
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,739
weave in and we've practiced this actually um here um but the idea when you say I love you

38
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:56,280
isn't so much oh I I have romantic love for you and and I want you and an

39
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,819
attachment and I expect you to love me back no that the idea of these three magic words is is when you open yourself

40
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:10,080
up um to appreciating and you can say we can say I love you to the sun I love

41
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:17,340
you or or the leaves I love you or the Blue Sky I love you or or or

42
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:24,600
um anything else that's in your life your neighbor I love you you know we may not even know that the person who's challenging for you I love you yeah you

43
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,540
you keep expanding my my edges you I love you because I can be more human

44
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:37,919
through you instead of thinking oh you know I'm enlightened perhaps or or or whatever my heart gets to expand I love

45
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,080
you so so hearing the song This I love you

46
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,360
song as she sings it you can check it out later it's just very sweet I love you this I love you that I love you this

47
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,940
guy I love you the earth I love you the tree I love you person who's walking by

48
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:59,160
I love you this sense oh opening up opening up opening your heart up so I

49
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:07,740
was uh this was in my mind today and I was um I was trying it on for size and and what

50
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:13,919
I invite you to to to to to play around with it as we'll explore in a moment is

51
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,440
I'll see what happens in your mind see what happens in your mind when you try

52
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:26,160
it on so and some reactions might be actually humorous might be funny when you try it on and see what the reaction

53
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:33,120
is so as I was trying it on today or I was outside I always love you Blue Sky yeah I made my heart actually open up

54
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,180
more to really appreciate that wow it's it's the fall and it's sunny today wow

55
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:46,380
or the fact that I can be out today I'm not so sick like the past few days I love you Skye I love you body I love you

56
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:51,780
and then and then my mind turned to oh the flu virus I love you virus I'm like

57
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,940
oh that's funny that's a funny thing to say I love you virus so humor came out

58
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:05,160
this sense of this this stance of of holding this relationship ship oh huh do

59
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:11,940
I love this virus well I don't exactly love it but but you know it's been a part of me it's been hanging out with my

60
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:17,280
body for a few days so so it it opens up different perspectives it opens up

61
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,440
different perspectives not to always be fixed in a particular way we see things

62
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:30,660
so for me this particular you know the three magic words I love you brought up a sense of uh humor appreciation kind of

63
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:38,039
releasing the way perhaps I usually relate so so so joining this these three magic

64
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:44,220
words practice with the theme of appreciation and gratitude uh this being

65
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:51,780
the week of quote-unquote Thanksgiving is let's try it on for size and see what

66
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,819
happens let's see what arises um is it more appreciation of something

67
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:03,479
that is might it be a different perspective it might be humor maybe it's resistance and if it's resistance it's

68
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:08,580
fine too like no no this thing I I I don't want to open up to it but maybe

69
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:13,800
these three magic words open our hearts a little more to something and

70
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:21,360
especially with respect to ourselves what if I what if you say I love you to yourself and you really mean it and if

71
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,940
resistance arises you you hang in there with the resistance anyway I've said a

72
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:34,440
lot already lots of themes but let's just ah leave all the words and

73
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,180
practice together and see what happens

74
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:44,780
now let's arrive let's arrive in our seats

75
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,840
ah let's get into our meditation posture sitting

76
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:59,479
up with as much integrity respecting the form

77
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,340
letting our hands be on our lap

78
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:12,840
and if you need to lie down the body needs care in that way that's okay too but I'm going to assume for the most

79
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:19,400
part that you're sitting up you're on a cushion or a chair

80
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,340
and that your feet your legs are

81
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:35,659
well rooted on the Earth your spine is straight upright

82
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:50,600
letting go of judgments letting go of thoughts plans

83
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:58,560
not needed right now not needed whatever has happened before you get got

84
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:05,600
to this point Let It Go let it go take refuge in the Simplicity of this moment

85
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:13,260
you don't have to figure it out you don't have to be a good soldier

86
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:18,860
marching on just be just be

87
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:25,940
do nothing for a moment be humble be simple

88
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:32,240
be an earthworm simple just simple

89
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,800
feel the softness of your body

90
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,680
let your heart relax your body relax

91
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,540
nothing to do to think to figure out to be

92
00:09:54,540 --> 00:10:01,860
be an earthworm ah

93
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:14,839
release release

94
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:40,740
feeling the connection of your body to the Earth your feet your legs your sit bones your

95
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,820
hands with your lap

96
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:53,459
ring the center of gravity of your awareness down down from your head

97
00:10:53,459 --> 00:11:00,139
down to your body let it be in your lower abdomen

98
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:06,500
receiving the breath there just settling

99
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:10,399
for a few breaths

100
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:46,339
receiving the breath receiving the sensations of the body

101
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,920
let the breath be calming soothing nurturing

102
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:26,180
receiving the breath receiving the breath in the abdomen

103
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:34,699
this breath just this breath gratefully appreciatively this life-giving breath

104
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:40,380
entirety of the in-breath the entirety of the Opera intimate

105
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,339
intimate

106
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:52,920
so sweet to be intimate with the breath knowing it knowing it

107
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,920
closely

108
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:11,659
serves as an antidote to destruction

109
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:23,880
scatteredness Which is less satisfying

110
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:29,580
so the breath this gift this anchor grounding in the

111
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:36,380
body thank you brother

112
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:41,059
thank you for your companion trip

113
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:27,320
say with the breath with your awareness

114
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,179
thank you

115
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,400
letting your heart be solved

116
00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:14,220
appreciating what we may often take for granted maybe not if you're

117
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:20,539
having the flu or a cold and you're congested and breaths are hard but

118
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:28,080
you appreciate when there is this breath

119
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:35,059
maybe even when it's hard that it's still here thank you I love you thank you

120
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:19,500
and now like to invite you to bring someone for whom your meta your care

121
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:25,620
flows with ease maybe a child a pet so with whom you have an uncomplicated

122
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:31,200
relationship invite them to your mind's eye to the

123
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,860
space of your heart

124
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:46,200
and as you are sitting with them you're seeing them being with them in this moment see how

125
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,480
their presence impacts you

126
00:20:54,360 --> 00:21:02,960
maybe it brings a sense of ease relaxation to your body to your heart

127
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,400
are you just appreciating them

128
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:21,320

thank you thank you I love you

130
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:37,559
and again I love you not so much as romantic love or expectation for

131
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:43,140
reciprocation but as a way of saying yes

132
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:51,140
to this being is your heart opening up its doors and saying yes to them

133
00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:01,220
appreciating them caring for them sharing Metta

134

137

and expand the door open the door of your heart

151
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,039
and invite someone else

152
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:53,039
maybe someone who's a neutral person for you maybe you've worked with them as

153
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:58,520
a neutral person a neighbor someone who works at a grocery store

can your heart be undefended unprotected

158
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:34,620
sharing its goodness sharing its medites

159
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:40,740
it's well wishing it's care it's kindness with strangers

160
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:45,679
I don't precise don't have to push it

161
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:17,580
and maybe now inviting someone you've had challenges

162
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:23,220
with but you really know deep in your heart they've

163
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:29,120
helped you expand your heart your capacity

164
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:37,919
you've been your teacher can you invite them and thank them for the role they've

165
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:44,240
played in your life thank you thank you I love you

166
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:02,659
let's try it on for size it's an experiment

167
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:33,480
and yourself inviting yourself

168
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,940
the being who's both your dear being sometimes neutral sometimes

169
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,679
person you have challenges with

170
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:52,880
this being who is me who does their best

171
00:30:02,659 --> 00:30:10,559
thank you and breath out breath

172
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:15,980
keeping yourself in my thanking yourself thank you

173
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:21,919
I love you

174
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:35,580
and if resistance arises stints judgment

175
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:40,820
feeling silly thank you I love you

176
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:49,320
see what happens is it disarming is it funny

177
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:55,520
is it a movement of acceptance

178
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:42,080
experiment on your own see what works

179
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:45,559
for you

180
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:56,360
maybe as you sit on the earth thank you thank you hers

181
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:18,380
your heart is resisting to be stretched

182
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,559
the resistance thank you I love you

183
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:34,440
maybe I love you in this case is an acknowledgment is a softening into

184
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:41,419
not the usual ways we think of it experiment on your own

185
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:20,240
can you love your challenges thank you I love you

186
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:29,480

hello hi so special to be with you before Thanksgiving

202
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:03,900
um um they gave out last year too when we were and so with this

203
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:09,000
towards the end it was something like about impersonality because suddenly it

204
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:16,200
was like I love you heartbreak I love you pain I I love you lonely like like

205
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:21,660
hard emotions and then it was just like oh they're like visitors

206
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:28,200
to show me what this is this Human Experience is like like it was

207
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:35,099
um not super personal there was some kind of like space

208
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:42,180
there um maybe because I'm not like in the throes and caught by one of those now

209
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:47,280
but yeah that was what came up for me

210
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:53,780
um that's profound Lisa thank you for sharing that yeah so appreciate this

211

212
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:05,700
your challenges that become the challenges of The Human Condition and

213
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:14,040
this this um really an insight into anata in personality not self-rises yeah

Missy please

218
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:49,079
thanks Nikki yeah uh this is brilliant I you know just never ceases to amaze me

219
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:57,359
that just like sitting silently in a chair here on Zoom with my eyes closed you know some of these practices my what

220
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:03,000
I discovered was that this can require courage you know to the

221
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,099
invitation was there and I didn't need to take the invitation but I did and I

222
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:14,339
did it to the neutral person and scrolling through these different people and I was like wow that uh yeah it was

223
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:20,099
an amazing practice thank you thank you Jesse I love how you talk

224
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:27,720
about um courage I completely agree it takes courage this practice takes courage a

225
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:33,140
lot of Courage the invitations are there and and yet you know sometimes our mind

226
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:38,520
goes oh this is too too dangerous or maybe the mind doesn't say that it says

227
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:44,820
oh this is so silly this is too stupid I don't want to do like or whatever it just comes up with with the reasons why

228
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:52,619
not to do it and it takes courage to say okay thank you I hear you but I'm gonna try this on for size and and expand and

229
00:40:52,619 --> 00:41:00,119
and as as you were sharing sounds like it was quite impactful for you in different ways like this experiment

230
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:05,400
um with these five magic words not just three but through five magic words um

231
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,440
showed up for you yeah anything else you want to add or does it feel complete

232
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,900
yeah no exactly as you said you know just um those voices are like oh this is

233
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:22,020
silly this doesn't make any sense but uh choosing to Step Beyond that exactly

234
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:27,980
thank you yeah yeah thank you thanks Jesse age please

235
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:36,420
please um hello um I'm thinking that um uh I have the

236
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:42,300
um the experience of last week um I'm I'm away from my house

237
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:47,460
and travel I'm not troubling but I lived down in Honduras half the year and my

238
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:55,200
house in Portland was burglarized and so I have the opposite of bounty usually or

239
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:03,300
celebrating Bounty and and um and being thankful for the for I was

240
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:09,359
going to say the things but thankful for things for lack of a better word in our

241
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:16,859
life and um and this was a devastating I have um a lot of had a lot of artwork

242
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:25,140
sculptures and um pretty much totally cleaned it out and broke whatever's there so I'm so sorry

243
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:32,160
yeah it's it's um and luckily I had just been on a on a

244
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:41,099
passionate the passenger retreat in Mexico um a few weeks prior and so I guess I was

245
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:48,540
kind of like in in shape to be able to receive such a blow and just say it is what it is and not um

246
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:54,180
and not do that but it was um you know considerable amount of um

247
00:42:54,180 --> 00:43:00,780
of possession I I hear and I appreciate that and and this might be

248
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:05,880
I um since there this is the theme of tonight too

249
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:13,200
um and it might be too soon so so this may not be the practice right now for you Paige but but when the time comes

250
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:20,280
when they're the stability and the Equanimity comes um of seeing that there is stuff in this

251
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:25,619
world and the stuff there's goodness Beauty and also they weigh us down is

252
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:32,400
there a way to be grateful for is there a way to see the good not right

253
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:40,260
now this might be too soon whether ouch might still be too strong but there always is a way to to find Liberation to

254
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:46,800
find Freedom to find more ease especially when things are let go of um even if it's not what we would have

255
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:53,579
chosen so I'll just offer that for for a reflection for you to sit with me I think I can understand that in theory

256
00:43:53,579 --> 00:44:00,480
and think you know sometimes people are a great point if they have a if they have a house burned down and then and

257
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:08,460
then say Oh start over but thank you thank you Paige thank you yeah

258
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:14,220
ah oh Rose asks um what are the five magic words the Five magic words is what I kept

259
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:21,300
repeating through the um the uh guided meditation thank you I love

260
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:27,780
you thank you I love you five magic words thank you I love you

261
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:34,260
so so um with that I'd like to invite us to to

262
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:41,640
uh engage to together in small groups and offering our ears for listening our

263
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:49,440
hearts um in appreciation of each other and there might be words there may not

264
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:58,560
be any words in are coming together and um the prompt or tonight is is there

265
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:04,560
something challenging something challenging perhaps I mean you can choose something good actually

266
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:12,060
something good and something challenging let's do it both something good and you can say thank you I love you something

267
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:18,359
challenging that you can say thank you I love you and and we do a couple of

268
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:24,119
rounds starting um first a person who uh alphabetical

269
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:30,900
order first person will offer something good they can say um thank you I love you next person next

270
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:37,740
person then the second round would be something challenging you can expand your heart to to have that relationship

271
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:42,900
with and um and

272
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:48,480
um what else do I want to say um and then the future rounds could just

273
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:54,180
be um just open conversation so so with

274
00:45:54,180 --> 00:46:01,200
that uh I'm going to create the rooms and again as always

275
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:08,339
please only speak from your own experience not uh uh you know managing

276
00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:14,220
the group just just offering a little bit from your own experience and letting other people have their space and if you

277
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:20,339
want to say pass that's perfectly fine you can pass and be kind to each other

278
00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:25,880
be kind to each other so here we go the rooms are created

279
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:32,040
and uh enjoy oh and we've got about just a

280
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:38,760
minute for any Reflections that might have come from either the practice silent practice or the practicing

281
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:44,579
Community this reflection these two uh questions

282
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:50,660
any Reflections what did you notice Kim please

283
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:58,440
I noticed that um with with the group with us going

284
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:03,599
around and and saying I love you

285
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:09,060
um it normalized it or I was uh struggling a little bit with it during

286
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:16,020
the meditation I could kind of get there but to have the three of us saying it

287
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:21,180
um really normalized it was like yeah this is great this works

288
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:28,319
awesome very nice thank you so much Kim for for verbalizing that for acknowledging that

289
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:34,140
because I that's exactly it I think when you hear it out loud other people saying

290
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:40,079
it and being held witness and that that um yeah that in that community that Norm

291
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:46,260
that normalizing feels like yeah or one's heart can land into and sort of sort of in the meditation like I don't

292
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:53,339
know what does that exactly mean I love you I don't know it feels wild it feels weird but oh yeah thank you so much for

293
00:47:53,339 --> 00:47:58,500
that and and um for those of you who are on the mailing

294
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:04,680
actually if you're not on the main language get on the mailing list because uh uh Christine already sent pointer to

295
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:10,619
this um uh person doing the the I Love You

296
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:16,619
song and and the way they do it is a little different than when when how we did it tonight is they do and you know I

297
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:22,980
love you Skye I love you the chair I love you this I love you that's what that can become part of what you

298
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:28,920
practice too I love you this and might feel silly but it's like oh I love you chair I love you computer you let me

299
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:35,460
communicate with my Sangha you know I look so there's a sense of naturalness that can come here but but tonight we

300
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:41,400
did thank you I love you which is the Five magic words practice instead of the three magic words of just I love you

301
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:46,500
anyway all these practices are so profound and can really shake you out of

302
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:52,920
your usual way of uh habitual way of going about the world with with more

303
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:58,500
meta with more care with touching into our Humanity anyway thank you so much

304
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:04,740
for practicing for showing up for um yeah for

305
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:13,280
or being part of the Sangha may all beings be happy may all beings be free including ourselves

306
00:49:18,839 --> 00:49:21,980
thanks everyone
