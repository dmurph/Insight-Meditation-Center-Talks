1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:11,559
okay welcome folks um good to uh good to be with

2
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:17,758
you so

3
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:27,400
um many years ago Gil said something like um it's not you who gets free it's that

4
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,960
you free everything else

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,079
and um that resonates with that the line from the um maim andaya that I shared

6
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:48,600
some weeks ago only when when there is what belongs to a self is there

7
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,359
self it's not you who gets free it's you free everything

8
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:01,440
else so we uh practice in this

9
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,438
Spirit how much might we

10
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,840
free so finding a finding a

11
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,920
posture e

12
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:26,640
so if you're sitting stretch up towards the sky with the spine

13
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,840
give everything else to the Earth

14
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:15,720
just arriving with your breath

15
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:59,360
just letting it all take its place amidst awareness

16
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:19,720
what's excluded often haunts us

17
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:42,919
and yet to include is not to be entangled

18
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:51,120
with to be entangled with is just another kind of

19
00:04:52,840 --> 00:05:00,000
exclusion excluding the fear or the stickiness or the whatever

20
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,680
so we

21
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,720
include

22
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,639
and let our life flow through awareness

23
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,639
not clanking into any

24
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,918
whirl pools of

25
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,720
clinging so we

26
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639
breathe

27
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
e

28
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
e

29
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,520
e e

30
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,000
and how how much of experience can we free

31
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:49,680
to free our images and

32
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,959
sounds to free our pain

33
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,880
Tranquility to free our feelings our

34
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:17,399
whole Rich affect of life to free our

35
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:25,920
thoughts not to be free from thought but to free our thoughts

36
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,160
what a strain possessiveness

37
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:57,600
is so much

38
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,319
tension and owner

39
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:28,120
ship what can be freed as we

40
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
breathe

41
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

42
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

43
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
e

44
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,160
e e

45
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,600
what whatever tastes like self whatever

46
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,480
tastes like

47
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,120
me like I am

48
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,320
this we let go

49
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,199
the whole play of uh

50
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,160
appearances rising and

51
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:30,959
passing becomes uh

52
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,040
personal e

53
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,639
and we I

54
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:43,240
move out of the position of protagonist into just a kind of another little

55
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:51,199
incidental subplot the Majesty of awareness

56
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,880
don't take a stand

57
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
anywhere

58
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

59
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

60
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

61
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

62
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

63
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

64
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

65
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,640
e e

66
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,600
there's more safety and openness than there is

67
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,799
in insisting upon continuity

68
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:40,880
assuming that what comes next to

69
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
me

70
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

71
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

72
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,480
e e

73
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,799
in uh greed and virion

74
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:18,158
fear these

75
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:30,360
forces maybe uh intrinsically create the

76
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,679
impulse to

77
00:24:52,080 --> 00:25:00,320
control great delusion always has an owner but in

78
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:08,360
equinity the self thins out

79
00:25:52,799 --> 00:26:00,240
just resting for these last few minutes

80
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

81
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

82
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

83
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,158
e e

84
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,190
[Music]

85
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,080
e

86
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,240
okay

87
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:06,880
um so I'm uh at a

88
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:16,640
uh at a stoplight uh this morning and uh I had uh just seeing the

89
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:22,559
uh Dylan film with uh with my parents a couple days ago and was

90
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:30,240
listening to one of his um early songs um M take this badge off of me I can't

91
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:38,000
use it anymore it's getting dark too dark to see feel I'm knocking on heaven's

92
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,799
door and was thinking about

93
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:50,840
uh my friend uh Ann Buck uh died uh this

94
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:58,880
week I think 93 50 years of Dharma practice and um

95
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:07,960
while she was uh in in the hospital um her house in the Palisades

96
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:17,480
um burned to the ground uh it's a place I i' had spent decent amount of time and

97
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:26,039
um yeah tragedy for sure um and in some moods she might have

98
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:31,200
said um something

99
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,679
like a better view uh of the

100
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:42,440
Moon and earlier earlier in the morning I was

101
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:48,919
flipping through Timothy Snider's book on um resisting

102
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:57,320
autocracy and um was surprised how many of the chapters the maxims are

103
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:06,039
essentially about fairly ordinary CA and emotional

104
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:12,760
Clarity and I'm at the stoplight I'm sipping a a

105
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:18,278
good cup of coffee and

106
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:25,120
um yeah enjoying and I heard somebody say um

107
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:31,519
when two molecules of hydrogen and one oxygen are coming

108
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:38,120
together I think they don't know they don't have any idea that they

109
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:46,440
could become water and um and I'm aware of all of

110
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:52,880
this um amidst all of this I'm

111
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,919
uh happy very happy and

112
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:04,960
then this person dressed head to toe in

113
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:12,880
fluorescent psychedelic confetti riding a bright pink bike

114
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:22,759
pedals past me I'm like okay this is life

115
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:29,399
here and so we um

116
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:34,600
we do our best to live the

117
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:39,639
Dharma and you didn't um come to

118
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:45,120
a uh memorial service here and I don't want to impose

119
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:52,519
my private um loss but I imagine Anne Buck's life has some meaning for most

120
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:59,960
any Dharma practitioner and I I knew an from

121
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:07,679
Retreats with uh shins and yang um starting in I think

122
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:14,040
2003 and cumulatively we probably sat many months together often next to each

123
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:20,800
other close to each other and uh you really get to know a

124
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:27,599
person in the silin and sometimes I I'd sort of feel

125
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:35,240
like like i' I'd sit next to her kind of draft you know like um the leader of a

126
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:41,240
you know like one drafts behind the the lead Rider in a bicycle race or

127
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:49,000
something they're breaking the wind kind of and um I remember one time we we both

128
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,919
arrived early to a a two we Retreat year end

129
00:34:54,919 --> 00:35:04,240
Retreat casad de Maria and and uh Santa Barbara and uh we were both we kind of

130
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:10,440
both sort of caught each other greedily looking

131
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:19,800
for the best spot in the room you know we were there early like before registration opened I think and um and

132
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:29,078
we said to each other like first we cling then it's time to let go

133
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:38,760
and I remember the first time I got kind of a big gulp of freedom I remember her

134
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:48,920
saying afterwards like I saw you I saw your eyes I knew what was

135
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:58,400
happening and we um we taught some um dayong retreats in LA

136
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:04,200
and we would always like plan really carefully and orchestrated and have an

137
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:10,520
outline and it was kind of like whatever we did it would just get really teary in

138
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:17,000
the room you know and perhaps it was meaningful for

139
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:24,400
you know um yogis to see two people separated by almost 50 years who love

140
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,440
each other and um and she was fierce she was kind

141
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:37,160
of fierce so when she said it's okay to really love yourself you

142
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:44,000
know you you knew she wasn't playing she was a restaurant tour I

143
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,880
think owned a few restaurants ran some restaurants and um and I'm not sure I

144
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:58,119
would want to have been her Sue Chef I can say that but when she

145
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:06,599
said it's okay to love yourself you did did what the woman

146
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:13,760
said and um ever since um I moved from

147
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:20,560
LA to the Bay Area she uh you know about 12 years ago

148
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:28,760
or so she she suggested that um we chat each month on the phone

149
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:36,319
just about life and practice and you know I thought you know I thought maybe

150
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:43,119
still think we were speaking as friends but I don't know I kind of suspect in

151
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:50,880
some way that um she wanted to just quietly support me

152
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,040
offer her blessing try to ensure I didn't do anything especially

153
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:04,599
stupid you know and we would have these like very lovely free flowing conversations about kind of whatever was

154
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:12,440
important uh but the Dharma was stri through all of that and

155
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:19,520
her yeah her confidence in the Dharma seemed to me seemed

156
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:26,720
unshakable and somehow yeah the path would just Infuse

157
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:32,359
everything we would discuss and just sort of feeling like oh yeah she's

158
00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:37,480
sharing her mind and

159
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:47,000
um and greed hate and delusion just kind of looks so silly in the the

160
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:55,560
mirror of that openness and that kind of made whatever

161
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:03,599
life was for each of us us somehow okay

162
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:12,720
enough and there was something about her her home um the view

163
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:19,960
from her backyard which is quite striking now in ashes you know I

164
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:28,200
looked on the whatever the was tracking it you know hoping home was

165
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:34,839
okay and um but uh you know

166
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:39,960
the Cal Fire has photos of each house

167
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:46,599
damaged or okay and it's just

168
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:52,640
ashes um but that view that view a month ago

169
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:59,480
just a month ago that view reminded me of her of her mind in a way I know she

170
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:07,760
likeed to sit out there practice you know it's very gorgeous view some grass and the kind of Hillside

171
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,720
Santa Monica Mountain Hillside and um overlooking the water

172
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:19,319
the Pacific and an had uh had practiced with

173
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:25,280
shinen and young um to whom we both feel like we

174
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:31,960
owe our life in some ways maybe but also

175
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:41,240
withe and and with sometimes just kind of very simple way just remark how much

176
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:50,960
kind of ready access she had to a mind that uh you know classically

177
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:58,000
described as intrinsically empty naturally radiant ceaselessly responsive

178
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,440
and she would ask you know like how easy is that for you how accessible is that

179
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:10,800
for you there's a lot of safety in that that

180
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,000
guides you through disease macular degeneration

181
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:24,079
through family pain pain of the world that uh keeps you keeps you

182
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:31,520
well and as she entered her 90s is I would um I would call at our appointed

183
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:36,800
time and I was never certain how she would

184
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:44,480
be and I could hear her aging and um I would help her sometimes with a

185
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,680
word or ignore it because it didn't matter

186
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:57,680
and uh still till the end the the kind of emotional resonance the the presence of

187
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:05,839
dhma was fully intact and uh there's something precious

188
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:12,040
about uh kind of spiritual friends who

189
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:20,318
can uh hear the hian tone of one's

190
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:31,640
heart and um know there were many many received her

191
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:38,520
her blessings and so um it's worthwhile

192
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:43,839
to reflect on life and death the gifts

193
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:51,480
of of fearlessness you know uh to reflect on that that question

194
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:56,559
I posed uh maybe a couple months ago how

195
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:02,920
How would our love look were we little less

196
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:12,359
afraid um for Andrew Wood by uh poem by

197
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:20,359
uh James Fenton what would the dead want from us

198
00:43:20,359 --> 00:43:25,640
watching from their cave would they have us forever

199
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:32,319
howling would they have have us Rave or disfigure ourselves or be strangled like

200
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:38,760
some ancient emperor slave none of my dead friends were

201
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:45,000
Emperors with such exorbitant tastes and none of them were so vengeful

202
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:53,680
as to have all their friends waste waste quite way in sorrow disfigured and

203
00:43:53,800 --> 00:44:00,920
defaced I think the dead would want us to weep for what they have

204
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:07,280
lost I think that our luck in continuing is what would affect them

205
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:13,079
most but time would find them generous and less self-

206
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:18,760
engrossed and time would find them generous as they used to be and what

207
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:24,839
else would they want from us than an honored place in our memory a favorite

208
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:29,920
room a hallowed chair privilege and

209
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:37,680
celebrity and so the dead might cease to grieve and we might make

210
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:44,359
amends there might be a pact between dead friends and living

211
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:54,078
friends what our dead friends would want from us would be such living friends

212
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,440
okay thank you
