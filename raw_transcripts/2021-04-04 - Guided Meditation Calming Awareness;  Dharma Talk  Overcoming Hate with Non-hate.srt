1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:09,040
good morning everyone and good day welcome to our meditation

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,920
and as a few words of introduction um

3
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:28,080
i'd like to mention that one of the classic functions of

4
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:35,360
buddhist meditation is to quiet still calm

5
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:43,360
the inner fires and the idea of a blazing fire that

6
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,039
burns the wood that sustains it that fuels it

7
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:56,239
as a metaphor for the kind of inner fire that burns us that harms us and that

8
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:04,000
particularly these fires are the fires of greed hatred and delusion and

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
in all kinds of ways in which we are excessively agitated caught up spinning around

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,600
can be seen as fires and it is to calm these fires it may be

11
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,840
extinguished with extinguish the ones that are the most painful and

12
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,520
harmful and the water that in a sense the water that can

13
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,560
quiet calm quench these fires is mindfulness

14
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:48,119
if mindfulness contains qualities of peace qualities of non-assertion

15
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:57,360
non-um greed non-hatred non-delusion

16
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:04,079
and so the art of mindfulness practice is to find a way to be aware of our experience be aware

17
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,080
of our breathing be aware of our body be aware of our feelings emotions even our thoughts and what goes on in

18
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,920
the mind the how we're aware of it is so crucial

19
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:23,840
and how is it for you in the way that your awareness your mind works that

20
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:30,720
you can how is it that awareness itself can feel like

21
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,959
a calming influence on you in what way can you be aware of something as simple as the

22
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:45,599
breathing be aware of some of the inner fires that exists for you maybe agitations that exist that

23
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:52,480
the awareness itself is reassuring it's settling it's spacious

24
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:59,840
it begins to remove some of the fuel that keeps us agitated because we make

25
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,840
space for it's there or we bring calmness to what's there or reassurance to what's

26
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,640
there so each of us are probably going to find a little different way of being aware

27
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:20,000
um but the principle is how can we be aware in such a way that it's settling for us

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,640
it settles us into the present moment it settles us into a kind of being at peace with

29
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:34,319
this experience of life that we're sitting with so to experiment to look to search

30
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,239
inside of yourself how to be aware so the awareness itself

31
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,599
is not caught in analysis and judgments and shoulds and shouldn'ts

32
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,920
but it's a reassuring awareness a calming awareness

33
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,000
that encourage and supports a deep settling here

34
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:07,200
so entering into a meditation posture

35
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,840
one that hopefully will allow you to be both alert

36
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,799
and relaxed

37
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:33,120
and to see if there's simple ways you can adjust your attitude for awareness

38
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:43,840
the task of awareness so that you're a little bit more

39
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:51,280
the awareness is a little bit more stable and centered and

40
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,560
reassuring and with this awareness that

41
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,080
reassuring awareness

42
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:13,360
to take a few long slow breaths and begin to process of relaxing your

43
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:20,240
body deep relaxation

44
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,840
full relaxation

45
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,120
and letting your breaths return to normal

46
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:58,160
and then considering how awareness can be have some peaceful quality to it

47
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:08,080
let your awareness shine upon or settle upon your belly

48
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:21,840
and as you exhale to relax your belly soften

49
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,840
do

50
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:49,840
letting the light of awareness shine on your shoulders

51
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,680
and as you exhale relax your shoulders

52
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,840
soften

53
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,840
and also to soften your face

54
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,840
your temples around your eyes forehead

55
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:31,840
relaxing your face

56
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:41,680
and then breathing normally experiment a little bit to see

57
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,720
how you can be aware of breathing how you can know that you're breathing

58
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,720
as you breathe so that awareness

59
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,840
is peaceful

60
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,759
maybe he has a soft accepting quality to it

61
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:17,280
the awareness itself doesn't need the aware the breathing to be different than how it is

62
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:24,400
awareness is just there as a friend to accompany

63
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,840
your breathing

64
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:44,080
awareness free of greed free of hatred ill will

65
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,440
free of doubt and delusion

66
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,079
awareness that's there peacefully present

67
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,800
with the inhales and the exhales

68
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:10,800
and if something else arises as you meditate see if you can discover how to be aware

69
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,839
of that peacefully

70
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:24,880
a peaceful awareness that calms the fires inside of you

71
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,320
that cools the fever

72
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,240
that settles the agitation

73
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:51,279
a simple awareness that has a feeling of reassurance for all things

74
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,480
so that what is not reassured can begin to relax

75
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:05,839
relaxing here into the present moment

76
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:55,360
if your mind is wandering off in thought engage your awareness more fully

77
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,000
engage your awareness to be here

78
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,639
with your breathing your body

79
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,120
engage a peaceful quality of awareness

80
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,199
awareness that is non-contentious

81
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,839
an awareness which is reassuring settling

82
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,839
peaceful

83
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,840
so

84
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,120
and in the last minute or so of this sitting

85
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:49,200
is there some way you can adjust your awareness so awareness itself is a

86
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:57,200
peaceful influence on you a calming influence

87
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:15,840
just to be aware simple awareness spacious awareness

88
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:25,360
an awareness that maybe spreads through your body and heart

89
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,840
with a reassuring calm

90
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:43,840
reassuring inner peacefulness

91
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:22,639
and then to imagine that you can now open your awareness up out into the

92
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:29,600
world then light that your awareness your consideration of the world is like a

93
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,440
light that you shine and there's some way that you can hold

94
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:41,200
the world also in a calming

95
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:47,360
awareness in a peaceful awareness

96
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:57,440
maybe an awareness that's reassuring that there is a way

97
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:03,120
to calm the greed the fires of great hate and delusion

98
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,840
for everyone

99
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:15,760
and perhaps our ability to be peacefully aware can allow us to

100
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,599
look at the challenges and fires of this world

101
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:31,359
to look at them directly to not turn away or not get agitated

102
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:38,638
ourselves an honest awareness

103
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,480
of the challenges of this world

104
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:50,320
gazing and gazing upon all of it

105
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:57,359
as if our gaze is coming

106
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:06,320
stilling and may it be

107
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,920
that whatever we could do to offer to this world around us

108
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,838
he contributes to the happiness and welfare of everyone

109
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:24,320
may all beings be happy

110
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:33,200
may all beings be safe

111
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,078
may all beings be peaceful

112
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:47,040
and may all beings everywhere be free

113
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:02,000
it may be the way in which we're aware and present for this world

114
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:10,720
maybe may we be aware in a way that contributes to this well-being

115
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:15,359
may we know the world

116
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:27,838
in a way that brings peace

117
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:43,050
[Music]

118
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:37,839
so warm greetings to all of you as i begin this talk

119
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:43,920
there is a renowned verse from the dhammapada

120
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:51,200
the ancient anthology of buddhist poetry verse

121
00:37:51,200 --> 00:38:00,720
and it goes something like this hate is not overcome by hate

122
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,480
but by love alone is hate overcome

123
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,359
this is an ancient truth

124
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:19,839
so hate is not overcome by hate by love alone is it overcome

125
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:26,880
and it's possible that translating the ancient world word as love doesn't really capture the

126
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,320
full richness of this verse and i'll talk about that a little later

127
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:39,119
but i want to evoke this very you know well-known verse

128
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:47,119
that it's really a central idea in buddhism that we cannot

129
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:52,960
pacify hate by adding more hate to the fire

130
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,440
hate is considered to be a

131
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:06,320
fire that burns the one who's hating that harms the one who's hating

132
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:13,760
so to respond to hate with hate means that there's two people now

133
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:23,440
who are burning and suffering who are wounding each other wounding themselves both

134
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:32,480
and this is such an important topic in the climate of the world really i don't know if there's

135
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:38,960
more or less hatred in the world than there's ever been before

136
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:44,400
but we're certainly becoming acutely aware of it here in the united

137
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,599
states and perhaps

138
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:58,480
perhaps we're coming into an era of this country where there is the possibility of

139
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:07,119
beginning to recognize the tremendous harm that hate has

140
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:14,480
that maybe it was difficult to see before when the hate was expressed

141
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,680
with you know so you know violently that people are

142
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:27,519
mostly spending their time protecting themselves from lynching and

143
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:36,400
riots and all kinds of things and hate was certainly present back then

144
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:42,960
but maybe it was not what was being addressed directly but now we come to a time where there's

145
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:49,920
a real heightened sensitivity to what hatred looks like how hatred speaks

146
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,359
how it spreads as a kind of poison through our society

147
00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:02,319
and i speak about this because of in the wake of the the rising hate crime against asian

148
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:09,359
americans here in california just a month ago there was a arson and

149
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:17,599
um vandalism of a buddhist asian buddhist temple in in los angeles

150
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:25,680
a japanese buddhist temple the pure land tradition of buddhism a very peaceful peace-loving form of

151
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:31,680
buddhism and and the temple was partly destroyed

152
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:38,240
not dramatically but enough to be quite disturbing and

153
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:46,079
and you know these are this is a tradition of buddhism where has been in

154
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:51,920
this country for well over 100 years it's possible that membership of their

155
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:58,079
temple is or at least of that form of buddhism their members have been here in the

156
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,359
united states for six seven pep it's possible even eight

157
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:10,560
generations by now and um and to

158
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:19,040
be the recipients of hate as if they don't belong in this country is quite painful

159
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:25,680
for all of us in this family that we hope to be in in this country

160
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:31,040
and so in some of these images we've seen of elderly asian americans being attacked

161
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:37,520
on streets right here in san francisco is one of them and it's not like over there that this

162
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:43,040
kind of violence happens but it's close in and it's uh

163
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:49,520
it didn't start then but it certainly raised people's worry a year ago when there started to

164
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:55,839
be hateful things said to people of asian descent especially chinese descent here

165
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:04,079
and locally in the peninsula because of the coronavirus

166
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,960
and somehow

167
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:17,760
spreading of animosity towards people of any kind of asian descent because of a virus

168
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:26,079
like this so the ease in which sometimes people hate this part of the issue here in this country

169
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:32,000
and and certainly there's a need to stand in solidarity with

170
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,359
the people who are the recipients of hate and certainly to

171
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:42,880
send solidarity with the asian americans who are struggling with this and with fear and

172
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,079
worry and about what it means to be out in public even or

173
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:53,119
out in public at night and we know what's coming

174
00:43:53,119 --> 00:44:00,640
and um and to offer our protection and to create places of sanctuary where it

175
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:08,319
feels safe to come and not just welcome to come but feeling like it's home like they belong and it's a

176
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:13,520
little bit hard here at imc to be maybe teaching here all alone

177
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,640
um these this last year but you know it's i want this place to be a

178
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:24,560
home for all people and for everyone to come here to feel like they belong and

179
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,920
even not just welcome not just belonging but feel like it's their place where they

180
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:37,680
can really engage fully and bring themselves completely here

181
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:45,440
so you know certainly i'm concerned for the

182
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:52,319
membership of imc that are asian american the membership of imc that are black

183
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:59,040
and all the people who are been the recipients of hate crimes here in the united states

184
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:04,800
the word hate crime is an interesting term because the definition of hate in this

185
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,319
regard is different very certainly very different than some of the other meanings of hate and

186
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:18,079
that we use we use the word hate uh when people say that um you know they hate spinach

187
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:25,280
it's uh it's a very different connotations very different meaning of the word than when we say we

188
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:31,040
hate an ethnic group or we hate one of the

189
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:38,400
you know i think i think the the highest number of hate crimes in united states is against african-americans

190
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:45,119
and um one of those other really high numbers is lgbtq

191
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,880
um and um

192
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:57,520
so the um the um to be a res so when there's a hate

193
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:02,960
crime it's not just you know that an intent you know a dislike of someone

194
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:10,319
but one distinction some people make also between like anger and hate i hate hate as a hate crime is that

195
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:17,119
anger is for a particular behavior a particular event particular situation

196
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:24,160
whereas racial hate or gender hate or

197
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:29,359
ethnic hate or something it's hate towards a whole category the whole

198
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:37,440
person uh not the behavior of the person what they say or do but the whole being of the person uh

199
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:45,839
and and their family and their and so it's not just a singular emotion

200
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:51,760
but it's an attitude a disposition a way of seeing it's an interpretation

201
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:57,839
that's overlaid on the totality of who a person is and that's why hate crimes

202
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:04,480
and expressions of this kind of ethnic and category crimes is so total why it's so difficult

203
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,599
for people and so painful is because it's a diminishing

204
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:15,839
contempt of who they are as a as a human being and to have that repeatedly to be

205
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:22,960
recipient that you as a human being are somehow worthy of my

206
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:28,160
hate is uh quite difficult and then to know that that's a lingering

207
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:33,359
disposition a lingering attitude it stays means that you know it's not just

208
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:38,559
a mistake of the moment or an incident of the moment passion in the moment but it's something

209
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:44,240
that stays and will be here and continue and continue

210
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:50,319
and to be the recipient of the victim of hate crimes it's not just individual who

211
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:58,319
suffers but also the families in the community because it's known that it's it's it's in some ways related to all

212
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:06,160
those together so it's a really a fabric a tear in the fabric of society

213
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:11,280
it's a rupture in our ability to be together

214
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:19,680
cooperatively harmoniously as fellow citizens fellow companions

215
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:27,839
in our humanity it's also kind of a this diminishment of people's humanity

216
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:34,559
and and this is one of the great tasks i think of our society and for ourselves and our times is to

217
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:41,119
learn how to see the humanity of other people and how to share our humanity with other

218
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:46,160
people there was i i saw an interview recently of um

219
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:51,520
between i think an imam the religious leader of a mosque and the

220
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:56,640
neighbor of the mosque a man who had been high on

221
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:02,800
drugs heard about some uh uh

222
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:08,559
violence i think it was the paris shooting uh massacre where all these people died

223
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:14,240
in paris by some isis

224
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:20,960
kind of followers and he came home high on cocaine and

225
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:26,079
and were just you know angry at muslims there all his idea was that they were he said he

226
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:32,240
had been listening to a lot of social media and so he thought all muslims were somehow violent and

227
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:38,319
terrorists and terrible people and so he shot up the building next door the

228
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:46,400
mosque and no one was hurt but still he shot it at it so he was arrested and went to jail and

229
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,599
um for the for what he did and he apologized for what he did and you know he i think when he was no

230
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:57,280
longer high he understood what he had done and the mistake he huge mistake he had made and when he

231
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:05,119
apologized the people in the mosque the religious leaders of the mosque forgave him and apparently brought him

232
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:10,720
food and little gifts in the prison and when he was released because he lived

233
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:17,440
next door they invited him over to the mosque and and uh and they were able to tell them a

234
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:23,359
little bit about the what their form of islam was and and he was shocked he found these people

235
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:29,359
to be fantastic wonderful people and peace loving people and and who had

236
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:36,160
forgiven him and as then he brought his friends over and to see them and they were all kind of discovering the

237
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:42,800
humanity of each other sharing each other's humanity getting to know each other which is not so easy not possible when

238
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:49,599
there's hate not possible when there's that categorical idea that someone is somehow

239
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:56,880
contemptible and so how do we

240
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:04,160
respond to hate as individuals and society and from a buddhist point of view we

241
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:12,079
don't respond with more hate and so to take a lot of care it's hard

242
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:18,160
to avoid doing that it's hard not to be upset with them those people who are doing it of

243
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:24,480
course there should be of course they shouldn't be of course we should take a strong stand

244
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:31,280
against the acts of violence against these acts of this level of hate and uh

245
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:37,920
and hopefully stand up and help protect our fellow humans who are struggling with this kind of situation

246
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:43,440
it affects all of us but we shouldn't hate and so in this

247
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:51,520
dhammapada verse it says hate is not overcome by hate and common translation is by love alone

248
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:57,280
is hate overcome but the actual uh language of the original language of the

249
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:06,000
of the line it literally says by non-hate is hate overcome and so non-hate

250
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,680
is a larger category larger points to a wider range of responses

251
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:18,160
than love love maybe is too hard too difficult to draw up love and expect

252
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:25,040
we're always supposed to be loving and and maybe it's not even appropriate as the as the first response or

253
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:31,839
as the response situations of hate and so the question is what is non-la

254
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:39,839
what does non-hate mean and most literally it means not to hate and so

255
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:47,760
the idea of loving i think is a great one and and and the motivation to love

256
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:54,640
it can arise out of deep meditation practice in meditation practice where we let go

257
00:52:54,640 --> 00:53:00,000
we quiet all the fevers of great hate and delusion we settle and discover a deep level of

258
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,559
peace and well-being within a settled peaceful contented reassured heart

259
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:12,319
we discover that there there is a way of living a way of being

260
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:19,440
that becomes more important uh like one of the most precious things that i have to live there can be a feeling of

261
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:26,480
kind to kindness love friendliness compassion that radiates from within and with

262
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:33,440
this is this feels like home this is the this has integrity this is the place of

263
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:40,720
of um value of how to live this life and then to feel a commitment that that

264
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:47,520
this is how i want to be and so what kind of what can exist rather than being loving

265
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:54,240
there can be the wish to be loving we can't always love but maybe we can

266
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:59,760
always have the aspiration to love and sometimes that aspiration to

267
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:05,200
love means that the best we can do it today

268
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:10,319
is not to give in to our hate our hostility

269
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:19,920
maybe not giving in to hate maybe the wish to love commits us to pausing sacred pause

270
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:27,040
to hold in check any movement we have to hate us to hate

271
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:34,400
we we we hold and check our tongue we don't speak words of hostility we hold our our hands

272
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:41,040
in check to not express any physical expressions of of hostility

273
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:46,400
that this learning to to hold ourselves back

274
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:54,640
because we want to love is not a kind of repression but rather it's a kind of expression

275
00:54:54,640 --> 00:55:01,839
of something that's deeper that wants to come out something deeper that's that's saying

276
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:07,760
wait hold it there's something more important here don't lose yourself don't give in to

277
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:13,040
something which adds to fragmentation alienation

278
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:19,920
don't give in to something that's going to burn yourself that some of the dramatic images of hate

279
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:25,680
and metaphors for hate and buddhism is that of a poisonous snake which is biting

280
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:32,079
itself or that of a fire that is burning itself when it burns

281
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:38,079
so hate we the fire of hate burns the person who's hating

282
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:43,520
uh the poison of hate poisons the person who hates

283
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:50,400
and one of the one of the dynamics of hate is that for sometimes hate is a

284
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:57,440
person's response to their own pain their own hurt and it's often said that

285
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:02,559
that hate that hurt

286
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:09,200
can evoke hate kind of blaming others and trying to

287
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:17,920
avoid the pain we feel ourselves by attacking other people and blaming other people and and turning the attention outward

288
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:26,559
so hurt can evoke or hate but then hate

289
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:32,880
in return evokes hurt and there you see there comes in a

290
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:39,440
vicious cycle one leads to the other and round and round and gets stronger and stronger

291
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:46,960
hate evokes alienation and alienation

292
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:53,200
is a condition that promotes more hate that when we end up hating uh we're

293
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:59,760
separating ourselves from the humanity of other people and then we're more alone unless we then

294
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:06,240
find companionship in other people of hate and we think we're connected then the mutual cause of hate what we're

295
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:12,160
hating but it's not really a very deep connection it's a shallow connection

296
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:20,720
and to get somehow supported or feel enlivened uh by hate is a kind of self-alienation

297
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:27,359
and the more we're alienated from others inhalating from ourselves then the more

298
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:35,200
the more that drives further hate hate brings alienation and

299
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:43,680
alienation promotes even more hate in buddhist language buddhist ideas

300
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:52,960
hate is a form of bondage and to be to be free

301
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:59,440
to to freely um you know uh do the wishes of our

302
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:05,520
jail keepers or jailers is not real freedom so to feel have the

303
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:12,319
freedom to express the hate and feel to be free and wonderful to express it freely is really doing the work of our

304
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:18,400
jailers it's just enslaving us or jailing us more and more in bondage

305
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:25,760
that people who are hating are in fact caught and diminishing themselves and jailing

306
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:33,280
themselves in these very strong feelings to find freedom is to find freedom

307
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:38,720
from hate to find the ability to allow something that's deeper than hate

308
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:45,599
to come forth and and move through us and so for those of us who are

309
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:54,079
practitioners one of the great possibilities for us is not to diminish ourselves because we

310
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:59,280
might feel hate or we might feel animosity or we might feel

311
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:07,119
we have prejudice and bias but rather to turn the light of

312
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:13,839
awareness on that to really be honest about that learn to see it and recognize it

313
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:20,480
in whatever form it takes our anger hostility even to anything

314
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:28,400
to keep turning back 180 degrees away from the object of our hostility

315
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:34,559
our prejudice our bias to what it's like for us to have the bias

316
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:41,680
the prejudice the hostility or even the intense hatred that occasionally can exist

317
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:48,960
and really be honest about it and see it and if we want to love ourselves

318
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:54,079
then we want to have the sacred pause and don't give into it but look at it

319
00:59:54,079 --> 01:00:01,119
deeper and deeper and deeper what's going on here and um

320
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:08,000
and then to see find by and and bring with that the awareness that's calming the

321
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,440
awareness that is peace peacemaking the awareness is not hating or in

322
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:21,680
conflict non-contentious awareness so we can start relaxing and settling

323
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:27,760
the fires relaxing the hurt the alienation relaxing the way in which

324
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:33,839
we recoil from pain feel our own pain deeper and deeper

325
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:42,400
until we find where the healing is where the um where there is peace

326
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:49,599
where there's wholeness maybe where there is love and we discover that when we respond to

327
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:55,119
hate in the world with non-hate

328
01:00:55,119 --> 01:01:03,040
that maybe it takes the form of generosity sending presents meals to someone in

329
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:08,960
prison who hated us maybe takes a form of forgiveness

330
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:15,280
the imam who was talking about forgiving the man who shot their mosque said it makes sense it made

331
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:22,839
sense to forgive him because he had apologized and so to discover the ability to

332
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:27,920
forgive to forgot discover the ability to

333
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:34,720
be friendly we don't have to be to love someone to be friendly and in

334
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:40,000
these all these expressions maybe we do discover how to bring more love into the world

335
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:48,640
how we bring more of a peaceful settling pacifying presence into this world to

336
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:53,839
benefit this world that's so challenging here

337
01:01:54,160 --> 01:02:00,798
so i think one of the great tasks

338
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:07,280
these days in the united states and perhaps many countries in the world one of the

339
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:13,440
great noble tasks the important tasks is for us to

340
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:19,760
stand in solidarity with everyone who is a recipient of hate and hate

341
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:25,599
crimes the black people in the united states

342
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:32,480
the indigenous people the hispanics the lgbtq the asian americans

343
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:39,039
and the list goes on and on and also but to really more than just stand in solidarity and

344
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:45,839
support to be actively involved in making this world a better place and a safer place

345
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:51,760
for all and understand as deeply as we can the roots of hate in ourselves

346
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:56,880
how this works and to learn to develop the strength and the courage and the

347
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:03,680
confidence to always wish

348
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:10,000
always want to be loving it doesn't mean you have to be loving

349
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,440
it's a it's a difficult task but we can always want to do it and in

350
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:20,799
wanting to do it maybe we pause sacred pause to avoid

351
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:26,400
causing more harm and we at least don't

352
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:34,160
express actively our hostility to anyone and maybe then slowly we can

353
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:42,640
begin learning how really to meet the challenges of

354
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:48,720
this world with expressions ways of being and

355
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:54,000
loving and caring and and standing up

356
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:01,599
and speaking up in ways that are going to heal the great divides of our

357
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:06,799
society let's discover the common humanity of

358
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:12,640
all of us so that we don't live fractured

359
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:21,440
but we live together as a community a fellow a family a society

360
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:27,838
that cares for each other they all of us care for

361
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:38,960
everyone we encounter thank you
