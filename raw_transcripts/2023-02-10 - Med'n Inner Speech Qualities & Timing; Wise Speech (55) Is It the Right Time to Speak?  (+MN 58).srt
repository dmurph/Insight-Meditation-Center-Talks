21
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,760
without a type

22
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:37,819
on the uprightness supported by the heart

23
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:44,940
it feels so good to have a sense of integrity

24
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,959

00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:14,640
not slumping a sense of Integrity if you need to lie

29
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,220

the sense of alignment

31
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:35,660
Let the Body the soft tissue be relaxed and soft I don't have to be tight

32
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:28,020
now let the breath be received in the abdomen lower part of the body

33
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:34,280
bringing down the center of gravity from the head where it usually is

34
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:42,979

38
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:28,139
internal speech as we have been practicing together

39
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:30,860
this week

40
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:39,240
is it spoken with a mind of love and kindness

41
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:46,520
so beneficial that's it idle chatter

42
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,380
internal Idol chatter

43
00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:00,860
is it even true said factual

44
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:09,199
it was a great Harmony or is it divisive

45
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,960
you're welcome to just choose one of those

46
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,720

00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:35,759
Idle chatter okay title chatter I know okay smilingly

shot you have shown the light of mindfulness on the inner landscape

50
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,860
and you let it go

51
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,740

myself foreign

99
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:31,740
greetings friends so this week we have been exploring a

100
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:37,559
wise speech together the different um

101
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:46,460
the different teachings the different questions that Buddha asks us directs us to ask ourselves

102
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:55,559
so I wanted to um to um do a quick review as I've already

103
00:31:55,559 --> 00:32:01,799
done in the guided meditation and add the last one uh today which is so

104
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:08,100
important and that is is it the right time is it the right time to say what

105
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:15,779
I'm about to say it's at the right time and this is particularly important when

106
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:21,539
um we're saying something that is challenging for the here to hear it's

107
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:28,080
disagreeable and celebrity says but before I get into that I want to share

108
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:35,880
with you uh the six guidelines that I've said that I've mentioned they actually amalgamation of of different parts of

109
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:41,700
the suttas and and you might have heard only five and I'm giving six and you might have heard slightly different ones

110
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:48,000
so I've brought all of them together because they're also wonderful I couldn't just choose this and leave that

111
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:55,620
so in my thoroughness I've brought them all together and and uh so I just I wanted to share the the suta references

112
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:01,520
with you so so uh in uh

113
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:07,740
sn45.8 the Buddha defines also elsewhere as well it's not the only place defines

114
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:15,059
why speech or right speech appropriate speech as abstaining from lying from divisive

115
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:21,539
speech from abusive speech and from idle chatter so these four not lying and we

116
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:28,080
talked about truthfulness right uh divisive speech not abusive speech uh

117
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:35,360
and no idle chatter and then in an 5.198

118
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:42,960
he gives five guidelines for well-spoken speech for why speech is it Timely

119
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,240
true gentle beneficial

120
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:55,260
connected uh beneficial means connected to the goal of the path and spoken with a mind of Goodwill so usually those five

121
00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:02,940
are the ones that teachers teach but in in another Sutton I didn't write the

122
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:09,300
reference it's elsewhere in my nose and it'll take too long to grab the Buddha also talks about is it true and factual

123
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:14,398
it makes the stick State distinction that is it true and factual not just

124
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:21,440
true um so that's another thing that I've tried to bring in the teachings today

125
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:27,720
um and in mn58 majima nikaya 58 which I

126
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:32,878
will talk about more today um he specially gives additional

127
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:40,858
considerations uh for saying what is disagreeable what is um challenging for others to hear and if

128
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:47,280
it's beyond fact if it's already true and factual and beneficial one still has

129
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,740
to wait for the right time so timeliness shows up in various teaching very

130
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:57,780
important so let's let's talk about that a little

131
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:05,220
bit so um in let's before I talk about this

132
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:11,400
um let's say you want to have a relationship conversation with with a

133
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:18,000
friend with a serious conversation and yeah all of these um

134
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,420
all the um uh guidelines we have talked about yeah they are met what you're

135
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:31,440
going to say is true it is factual it is what happened um it it's going to create Harmony in

136
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,079
your relationship you're gonna say it very gently uh gentle to the ear goes to

137
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:42,480
the heart um it's beneficial for your growth both

138
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,300
of you coming closer together supporting each other and you're going to be speaking with a mind of Goodwill love

139
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:54,660
for both of you but your friend is sick right now they are ill or they've just

140
00:35:54,660 --> 00:36:00,060
lost someone or they've lost their job it's not the right time to have this

141
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:07,560
conversation of course it isn't um no matter how much you want to get it off your chest and just have it and get

142
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:14,460
it over with it's not it's not wise it's not the right time um similarly if you want to give someone

143
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:20,880
feedback or or it's not wise to just put it in an email and send it off and get

144
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,160
it off your chest it's kind of actually cowardly you you really want to to reach

145
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,400
out have a conversation with them it will reach actually Reach Out make a time you know set a good time there's

146
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,760
something I want to share with you just give them a heads up and then set up a time to either have a phone call or meet

147
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:45,000
with them in person even better and have the conversations just the right time create the right circumstances you never

148
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,700
know you know they might open the email they're very very difficult uh time in

149
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:56,280
their lives if you just don't know what's going on they might be at the funeral you know leaving your funeral

150
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:03,200
who knows anyway so the right time is it the right time to say what I'm about to say

151
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:10,560
um in addition to all the other things so even all the other things are are

152
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:16,020
um um met all the other conditions are met

153
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:23,339
so I wanted to now share a little bit about this where the Buddha really gives us teaching and it is so beautiful

154
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:30,320
um it's Maji manikaya 50 um see 58 as much money 58

155
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:35,940
and this is the setup so here's a little story so the setup is that

156
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:41,660
um that Prince um um

157
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:47,099
prince abhaya prince abhaya uh has gone

158
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:53,060
to uh neganta nataputa and liganton

159
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:59,579
apparently was one of uh um Buddha's Rivals at the time

160
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:05,400
so this Prince goes to them having a conversation and and then this is this

161
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:12,180
rival Buddha's rival uh says you know Prince you can go and refute the words

162
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:17,460
of gotama the contemplative Buddha and

163
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:24,180
you know if you refute his words then you'll become more Mighty people would

164
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:30,960
say wow Prince Abaya has refuted you know this wise man's uh words and the

165
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:37,500
way you can do that is go to him go to him friends and say

166
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:44,880
um uh Lord would you uh Lord Buddha would you um would you say something would you

167
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:51,240
say words that are on dear and endearing and disagreeable to others would you do

168
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:56,359
that and if the put it says [Music]

169
00:38:56,359 --> 00:39:03,720
see and if the word it says um uh that he would say it then you would say well

170
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:09,720
what's the difference between you and the run of the male person who would just say things that are disagreeable to

171
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:14,760
people and if he answers no

172
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:20,099
um then you would say well uh gosh then

173
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:25,920
um you know it's that's you know you're you're afraid of other people you know

174
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,740
you won't say something that's disagreeable um and

175
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:37,140
um and basically it would be uh it would be in a you know either way you would

176
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:43,400
get them either way you would get them so basically just there's there's like more detail about this gets to

177
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:50,820
Devas and devitals without getting to the into the details but anyway keeping the story short uh to get to the point

178
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:56,940
um the Buddha that they're trying to set the boot up so so the so Prince Abaya

179
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:03,180
goes to the Buddha and says so would you actually tell would you speak things words that are unendeering and

180
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:09,000
disagreeable for um for others to hear and basically

181
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:17,280
the Buddha um is silent and essentially he says it depends it really depends and then he

182
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:23,720
gives this beautiful teaching and Prince Abaya you know bows and and it is is

183
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:30,140
devoted to the Buddha anyway so so here is the teaching and it's so beautiful basically

184
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:36,000
he says it really depends if if I know it to be

185
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,180
um and basically he gives this table of conditions that if it is

186
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:49,320
um if it's unfactual untrue unbeneficial and on endearing and disagreement to

187
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:54,660
others of course I won't say it because those other conditions are not met now

188
00:40:54,660 --> 00:41:01,619
if it's factual and true but unbeneficial and un endearing and

189
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:09,000
disagreeable to others I still won't say it even if it's true and factual but there's no benefit in saying it so I'm

190
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,520
not going to say it if it is true and factual it is

191
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:23,339
beneficial but it is on endearing and disagreeable to others to hear I have the sense of

192
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:28,440
the proper time for saying it so waiting for the right time and then it continues

193
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:34,380
there are three other clauses if it is on factual untrue unbeneficial

194
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:39,480
but it's in endearing and agreeable to others this is an important one so it's

195
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:45,960
not true it's not factual it's not beneficial it's I you know but it's endearing basically you're saying

196
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:51,839
something that other people want to hear there's no benefit it's not even true and factual

197
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:58,500
um he doesn't say them beautiful right so wise so wise

198
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:04,260
um because sometimes as lay people maybe we say something that other people want to hear but it's like yeah it's not even

199
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:10,260
Bachelor it's not beautiful teachings a couple more of the words of the Buddha

200
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:18,060
um if if the atagata knows it to be factual and true

201
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:24,300
but unbeneficial but endearing and agreeable to others he doesn't say them

202
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:30,780
so in this case now we're raising the bar a little more it is true but it's unbeneficial and other people would love

203
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:36,960
to hear it um he still doesn't say them so if it's not beneficial even if it's true and

204
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:43,260
other people would love to hear it it's endearing and it's sweet still it doesn't seem because it's not beneficial

205
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:51,660
and I love this last one I love this last one so if the target knows it is factual it

206
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:58,619
is true it is beneficial and it is endearing and agreeable for others to

207
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:06,200
hear he still has a sense of proper time for saying them why is that because the

208
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:12,420
katagata has sympathy for living beings ah that just touches my heart so even if

209
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:18,960
all of those conditions are satisfied he still says it at the proper time proper

210
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:25,140
time why because he has compassion sympathy he has compassion through this word simply can be translated as

211
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:30,359
compassion because he has compassion for living beings a lot of compassion choose

212
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:36,839
the right time choose the right time so ah these teachings are so beautiful and

213
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:43,680
just so wonderful to be able to share them with you what what a joy what a delight so so

214
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:52,200

215
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:58,079
