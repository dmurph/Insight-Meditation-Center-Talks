00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,200
foreign hello everyone welcome back

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,240
my name is Maria stratman I'm sitting in for Gil for install this week

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,480
and just to note early in this sit I thought

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,800
I heard what sounds like the beginning of a failing smoke alarm you all know

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,439
that those intermittent very loud noises and so my hope is that

6
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,579
it was a fluke but if you hear something don't panic

7
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:42,899
otherwise we'll just stay here anyway so

8
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:52,020
um this week we have been talking about blamelessness blamelessness as the

9
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,840
um the antidote to self-criticism self-blame

10
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,760
piling on of things that we do to ourselves about how how we are not succeeding

11
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:13,140
and we're we're teaching we're thinking of it as blamelessness because it has a little bit more positive vibe to it you

12
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:20,100
know it's how do we live in the absence of self-criticism

13
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:27,360
how do we establish the Equanimity of blamelessness this is here this is not here so we

14
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,560
talked about the beginning of the dhamma Pata and I want to just repeat that as we go into this next topic so all

15
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,720
experience is preceded by mind led by mind made by mind

16
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,479
speaker act with a corrupted mind and suffering follows like the wheels of the

17
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:52,020
cart behind the hose of the ox all experience is preceded by mind made

18
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,659
by mind led by mine made by mind speaker act with a peaceful mind

19
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,960
and happiness follows like a never departing shadow and I repeat that because it's the it's

20
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,080
that final happiness follows part that I find encouraging

21
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,660
that if I can find the peace in my heart always going to be well there's a

22
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,940
there's an element of trust there but today we're going to talk about

23
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,599
doubt doubt is perhaps one of the most Insidious

24
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:34,379
hindrances to practice and one of the things that most often leads to self-criticism doubt is that is

25
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:42,720
the undermining the word doubt comes from the Latin word dubitare meaning to hesitate

26
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,879
so we stumble in our practice but also as we hesitate we give the

27
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:53,519
chance for all kinds of other stories to come in and tell us how it's not going to work so

28
00:02:53,519 --> 00:03:00,959
unlike my usual habit I'm going to begin with a poem and this is this is a Jane hirschfield

29
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,060
poem and it's called My doubt my doubt

30
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,099
I wake doubt beside you like a curtain half open

31
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:16,800
I dress doubting like a cup undecided if it's been dropped

32
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,099
I eat doubting work doubting go out to a dubious Cafe with skeptical friends

33
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:28,379
I go to sleep doubting myself as a herd of goats sleep in a suddenly

34
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:33,420
gone quiet truck I dream you doubt nightly for what is

35
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:41,400
the meaning of dreaming if not that all we are while inside it is in transient amorphous in question

36
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,459
left hand and right hand doubt you are in me throwing a basketball guiding my knife

37
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:52,799
in my fork left knee and right knee we run for a bus for a meeting that surely

38
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:59,400
will end before we arrive I would like to grow content and you doubt as a double-hung window settles

39
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,879
obedient into its hidden pulleys and ropes I doubt I can do so

40
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:10,980
your own counterweight governs my nights and my days as the knob of hung lead

41
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:16,500
holds steady the open mouth of a window you hold me my kneeling before you

42
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,560
resistant stubborn offering these Furious praises I can't help but doubt you'll ever be

43
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,340
able to hear me

44
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:34,680
I doubt everything I doubt this I doubt that I doubt the other I pull it into myself it's my doubt everything about

45
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:41,240
this poem epitomizes the nature of doubt and the and the truly

46
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,919
undermining aspects of it once we begin doubting We Begin we hold on to that

47
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:54,000
doubt and it becomes something that guides it well I can't believe uh why can't I believe that I can't

48
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,600
believe that

49
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:06,600
it often arises when our desired outcome is not realized hey we have an idea it's like we make a a deal with Universe if I

50
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:13,259
sit every day then I'm going to have marvelous insights and I'm going to be a kind person and

51
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:18,300
as if as if just because I want it to be this

52
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:24,000
way it should be this way and if it's not this way

53
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,380
well it actually happens is we suffer but we're very used to as humans trying

54
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,780
to find out the cause of what is endangering us what is threatening us

55
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:43,020
what makes me feel not safe and then we have this myth that we

56
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:48,360
should be able to fix that and then when we can't fix that doubt

57
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:54,000
arises well okay it's my method so we begin to doubt practice we begin

58
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,600
to doubt that I know how to do it we begin to doubt the teachers we begin to well it must be the the chair I'm

59
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:06,060
sitting on or the cushion I'm sitting on we we throw up reasons

60
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:15,020
why we're not realizing the outcome we desire and we're missing we're missing the fact

61
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,580
that what we're suffering from is simply things not being the way we

62
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:27,240
want them we want things to be other than they are

63
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,280
which always gives rise to suffering but not only do we want things to be

64
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:39,360
other than they are but we think we have responsibility for that we think that it's our job to make sure

65
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,180
that we're happy hold on just a second here

66
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:59,340
we're perhaps least happy when we don't know why something is true

67
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:02,780
I'm gonna have to clear my throat

68
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:12,600
we think we know why we need to know why something is happening so we can fix it so we can shape it so we can control it

69
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:18,060
we can make it what we need it to be what we want it to be and if that doesn't happen

70
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:24,599
doubt Creeps in that that little note that says oh if I

71
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:30,060
were better if this were different ah but it's not happening

72
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:36,180
it's not happening and so and so we come to a conclusion

73
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:41,940
the uncertainty is so uncomfortable for us it must be that we're doing something

74
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:48,660
wrong it must be that this job is wrong it must be that this person is wrong

75
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:54,240
because I have to have something to blame I have to blame something I have to

76
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,360
blame myself if I can't find anything else to blame I blame me

77
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:12,240
where we find ourselves is in a place where we're trying to find out

78
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,699
why am I thinking this why is this here

79
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:23,160
and it Digs at us and it Digs at us and we begin to dig into it what is

80
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:29,400
happening here what is happening here and everything seems to shift and nothing I do seems to work out I'm

81
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:36,060
probably just going to be late anyway if we could say ah

82
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:41,339
I'm probably going to be late and stop

83
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:49,140
oh late you know sometimes I find myself in my car and I'm late because I've tried to

84
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:56,220
put one more thing in and I find myself gripping the steering wheel and leaning forward and I remind

85
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:02,760
myself I can't get there any faster than the car and I sit back

86
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:09,540
this is how we deal with doubt it's ah doubt uh-huh

87
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:15,959
and we come to realize that doubt like everything else arises and passes away

88
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:21,060
it's just that in the midst of doubt we doubt that we know that

89
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,500
we don't everything

90
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:32,339
what we need to do is think about what are the thoughts we're investing in

91
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:38,880
would we investing our energy in so when doubt arises for me

92
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:45,959
I think okay I'm doubting I'm doubting yeah curiously this morning when I was

93
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:51,300
thinking about okay what what's going to be the centerpiece of the talk this morning

94
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:56,700
I began to doubt that I'd be able to come up with anything that was going to be interesting or new to say about it

95
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:03,860
and I felt that that creeping sense of oh no oh no oh no

96
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:10,339
and I said oh yes I'm quite familiar with this it's just doubt

97
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:17,399
and unless I give doubt the rains if I give doubt if I reify

98
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:23,540
doubt if I make it a thing it's just doubt

99
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:29,339
it's just down it doesn't have to mean anything

100
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,080
it's just doubt

101
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:44,240
sometimes we forget that thoughts are empty they're just thoughts

102
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:53,760
the ability to be in the presence of Doubt is something that we cultivate and

103
00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:00,060
we cultivate it by surviving it for one thing and we say oh well

104
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:05,459
yesterday I was so full of doubt today I'm not certain but

105
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:12,120
huh it doesn't feel as strong as it did or in that last moment I felt down I

106
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,480
thought oh no oh no I don't know how to do this

107
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,779
the reason I began with the dhamma Pate again is because I wanted to emphasize that it's really what's going on in the

108
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:31,339
mind that is creating the condition that leads to doubt

109
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:39,620
what are the thoughts that we're grabbing onto are we grabbing on to all the times when things didn't work

110
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:47,899
are we willing to take a risk it really comes down to a sense of safety

111
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:54,300
can I feel safe even if I am full of doubt

112
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:59,959
well It's Tricky it's hard to hold those things together

113
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,980
we don't we're not comfortable with the uncertainty of doubt

114
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,579
but we don't have to be comfortable we don't have to be comfortable

115
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:22,140
we don't even have to be doubt free we just have to

116
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:30,139
come up with that little piece of faith that says I'll wait and see what happens

117
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:38,640
I'll wait and see what happens it's like stepping out of the room when you're angry or when you're confused or when

118
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:47,639
you find yourself out of touch just pause and say doubt

119
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:55,740
doubt learn what doubt feels like so that you can recognize and not be

120
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:01,620
surprised by it when it shows up in your life to not get so far into thinking about

121
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:07,019
doubt that you're down in the pit before you say oh that feels like doubt

122
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:13,440
it feels like doubt so then you watched out and you say ah doubt looks like this it has this kind of shape this is what

123
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,320
it does with me the interesting thing that I have discovered

124
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:26,579
is when I am most full of Doubt when I'm most uncertain when I'm certain that the

125
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:32,579
teacher is wrong and the place is wrong and I'm wrong and I'll never sometimes

126
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:39,540
in the middle of retreat I'll discover I've forgotten how to meditate totally just can't meditate I don't even

127
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:46,980
remember what it means I'm so lost and I'm very happy in those moments

128
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:55,200
because what I realize is something's about to happen when I am most full of doubt

129
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:02,579
my experiences not what I believe about it my experiences when I am most full of doubt

130
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:07,980
something is about to happen it's rather like I I think I told this

131
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,380
story to you the other day but I'm not certain maybe it was in the question and answer I was talking about fear and

132
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:19,139
being on the side of the mountain and and having to call it fear and instead we're trying to talk myself out of it I

133
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:24,420
said fear I'm afraid what am I afraid of I'm afraid of falling off the mountain

134
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:30,060
the only thing you can be sure of is you can't stay here

135
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:35,720
and the realizing that you can't stay here

136
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:43,380
freeze you it gets to the place where you can say oh I wonder what's going to happen

137
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:49,560
as soon as you open yourself up to the Curiosity of I wonder you're you break

138
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:56,940
the bonds of the doubt that says I know I can't rely on

139
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:02,220
and you have the beginning of confidence which by the way

140
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:08,160
is one of the first of the five faculties for a spiritual practice is the development of faith and confidence

141
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:15,060
it is the backside of doubt every time you come out of a moment of

142
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:20,220
doubt every time that moment rejoice and

143
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:26,760
realize ah one more tip for confidence one more tick for trust

144
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:32,459
one more tick for I'm safe just with me

145
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:37,560
I'm safe it'll be okay

146
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:43,800
what will be okay is I'm still here not that it's going to be the outcome that I

147
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,959
want not that I'm going to come and give this talk and be amazingly brilliant

148
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:54,959
but that I will be here the intention will be here

149
00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:01,800
the thoughts will be here the heart will be here this is what I can rely on

150
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:09,079
in the midst of everything else I am still here

151
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:16,980
no requirements for how I'm here just here

152
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:22,019
from this blamelessness Rises

153
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:27,959
where I stop expecting something I stop expecting something of myself and I'm

154
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:36,740
simply here still here despite everything still here

155
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:42,959
we don't have to give up everything we don't have to be brilliant we don't have

156
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:49,440
to be wise we just have to realize

157
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,699
the is-ness of just being here

158
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:03,540
I don't have to believe anything I can just experience this

159
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:08,660
this is enough this is enough

160
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:15,860
for now all the other expectations can come after that

161
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:31,860
there was a I read an article the other day by Dan Harris in the New York Times and he is the guy that has uh 10 happier

162
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:39,539
podcast which is Buddhist related and he talked about visiting with Adam a lot of llama recently and

163
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:45,480
his struggle with the word uh selfish that all practice seems somewhat selfish

164
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:51,120
and the the dominata said sorry ah

165
00:17:51,120 --> 00:18:00,020
Dalai Lama said you know it's wise to practice wise selfishness

166
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:06,720
and I thought about that and said you know this is the point at which the doubt am I doing this right am I doing

167
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:14,160
it wrong why is selfishness why is the tension to just this

168
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:20,640
and then from here I reconnect with my intention from here I take just the next

169
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,679
step and see what happens

170
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:32,299
just see what happens thank you

171
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:40,100
so hopefully that is useful

172
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:45,380
and if you have any questions I'd be happy to entertain them

173
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:50,520
hey thank you very much Maria that's a lot to chew on and I'm sure if anyone

174
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:56,880
has any questions uh you can go ahead and in YouTube uh post them in chat and

175
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,419
we'll try and get to as many as we can and in Zoom if you want to post them in chat or raise your hand

176
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:11,039
you can do so as well okay we've got Stuart oh right on the

177
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:18,559
line so Stuart go ahead and uh um unmute yourself and

178
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:26,220
hi hi thanks that was very helpful very encouraging talk

179
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:34,500
but while you were talking about doubt I found myself substituting the word worry for that I'm

180
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:40,220
just wondering if what you're saying about that applies equally to worry

181
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:47,700
they're very similar aren't they now worry is doubting the outcome that you desire you know you can you can

182
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:54,299
substitute the words one for the other you can also look at it as there are

183
00:19:54,299 --> 00:20:00,480
lots of elements to worry but it is the uh it is the fear that

184
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:09,840
what I wish to be true turns out not to be true and in doubt it is the fear that all of

185
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,000
my best wishes don't come true don't aren't

186
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,419
realized so down and worry are very very similar they have a

187
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:27,200
they they both have the the quality of

188
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:33,360
wanting wanting wanting leaning into something I want and

189
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:39,120
and the fear the fear that I can't have it and it comes down to the fear

190
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,360
in the end for that form of Doubt so I would call worry a form of Doubt so yeah

191
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:52,980
I think it's very very similar thank you and the the the antidote is

192
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:58,860
also very similar okay right now this is what's true right now

193
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:04,220
this thank you

194
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:10,620
Marie we have a this is not a question but it's more uh a

195
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:19,320
uh a comment from YouTube uh LG uh says one of my favorite things

196
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:25,740
from aam assuming that's Alcoholics Anonymous is don't quit five minutes before the

197
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:31,260
miracle would give me space from doubt and an invitation for patience

198
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:37,679
um and uh I don't know if anyone's familiar with the the book The Dip this kind of sounds something

199
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:43,760
similar to that you know don't quit before the payoff comes

200
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,340
uh so

201
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:55,919
it's doubt is full-blown I realize something is about to happen for me

202
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:02,220
uh so that is a wonderful quote yeah don't don't quit right before the payoff

203
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:10,700
um yeah I I I once experienced an entire

204
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:16,140
month of a Persian in a retreat and I uh

205
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:22,020
because of that I doubted everything I doubted the teachers I'd doubted the place I was at Spirit Rock I was never

206
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:29,940
going to go back to Spirit Rock again it was a terrible place the teachers were all horrible I was just in the pit and I

207
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:37,080
did that for the entire month and the only virtue of the whole thing was that I became very familiar with aversion and

208
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:45,299
doubt and I know what they feel like and what they the shape of them are and and that experience allows me to see it more

209
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:51,299
easily when it arises so you know if all else fails just see what

210
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:56,779
you can learn from that from from being there with that

211
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:05,419
so uh next and uh Patron

212
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:12,179
thanks Patrick um thank you this this very timely for

213
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:18,600
me or maybe always as Timely um I experienced doubt constantly all the

214
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:25,320
time and I sense when I'm like more Curious that it has a lot to do with recognizing that

215
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:34,020
I have no control and recognizing that things are subject to change and unsatisfactoriness and and

216
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:41,400
all these things and that maybe there's some part of me that's fighting that reality or trying to protect me from it

217
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:48,179
like well if I just like really really question everything I'm doing maybe I'll come up

218
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:54,720
with like the solution the the thing that is like uh in like

219
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:01,140
is not affected by change and and you know things falling apart

220
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:08,159
um and and I think as I get older I've Just Seen Cycles happen so many times I've

221
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,559
seen myself go like yes this is the thing like this is the way and and then

222
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:19,740
it's like black and then coming back around and so seeing these cycles and

223
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:25,440
and and so what I sense is that there's somewhere deeper to reach or a sense of

224
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:31,500
of faith and groundedness um as we say about taking Refuge but I

225
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:40,380
often find that hard because I feel it very much in my body it's really a like nervous system kind of like fear

226
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:48,179
um so I don't really I'm trying to get to the question in this it's something about like how to how to work with um

227
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:53,460
with doubt in the body and like

228
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:59,700
what is the anchor that um that helps

229
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:06,600
just sort of let doubt be there but draw from something deeper to find a deeper

230
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:12,539
source of of um of Faith or or confidence in just

231
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:19,140
being a human and whatever might come from that yeah so

232
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:26,279
uh so if you were listening to you if you were listening you might come to the place where you'd

233
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:31,340
say oh that must be so painful

234
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:39,559
and if you were listening to you you would you would feel that piece of tenderness in yourself

235
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:46,080
that place that seems so

236
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:52,500
Raw and you would recognize it

237
00:25:52,500 --> 00:26:00,740
and you would say oh I'm sorry that you feel that

238
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:08,840
and you would be cognizant of the compassion that that has generated in you

239
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:17,400
and doubt is very far from that one of the difficulties we have with

240
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,559
doubt is that we try to work it out in our heads we try to to analyze it and

241
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:29,520
and shape it and find some reason some other way of explaining so that doubt is

242
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:35,880
not so prevalent but what doubt actually feels like in the body has to do with what is the

243
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:44,059
trigger that is giving rise to doubt

244
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:51,000
what is what is the center fear so it is in fact in going deeper and

245
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,120
deeper and deeper into that place of rawness

246
00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:05,400
that we evoke something else from ourselves we evoke the peaceful heart

247
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:12,900
that doesn't support doubt and we're able to say as painful and as

248
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:21,799
tender as this spot is for me I wish myself well here

249
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:33,360
is it it's a form of giving in and not

250
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:41,279
fighting the doubt that the struggle against doubt

251
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:48,779
stimulates doubt it stimulates the corrupted heart it keeps it stirred

252
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:54,779
up I'm fighting doubt I'm fighting doubt I no doubt is is undermining me

253
00:27:54,779 --> 00:28:02,279
if I can stop fighting and say what is it that's being hurt what is it that's making me feel unsafe

254
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:10,760
here and look there then doubt doesn't have a home

255
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:22,679
does it come down to of fear of

256
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:28,200
existence does it come down to a fear of not being loved

257
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:33,980
does it come down to a fear of space

258
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:40,080
what what is what is that point of tenderness in my body you can only find

259
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,360
it in your body in the head you can do all their their arguments

260
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,520
they're just arguments and you know the strongest arguer wins today

261
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,679
but it doesn't doesn't change

262
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:09,600
it doesn't change the heart and the heart is where the doubt lies

263
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:16,760
not in the mind the mind just explains it so

264
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:23,039
so say what else is here until you get to the place that is raw

265
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:28,260
and then allow that to be true

266
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:35,240
say I see you I see that that fundamental fear I see that

267
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:44,820
and I would wish it was not here but it is here and I am still here this person

268
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:49,460
right now here

269
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:58,398
okay thank you so much

270
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:07,320
you've got a question from YouTube from um

271
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:12,779
I think it's see if I can find it here

272
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:17,820
um so on YouTube someone is asking uh can you please talk a bit about the

273
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:24,059
connection between the sense of being safe and being present

274
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:29,240
and the courage to be vulnerable in presence

275
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:40,260
okay so uh that's similar to the exercise I just went through the discussion I just

276
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:48,500
went through but what what uh what I've discovered

277
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:54,799
so I'm only speaking from my experience is that

278
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:01,380
when I am doubtful I remind myself that the doubt arises out of actually not

279
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:09,600
knowing the outcome and that it is uncertainty and ambiguity

280
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,600
and that that means I don't know the outcome

281
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:22,860
it could be pleasant or unpleasant could be good or bad it could be successful or

282
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:30,020
not success and in the end it will be

283
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:38,539
and what am I afraid of and so

284
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:45,779
it turns out for me that in order to realize my intentions

285
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:53,279
in life it has become extremely important to become familiar with allowing myself to be vulnerable

286
00:31:53,279 --> 00:32:01,740
doesn't mean I put myself in unsafe situations in the sense that the the their life life-threatening but I show

287
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:06,559
up in a space that that says here I am

288
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:15,179
I hope it's enough and it is enough for me so it's a little like

289
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:21,419
uh what what I've discovered is that the the safest place for me is to be totally

290
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:27,059
present that's the safest because I'm not trying

291
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:32,520
to be something other than me which is an extra layer of suffering an extra layer of being

292
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:40,559
and so the the the essence of that statement I am here is the I am here

293
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:45,840
this person is here as I am today with all of my strengths

294
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:53,039
and failings and uncertainties In This Moment under these conditions

295
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:57,980
this is I'm just here

296
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:05,640
and open to you feel okay about that or you don't

297
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:11,880
feel okay about that and I may alter what I say to you based on what the

298
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:17,159
feedback I get for you it's not as if I'm isolated in that showing up at all

299
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:23,820
it just means that I am willing to be affected by what happens next

300
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:32,720
I'm willing to be affected by what happens next there's a willingness in that showing up

301
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:40,140
and the willingness and and it means that sometimes you get hurt

302
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:45,720
and sometimes you say oh that wasn't expected

303
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,480
and then you Marvel at how that wasn't expected

304
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:59,039
but it involves staying at that place of of the peaceful heart try to stay there

305
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:04,640
try to try to have that and when it feels tense

306
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:12,560
back away from that let that let that not occupy you

307
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:21,060
it's the best I can do with that one I hope it helps

308
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:26,638
so our questions great thank you Marie uh Susan Sanford

309
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,740
you can go ahead and unmute yourself hi

310
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:38,000
um thank you so much for this week it's wonderful I'm noticing how

311
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,560
my um I would call my superego or my critic

312
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:50,419
um uses doubt um to

313
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:57,660
like it's a hook like to limit my practice so I will

314
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:05,520
it'll say well you may as well not even go to that Retreat because you know you're not gonna get any further anyway you know so

315
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,920
there it's like this kind of and then and then it that leads into

316
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:17,400
sloth and laziness you know like well I may as well not even practice

317
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,680
I may as well not even meditate because I'm not any good at it anyway

318
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:28,279
so there's this constant um way that

319
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:37,200
that I used doubt it's a reactive doubt preemptive doubt

320
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:45,000
I'm gonna I'm Gonna Save myself from being disappointed by just not going there yeah when I when I was a teenager I

321
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,040
decided that life was so horrible that I was not going to have any expectations

322
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:56,460
because then if I didn't have expectations I couldn't be disappointed this is very similar to that I adopted

323
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:05,300
it as yeah this is how I'm going to go through life I'm not going to have any expectations and then what I discovered is I also didn't have any dreams

324
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:12,660
it was nothing wonderful to anticipate either that it was really self-defeating yeah

325
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:20,400
which isn't you know I don't want to make light of it I mean I understand preemptive doubt trust me I go through

326
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:26,460
this uh I have an exercise class that's really beyond my capability and but I go

327
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:33,359
and I I'm exhausted afterward and sometimes I'm in great pain afterward and and I have so much resistance to

328
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:40,260
going and but I know I'm I'm stronger and I'm better for doing it but it isn't

329
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:48,060
until I actually get there and start working out that I feel like I should be there it's I overcome the doubt by

330
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:54,660
saying well I really don't know and I use the discipline of effort to

331
00:36:54,660 --> 00:37:01,980
get me over the hump it's it's the is this wise effort

332
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:09,359
part of the Eightfold Path there's a place effort has a place that says you know you just have to not give up

333
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:17,820
because if you give up you can't do it doubt is the thing that says oh who says

334
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:22,880
yeah who says and you know

335
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:29,940
like I said I went on that month-long Retreat and it was horrible and you know who would want to do that again and it

336
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:35,099
was yeah later in retrospect that I looked back on it and said wow I learned

337
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:42,780
so much about that at the time I'm not even sure why I stayed the whole month

338
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:49,800
and subsequent Retreats have been quite different all the retweets are different and you know this also every Retreat is

339
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,900
different and I always have anticipation before I go because I don't know what's

340
00:37:54,900 --> 00:38:02,220
going to show up and that can be frightening not everything I discovered was wonderful

341
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:08,000
yeah and they're always really difficult they can be

342
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:16,380
pretty much so far they always are but then that usually at the end they're like oh yeah like they're always open

343
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:22,940
you know there's always amazing openness always an opening yeah

344
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,980
I'm still here damn it

345
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:40,500
I'm I'm just gonna do it yeah there's

346
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:49,020
the inertia of Doubt can be very strong just inertia

347
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:56,960
you don't have to follow it you don't have to be there with it you don't have to say this is mine right

348
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:02,460
oh that's a dirty trick just yes name it

349
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:10,880
oh thank you go to retreat

350
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:20,700
anything else we're going pretty late I hate to hold up all the uh all our teams so

351
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:28,380
is uh are people generally okay here yeah I think uh I'm fine so um there's

352
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:34,320
there's actually another question off of YouTube um and a person asks Maria is it is

353
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:43,980
doubt to some degree another form of inquiry or is it more of a negation or fear

354
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:50,099
now is it a result of inquiry is that the question another form of inquiry or

355
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:58,380
is it more of a negation or fear yeah uh doubt okay so there is a

356
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:03,599
the doubt of inquiry is the one that says

357
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,720
do I see this clearly and it's in the the inquiry has a

358
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:17,880
different energy than the doubt that I've been describing which is is more of a hesitation than a stopping so if I

359
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:24,000
have a doubt that I understand something well then it is wise for me to question

360
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:32,040
what's that about what's that about what's that about and there is a form of doubt that can be that I can

361
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:40,079
have for example uh in in the example that we just explored

362
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:47,160
with Susan when she said well you know I I it may is probably not going to have a

363
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:54,420
good outcome anyway then establishing a and well I wonder what could happen

364
00:40:54,420 --> 00:41:00,599
is is a form of inquiry it's sort of questioning your own doubt is a form of

365
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:08,040
inquiry so they're not exactly the same one can say for example here's another

366
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:15,540
example so uh when I read Buddhism for 25 years before I ever sat on a cushion

367
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:22,619
I loved the ethical path of Buddhism but I was particularly stopped by the idea

368
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:29,640
of non-self because I was pretty sure I had a self it was a very strong personality and it made no sense to me

369
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:35,820
but it was and so I I asked about it and asked about and asked about and and it

370
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:43,740
wasn't until I was actually sitting on the cushion that I came to understand the meaning of not self which was not to

371
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:50,640
deny that there's a person here at all but rather that there's an unchanging person here and then I know exactly

372
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:58,079
what's going to happen and so it was the inquiry that was inherent in actually sitting on the cushion and allowing

373
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:04,560
curiosity for the answer and not not the form of inquiry that says I'm

374
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:11,099
going to prove you wrong but the form of inquiry that says I wonder what

375
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:16,140
so doubt is that I'm going to prove you round or wrong part the spirit of

376
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:22,380
inquiry is I'm going to see what's true all of Buddhism you should not believe a

377
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:28,859
word I say you should accept it with a a grain of belief that

378
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:34,380
says well that sounds like it's working for her let me see if it works for me if

379
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:40,140
that has value for me it it's the belief that comes out of experience Buddhism is

380
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:46,339
totally reliant on that I hope that answers that

381
00:42:46,339 --> 00:42:50,660
sounds like a healthy skepticism

382
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:07,440
so it's it's not non-believing it's an open an openness to what may be true

383
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,900
that we as we strive for

384
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:18,960
thank you all for the earnestness of your questions of your showing up thank

385
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:25,680
you for your practice the world is a better place for that we offer that our practice for the

386
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,740
benefit of all see you tomorrow
