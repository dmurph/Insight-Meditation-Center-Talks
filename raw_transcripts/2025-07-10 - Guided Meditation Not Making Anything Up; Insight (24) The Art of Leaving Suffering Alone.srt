1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,440
So hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,880
and here to the meditation that's uh

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,440
part of a longer series uh that sets the context for today and part of the more

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:24,560
recent context is a you want is a um

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:33,040
deeper engagement deeper reflection exploration deeper her uh uh

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:40,000
discovery of wise ways of practicing with suffering, with stress, with

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,040
destress, uh with the emotional tensions that we

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,399
carry through our days. And um

9
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:58,399
and there's a number of purposes for this. One is so that uh we can discover uh

10
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,600
profound satisfying healthy happiness

11
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:13,280
that um can be an alternative to suffering and also can be a partner to certain forms

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,479
of suffering that we have. Suffering is not a mistake to have to experience. Um,

13
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,840
there's all kinds of emotional pains that come with being human, but there's

14
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,200
also what we add. And it's the the what we add

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,280
unnecessarily that is a big part of what we're

16
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,320
uh kind of working with in Buddhism. So what I'd like to suggest that one of

17
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,920
the important areas of practice

18
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,520
is uh my the opportunities with mindfulness practice

19
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,320
is to be able to

20
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:12,319
um suffer without making anything of it.

21
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,480
to to feel our emotional distress, emotional pain, to feel our physical

22
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:25,680
pain, to feel the challenges we have. And of course, there are times we should

23
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:33,200
adjust and change and fix certain things. But when we come to meditation,

24
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,519
one of the great opportunities here is to discover a kind of freedom that comes

25
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,680
when we don't have to do anything about it. We can

26
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,720
just sit and not add any second arrows.

27
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,200
So the so just to sit

28
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,040
and not make anything up in relationship to the suffering to let it just be

29
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,440
suffering and not be for or against it not

30
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,040
interpret it not have an attitude even towards it that

31
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:24,959
it's undesirable or not try to protect it just a radical leaving it alone,

32
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,560
not making anything of it, not

33
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:38,319
imagining a future with it where it's going. Just radical simplicity.

34
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:46,560
Let it just be suffering and um just be sadness, just be

35
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:53,280
anger, just be disappointment, just be

36
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,560
hurt, just be. And one way that uh it's been meaningful

37
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:07,239
for me to think about this is that um when we're suffering,

38
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:14,480
be a suffering Buddha. When we're sad, be a sad Buddha.

39
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,759
when we're discouraged, be a discouraged Buddha.

40
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,040
And what that kind of language does, that kind of image does for me is it

41
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,840
allows me just to pull back. Let it be. Don't do anything with it. Don't see

42
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,400
anything as a problem. Don't see suffering as a problem. Don't even see suffering as an

43
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:47,040
opportunity to find happiness. Just let it be. Don't make anything up out of it.

44
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,720
So to assume a meditation posture

45
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,040
and if you've been meditating for some time

46
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:10,680
maybe you can feel the familiarity of the posture that you assume.

47
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:18,960
Maybe it's even a homecoming. Ah, here I am.

48
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,919
My body in a familiar posture of meditation.

49
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,639
Maybe the body now becoming the meditation center, the meditation

50
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,240
hall, the temple.

51
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,440
Feeling the familiarity, feeling the goodness.

52
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,039
And also feeling the tensions, the holding

53
00:05:51,039 --> 00:06:01,000
the parts of the body that are activated with emotions, energy, tensions.

54
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,840
and to gently

55
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:26,160
breathe more fully and as a statement

56
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:34,120
as in kind of a claim to presence here Now

57
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,080
as you exhale

58
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:50,319
a relaxing that is a definitive

59
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:59,080
reminder statement act of being here No.

60
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:54,840
letting your breathing return to normal. And as you exhale,

61
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:03,400
relax, soften, put your body at ease.

62
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:37,680
As you exhale, to whatever degree you can,

63
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:47,279
set your mind at ease, easing up the tensions, the tightness.

64
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,720
The pressure in the mind.

65
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:10,800
As you exhale, ease up

66
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,640
in your heart area with your emotional feelings,

67
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,640
sensations.

68
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,760
Be easy

69
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,000
with how you're feeling emotionally.

70
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,720
easing up.

71
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:05,440
And then becoming aware of how the body, your body experiences

72
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:12,920
breathing, the movements of breathing.

73
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:28,920
The alternating sensations of breathing in and breathing out.

74
00:10:51,920 --> 00:11:00,920
And then ease into your breathing almost like your awareness.

75
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,399
You can enter into the phys physicality of the body

76
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,399
breathing.

77
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,000
As you get to the end of the exhale,

78
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,560
let go. Settle in

79
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,639
for a moment. Let there be a grounding deep in your body at the end of the

80
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,240
exhale where you allow yourself to let go of

81
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:39,160
everything else, past and futures.

82
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,360
thoughts, beliefs.

83
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:56,880
Try to make anything happen except grounding deep in the body with the

84
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,880
exhale.

85
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,560
And the inhale arising from this grounding spot.

86
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,519
And if you find yourself thinking, take a moment

87
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,639
to see if you can recognize

88
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:46,320
that you don't need to be thinking what you're thinking

89
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:52,480
unless it's about the meditation on breathing itself in a simple way

90
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,519
remembering to do it.

91
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,839
Nothing else at this moment

92
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,399
requires thinking

93
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:37,040
When the mind thinks things, it's often making things up,

94
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:43,000
constructing ideas, stories, conversations,

95
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,800
judgments, commentary.

96
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:02,120
It's possible to feel the pressure to do this.

97
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,639
A kind of subtle pressure

98
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,040
of believing this is important to do.

99
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,319
A certain desire clinging

100
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:40,920
at the end of the exhale. Let it all go

101
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:49,600
and find a rest deep within in the body. The resting

102
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,839
spot, grounding spot.

103
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:04,839
A rest below the agitation of thinking.

104
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:21,200
And if you're thinking if you're if you're suffering

105
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,720
in any kind of way, distressed,

106
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:35,080
troubled, uncomfortable emotionally with anything.

107
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:42,039
Notice if that suffering

108
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,559
arises out of how you're thinking.

109
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:22,919
Notice how the suffering feels in your body.

110
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:52,840
Notice if your suffering affects how your breathing

111
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,400
and maybe the suffering is even very mild stress.

112
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:19,158
And as you know it, as you feel it,

113
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,840
leave it alone.

114
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:43,080
Not making anything up. Not building any conclusions.

115
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,159
Not adding the ideas, the judgments of thinking on

116
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:08,720
top of it without interpreting it. Just let it be.

117
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,320
Let let it leave it alone

118
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,880
with the exception of maybe breathing with it.

119
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:32,559
We're dropping down to the grounding spot deep within the breathing

120
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:38,159
below the suffering and radically

121
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:45,960
unconditionally leaving your suffering alone.

122
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:57,559
Nothing to do about it, nothing to fix,

123
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,280
no conclusions about oneself.

124
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:15,320
It can be so simple that all that's left of suffering

125
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:23,720
are the immediate sensations associated with it.

126
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,440
Thinking not needed.

127
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,158
And then

128
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,320
as we come to the end of this sitting,

129
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:45,360
what might you have learned? learned. What could you learn

130
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:53,640
here and now about leaving suffering alone?

131
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:04,240
Not making anything uh making making anything of it.

132
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,320
Not making up anything about it.

133
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:19,120
Suffering is suffering in and of itself. It's bad enough.

134
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:25,559
Don't add anything. Don't make anything of it.

135
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:39,919
And can you find in that simplicity, leaving it alone,

136
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,399
some freedom,

137
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,559
maybe breathing room with the suffering.

138
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:04,278
Maybe a sense of ease or peace

139
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:13,639
that's deeper within you or which surrounds everything.

140
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,760
can

141
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:37,080
not making up anything, not trying to do anything,

142
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,480
give you a sense of ease

143
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:51,000
that can exist. this together withever with whatever stress

144
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,039
duka that you have

145
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:09,559
and then holding this ease and unease together.

146
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,000
May we appreciate or understand

147
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:22,799
that others have duka, others have unease,

148
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:30,159
suffering, and they have the capacity

149
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:36,039
to have ease, to find freedom.

150
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:46,399
And may our own suffering help us to have a greater compassion,

151
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:51,840
patience, love

152
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,158
for others.

153
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:04,200
And may our own freedom from suffering, our own ease,

154
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:13,360
be the source of good will, well-wishing for those we're with.

155
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:19,919
May with whatever ease, well-being we have,

156
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:26,880
may we live with good will. May all beings

157
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,760
be happy. May all beings

158
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:39,440
be safe. May all beings be peaceful.

159
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,278
May all beings be free.

160
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:58,390
[Music]

161
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,000
Thank you.

162
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:14,480
So hello and welcome to this continuing series on insight

163
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:20,720
and for these days it's uh having insight having a deep understanding recognition

164
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:28,559
about uh suffering. A big word and uh sometimes alternative

165
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:34,559
word that I like is unease. And then when I was younger, I was aware

166
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:41,679
of some writers who wanted to uh translate it as disease with a hyphen

167
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:48,240
between the dis and the ease. that somehow there's a deep unease. And

168
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:55,279
the value the value of this emphasis on uneasiness is that uh it maybe a little bit easier

169
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:01,200
to understand the broad kind of um

170
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:08,399
u terrain broad range of what Buddhism refers to as duka. There can be an

171
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:14,480
uneasiness with just the mildest little thing and they can be quite big and

172
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,960
large. And um and so one of the really

173
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,559
important teachings that we teach and I taught about it yesterday

174
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:33,279
here at IMC and taught it here on YouTube is that um the idea of the two

175
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:39,919
arrows that uh if a person is uh injured by an

176
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:45,200
arrow that's shot at them that's painful. There's no

177
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,399
doubt about it. A second arrow is uh shot at the person, it's even more

178
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:56,559
painful. And the idea in from the Buddha about these arrow, the simile of the arrows is

179
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:01,679
that the first arrow uh is just what life

180
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:07,840
brings us. Uh we get sick, we get injured, we get

181
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:16,320
old, we we die. Uh there's loss. Uh, we break a cup,

182
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:23,358
falls on the floor, and it breaks. Uh, maybe we didn't even drop it. It was just somehow the the cat pushed it over

183
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:31,440
the edge of the table or or there's an earthquake and and um a precious

184
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:39,760
family heirloom falls and shatters. And there's all kinds of things. The first arrow is what life brings us. And

185
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:45,440
um and we have sometimes very little control over um these first arrows.

186
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,720
Maybe we try the best we can sometimes to prevent

187
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:57,040
the difficulties, challenges, things break, but um

188
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:04,320
the first arrow is just what comes and we're not responsible for it. And um and the second arrow is the one

189
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,720
that we add to the situation and that's when we make things up. We we

190
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,160
interpret it. We uh judge it. We

191
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:22,079
uh dream up scenarios of frightening futures about because of this this will

192
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:29,280
happen now and that'll be terrible. We uh cling to uh how we want things to

193
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:35,760
be or how they should be or how they shouldn't be. Um it's bad enough to have the cat knock

194
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:43,200
the precious teacup on the floor and um but don't make it worse.

195
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:49,440
uh the second arrows that we add. Uh we might not be happy with what's happening

196
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:57,119
on a the political level and uh maybe politicians are spreading fear and hate

197
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:05,599
and anger and then we get uh afra afraid and angry ourselves. And so in a certain

198
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:14,079
kind of way the first arrow is what the politicians do. The second error is what we add to it and add to it to the world

199
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:22,480
but also add it to ourselves. And in some ways it's very sad that um how much

200
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:29,119
added suffering we add to ourselves um when the first is bad enough

201
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,800
and uh when for example politicians are filled with as is commonly done to get

202
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:43,760
elected is to spread fear and anger uh and uh and then we do the same. We're

203
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,280
just adding to the accumulation of this kind of terrible kind of way, ugly kind

204
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:56,320
of way of being in the world. And uh we're not the solution. We're just making the problem worse and worse. And

205
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:03,280
so it's very hard to imagine leaving things alone. Like it's okay to do that. Not to add to

206
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:11,240
suffering, not to add second arrows. Of course, we have to do something. We have to fight the good cause.

207
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:18,800
Meditation is a very special place. It's a place where we step out of the ordinary world.

208
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:25,280
It's like kind of like the old days going to the library. And you go to the library and it's a quiet place. It's

209
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,720
kind of a sanctuary. It's kind of a peaceful place. People leave you leave you alone for the most part there.

210
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,000
People are quiet. Maybe some people are talking softly, but it's it's a kind of

211
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,680
its own unique place. and we go into the library and and we kind of participate

212
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:47,280
in the in the culture of the library. Meditation is like going to some place

213
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:53,359
like that where there's a different culture, there's a different understanding, different possibility.

214
00:37:53,359 --> 00:38:02,000
And one of those is a place to learn not to fix things, not to judge things,

215
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,960
not to make up any stories about things, interpretations, not to live in the future and pasts

216
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,000
about things, not to uh tell stories about it.

217
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:21,280
And um and um but rather to leave things radically alone. Just let each thing be

218
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:27,839
itself. And what that means is we're not adding second arrows, third arrows, fourth

219
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:34,560
arrows. Uh and sometimes these arrows that we build uh we throw we we we are

220
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:40,640
second third arrows we're doing become the foundation stones for building

221
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:48,160
bigger and bigger um buildings of suffering, buildings of stories and

222
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,440
and interpretations of life and ourselves and our identity.

223
00:38:53,440 --> 00:39:00,960
And when when uh our world, our self, our relationships to others built on all

224
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,800
these accumulated arrows that are that are landing on top of each other,

225
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,400
they're not very safe. They're not stable. Um they'll blow over, they'll

226
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:19,200
fall over. When they get tall enough, they will definitely collapse.

227
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,240
And um so uh so this idea of meditation

228
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:31,359
being its own domain to leave things alone. Just breathe with things. Just

229
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:38,079
know it. Know it. Don't construct it. Know it. Don't add

230
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:45,200
to it. Don't make it worse. and find some ease in the knowing of oh

231
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:52,320
wait there's stress there's pain there's unease here let's just know it in the

232
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,680
simplest possible way let's just feel it in the simplest possible way let's be

233
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:04,320
careful we don't add to it with stories don't make anything about make up anything about it don't make anything of

234
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:11,440
it and one of the fascinating things to discover from doing this or trying to do

235
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:17,760
it, doing it to some degree, even a m small degree is we at some point we

236
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:24,000
start recognizing um how the source of some of our

237
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,760
suffering, the immediate source, the kind of experiential source, the place where the

238
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:35,920
tension arises, the unease arises is not from the events in the world, but rather

239
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:42,560
from the way we think about it. So the cat knocks over the cup

240
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:50,160
and uh in and of itself that doesn't have to do anything in the mind. But then the mind immed immediately

241
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:56,240
uh narrows and focuses on oh that was a gift from my best friend and my best

242
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,359
friend will feel like I've you know will be upset with me because that cup is now

243
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:06,800
broken and maybe my friend will think I was disrespectful and we'll think that

244
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:13,440
I'm a careless person and and we can and but if you're watching all this you can

245
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:20,640
feel how much suffering tension unease is it rising in the wake of these

246
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:26,000
thoughts that we have. And then at some point we can also see

247
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:34,160
that our unease is the very source for more of this kind of making up thoughts.

248
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:40,000
And at some point the unease the tension that we carry and within us becomes like

249
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,560
um the toothpaste without the lid toothpaste uh tube that

250
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:53,040
if we keep pressing it the toothpaste will just keep coming keep coming keep coming brushing it away but as long as

251
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:59,920
the tension is there the pressure is there it'll keep pouring out the the thinking will just keep pouring out

252
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:07,359
stories will keep make because of the tension we have here on the mind.

253
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:13,359
So to learn to leave things alone to leave our suffering alone is a

254
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:20,480
dramatic step of of uh learning a radical different way is not adding more

255
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:28,800
arrows. And even if you have 10 arrows being fired at once, rapid fired arrows,

256
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:35,599
we can learn not to do the 11th. Don't add one more.

257
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:41,200
Just let it be. And at some point in this practice of the dharma,

258
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:46,960
it's almost necessary to learn the art

259
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,560
to leave suffering alone. If we've have a whole series of madeup

260
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:58,240
suffering, madeup reactivity that we live under, um, at some point we need to

261
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:04,240
learn to stop at the 30th generation of arrows.

262
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:10,640
And this stopping means that at some point we have to be

263
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:17,200
willing to be at ease with suffering. At some point, we have to learn to just,

264
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:25,200
okay, now there's a different way. There's a different culture. There's now I'm in the library. And now, let me just

265
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,880
be here without making anything up with that, without talking loudly about it,

266
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:37,680
without yelling. Now, let let me learn how not to how to

267
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:43,599
suffer without adding an arrow.

268
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:49,440
Let me learn how to suffer without

269
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:56,240
having thoughts, ideas, reactions that just adds more and more.

270
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:03,359
And the marvelous thing that can happen is when we learn that stopping, learning to stop and just let suffering be very

271
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:09,760
simple, not making anything of it. Then the edifice of tension, the edifice

272
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:16,720
of all these arrows begins to collapse, begins to fall away, begins to relax.

273
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,880
But if we have think we always have to react, always have to do something with it, always make something of it, always

274
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:28,400
define ourselves, always see what our our problems as reflecting back on who

275
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:34,960
me who I am, then that just gets perpetuated more and more and more.

276
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,000
So whether it's the second generation, the hundth generation of arrows that

277
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,160
you've been slinging at yourself over a lifetime.

278
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:51,318
At some point, just stop.

279
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:57,920
Stop and look better. Stop and see more clearly

280
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:03,520
what is there. And one of the things to clearly see

281
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:11,359
is the stopping is the not adding and in doing that finding your ease.

282
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:18,838
Ease on the path to freedom. So thank you.
