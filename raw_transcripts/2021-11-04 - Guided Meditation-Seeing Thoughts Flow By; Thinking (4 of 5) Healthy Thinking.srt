1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:08,240
warm hello from inside meditation center in redwood city

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,880
and uh

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,279
it's so wonderful that you're here to go along with us in this meditation

4
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:26,240
thank you so

5
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,840
the topic is thinking and

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,719
it's an important thing to become wise about when you're a meditator

7
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:47,519
and you don't become wise by batting it away and you don't become wise by indulging in it

8
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:57,280
you become wise by looking at it seeing it clearly

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:04,239
where the emphasis should be on the word clear seeing it really clearly

10
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,960
clear seeing and i think that um i think

11
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,560
the um some people are so identified

12
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,479
with their thinking that they are synonymous with their thinking

13
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,680
their identity their sense of who they are they're very beingness

14
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,720
is is associated with thinking and it gives thinking a lot of authority

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,920
because sometimes in thinking whatever i think is part of who i am and therefore it

16
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:47,040
needs to be true it is true my opinions my views my everything

17
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,320
so i am therefore i think is the famous french philosophers

18
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,439
saying and buddhism wouldn't say that

19
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:02,880
thinking is just one part of the vast world of our

20
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,640
psychophysical functioning and it's not any more warrants

21
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,760
identifying with as being mine as your finger clipping once you've

22
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,160
clipped your fingers you hold up your finger clipping and say this is me this is me look here there

23
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,879
here i am i'm going to keep it close maybe thoughts once they've been

24
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:33,440
thought out once they've appeared in consciousness are simply the finger clippings of the

25
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,360
mental processes we have we give them a lot of credibility a lot

26
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,959
of importance so one of the ways

27
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:52,400
of sitting with meditation with thinking is to when we think

28
00:02:52,400 --> 00:03:00,400
to turn the attention fully onto the thinking

29
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,040
and look thinking right in the eye to really observe thinking

30
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:14,080
without justifying it without condemning it without being for it or against it

31
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,800
but taking it as a fully fully warranting attention as anything else

32
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:29,120
if there was a wonderful bird singing outside the bird song coming through the window

33
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,959
some people might take that as a delightful object of meditation just kind of just

34
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:43,840
listening for listening in the same way we can just watch listen

35
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,120
look at directly oh this is thinking

36
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,560
one delightful kind of way of that looking

37
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:04,000
is to imagine that you're sitting on a big boulder safe and sound and content

38
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,280
in a river where the middle of the river draw high and dry

39
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,040
but either side of you the river's just flowing just flowing by

40
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,759
and you don't pick it up you don't get involved you don't dip your hand in it you just watch the flow by

41
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,960
to step back or stand on a dress and sit on a dry rock

42
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:33,919
and just watch the thoughts come and go and watch the tendency to get on them to get

43
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,600
into the river the old analogy of thoughts are like

44
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,680
trains train cars going by and suddenly you find yourself in the train

45
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,919
car

46
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:58,320
just watch just watch teso and if if you want to identify with something as being you

47
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:06,160
for the purpose of this meditation don't have it be your thinking have it be the observation of thinking

48
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,639
settle back relax and just observe and see if thinking is not predominant stay with

49
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,680
your breathing meditate as usual but then when thinking

50
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,680
picks up do this exercise of just turning and looking directly at it recognizing what

51
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,600
this is thinking as if the thinking is

52
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,479
apart from you not really you

53
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,800
if anything the observers you just see it let it let it

54
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,918
run by you like you let a river run by flow by

55
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,360
so taking an upright meditation posture either

56
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,280
literally or metaphorically one that has a little bit of

57
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,520
energy in it a little bit alertness in the posture

58
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:12,240
maybe being a little careful with the spine so that the spine feels a little alert

59
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:21,080
you're aware of the spine the aliveness of it

60
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,360
lowering your gaze

61
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,840
and if it's comfortable gently closing your eyes

62
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,080
and then taking a few long slow deep breaths

63
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:07,120
on the exhale letting go of your thoughts and your concerns

64
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,720
let go and let go into your body

65
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,680
deep breath in relaxing the body

66
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,080
letting your breathing return to normal

67
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,719
and on the exhale relax your body

68
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,199
maybe in the inhale feel some part of your body where there's holding or tension

69
00:07:53,199 --> 00:08:00,840
anywhere it is in the body on the exhale relax

70
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:52,880
and then taking them a few moments here to allow yourself to think

71
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,040
but look thinking right in the eye

72
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:08,360
calmly clearly recognize your thinking

73
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,880
the thinking then gets quiet being watched this way

74
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,839
feel notice what that quiet feels

75
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:27,120
like notice the space or the stillness the quiet

76
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,760
notice if there's a location for it

77
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,839
is there any attention associated with it

78
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,040
if there is relax

79
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,080
and if thinking stays away then begin again with your breathing

80
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:58,399
if thinking stays there is even more activated than before

81
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:05,040
breathe with it breathe through it and see if you can

82
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,279
find the place to sit on the boulder in the river

83
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,959
so that the river of thought just flows right by

84
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,800
and you are not involved with it

85
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:40,880
and looking clearly at thinking and stepping away and being on that dry

86
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:47,760
boulder it can be helpful to label the thinking

87
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,840
as thinking thinking or remembering

88
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,760
talking planning

89
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,640
the label is not so important what's important is the way the label

90
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:17,640
helps you step away and not be so glued to the thinking

91
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:04,799
and then taking a few moments to feel any tension that exists in your

92
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:11,000
body any holding tightness

93
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:21,360
notice it in a relaxed way no need to judge it or yourself

94
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,880
just notice if there's any tension

95
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:35,520
and then in the next three exhales see if you can relax that tension and

96
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:41,320
any tension right down to the core of your being

97
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,320
relax and let the thinking mind become quiet

98
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:08,400
peaceful as you feel your way to

99
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,000
whatever relaxation there's here

100
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,720
and then

101
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:47,840
there are times when thinking is heavy

102
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,240
and sometimes when it's very light

103
00:26:53,840 --> 00:27:00,639
it's heavy when we identify with it and lighter when we let it be

104
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:10,960
and lightly see if you can allow for some light thoughts

105
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:21,760
almost not thinking at all but the light thoughts that arise

106
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:28,080
or might arise in the wake of these words that i will

107
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,080
speak

108
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,880
we all have a capacity

109
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,840
to have well wishing for others

110
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,278
we all have the capacity to be generous

111
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:03,840
we all have the capacity to be kind friendly

112
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,398
we all have the capacity to love

113
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,840
even if it's ever so slightly

114
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,720
and to make room for that capacity for these last couple of minutes to

115
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:36,480
trust that capacity and allow perhaps there to bubble up

116
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,600
very simple light thoughts of goodwill

117
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:49,440
it could be they take the form of just appreciating how wonderful would it would be

118
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:56,760
if others were happy peaceful and safe

119
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:09,520
may it be that all beings are happy

120
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,600
may all beings be safe

121
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,240
may all beings be peaceful

122
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,200
may all beings be free

123
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:46,480
and without any burden any sense of weight but rather with a light as a feather

124
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,120
may it float from us the wish to contribute to that as a

125
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:02,480
possibility may we go through the day

126
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,840
doing whatever is easy and light

127
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,600
for the welfare and happiness and well-being of others

128
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,760
may all beings be habeam

129
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:36,789
[Music]

130
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,880
thank you

131
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,840
so we continue with the topic of mindfulness of thinking

132
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:05,039
today it's the topic is restoration and what i mean by that is the restoring

133
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:11,039
of a healthy way of being that um we

134
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:17,919
the ways that clinging and attachment and fear and the resistance

135
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:23,600
inhibit the natural healthy functioning of our psychophysical being

136
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:29,840
so the

137
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,919
as we kind of no longer are carrying the burden of our attachments

138
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:43,360
and carrying the burden of our responsibilities you can still have response abilities

139
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,080
but to to be weighed down by them

140
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:55,279
to be able to shed a lot of the attachments that we have in preoccupations

141
00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:02,880
is a way to allow a healthy and so meditation operates

142
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:09,200
for some people a little bit like a you know if you're dirty

143
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,399
you take a shower and you're clean and so meditation is a way of cleansing

144
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:20,640
the mind the spirit the heart excuse me for a minute

145
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:32,000
so um so how does this relate to thinking

146
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,360
uh there's there can be a restoration of healthy thinking um

147
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,480
or thinking which is beneficial thinking which is light clear

148
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,799
easy and

149
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,519
so one of the steps towards that is as i've talked about is to respect

150
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:59,039
thinking but here's a way of looking at it

151
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,039
is that um

152
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:13,039
everything that we are is made up of parts

153
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:19,279
and so thinking is made up of parts it's part emotions part physical tensions far

154
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:27,519
apart motivations apart our memories and our associations

155
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:32,640
and um sometimes thoughts are motivational they're

156
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,080
trying to get something done sometimes they're simply uh very relaxed

157
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,760
memories or relaxed pleasant anticipations so all kinds of

158
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:49,200
there's relaxed reflections as we

159
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:56,080
begin respecting the different component parts of the complex of thinking

160
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:03,679
it's possible to recognize there's tension there's heaviness there's tightness contraction

161
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:09,040
and that's our contribution to it there's a way in which we're involved or identified or

162
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,320
represents some attachment we have independent of whether it's appropriate

163
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,679
to be thinking of whatever you're thinking about the weight the contraction the tightness

164
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:25,200
is not necessary in fact we usually think much better

165
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,638
more creatively more efficiently if there is no tension

166
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:36,878
if there is no tightness and heaviness and preoccupation

167
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:44,560
and and so to begin letting go and allowing thinking to

168
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,760
to be free of our

169
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,040
reactivity to them or cotness in them allows a thinking to operate to be

170
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,160
restored to a kind of healthiness to think without fear

171
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:05,920
to think without hate to think without um

172
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,680
desire wanting something it's maybe unimaginable

173
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:18,720
because if those are so much important parts of our thinking to have thinking occur

174
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:24,640
but not to have it glued to our sense of self me myself and

175
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:30,800
mine my opinions my stories it's really remarkable how much thinking

176
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:37,680
from some of us that we're somehow a central character in our thoughts

177
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:44,000
one way or the other and as uh we become lighter and freer we're

178
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,599
thinking the thoughts don't have us at the center of them anymore

179
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,640
and so thoughts just float up and one of the ways one of the

180
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:00,400
remarkable things that can happen in meditation if you do it meditate long enough or deep enough

181
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:06,800
is that with time thinking is not so heavy and thick

182
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,480
it's not so solid sometimes when we're really caught up in something

183
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:20,160
thinking can be the most solid thing in the universe it's so dense so serious so important so much energy

184
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:26,000
behind it and when that when the content of the thoughts

185
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,240
are negative negative about ourselves negative about the world the heaviness and the

186
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:38,640
and the contraction around the thoughts can be quite debilitating they say that the leading one of the

187
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:44,000
leading causes of depression is rumination just kind of

188
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:51,280
churning away with the same kind of thoughts over and over again that are negative negative self-talk

189
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,480
so to begin to put that to rest to not identify with him not be involved in it

190
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:04,000
and there might still be unfortunate kinds of thinking going on but uh because we're not logged

191
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,160
latched onto it or reactive to it or taking it so seriously we're just sitting on the boulder in the

192
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:15,280
river and just letting the water right run by not identifying with it

193
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:21,599
over time the thinking becomes thinner and thinner lighter and lighter

194
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:28,560
it's remarkable process by which thinking has its lightness to it it's like a thin thin veil maybe

195
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:34,960
or it's like a clouds drifting across an open sky

196
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,079
and clouds have no weight almost thoughts have no weight

197
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:46,000
in and of themselves they're very very light they don't interfere with anything like a cloud kind doesn't interfere with

198
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,599
anything you just put your hand in a cloud and your hand goes right through um

199
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:56,640
so that the thoughts feel like they're getting thinner and thinner lighter and lighter

200
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,480
more and more relaxed and and they just kind of feeling of them floating

201
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:09,280
through floating by and at this point some people find

202
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,400
that their thinking becomes creative i certainly found that when i was

203
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,480
um when i meditate a fair amount generally outside of meditation

204
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:27,599
my thinking is very easy and relaxed and creative i'm more likely to write poetry

205
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:33,440
when i have this kind of very light thin thinking going on

206
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,920
i'm also more likely to think about things more clearly i often will find that after i've

207
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:46,560
meditated in the morning that i go back to some thing i'm trying to figure out or do a right or something

208
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:52,000
and there's much more clarity and it's ease i think there's coming out it's almost like the

209
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,880
forcefulness that trying really hard to think or do something interferes with this natural creativity intelligence

210
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:05,280
that exists within us so one of the possibilities with

211
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,880
mindfulness of thinking is to understand the territory of thinking the ecology of

212
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,480
thinking to recognize the different component parts of it

213
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,560
and understand which parts we don't have to be involved in which parts we can let go of

214
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:29,200
it might not be letting go of thoughts themselves it might be letting go of all the tension associated with them

215
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:35,599
or it might be that maybe there's certain motivations connected to those thoughts which are

216
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:41,359
not something if you realize what the motivations are you know i don't need that you can let go of the motivation what they're trying

217
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:47,599
to do with their thoughts or it could be that there's a lot of physical tension

218
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,960
connected to thinking and so you let go of that you relax that and

219
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,000
and uh or maybe the emotions that are connected need real attention

220
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,880
that's what needs your love and your care and your presence so you and by recognizing the component

221
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:11,680
parts then we start separating that suffering that away it becomes easier to

222
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:16,720
look at thinking right in the eye and just see it

223
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:22,079
and it's fascinating to do that sometimes when we do that thinking just fades away

224
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:28,319
partly because thinking continues through time by our feeding it

225
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:34,960
and if we're just watching it then we're not feeding it and then it kind of kind of dissipates

226
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:40,640
and but then what's interesting is when it dissipates and we're relaxed

227
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:47,200
at some point maybe after meditation if you stay relaxed don't rush back into the thoughts and

228
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:53,680
concerns of the day that there's this restoration of a healthy way of thinking

229
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:59,599
and healthy wholesome useful there's a there's a way of being when

230
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:08,240
we're deeply relaxed and at peace we have a reference point for what health is what being healthy is

231
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,680
and it's not healthy to start getting preoccupied again or

232
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:19,200
starting to get caught again in the preoccupation concerns of the day

233
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:26,640
we do have concerns we do have things to take care of but the wonderful thing to discover

234
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:33,599
is we take care of them better if we're not tight if we're not rushing if we're not

235
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:40,319
pushing we're not barreling ahead we you know we can get up out of meditation some of us and like okay

236
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:45,760
gotta get to work and that attitude then

237
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:53,920
is a kind of leaning then into thinking leaning getting involved and thinking or the thinking itself gets revved up

238
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,119
and it's not that's it maybe it's not necessary

239
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:04,880
maybe there's a way of trusting that healthy way of being with thoughts where they're light and

240
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,079
soft and gentle maybe or just kind of you know

241
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:16,560
not weighty and not pushing us that um

242
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:22,160
that we have a sense oh that's healthy that's what's useful

243
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,240
so here restoration it means restoration of kind of a healthy thinking

244
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:34,800
and they have the ability to know what that is and uh the more ease more peaceful more

245
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:42,480
relaxed you can become in meditation the more you'll discover this reference point of a peaceful baby

246
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:49,520
a healthy way to be with the world of thinking we don't have to only let go of thoughts

247
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:55,760
there are times when it's completely appropriate to be thinking and even in uh and even wonderful to be

248
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:01,599
thinking thinking can be a gift you can be friends with your thoughts

249
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:07,280
but you can be friends with relating to the thoughts in a very healthy way

250
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:13,839
the thoughts themselves can just feel healthy and it's actually possible to have thoughts which feel nourishing

251
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:20,160
that feel supportive that feel onward leading to greater peace

252
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,480
so um thank you we have one more day on thinking

253
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,000
and and then tomorrow i'll talk a little bit about the plan for next week and

254
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,200
kind of how to continue this series so

255
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,319
may you today discover something

256
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:50,200
new about healthy thinking thank you
