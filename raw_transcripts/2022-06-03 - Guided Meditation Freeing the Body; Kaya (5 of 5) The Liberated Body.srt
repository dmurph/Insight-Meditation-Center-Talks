1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,200
hello everyone and it's a

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,639
auspicious and wonderful occasion to come together both to a group of people

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,920
meditating meditating together is always uh suspicious to

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,039
reflect on the dharma is auspicious to spend a week appreciating

5
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:33,760
the body the valid tremendous value of finding a way to

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,920
wake up into the body and maybe different ways than the karmic body that we often live in

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:47,680
but to know the other possibilities that maybe allow us to respect it in a deep way appreciate it

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,399
to consider the miracle of it and uh and now coming to this day

9
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:01,760
talking about the liberated body to this body that in a certain way

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,439
we can say has cared for us for our lifetime we can return the gift

11
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,079
and provide it with freedom the liberated body

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,240
and so

13
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,520
to free the body from our attachments to free our body from our

14
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,000
judgments to free your body from our desires

15
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,720
and to allow it to be

16
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,439
and to allow it to express itself to be itself from the

17
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,720
inside out in the sense that from what emerges from within the body

18
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,200
not what's projected on it from the mind and

19
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,200
wondrous so to assume a

20
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,200
posture of the for this body that

21
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,879
maybe expresses the dignity and value of the body

22
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,000
assume a posture that independent of how you feel perhaps

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,720
gives a chance for your body to feel present

24
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,080
respected

25
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,480
dignified and valued

26
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,040
here in this body with taking a posture for this body to

27
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,599
be rooted here in this place to inhabit

28
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,879
this time and place as if

29
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,840
not as if with the idea that it belongs here

30
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,319
no shame no diminishment no

31
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,680
self-effacing allowing this natural

32
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:24,480
animal body we have to have as much rights to be alert and

33
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:32,840
present in a nice way as a deer alert

34
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,719
to the great view across a grassy meadow

35
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:50,720
here and to gently close your eyes

36
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,480
and sometimes if it was comfortable for you to close your eyes closing the eyes as a way of

37
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,760
transitioning to being

38
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,519
connected to the body's experience of itself

39
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,519
here

40
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,360
so

41
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:42,560
and the body thrives on oxygen that breathes in

42
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,280
and carbon dioxide that it exhales and taking a few gentle

43
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:56,440
luxurious deeper breaths to bring in the oxygen

44
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,639
and exhaling along exhale

45
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,080
to release that carbon dioxide which is no longer

46
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,280
needed for this body

47
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,080
breathing in and breathing out

48
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,599
letting breathing return to normal

49
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:48,400
and taking a back seat relationship to your breathing

50
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:57,919
without being a backseat driver allow the breath now to breathe itself

51
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,680
and if that's not possible be okay with how it is

52
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:16,280
be relaxed about whatever way you're breathing

53
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:29,600
whether you are controlling your breathing or or

54
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,039
allowing the breath to breathe itself either way

55
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,520
the important work of the breathing of

56
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:48,600
the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide still happens

57
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:01,240
the purpose of breathing happens regardless of your role of

58
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,039
and then seeing if you can release

59
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:17,840
the tensions of your body the ways in which the mind

60
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:31,840
makes the work of the body a little bit more difficult entangled

61
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:42,039
mixed up with the body to release the tension of the shoulders

62
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,560
release the tensions of the belly

63
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:03,840
releasing any holding tightening in the thighs the legs

64
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:18,680
releasing any holding in the small of your back

65
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:34,560
softening relaxing the hands maybe adjusting a little bit how the

66
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,919
hands are so that the hands are more at ease

67
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,519
relaxing the muscles of the face

68
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,880
relaxing relaxing the mind

69
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,880
thinking mind in such a way

70
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:16,000
that the thinking mind is not interfering so much with the body

71
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:23,120
part of the gift of relaxing the thinking mind is the way in which that might free up

72
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:30,080
the body from the tensions and the pulls and

73
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:38,720
pushes activations that come with the activated mind

74
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,240
softening the grip on your thinking

75
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:03,000
relaxing the force that goes along with thinking

76
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,759
and then settling into your body

77
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,560
setting settling into your breathing

78
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,399
trusting the body to breathe itself

79
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:54,600
entrusting yourself to the care of the body

80
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,800
allowing your thinking mind

81
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,880
to soften

82
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,480
lighten up

83
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:43,519
release itself as you release yourself into

84
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,240
the continuity of one breath after another

85
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,839
breathing

86
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,839
so

87
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,320
so

88
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,440
so

89
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,480
so

90
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,800
so

91
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,600
so

92
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:41,440
and if it's possible see if you can free the body

93
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,679
from your thinking and judgments and attachments

94
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:54,720
ideas of what should be and marvel at

95
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,520
whatever way your body is

96
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,799
it's an amazing result of

97
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:11,360
an evolution of animal life on this planet

98
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:18,840
the amazing window we

99
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:25,679
have into the animal body

100
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:32,559
so much of it which we share with other mammals and animal animals

101
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:39,919
and this is the one that we have to experience from the inside

102
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:51,760
maybe gazing upon it like a naturalist gazing upon

103
00:20:51,760 --> 00:21:00,600
the deer and the animals and wandering around in the woods

104
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:09,200
with an eye out for [Music] liberating the body

105
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,559
from your attachments

106
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,480
so

107
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,520
so

108
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,840
so

109
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,240
so

110
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,760
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

111
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:11,039
to first say that liberation from suffering liberation from clinging

112
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:17,760
attachments is the liberation that buddhism most

113
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:25,919
emphasizes for each of us however it's helpful to consider

114
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,760
that it isn't so much that you will be liberated

115
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:38,960
when you're liberated you won't care so much about whether or not you're liberated

116
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:45,919
but what you will care about is that you're liberating everybody else

117
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:51,120
from you you're freeing everyone else from your

118
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,559
attachments your projections your bias

119
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:05,120
your judgments just as you're liberating your body

120
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:11,200
from all those so we can free others

121
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,559
allow everyone else the opportunity to live

122
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:22,080
independent of any influence from attachment and

123
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,120
clinging from us

124
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:34,480
may our liberation be a way of liberating others

125
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:41,760
from any clinging and holding in resentment and hate and envy and

126
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:49,600
jealousy desires that we're caught up in

127
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:56,880
may our practice lead us to giving freedom

128
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,720
to all beings may all beings

129
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:09,520
be happy may all beings be safe

130
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:19,000
may all beings be peaceful may all beings be free

131
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:32,270
[Music]

132
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,120
so

133
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,440
so then we come to the last talk in this five-part series on

134
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,840
the different ways to experience our body the kaya

135
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:03,600
and that the experience we have of our body is very much influenced

136
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,679
by our states of mind activities of mind our thoughts our judgments our attachments

137
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,720
and and as those shift and change then

138
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:20,000
the experience of the body changes as well and when we practice

139
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,960
when the different kinds of states and ways the mind works while we meditate

140
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:34,000
can give us a different experience of the body which experience is the true experience

141
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,120
of the body you know is is the one that you're most commonly

142
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:47,039
the most the most common way you feel your body you know your body is that the how you really are the true body

143
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:52,320
in fact um i think that uh there's no basis for

144
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:59,760
deciding that the karmic body is the accurate body uh or the you know the real body

145
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:05,039
it's accurate enough as a karmic body but it's that's what it is it's uh

146
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:13,360
experiencing the body through the lens or through the mind states that's caught in the world of carmine

147
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:20,799
as the mind becomes free of that world uh relaxes settles in

148
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:27,279
then sometimes we start feeling the the joy body

149
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:33,120
and wonderful feelings of suffusing joy or well-being

150
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,960
contentment and as practice deepens then the

151
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:46,640
tranquil body becomes more evident and the bodies is very peaceful equanimous

152
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,919
and as mindfulness develops we have the insight body

153
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:58,480
the body has experienced uh when through observation or perception

154
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,760
that's that's very present very attentive but freed of

155
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:12,398
the labels ideas concepts we overlay on top of experience

156
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:18,000
and part of the value of seeing free of the all the concepts and ideas

157
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,200
and seeing more of the stream and the flow of the body is to loosen up the

158
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,600
attachment to body attach into self from relationship to the body and all attachments

159
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:34,640
and as we release our attachments as clinging and grasping and

160
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:40,960
striving and resisting judging and bias and fear and hate

161
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,799
finally quiet down the experience of the body changes dramatically

162
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:52,559
and we can have uh the liberal experience of the liberated body

163
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:59,200
and and the liberated body is the body that's not entangled in the

164
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:05,200
mind the experience of liberating liberated body is a little bit a product of the

165
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:13,360
mind but it's the product of the mind free non-clinging at ease peaceful

166
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:19,360
and so the result is that the body feels much more at ease it feels lighter

167
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:26,159
it feels more refreshed it doesn't have to live with the weight and the stress

168
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:33,039
of the puppeteer the mind which is constantly maybe thinking and reacting and

169
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:38,399
being afraid being desirous being angry and all the ways that kind of

170
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:45,120
seeps into the body certainly in muscles being tense

171
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:51,919
tight but also in all kinds of chemicals that the body releases stress chemicals and things that

172
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:58,080
releases into the body from stressful activities of the mind things of the mind

173
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:05,600
and so as the body gets freed of all this it tends to have a feeling of of more

174
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,280
unity of flow of ease a certain kind of

175
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:18,000
delight joy lightness the weightlessness that way that kind of

176
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,358
grace goes with it it just feels like there's almost like grace to move an arm

177
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:28,158
or to walk or do anything

178
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:34,560
maybe partly because it's all just kind of a wonder a surprise a delight

179
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,919
it's uh and to be present for all that

180
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:45,358
the um the liberated body

181
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:50,878
is one where we don't impose on the body

182
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:56,960
all the then issues of identification me myself and mine this is who i am

183
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,800
we don't put on the body expectations that should be different or judgments ideas

184
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:09,520
that interfere with the natural functioning of the body a liberated body is a body that has

185
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,119
certain kind of harmony to it and a body that

186
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:20,880
all the parts of it as they are are just fine as they are

187
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:28,320
in and of themselves if a few days ago i injured my finger a

188
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,520
little bit and and

189
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:38,880
you know i kind of would like it to heal properly and it is it's not as a small little cut

190
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,400
but my finger doesn't mind my finger doesn't know

191
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:51,119
that it should be any different it's a just a natural way in which this world exists this moment that there's a

192
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:56,320
finger with a cut in it that uh from the point of view of our body and

193
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:02,079
itself whether we're bald i have long hair or thin hair or

194
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:07,839
curly hair or kinky hair or straight here

195
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:13,359
it's all just fine it's all just from the inside out it

196
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:19,599
just is what it is just like you would look at a at a tree and you wouldn't say well that

197
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:26,160
branch is all wrong that it's the angle in which it's coming off the trunk or it's twisted or bent in a

198
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:31,280
certain way it's just all the way that nature works and the way richer grows and

199
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:39,040
it can all kind of a marvel so to give that kind of freedom to the body and let the body be the body let it

200
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:46,400
be the natural event that it is that we don't identify this is my body

201
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:53,200
and we don't define ourselves by it and the same time we care for it

202
00:36:53,200 --> 00:37:00,880
it is uh just as much worthy of our care our love as some other person or an animal

203
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,640
um some of you love your pet and

204
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:12,800
you know i don't know if your body should see as your pet exactly but it could be something that you care

205
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:18,640
for and love and treat well and with respect you don't it's not an afterthought

206
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:23,839
the body is not just a convenient vehicle for getting you from one place to the other

207
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:31,760
the body is you know a valued vital important part of this whole process

208
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,599
so i wanted to read a couple of quotes from the ancient buddhist texts one is from the

209
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:45,200
verses of the elder monks and i delighted this little poem

210
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:54,240
and i see it as kind of a poem in the liber about a liberated body

211
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:02,480
hey my body is light having been touched with vast joy and

212
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,079
happiness my body feels like it's floating

213
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:12,400
like cotton blowing in the wind

214
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,839
here's another quote actually from the buddha himself

215
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,920
i immerse the body in the mind and the mind and the body

216
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,680
and when i dwell having entered upon a blissful perception and a buoyant perception

217
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:38,160
in regard to the body on that occasion my body becomes more buoyant malleable

218
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:43,440
wieldy and luminous a luminous body

219
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:49,839
so these are all ways different ways of experiencing the body there is you know the karmic body is not

220
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:56,560
the only body to experience and we want to kind of free ourselves from the idea that this is the real body

221
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,839
of the singular real body it's real enough we have to respect the karmic

222
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:07,599
body and take care of it on its own terms but there are other ways of experiencing

223
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:14,400
the body and so free ourselves up from a kind of attachment or a fixidity on this is how

224
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:20,240
the body is and i have to constantly negotiate and struggle and work with this

225
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:26,240
as the mind meditates as the mind becomes freer more concentrated more insightful

226
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:32,320
the experience of the body changes as the experience of the body changes

227
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:39,040
uh it in turn it changes the mind there's kind of a reciprocal relationship

228
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:44,480
that goes on here and so as you begin feeling the lightness of

229
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:50,240
the body the freedom of the body the joy the tranquility of the body

230
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,800
that's a lesson for the mind that's a teaching to the mind what's possible

231
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:02,640
it's a reminder of the mind to yes here this is a good place to dwell

232
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:08,160
to be centered and relaxed here as opposed to being carried away

233
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:15,280
on the street on the kind of freight trains of thoughts that

234
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:22,760
carry us away so the liberated body

235
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:34,160
it's fascinating to me that how dynamic complex sophisticated this

236
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:39,440
human body is that's so many systems working so many

237
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:46,400
complicated chemical systems neurological systems mechanical systems are operating

238
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:53,200
that any one of us even with a phd in engineering and biochemistry simply could not track it

239
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:59,680
all and manage it all it's an amazing complicated thing that happens

240
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:06,800
mostly on its own and [Music] and in addition to that the mind itself

241
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:14,240
is a wondrous thing you know most of the mind happens uh off stage you know

242
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:21,440
that we don't really know that's all the complicated ways in which the mind works as well i don't think any of us is smart enough

243
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:28,480
in our conscious self the self that we consciously know to direct and manage and supervise

244
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:34,720
all the ways in which the brain works the mind works and all the ways in which the body works

245
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:41,839
the part that we can actually have some say and do the part that we get attached to and get cling to and get preoccupied

246
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:47,359
with is actually a very small sliver

247
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:52,640
of who we are we are in our totality and it's remarkable how much trouble we

248
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,720
can get into in this little slice of or that we're conscious of

249
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:03,920
where we take this is who i am and this is what i have to do and it's all up to me and

250
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:10,000
and i have to navigate and do all this this practice of ours can teach us

251
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:17,280
what it's like to put that little sliver that little subset of

252
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:24,640
of our whole our whole that subset which is the conscious part if we can let that rest

253
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:30,640
let that be at peace so that it can be informed

254
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,920
it can be guided by this huge

255
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:43,280
percentage of who we are that we're not so conscious about and that is where living a dharma life

256
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,960
living a life that's ethical that's peaceful that's not

257
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:55,119
caught up in greed hate and delusion that's where

258
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:00,160
we've come into this beautiful harmony of the dharmic body

259
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:05,280
the dharma dharmakaya the dhammakaya

260
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:11,440
the liberated body operating in the fullness

261
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:18,240
of all its systems integrated harmonious and free

262
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:25,040
so thank you for this week and for today and i hope this has given you an interesting

263
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:30,079
perspective for your body and if you

264
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:36,640
what i talked about today is of interest for you maybe through this weekend you can look you can spend some time

265
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:42,880
meditating and walking and doing simple things with your body and to see if you can kind of intuit or

266
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:49,280
feel into what a liberated body is like what is your body like

267
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,880
when the body has is not just peaceful or tranquil

268
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,400
but has a sense of being

269
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:08,280
operating free of attachments free of clinging thank you
