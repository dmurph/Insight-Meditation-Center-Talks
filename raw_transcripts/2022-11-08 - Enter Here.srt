1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,080
good evening I wonder how the volume is it feels a little bit low is it okay for you guys

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,519
or is it okay let me just

3
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:21,300
so maybe I should say welcome to the end of daylight savings too right this shift

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:28,439
that we do every year is you would think we would get used to it year after year but right I don't know I

5
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:35,820
never get used to it so tonight I'd like to start by reading

6
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,480
a short poem by uh Maddie weingest and

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:48,000
Maddie read some of the poems that were written by in fact it's their earliest

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,120
human literature by women attributed by women and it's in the Buddhist tradition

9
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,399
in this tradition and he read some of those poems and was inspired by them and

10
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,920
kind of wrote some of his own poems based on some other earlier ones those

11
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:12,299
of you who are interested um the original poems are called the terrigata you can find in versions of it on the

12
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,640
website and Maddie weingus inspirational poems

13
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,659
from the book first free women so uh here's one of the poems that he

14
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,759
writes maybe I should say a little bit more about what these poems are about

15
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,159
they are Awakening poems so things that the women after like an Awakening

16
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:42,000
experience they would write a poem or you know say they probably at that time didn't write them but would say a poem

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,820
so it's a kind of an exclamation after Awakening some of it like how they got

18
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,579
there or what the experience was like or something like this

19
00:01:53,780 --> 00:02:00,899
so and the poems are just named after the nun the woman who said them so this

20
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:08,700
one her name was Vijaya when everyone else was meditating

21
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:16,620
I'd be outside the whole wait I'm sorry when everyone else was meditating I'd be

22
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:23,959
outside circling the hole finally I went to confess

23
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:31,980
I'm hopeless I said the Elder nun smiled just keep going she

24
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:39,480
said nothing stays in orbit forever if this circling is all you have why not

25
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:46,319
make this circuline your home I did as she told me and went on

26
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:53,280
circling the hole if you find yourself partly in and

27
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:00,660
partly out if you find yourself drawn to this path and also drawing away

28
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:07,739
I can assure you you're in good company just keep going

29
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:13,220
sometimes the most direct path isn't a straight line

30
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,200
I love this poem it's very sweet right she's kind of like circling around the whole like okay I really should get in

31
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,080
there I really should settle down and meditate but I'll do it later okay but maybe I'll do this I'll distract myself

32
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,239
I'll take care of this I'll clean the refrigerator or all the you know all these types of things that we do right

33
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,659
when we think we should be meditating or whatever it is exercise

34
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:40,860
read more eat better you know all these things right we often are

35
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,140
doing something else but what I love about this poem a is

36
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:51,840
that kind of points to the humanity of this that we all have these ideas of what we

37
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,120
should be doing or want to be doing and then there's what we actually do

38
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,299
and then there's this nun the Elder nun who gives the instructions

39
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:10,739
that's what you're doing just keep doing it and this way that this uh

40
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:17,880
practice this Buddhist practice isn't asking us to be somebody that we're not

41
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:25,199
it's not asking us to completely change ourselves and pretend to be something or

42
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,840
somebody that we're not instead we start Where We Are

43
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,060
of course we do of course we start where we are and for many of us probably more

44
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:42,360
often than we like to admit right we're the ones that are kind of like circling the whole quote unquote instead of like

45
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:49,698
actually getting to the cushion or doing the things that we think that we should be doing want to be doing

46
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,740
so I know certainly for me there have been times when I was just like circling

47
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:01,979
the whole this expression that I just couldn't get myself to like meditate you

48
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:08,660
know even though I had lots of experience meditating and not you know lots of benefits from it and I just

49
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:16,320
couldn't do it I just could not find myself getting to the cushion

50
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:22,680
and it wasn't immediately apparent to me why that was until a little bit later I

51
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:28,139
realized that like I would sit down on the cushion and then you know 90 seconds

52
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:33,720
later oh no I need to take care of this I gotta do that or something like this I

53
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,900
didn't quite recognize that I was distracting myself because there was some uncomfortable emotions that would

54
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,860
arise when I finally would stop circling

55
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:53,340
and just settle down I don't appreciated the impact that

56
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:59,460
these difficult emotions were having on me they weren't I couldn't even tell you exactly what it was but whatever it was

57
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:05,039
I just felt like I did not want to experience it just this oh my gosh and

58
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:11,600
would distract myself or busy myself or something like this

59
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,460
so in this in the Buddhist teachings there

60
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:24,360
aren't a lot of distinct teachings about emotions specifically like had to be with difficult emotions or lovely

61
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:30,479
emotions or things like this and we might understand this in a few

62
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:37,500
ways one is that maybe in Ancient India that had a

63
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:45,419
different understanding about emotions I know we might think that well emotions or emotions what is there to understand

64
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:50,759
but I know that um researchers like when they

65
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:56,520
want to look into emotions they often will like have surveys you know the

66
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:03,660
questionnaires that they ask people to do to kind of learn about people's inner life or what's happening

67
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:11,759
and what they've discovered is that they cannot translate these questionnaires

68
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,100
from English into all other like many other languages because other languages

69
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:22,560
don't even understand emotions the same way for example like in a question like

70
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,319
well when is the intensity of that emotion the greatest some like some

71
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,319
cultures don't even have this idea what do you mean intensity of an emotion that just doesn't make sense we don't think

72
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,539
of emotion as having intensity or they would think about well it's I don't it's

73
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:46,620
only what's expressed it's not what's inside or I don't know exactly how it would be but this was like it turned out

74
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:53,580
to be a whole area of research on its own how different cultures have complete different understanding of what is an

75
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:59,940
emotion as well as the value of emotions so we

76
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:06,599
might understand that's why in Ancient India there just wasn't the understanding that we have these

77
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:13,259
thousands of years later after how many you know all this Psychotherapy and all these types of things now right we

78
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:19,560
shouldn't underestimate how much that's impacted our culture and in terms of how we understand what it means to be a

79
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,139
human and what it means to be a happy human

80
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,620
and I was thinking about this so uh well well how are our emotions

81
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:37,020
talked about and it occurred to me that I don't even I can't even think exactly

82
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:43,020
what the poly word would be for emotion probably where is the language the

83
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:51,019
pictures are written in for this tradition and I I can't even think of one but of course we know about

84
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:56,220
loving-kindness practices which are kind of like heart practices I mean kindness

85
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:03,120
and compassion [Music] we have things like generosity which we

86
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,339
might think is can be an action but also maybe it's just like an openness of the heart

87
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:16,140
so we have things like this but there isn't a emphasis on emotions and

88
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:22,580
how they might be a part of our path of practice

89
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,580
but what is clear I would say in like maybe contemporary times is maybe that's

90
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,620
not like the number one practice we talk about in terms of finding greater

91
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:41,700
Freedom finding Awakening finding peace but it might be I don't know if there's

92
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:47,820
been any research on this but it might be one of the biggest sticking points where

93
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:55,200
people might get stuck or tingled up or have a lot of difficulties is with their

94
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,800
emotions like just like for me like I just couldn't meditate because I was trying

95
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:07,320
to avoid my emotions but I didn't even know I was trying to avoid them it took me a while to kind of figure out and

96
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:13,740
discover what was happening so as sometimes as we start this

97
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:21,360
practice with the mindfulness practice we just start to become more and more aware of our inner life and or

98
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,540
we aren't distracting ourselves as much just paying attention more to

99
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:34,920
our life in all areas of our life and when we do that there might be some new emotions that arise

100
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:42,959
or there might be some recognition some uncomfortable realizations of psychological insights

101
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:48,480
Etc and so

102
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:55,980
even if we aren't aware of them I would say you know their influence you know show up in so many different ways

103
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:02,459
and the last time I gave a Derma talk not that last week but the week before

104
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:09,480
I talked also about emotions and introduced a practice that uh go for

105
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:16,800
install and Tonya Weiser have talked about which I find really helpful and I find myself offering it to a number of

106
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:25,440
people that's a way to support their practice and this is the r a f t

107
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,079
some of you have heard me say this recognize the emotion

108
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:36,959
allow it to be there it is there so you know just allow it to be there

109
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:42,360
feel it in the body and then tease apart are the emotion and

110
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,940
our reaction to that emotion r-a-f-t

111
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,060
so we happily give these instructions raft you can do this with the emotions

112
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:59,519
but I I want to unpack this just a little bit more because

113
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:05,459
this idea of to recognize this the first letter in raft

114
00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:10,160
turns out to not be so simple

115
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,959
because also with some like this emotional research they've

116
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:23,399
when they ask people you know list uh your emotions Or List emotions

117
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:31,640
most people had a list of three sad happy and angry

118
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:38,880
okay but there's many more emotions but most people just in different cultures

119
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:45,839
and Western cultures non-western cultures had just these three but they didn't include things like

120
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:53,480
contentment or despair or embarrassment or hopeful or

121
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,279
overwhelm or ah you're like there's a really long list

122
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,339
but it turns out that people don't have this like vocabulary

123
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:10,320
for their emotional life but it's not that they don't feel these

124
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,139
things but they can't explain it or they can't share it or

125
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:22,500
don't really aren't really in touch with it or something like this and

126
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:28,320
in some ways this can be frustrating because

127
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:35,160
language if we have language if we're able to use word like ah or boredom or

128
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:41,940
contentment whatever it might be ashamed yes really long lists

129
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:48,000
if we don't have words then it's about this it's more difficult to not only

130
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,040
connect with ourselves with our experience but to connect with other people

131
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:59,639
kind of like share what's going on with ourselves to describe what's going

132
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:04,860
on or be able to relate to people because

133
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:12,480
a way that we connect with others and connection is important is through kind of this vulnerability and intimacy

134
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:21,200
through our emotional life but language also helps us to like see

135
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:28,860
connections between people Us and other people ourselves and others or connections

136
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:36,779
between oh this person had that expression on their face when they were talking about ah but when I experienced

137
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:42,240
oh it's different and you know maybe we just start to understand ourselves better and understand the emotions

138
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,060
better if we do have some of this language

139
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:53,660
so I've been saying just Do raft recognize

140
00:14:53,660 --> 00:15:01,920
and not recognizing that actually this for myself to has been part of kind of

141
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,260
my path is to just kind of understand the whole range of emotions

142
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:12,079
as opposed to just happy sad and angry

143
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:20,100
and so one thing that might be helpful or supportive is to broaden our

144
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:27,540
emotional awareness or literacy and one way we can do that is just too frequently

145
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:32,579
throughout the day just check in how am I feeling

146
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:39,480
and it can be helpful to have these lists of these words and there's these lists are I've seen them all over the

147
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,699
place I've seen them in Derma books websites you know these just kind of

148
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:54,300
lists so this could be something to help us this recognize but then this idea of about allowing

149
00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:01,800
allowing emotions that maybe it's helpful to

150
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:07,860
recognize maybe I could use that word that when or to keep in mind that

151
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:15,000
there is no emotion that is fundamentally wrong

152
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:23,220
there just isn't we have emotions that's not the same as

153
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:30,420
behaviors and acting out I'm talking about just the emotion Rage or

154
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:37,259
or lust or you know these types of things right they arise

155
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:46,199
and there isn't any of them that's fundamentally wrong it's just uh what we do with them

156
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:52,259
and how they how we get expressed because so we might say if an emotion is

157
00:16:52,259 --> 00:17:01,079
felt or experienced it doesn't have to be different at that moment

158
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:08,100
we can just allow it to be there we might not know like why this emotion

159
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:13,380
has arisen how long it's going to be here we don't know if there's a lesson

160
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,418
connected to it something that it's needs to tell us or we might as I said

161
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:25,500
not even know precisely which emotion we're experiencing but what we do know that our emotional life

162
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:31,799
is legitimate it's valid it's a rich part of The Human Experience

163
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:39,360
and it has we might say it has a right to be a part of our experience

164
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:45,360
so what we do we don't know you know why

165
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:53,520
it's here or exactly or a lot of things that we don't know about emotions but what we do know that

166
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,880
it does have a right to be here and this knowing like it's okay it's what's

167
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:06,720
arising if we apply that like sincerely and

168
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:14,220
consistently to our life this leads to a certain kind of peace

169
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:21,600
it leads to a diminishment a softening of the struggling with our emotions

170
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:31,380
with our resistance to our emotions to our mistrust of our emotions

171
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:37,400
and this piece but I just recognize that okay this is pure and

172
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:44,460
let's I'm gonna allow it to be here it's legitimate because it actually is here

173
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:50,640
it's not like pretending that it's not there or trying to resist it is going to change the

174
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:57,240
the reality of it having a risen even though we might think that sometimes right we kind of might think

175
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:05,059
this but but as our resistance softens us our

176
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:13,160
allowing increases this peace increases in our life

177
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:20,400
Freedom increases in our life but why is it so hard to allow emotions

178
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:27,780
if they're just this natural thing that humans have however they understand emotions why is it so hard why do we

179
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:35,039
have to have a whole practice around it well I think for many of us we have a

180
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:40,919
mistrust of emotions and maybe a misunderstanding and in some ways this

181
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:45,960
kind of like seems so common

182
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:51,600
and I know I certainly have had a lot of mistrust of emotions

183
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,419
certainly in my younger life I just thought they were messy and

184
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:02,640
I don't know I just thought that they got in the way and life would be so much

185
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,960
better without them right teenage years young adulthood I couldn't find my way you know really

186
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,280
confused and just out of sorts

187
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:20,820
and so I felt like okay just things would be better if that entire emotions and I

188
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:26,520
don't know I can't imagine now I wasn't aware of it then but maybe that was part of why I became a research scientist

189
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:32,460
right because uh you know science is all neat and tidy and I love kind of

190
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:41,520
mathematics with the tidiness of that and so maybe that's partly what led me to in that field

191
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,940
and clearly I didn't stay there but uh so

192
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:55,200
but there was something that when I had kind of early in my Buddhist practice years I

193
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,500
was doing some training to be a chaplain in the hospitals

194
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:07,020
and Interfaith chaplain and as part of the training we read this

195
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:14,480
book called wounded healer by on Henry newin

196
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:23,520
I don't remember all the details of this book this was quite some time ago but just even this idea wounded healer and

197
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:31,559
renewance point is that all the difficulties that we have

198
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:39,960
helps us to connect with others helps us to understand others they are actually just it's okay it's a part of our life

199
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:45,480
and that book in particular was about how to like be a minister or a chaplain

200
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:52,140
to support people this idea that you know people are suffering and you can connect with them through your own

201
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:58,620
suffering and from what you've learned from it and that was a game changer for me to read this book like it never

202
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:03,780
occurred to me oh like all the difficulties I had when

203
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:10,799
I was younger actually could be helpful and I have certainly have found this to be true

204
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,900
and my role as a Dharma teacher and a retreat teacher you know sometimes in

205
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:23,520
Retreats you know are difficulties arise and people meet with me and I can hear

206
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:30,179
and feel and see their difficulties and I feel like oh you know I've been there

207
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:35,960
too and that's really different than just giving a clinical

208
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:44,120
explanation or something like this so this was a big surprise for me

209
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:49,500
that what I felt like needed to be avoided it

210
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:56,039
turned out to be a strength in some ways I don't want to say that I'm perfect with emotions or anything like this and

211
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:02,220
that I can perfectly match everybody that comes to talk to me and I don't want to give that impression

212
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:09,600
but just this idea that our emotional life even if it sometimes

213
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,480
is it difficult emotional life has a value

214
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:22,620
and might even really support us for ourselves or for other loved ones or

215
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:28,980
people in our lives and

216
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:36,000
recently I read this idea that with social media or we live in this world of

217
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,679
personas of people that are constantly trying to project the image

218
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:48,960
this I'm sure was happening before social media but now it's really uh

219
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,120
maybe he was exploded in some ways that we live in a

220
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:59,820
world of personas but we're trying to constantly give the image that we're

221
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:05,880
stable we have it together and we're unafraid and that everybody's walking

222
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:12,179
around trying to do this but not recognizing that actually all of

223
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:18,679
us have some of this suffering inside all of us

224
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:25,679
in fact we might say this is what the Buddha was pointing to with the first Noble Truth that there is suffering

225
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:34,140
is some of this difficulty that's humans experience and we're

226
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:40,380
trying to hide from this difficulty both from others give this impression that we

227
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:45,960
have it together and hide it from ourselves we don't want

228
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:53,299
to be with these things of course we don't want to it's uncomfortable

229
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,880
another reason why it's difficult maybe to just allow emotions

230
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:05,039
is that we have some beliefs about them

231
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:12,299
we have beliefs that well only certain genders Express certain emotions

232
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:18,659
and only at certain times or in certain settings or something like this or

233
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:26,059
just this general idea of I shouldn't feel this this shouldn't be happening

234
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:31,200
and so often we have beliefs you know that come from our culture from the

235
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,960
generation we grew up in you know our families of course of

236
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:43,020
course some people have this idea that you know every emotion must be shared with

237
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:48,539
everybody else and they're like talking all about it all their inner life and other people of the opposite trait that

238
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:55,440
they're not going to share anything but what are some of our beliefs that we

239
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:01,200
have about emotions like the role that they have in our lives or the value that

240
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,440
they have and we might explore this for ourselves just to ask

241
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:14,039
what are our beliefs about this emotion or what scares me

242
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:19,679
about this emotion or

243
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:26,419
what what if I could like fully feel this emotion what would happen

244
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:34,080
and the physiologists tell us that uh emotions last for about 90 seconds if we

245
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:39,659
don't get tangled up with them with stories or if we're not

246
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:45,179
fueling them with these kind of resistance okay this shouldn't be here

247
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:50,279
and oh this means I'm a bad person or something like this and I don't want to

248
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:55,380
be a bad person I shouldn't feel this and the last time I did this happened

249
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:01,260
and I can say in my experience this is true actually

250
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:07,980
I have had this experience on Retreat when the mind is a little bit more quiet and settled

251
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:15,240
of having this really intense like sadness I couldn't even tell you why

252
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,640
it's like oh my gosh it was so intense

253
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:28,500
and like the tears started and like wow like okay I'm I'm just gonna be with

254
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:35,520
this it was intense I'm about 90 seconds later it was gone

255
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:42,000
it's like wow that was amazing like I'd never experienced anything like that I'd heard

256
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,159
these ideas that okay emotions can be short-lived but we only prolong them

257
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:52,320
with our stories but it wasn't until they actually experienced that

258
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:58,799
and I had this idea like was that what I was afraid of

259
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:06,000
that wasn't so bad 90 seconds I can handle this so kind of gave me some confidence and

260
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,279
kind of also shifted my experience with emotions

261
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:16,940
so we might have some resistance we might have some of these

262
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:24,779
beliefs about them but this idea of

263
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:31,679
we our emotional life can just be folded into part of our practice

264
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:39,120
instead of something that gets in the way of our practice or this feeling of well I'll meditate when

265
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,940
um I'm feeling a little bit more stable or when I have this uh

266
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:50,419
emotional thing taken care of or whatever it might be

267
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:57,900
this idea of r-a-f-t recognize allow feel in the body

268
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:04,559
the feel in the body so we can get out of the thoughts and then to tease apart the reactions

269
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:13,200
most often our reaction is resistance so part of our practice is maybe just to

270
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:19,380
notice acknowledge and experience the emotion to the best

271
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,159
of our ability

272
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:32,880
and this we should not underestimate how powerful this is just how our life unfolds differently if

273
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,980
we don't have this feeling that we have to avoid certain emotions

274
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:46,100
if we don't have to avoid certain situations because they might create the conditions in which emotions might arise

275
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:53,340
so this idea of instead of like avoiding or distracting or circling around the

276
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:59,760
whole maybe there's a way in which there can be more like of a inter here

277
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:06,059
kind of way of enter here into the meditation Hall so to speak or enter

278
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:13,200
here as a way of our practice like our emotional life is a place in which we don't have to run

279
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:19,679
away from of course we have to use wisdom here too

280
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:25,620
it's not helpful to jump into emotion in a way that's going to cause overwhelm

281
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:35,279
so it could swim we're overwhelmed we are overwhelmed we don't have access to our wisdom and support and resources

282
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:41,460
so and we also need to take care of our trauma history sometimes that can really

283
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:47,659
tip us over and to overwhelm kind of rather easily

284
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:54,659
but our mindfulness practice our practice towards greater Awakening

285
00:30:54,659 --> 00:31:00,539
needs to include our emotional life not because it's

286
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:10,140
once we have that all cleaned up we're going to be come awakened but because that most often is what is a can be a

287
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:15,600
roadblock to Greater Peace and Freedom and ease

288
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:21,720
so as a way to help work with some of the difficulties in our lives so our

289
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:26,820
mindfulness practice can of course include

290
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:33,779
our emotions recognize allow feel in the body tease

291
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:38,880
apart and as our practice uh

292
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,399
evolves our experienced with emotions evolve

293
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:50,340
let me beginning we often have like these interpretations or narratives

294
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:57,179
about emotions we have um stories about them and we talk about them and we might

295
00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:02,700
feel like okay this is a an authentic way for me to be with our emotions but

296
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:08,760
there's a way also in which we do that which we're not actually experiencing or

297
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:15,240
feeling them we're just talking about them so it's different

298
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:21,899
maybe that is kind of like the recognizing part of this and then

299
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:31,020
further along with practice then we actually feel them we feel the heart break we feel the sadness the tears come

300
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:36,960
that we feel the anger the heat of the anger

301
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:43,080
and we also feel the resistance we feel that nerds and notice are the way we

302
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:48,080
want to distract ourselves from that and not be with us

303
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,720
and then with the further with practice then the resistance patterns start

304
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:00,659
dissolving we start to see how just in all areas of our life it doesn't serve us to

305
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:07,320
be disconnected from ourselves and to be trying to isolate ourselves from

306
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:13,380
everything that's uncomfortable we recognize it's not possible to do that and

307
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:19,440
it's not the end of the world if we're uncomfortable and then

308
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,880
we start to realize that the direct experience of emotion without any

309
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:33,919
resistance just the sheer emotion is perfectly fine

310
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:40,340
it arises we experience it and it passes away

311
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:48,720
it doesn't have to be more complicated than that but it's a journey to get to

312
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:55,980
like recognize that to actually feel to be okay to allow them and just to have

313
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:03,539
this be part of our experience and then maybe I'll end with this an

314
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:10,980
excerpt from a poem from Jeff Foster and this poem is called

315
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:18,780
how I became a warrior once I ran from Fear

316
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:25,618
so fear controlled me until I learned to hold fear like a

317
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:31,020
newborn listen to it but not give in

318
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:37,020
honor it but not worship it fear cannot stop me anymore

319
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:45,480
I walked with courage Into the Storm I still have fear but it does not have me

320
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:51,118
and then he continues with a bunch of other emotions I'm not going to read them all here

321
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:57,060
and then the ending of the poem goes once I ran from difficult feelings now

322
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:02,280
they are my advisors confidant's friends and they all have a home in me

323
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:09,780
and they all belong and have dignity I am sensitive soft fragile my arms

324
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:15,180
wrapped around all my inner children and in my sensitivity

325
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:24,619
power in my fragility an unshakable presence

326
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,859
in the depths of my wounds in what I had named Darkness

327
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:38,520
I found a blazing light that guides me now in battle

328
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:44,460
I became a Warrior when I turned towards myself

329
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:52,859
and started listening Jeff Foster how I became a warrior

330
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:59,700
this idea of our emotions are even though when the

331
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:06,839
kind of like the Buddhist scene we don't talk about them necessarily that much and they're not an integral part of the

332
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:12,000
Buddha's teachings but their integral part of our life

333
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,000
and we can welcome them into our lives and we can work with them and not avoid

334
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:25,020
them so I think with that I'll open it up if there are some questions

335
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:33,079
including if there's some questions on YouTube I don't know if anybody does or will but

336
00:36:54,180 --> 00:37:01,200
hi thank you Diana again um well I with the raft

337
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:08,700
um practice I find that knowing that I have to recognize it

338
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:16,380
I don't want to allow it to be there and so I just feel unwilling because then I

339
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:24,119
know I'm like oh gosh here we go again but then I know it's stories that I tell myself and so rather

340
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:31,260
than what in your last poem what Foster put had put like there are all the EX my

341
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:36,780
previous experiences can help guide me I'm like I don't want to do that again because it

342
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:42,839
sucks and so when I'm in my when I'm trying to meditate

343
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:49,560
I I kind of just I have I put the timer on and I try to go with it and see what arises

344
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:57,359
but I'm just busy thinking and and I know that with this practice there is more

345
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:04,200
awareness but hard to deal with it because I don't sometimes I feel like because I don't

346
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:11,640
want to I just I don't blame you I think right right it's hard this is hard and I'm making it

347
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:18,119
sound like oh okay just do raft you'll be fine it's not like that right this life is

348
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:24,180
messy and complicated and all these types of things and there might be some real wisdom

349
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:29,640
to recognize say okay there's that sadness and you know what I'm gonna deal

350
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:34,980
with you later right now I'm meditating and maybe there can be just say you know

351
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:41,220
later or anger or something and just say it later so just recognize it and not just

352
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:46,320
like allow ourselves to just fall into it to say okay I see that it's here but

353
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:54,720
right now I'm not going to do this so there might be some wisdom into doing this and what happens is as we kind of

354
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,859
like gain some confidence or gain some um

355
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:08,220
yeah experiences where we're um are not being pushed around as much

356
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:14,579
then it becomes easier and I actually I recently I read this description thank

357
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:22,680
you for saying this I I wanted to bring this in the talk that um this idea that when we really don't

358
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:28,260
want something or let's say this there's this uh expression what we resist

359
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:35,820
persists you might have heard of this but I've heard of this other ways like so we have an emotion and I'll speak to

360
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:43,260
me and we have this maybe this reaction to the emotion and if we uh the reaction is what we really don't want it then

361
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:49,859
what happens is the emotion kind of like they lean end up leaning against each other and so they get stronger and

362
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:56,400
stronger but then if the resistance were to go away then the emotion just kind of Falls

363
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,160
away so the more we're resisting the stronger the emotions are but we can't

364
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:10,079
see that like we don't right now this is these are just words that I'm saying but as we start to have

365
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:16,440
more experience as we start to yeah I'll just say this have more

366
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:21,839
experience with our practice and the resistance just starts to soften a

367
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:27,359
little bit and then the intensity of the emotions softens as well

368
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:32,820
they go they go down together they're intuitly intricately related

369
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:39,000
so and you're doing the right thing I appreciate very much that you said oh no I don't want to feel this and then you

370
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,400
said and I know those are the stories perfect that's where we start like okay

371
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:52,380
I'm all tangled up here I have all these stories going with it and I don't want it perfect and then it's perfectly fine too

372
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:59,280
to say okay I'm all tangled up I'm gonna put this aside right now we don't have to jump right in I don't

373
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:05,099
know if this is helpful Andrews yes very much I and I thought that is what's been

374
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:11,880
happening I just resist and it persists on but and and that's because I allow it

375
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:17,820
to persist rather than just tease it apart or feel feel what it's like in the

376
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:23,760
body instead of identifying with it like oh so now this is what I'm and it

377
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:29,760
doesn't have to be like that so maybe being honest with myself too so thank you you're welcome

378
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,520
it turns out honesty is not a bad thing

379
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:47,460
is there one that so J can you hear me yeah so Jeremy has

380
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:54,000
a question um okay I need to scroll a little bit

381
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,940
I find that my mind tends to jump from recognize to feel

382
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:06,960
uh since I feel emotions mostly As tension

383
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:13,020
but then I have aversion to the tension what was that last word I have with a

384
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:21,560
version of attention do I need to slow down and go through accept first before feel

385
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:32,940
I often think about maybe I should talk here this way I uh often think about

386
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:40,260
feeling as a way to help us allow so accept is a little bit different than

387
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:45,800
allow and I would say like allow is like okay it is there can we not push it away

388
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:53,820
and to feel it in the body is one way that helps us to allow it because we are

389
00:42:53,820 --> 00:43:00,359
um if we're in the body then we're less in our heads and the heads that is where we have the story about the shouldn't be

390
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:06,839
here I don't want to be here oh no here I go I'm always going to be like this or whatever we might have

391
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:14,700
so you don't necessarily have to slow down because raft doesn't have to be in that

392
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:22,380
order but um you might feel the tension I guess maybe you are

393
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:27,380
feeling the tension right if you're saying this so

394
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:34,380
the emotion might become the aversion might become the next

395
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:40,619
emotion so then you recognize that and feel the aversion and then there

396
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:45,720
might be a version to aversion and then to recognize that aversion and

397
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:52,140
then just to recognize oh okay there's some resistance here is there something that can soften and

398
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:58,260
it might be sometimes softening in the body can help too which can soften the

399
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:04,800
what's going on in the mind and the whole experience sometimes it's a deep exhale or something like this might help

400
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,560
so I hope I hope that was uh clear enough

401
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:17,339
okay so here we are at the top of the hour thank you for your attention

402
00:44:17,339 --> 00:44:23,300
and I'm wishing you all a wonderful rest of the evening thank you
