00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:08,200
hello and welcome to this Friday meditation at

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:14,519
IMC And as we come to the

3
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:22,960
final talk on uh the third Janna the third absorption

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,160
third immersion the third way of getting settled

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,680
peacefully into a

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,800
wholeness And I like using the word wholeness because

7
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,320
um the idea in these deep immersive

8
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,680
states is to um have

9
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,600
the the goodness of these states often described as joy and

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,840
happiness to be pervasive throughout the body The whole body is

11
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:11,520
included And the body that we talk about in Buddhism is not exactly the same as

12
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,960
our physical body Uh it's the body that we

13
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:27,119
experience It's the body we experience through the medium of all kinds of aspects of the mind the

14
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,320
state of the mind the orientations of the mind the preferences of the mind the

15
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:39,040
beliefs and thoughts stories of the mind We are not innocent

16
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:46,880
uh experiencer of this body We only experience a small subset

17
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:54,079
of all the things happening in our body It's a subset that has

18
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,759
uh you know where our the mind travels through the nerve the nerves that

19
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,799
stretch out from or are part of the mind It's almost as if wherever there's a

20
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,280
nerve ending the mind is right there as well And the whole functioning of the

21
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:18,160
mind then shifts and changes how we experience the body

22
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,440
And as we go into these deeper states of meditation

23
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,500
uh it is um we

24
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:36,400
[Music] are shifting the orientation to the body

25
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,640
what we pick up in the body what we amplify what we add to the experience of

26
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:51,200
the body And one of those things is that we start living more in a whole way We don't we

27
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,440
stop selecting out a piece of it or we stop having blinders on because we're

28
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,640
thinking so much and preoccupied by things

29
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,239
And one of the characteristics of deepening and deepening in meditation in

30
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:14,840
samadei meditation is an increase increasing feeling of

31
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,360
peace And in the third genre this is characterized with the word

32
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:28,720
equinimity Equinimity There's the peace of nonreactivity The peace of not making

33
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:36,159
something about making up something about what's happening Not making up stories or

34
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:45,560
living in the stories of what's happening Judging it commentary not tensing or reaching for

35
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,000
experience There's a deep settleness And the peace of the third

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:00,680
Janna is um is different than what's going to come in the fourth Janna The peace is

37
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:09,519
um kind of like the peace you might find if you kind of dive under the water

38
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,639
and rest there for a few moments It can be very peaceful and

39
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:21,600
still and but still there's a the texture the viscosity of the water

40
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,759
that's there There's something there that is buoyant maybe something there

41
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,800
that um presses gently against us if unless

42
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,080
we go too deep and uh it doesn't offer much

43
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:45,880
resistance We can swim through it but it's still there It's not as thin as the

44
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:54,160
air And so this piece of the third Janna has a little bit of density a

45
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:01,960
little bit of viscosity little bit of sub substantuality perhaps

46
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,120
something that um spreads through the body

47
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,800
It feels very whole and complete Everything that we touch in the

48
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,840
body everything the nerve ends touch and that we can be directly aware of is

49
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:26,080
felt in this lake of peace

50
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,639
So assuming a meditation posture

51
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:38,800
and over time the posture itself becomes the beginning of

52
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,880
appreciating peace with the body becoming still The

53
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:51,280
body not being so active anymore For a beginner in meditation the

54
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,360
posture is a challenge and maybe takes work and patience

55
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:02,039
and but as over the months and years of regular

56
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:10,479
meditation the body and the posture become a refuge a refuge in

57
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:16,080
stillness a wonderful form of

58
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:22,039
nonactivity that is satisfying just in

59
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:28,400
itself So feeling the peace maybe the stillness of the posture

60
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:40,039
the body and breathing deeply and relaxing

61
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,240
relaxing

62
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:53,039
peacefully If you feel your muscles relax the moments in which it's

63
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,240
releasing and softening are moments moving towards

64
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,240
peace

65
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:22,720
relaxing softening and letting the breathing return to

66
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:36,638
normal And the absence of the activity of breathing deeply and

67
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:47,000
relaxing means that now there's a different kind of peace here The peace of not doing those things

68
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,960
And as you inhale for a few breaths feel the thinking

69
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,960
mind Feel the tensions or pressure or agitation there might be

70
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:17,560
there And as you relax as you exhale relax the thinking mind

71
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:34,479
As a thinking mind relaxes it relaxes toward

72
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,640
into peace in the mind

73
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:16,519
And then to in a way that feels

74
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:22,040
peaceful gentle lower your

75
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,320
awareness into the body breathing

76
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:36,959
Maybe landing on the settling spot the grounding spot of

77
00:09:52,200 --> 00:10:01,279
breathing And while you're aware of breathing also open your

78
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:08,320
attention peripheral awareness out beyond the

79
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:19,160
edges of breathing beyond the edges of the sensations you have of breathing

80
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,519
And maybe beyond the edges of

81
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,640
breathing there is some kind of

82
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:48,040
peace stillness spaciousness

83
00:10:53,279 --> 00:11:00,200
In which the sensations of breathing

84
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,200
float

85
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,880
move or nested

86
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,519
did gently

87
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:43,839
softly feel the spread head of peace as you

88
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:59,839
breathe As if the movements of breathing are a gentle wind a gentle

89
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:07,240
warmth expanding the peace through your body

90
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,600
Reassuring the mind that it's

91
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,800
okay to quiet your thinking

92
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:54,000
Taking a moment to

93
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:59,160
quiet your inner life

94
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:09,240
So you can feel allow yourself to

95
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:16,639
feel the influence of any degree of

96
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,559
peace that's

97
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,039
present in the

98
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,720
body in the experience of

99
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:50,200
breathing in the mind and heart

100
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:09,120
And perhaps the peace found in any degree of

101
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:19,840
spaciousness here around you within

102
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:30,840
You allow yourself to feel silently

103
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:36,120
feel the influence of peace

104
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:44,520
And as we come to the end of the meditation I'd like to evoke an ancient

105
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:51,159
Buddhist idea around samadei

106
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:59,400
that there is something about the well-being of somebody the peace of

107
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:08,559
somebody that we can drink we can it's like medicine or

108
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:15,200
nourishment And so to drink the nourishment of

109
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:27,519
peace take it in the nourishment of peace and let it spread through your

110
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:31,679
body through your

111
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:37,440
arms your legs

112
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:47,039
legs the back rib cage the

113
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:55,840
spine the belly and the front rib

114
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:04,679
cage into the head

115
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,760
and to feel peace as a nourishment

116
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:20,360
Whatever degree however little there is maybe it's a homeopathic dosage of

117
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,480
peace feel it sense

118
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:35,320
it and then wish it for

119
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:42,120
others May others have a chance to experience peace

120
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:50,559
Those who are experiencing violence may they be

121
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:59,519
peaceful May they know peace Those who experience

122
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:05,760
hate may they feel

123
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,799
peace an experience of peaceful

124
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:19,720
time Those who are ignored and

125
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,840
marginalized may they feel peace

126
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:33,919
peace that allows them to be whole dignified in their own

127
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:47,320
right And those who grieve may they feel

128
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:53,120
peace to hold the grief to allow it to be

129
00:29:53,880 --> 00:30:00,480
there And may it be that what we learn about peace

130
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:06,440
through meditation May it be that it spreads from

131
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:12,919
us as medicine as nourishment for our

132
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:20,600
world May all beings be happy May all

133
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:29,120
beings be safe May all beings be

134
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:34,080
peaceful May all beings be

137
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:51,519
Hello and welcome to this fifth talk on the third Janna as part of this samadei

138
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:59,120
series And um sometimes I've thought that the third

139
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:06,320
Janna is my favorite of the Janna Maybe because it certainly has a degree of

140
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:15,120
wonderful degree of peace but it also has kind of a very satisfying comforting or deep feeling of well-being that's

141
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:22,278
part of it that seems to fill the whole body

142
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:29,559
And so but one of the so I want to read again the gen the ancient description of

143
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:34,960
the third Janna as part of completing this

144
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:44,840
week with a fading of joy a practitioner abides at quantamus

145
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:51,760
aware and with clear recognition and experience experiences

146
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:59,760
the happiness of the body The practitioner enters and abides

147
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:09,600
in the third Janna of which the noble ones declare a quantamus and aware abides in

148
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,840
happiness The practitioner

149
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:22,360
pervades pervades saturates permeates this body with

150
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:29,159
happiness that is freed of joy So that no part of the body is not

151
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:36,080
touched by the happiness So one of the characteristics of this

152
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,159
third genre is equinimity and uh and that's a form of

153
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:48,080
peace There's something peaceful about not reacting about not being caught and

154
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,360
being for and against or preferences Um partly because there's no

155
00:33:53,360 --> 00:34:01,360
reason for it Um but partly because even in this third Janna where uh the

156
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:09,118
experience is just predominantly or only pleasant that um uh we don't lean into

157
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,398
it We're not grabbing it We're not uh involved in any kind of reactivity

158
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:19,960
positive reactivity towards it We're aquatamus We're peaceful about

159
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:26,480
it because it's allowing something deep in our mind deep in our psyche to relax

160
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:32,760
to let go to not have to be constantly chronically

161
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:39,720
active doing making wanting protecting figuring

162
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:46,398
out responding to every little thing that happens The mind can have this

163
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:53,000
tremendous clarity It's a quantmous It's aware There's a clear knowing of what's

164
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,440
happening But at the same time uh everything is allowed to happen

165
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:06,640
freely Uh and the classic metaphor as I've said is um beautiful flowers lotus

166
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:12,640
flowers that are open and just exquisitely pristine Perhaps

167
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:20,920
uh lotuses are uh considered somehow pure and uh uh floating in water

168
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:26,680
underwater peacefully very peacefully and everything that we

169
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:33,680
experience is held in the in the water of the mind the water of of uh happiness

170
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,960
the water of peace equinimity And as we come to the end of

171
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,400
this week on the third Janna uh the word the word peace itself is not in the

172
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:50,880
description of the Janna But equinimity is a form of peace It's not uh there's

173
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:58,000
many flavors of peace This is one of the great delights of meditation of dharma practice Maybe one of the delights of

174
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:05,200
human life is uh to be able to appreciate the flavors of peace the many

175
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,960
flavors that that we can experience And um and if you never heard

176
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:18,200
of this idea that peace can have many flavors many be experienced many different ways that different

177
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:23,440
characteristics Uh you might want to make a study of that maybe over this

178
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:30,079
weekend before we start again You might uh give yourself an opportunity to

179
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:38,520
experience peace Maybe there's places you can go that you can experience it Maybe

180
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:44,880
there's some kind of um cathedral church in your neighborhood

181
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,560
that has very peaceful inside Maybe a park with the grove of trees

182
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:56,400
Maybe there's um a peaceful bank of a river that you can go sit by Maybe it's

183
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:03,560
a corner of your home that maybe looking out the window or maybe with uh maybe

184
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:10,240
with you know setting up a certain kind of context Maybe when you're alone at home or you just allow yourself the

185
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:16,200
chance to not do anything except begin to sense and feel

186
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:23,040
uh peace and the different ways peace can be experienced Maybe you find yourself in situations

187
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:29,280
that are quite agitating and difficult but with a assignment to feel the

188
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:36,359
different flavors of peace maybe ask yourself in a way maybe you've never done before in this in a trying

189
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:43,520
situation Um where's the peace here where's the peace while people are

190
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:49,960
arguing where's the peace when there's a difficult tension in the room is there

191
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:56,480
any and there always will be somewhere uh provide and at minimum it can be

192
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:03,720
found in the calm mindfulness the calm awareness that searches for

193
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:10,960
it and um so in this third genre there's a degree of peace and that peace feels

194
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:17,119
uh not personal exactly it can feel almost like it expands beyond the edges

195
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:22,960
of the body or beyond the edges certainly of any ways that we we usually

196
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,800
define ourselves or want to be and uh there's all kinds of lessons around this

197
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,920
uh in the third gen and one of them is that um any appropriation any kind of

198
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:40,560
movement towards making it mine or this is me having this experience can be seen

199
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:46,320
as um creating agitation on the surface of the lake It can feel like it's

200
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:52,800
unnecessary it actually detracts from the richness of the experience

201
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:59,960
And so to begin kind of appreciating the peace feeling what peace is here and

202
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:08,160
um and uh and becoming a connoisseur of of peace and the reason

203
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:15,680
for this is that in the fourth Janna uh the it's the equinimity becomes

204
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:23,119
stronger and more peaceful and so uh being able to kind of sense and have a

205
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:28,440
kind of um registering of the qualities characteristic of

206
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:35,839
peace characteristics of this happiness that's there Uh that's the the means by

207
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:42,079
which or the condition by which our psychophysical system can move into the

208
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:48,560
fourth Janna So it's one of the charact one of the characteristics of this instructions

209
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:55,440
in the four janna is to pervade saturate and pervade the body with the joy and

210
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,280
happiness with the happiness with the peace Um partly so we can know it well

211
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:08,640
We can feel it well Um we can feel it in a deep way that it's almost like we are

212
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:17,280
not feeling it because we're not appropriating it or measuring it against me myself and mine or or or uh defining

213
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,400
ourselves by it or wanting more or wanting less Just really getting to know

214
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:28,359
it on its own terms how that is and this deeper

215
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:33,680
familiarity So sometimes I've known people who go into the Janna and are

216
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,960
kind of in a hurry to go through it They want to be masters of it They want to be

217
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:45,359
somehow this idea of being a good meditator or a successful practitioner There might be a little bit conceit

218
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:50,800
around going into these deep states And this is rather unfortunate

219
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:58,240
because the conceit gets in the way of the deeper lessons of these states And

220
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:05,480
one of the deeper lessons is to take in the kind of the selfless

221
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:13,599
experience of something profound going on a profound movement a profound opening a profound quality of well-being

222
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:19,079
and peace that um we want to really

223
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:26,160
register and uh and get to know well without any interference any kind of

224
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:32,720
agitation or or that comes with um trying to do something with or get more

225
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:39,400
from it or speed along and just just being very subtle led very

226
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:46,920
peaceful and uh discovering the almost selfless quality of these deep deep

227
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:53,800
states because we're not selfing around it There's a deeper

228
00:41:53,800 --> 00:42:01,359
peace So um so if you're at all inclined I encourage you to spend this weekend

229
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:08,560
um um getting to know the flavors of peace for you Search for it Look for it

230
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:16,359
Uh search it out where places you can go what people you can be with uh what ways

231
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:23,599
of doing housework what ways of being at home Um that uh you can actually take

232
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:28,800
time to begin exploring the different qualities characteristics of what how

233
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,240
you experience peace And then you'll be a little better prepared for next week

234
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:41,200
when we do the fourth Janna So thank you very much for being part of

235
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:46,359
this and I look forward to our continuation
