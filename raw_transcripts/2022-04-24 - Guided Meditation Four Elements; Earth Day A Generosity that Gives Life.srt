1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:08,960
so good morning everyone and welcome to imc and mostly we'll sit quietly this

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,920
morning and uh but i would like to

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,760
uh one of the central meditation aspects of this

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,480
vipassana tradition is to be aware of the four elements

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,160
and here we're kind of this is the sunday to celebrate

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,280
earth a day and so the four elements are earth

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:46,160
water fire and wind and uh

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,160
and in this tradition the pipasana sometimes will focus on

9
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,640
the ways that these are found in ourselves as particular

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,080
qualities of experience the earth element is

11
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,880
they often say the earth element is everything that's hard and solid

12
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,759
but itself i often experiences that which is offer support

13
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,200
the water element is

14
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,920
everything that's fluid moist but the quality the way it's experienced is it

15
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,880
it's that which holds things together cohesion

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,799
and uh the fire element is all the everything that's animated in us

17
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:51,359
everything that's energized within us the energizing forces of life

18
00:01:52,799 --> 00:02:00,240
which is basically all their sensations and then there's uh the fire the uh wind

19
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,600
element and that's the movements everything that moves as we sit the

20
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:13,200
movements of the chest the diaphragm the belly anything that moves just the wind element

21
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,200
so to sit quietly here and to feel those four

22
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,840
so to gently close your eyes

23
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,879
and to feel the support

24
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,879
of the earth

25
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,239
the earth both is what we rest on

26
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,840
our bodies the earth element it supports us

27
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,000
and to feel the contact of your body against your chair your cushion

28
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,319
the floor in a sense would hold you up from the

29
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,280
pull of gravity

30
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:23,200
in your body there's a support of your lower torso that holds up the upper torso

31
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,360
the neck that supports the head

32
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,519
and a water element the cohesion

33
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:47,680
that can be exaggerated in all the feelings of

34
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:55,200
tension that we have the holding together the tightening

35
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:02,000
pulling in and to gently

36
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,599
as you exhale exhaling the wind to the air

37
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,720
to release some of the extra tension holding in

38
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,200
your body

39
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,079
relaxing in the shoulders

40
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,840
the belly

41
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,479
in a sense releasing the tension that pulls the muscles inward

42
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:49,600
and allowing your muscles to fall outward away from this bones

43
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:56,960
where it can be held by the skin the cohesive holding

44
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,759
property of the skin can hold us

45
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:15,759
and the fire element of everything that's animated energized

46
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:23,199
within us energized sensations every sensation you experience

47
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:29,199
is there because of the animated energy of

48
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:36,280
the nerves the firing

49
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:44,879
the energy behind thinking this is the fire element

50
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:54,720
whatever you're feeling emotions are an expression of that animated

51
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:01,918
life energy of the buddhism likens to fire

52
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,479
and that fire element can come into harmony like a candle

53
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:16,800
frame flame without any wind everything burning everything alive

54
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,600
animated held in awareness

55
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:31,759
allowed to burn allowed to be without our

56
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,919
preferences our likes and dislikes our wants and aversions

57
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,800
pushing them around

58
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,840
and then the wind element gently

59
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,759
as you breathe in and out gently feel

60
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,680
the movements of the body as you breathe

61
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,280
so

62
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:43,800
maybe treating the breathing is something delicate fragile

63
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:52,479
tender that you want to hold or receive gently in awareness

64
00:07:52,479 --> 00:08:00,960
with no forcefulness just a soft receiving

65
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,520
of breathing the movements of the body

66
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,479
touching awareness

67
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,840
and so we sit here

68
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,518
aware of the natural

69
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,959
elements found within us

70
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,240
that are found in the natural world

71
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,640
and we sitting here in a certain way are continuous

72
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,600
with the outer world in the inner world here

73
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,839
now

74
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,560
nature

75
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,320
here and now

76
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,200
okay

77
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,720
this

78
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,360
so

79
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,279
so

80
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,519
so

81
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,320
uh

82
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,240
so

83
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,320
so

84
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,480
so

85
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,199
so

86
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,920
you

87
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,880
so

88
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,399
so

89
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,920
you

90
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,680
so

91
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,639
so

92
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,760
so

93
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,480
so

94
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,480
so

95
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,039
so

96
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,559
so

97
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,679
so

98
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,760
so

99
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
so

100
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,320
now

101
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,760
so

102
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,320
do

103
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,120
so

104
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,159
so

105
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:23,200
as we come to the end of this sitting

106
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:29,840
i'd like to use the analogy of a light

107
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,600
that goes on in a dark room

108
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:42,880
then if the light is on a dimmer and it gets turned on at the absolute

109
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:48,158
most lowest setting

110
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:53,519
the room might just begin to come into view

111
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:59,360
just a little bit but as a dimmer goes that's turned up

112
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:06,799
higher and higher more and more comes into view until the whole room is filled with light

113
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:14,960
so we come to the end of a sitting and we dedicate our practice for the welfare and

114
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:22,480
happiness of others it might begin with this

115
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:29,518
the light of care the light of compassion light of

116
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:36,960
our deep connection to others maybe it's turned on that just a little

117
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:44,398
bit and our wish to benefit others can be a small wish

118
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,840
but it can be the beginning of that light getting brighter and

119
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,440
brighter until it fills the world

120
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:02,720
may it be that our care for others and for this world

121
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,840
can grow steadily within us

122
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:15,040
and may it be that the benefits that come from this morning's practice

123
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:21,638
is dedicated some way known in unknown ways

124
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,878
for the happiness safety and peace all beings

125
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:35,040
in this world of war and environmental degradation

126
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,599
poverty and hostility and hate

127
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:46,480
may we be a light in wishing and working for

128
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:53,679
possibility that all beings may be happy

129
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,560
all beings may be safe

130
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:08,000
all beings may be peaceful and all beings

131
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,720
be free

132
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:20,760
and may that wish be a light that grows stronger and stronger

133
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:33,709
[Music]

134
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,699
so [Music]

135
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,720
so before i

136
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,839
before the talk i think

137
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:20,320
one of the nice announce announcements especially since we're celebrating earth day today a few

138
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:28,079
days late but we do it on sundays usually is that the imc is

139
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,240
starting up restarting its earth care group

140
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:39,680
that is a group of people here at imc whose

141
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:47,040
meet to talk about earth care activities studying earth care issues together

142
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:52,880
and considering what imc might do

143
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,160
in this wider world for caring for this earth

144
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:04,160
and i think they're going to start having regular monthly meetings and they're going to be a lot of them will be on

145
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:10,400
zoom so it means that people who are imc connected people far away could maybe participate

146
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,760
and the first meeting will be next saturday at 1pm and uh

147
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:23,200
ram who's here in the back those of you here raising his hand in the back he's one of the people organizing it

148
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:30,000
and he went through the sati center's buddhist eco-chaplaincy program and now

149
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,800
he's deeply connected to this whole world and shawnee here also who's here she's also went through the

150
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:43,040
buddhist equal chaplaincy program together with ram so anyway so that's the

151
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,160
so if you're interested there's more information on the website under what's new it's an announcement for it with the

152
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:54,000
zoom link it's also also in the imc calendar and or if you're here in imc you can talk to

153
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,599
ram and probably shawnee too

154
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,040
so

155
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:10,480
so to talk about her this day earth day

156
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:16,000
i want to uh adapt a story that i'm fond of i've told

157
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:23,680
before but adapted for this occasion and the story has to do with uh

158
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:29,119
in the village there was a a couple who were going to give birth to

159
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:36,640
their first child and she was born and this beautiful little baby girl

160
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:43,200
and uh some wise elder of the village

161
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:49,760
or from the neighborhood the area came through town and looked at her and said oh very nice

162
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:57,119
however it's her destiny that she will die on her wedding night

163
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:02,800
oh well so the the couple had the baby then raised his

164
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:08,480
daughter and were kind of hesitant to have her be married but at some point she couldn't they couldn't keep her from

165
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,760
becoming married and they didn't want to tell her about the prophecy

166
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,200
so she was married and then there was that that evening a

167
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,640
big party and everyone in the village came and it was a big celebration and party and

168
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:32,640
to celebrate this wedding and um the parents of course were a little bit worried what this meant

169
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:39,599
and everybody was involved in the party and then but then someone knocked on the door and it turned out to be this very old

170
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:45,599
lady who lived on the edges of the village and people had kind of forgotten about

171
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:52,079
her no one really quite knew whole she was but

172
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:58,400
she had lived there for her whole life and she had given birth to a number of kids

173
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:04,400
she cared for and she took care of her grandkids

174
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:12,720
even took care of her great-grandchildren but because people had children when they were quite young in this village

175
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:19,599
after she had grandchildren and great girl she stopped having the energy to take care of them that she was old

176
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:25,599
and as the generations proceeded she was forgotten that some of her kids

177
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:31,839
and grandkids had died and great-grandchildren had died and so the people left this old old

178
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:37,599
lady she couldn't take care of herself anymore and people left her alone and

179
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:43,119
what you said anybody of an old lady and so she was hungry and poor

180
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:49,520
and so they came to the wedding knocking on the door to ask for some food

181
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:56,480
and the guests opened the door said i'll just shoot her away you know someone that poor and old you know just

182
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,520
just not so not so nice to have a wedding party we're celebrating they shoot her away

183
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:07,599
and but then the bride saw this

184
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:12,960
so she went out and asked what is it it's so i'm hungry

185
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,720
oh let me bring you some food so you brought her a big plate of food and may i sit with you while you eat and she

186
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:24,880
said yes and now when they had finished eating her meal the old lady said to

187
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,519
the bride

188
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:36,880
you know i've been here living this village for a long long long time

189
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:42,160
and i have a lot to teach you for the sake of your children and their

190
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:49,280
children and their children down the generations i know things that people have forgotten

191
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:55,920
i know the seasons to plant and harvest so that the soil doesn't erode away it actually keeps the

192
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:02,400
soil healthy and fertile i know how to harvest things from the forest

193
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:08,800
trees and everything so the forest regenerates i know how to care for the lakes and the

194
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:15,599
rivers so that pollutions and sewage and all kinds of things don't destroy the life there

195
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:21,520
i know how to have fires in the village when to do it where to do it how to do

196
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:26,640
it so that the children don't grow up with asthma

197
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:33,838
if you come visit me i'll teach you these things and the bride said sure i'll come

198
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,240
and uh well she went by went back to the party it was celebration

199
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:46,800
the bride and groom do what bride and grooms do and then they uh the next morning

200
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,839
the bride was still alive so the parents were kind of like what

201
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:57,599
happened you know so they went to the person who had prophesized about her death

202
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:03,920
and they said well there was one thing i couldn't tell you there was one thing that would allow her to live

203
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,119
and that was she had to be selflessly generous

204
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:15,280
but if i'd said that she wouldn't it wouldn't have been selfless so she would have wouldn't have been real generosity

205
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:22,880
and she did that selfless giving to this old ladies and that's that kept her alive it saved her

206
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:30,800
and uh and then more than and saved her she got a gift back

207
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,680
from it and offered to come and study and learn

208
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:43,599
and this old lady her name was in different languages in

209
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:50,720
our buddhist language he was bhumi mata the earth mother

210
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:56,800
terra madre in italian in norwegian it's you

211
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:03,359
and the word yo mo means earth mother it also is the norwegian word for midwife

212
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:10,319
which is kind of nice you can probably make all kinds of connections from that interesting ideas

213
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:16,480
of that our earth mother is

214
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:24,880
also gives birth to all that we have here supports it and brings it forth

215
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:33,520
and uh so here we are on earth day and uh we have this wonderful earth

216
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:39,200
that has been supporting us for generations cared for

217
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:44,480
you know the earth has cared for human beings since the beginning of human beings

218
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:51,839
provided abundance of often in order to survive or to make it down through the generations

219
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:58,160
and here we are and uh and what's going to

220
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:04,400
what's going to save us the earth is struggling it's under assault

221
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:12,078
the people of the earth are under all kinds of intentions stresses and

222
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:19,680
that are pretty awful with climate change and things now what what's going to what's going to

223
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:26,640
make the difference what's going to keep us a lot us alive well from the story it's an act of

224
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:34,880
generosity to be generous and generosity can't be forced

225
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:40,160
can't be an obligation that has to really come from us

226
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:46,079
which to say that or to hear that some people will protest

227
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:52,800
say no no we have an obligation we have a responsibility to

228
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:59,760
work to save this planet save and mitigate the problems of climate change

229
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:06,000
not only for the sake of the environment but for also for so many people who are going to be harmed by all this

230
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:12,400
some of them are the poorest of the poor and of course we're obligated especially

231
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:19,040
here maybe some of us in the united states where the united states has five percent of the world population but produces thirty

232
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:24,960
percent of the pollution so you know so don't then you know that in a sense you

233
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:30,560
can say the privilege to you know should actually use more of the resources should be more

234
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:36,720
responsible so of course be the responsibility and we bring up our finger and we shake it

235
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:42,319
you know like you have to do something and you're responsible and obligated

236
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:48,240
but obligation and responsibility and chastising like

237
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,800
that is not generosity

238
00:46:53,520 --> 00:47:01,280
but of course we're responsible for going well if you like

239
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:07,359
obligation if you like the idea of responsibility if that's your thing

240
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:14,240
then from the buddha's point of view we have to turn it around and say well

241
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:22,240
we have an obligation then a responsibility to learn selfless generosity

242
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:28,000
so that from selfless generosity we can do we can support the world and

243
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,520
the people of the world so there comes with a joy a delight so

244
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:41,920
we're willing not just to so we can sit down with everyone and learn from them and be friends with them

245
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:49,200
not be divisive there's a kind of poison that comes along all too easily

246
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:55,119
if we act from obligation duty like you have to

247
00:47:55,119 --> 00:48:00,400
it doesn't lift us up it's kind of obligation is like a burden

248
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:08,000
and it it kind of i don't think there's much hope for us as a planet if everyone has to click you know gear

249
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,480
up their obligation and like okay we gotta you know but can we do things

250
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:19,760
with gender selfless generosity maybe tirelessly maybe do a lot maybe give

251
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:26,000
ourselves over to it but come from a motivation that

252
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,520
that is inspiring that's nourishing for ourselves and for others

253
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:39,040
then i think there's hope and possibility then it's contagious if we can figure out how to do this

254
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:46,559
and uh and i think that's one of the contributions buddhism can make to all this buddhism hasn't had a

255
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:52,160
particularly particularly history good or bad i would think

256
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:57,920
of caring for the environment people who are environmental and buddhist environmentalists will kind of

257
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:05,680
squeeze out of buddhist teachings teachings that support caring for the environment so you can find it there but

258
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:11,040
i don't think that you have to kind of like you know really search for it and you

259
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:17,680
get small little hints here and there and then they put them all together in one big package so it looks nice

260
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:23,119
but buddhism hasn't had a lot to say about this but buddhism has a lot to say about generosity

261
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:28,559
about care compassion those are important

262
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:35,440
and so when we see suffering around us then the idea is to generously care for

263
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:42,559
that generously inspiringly with love and kindness and friendliness engage in doing something

264
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:48,880
and how do we come to that place so that we don't have to fall back on obligation and

265
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:54,960
or defensiveness or war to care for ourselves

266
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:01,440
well this is that's the strength of buddhism is to bring forth those in an inspiring

267
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:07,040
way in a delightful way and so we learn how to look at

268
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:13,119
our attachments our clinging we like to look at the ways that we create divisiveness and hold on tight and

269
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:21,200
create a sense of self that that contributes to divisiveness contributes to selfless selfishness

270
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:27,119
and to learn an alternative to learn to settle deeply and open up and discover

271
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:32,720
layers and layers of inner freedom layers and layers of joy and happiness

272
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:38,960
that dissolve selfishness dissolves self-centeredness

273
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:44,720
helps us to feel more and more deeply connected to our others to the world

274
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:50,240
like when you know like when i from the first years i was practicing

275
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:55,839
i was in college and i took a botany class

276
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:02,319
and uh maybe literally because of my meditation practice by that time there was one day when the

277
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:08,160
professor was on the board and speaking at the amphitheater class and

278
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:13,280
i was talking about i think the photosynthesis for the synthesis and this you know the

279
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:18,720
cycle of you know all the cycles and oxygen and carbon dioxide and the

280
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:25,119
cycling of all this you had all these diagrams of how the cycles through nature you know the simple like cycle is

281
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:31,200
that we produce carbon dioxide and the plants

282
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:37,040
converted carbon dioxide to oxygen so we can breathe without the plants doing it

283
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:42,640
there would not be enough oxygen here for us to be alive so then i left the class i was kind of

284
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:49,680
absorbed in this whole discussion very still and i and so because i was so kind of absorbed

285
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:55,440
in it in the mind everything distractions and kind of fell away when i went out and stood in the

286
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:00,480
courtyard of at the college where there was huge old oak trees

287
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:07,040
around us i stood there and i kind of became under frozen's right word but completely i

288
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:12,800
couldn't move i just started looking at it and i felt wow

289
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:18,800
i could do without one of my kidneys without a arm and all kinds of parts of

290
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:24,640
my body i can manage fine without but i can't do without these plants

291
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:30,880
and so where do i begin and where the plants end you know where is the separation if i'm i'm so dependent on

292
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:36,000
them and i stood there this kind of world of separation dissolved and it

293
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:42,240
felt this beautiful inspired sense of the mutual support and connectedness and

294
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:47,520
how we don't we're not born from the the earth from nature

295
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:54,160
we are the earth we are nature we're no we're not revisiting this planet visiting life

296
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:59,280
we are the life of the planet we're inseparable from it

297
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:05,359
and so from that to be generous is your right hand generous when it

298
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:12,480
helps when it washes the left hand and the left hand is it being generous when it washes the right hand

299
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:19,040
you could say yes but it's it's selfless you know it comes together then you know

300
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:24,640
it you know it is it's because it's you know they're connected or we don't think of that way because it's just

301
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:31,599
caring for what's here can our the way that we relate to the world around us have that kind of

302
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:36,720
intimacy like it's almost as if it's part of us or there's no there's no sense of

303
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:44,400
it being an obligation to care or no sense of it is um required even

304
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:49,520
but it's just of course we do it of course that comes out of us

305
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:56,079
it doesn't even come out of us of course it comes out of the world and this is kind of the beauty and the

306
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:02,640
mystery and the wonderfulness of settling deeply into buddhist practice is discover this

307
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:09,200
beautiful source of motivation this beautiful source of energy and engagement

308
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:15,920
that is kind of selfless kind of we don't want to we can't claim it to be

309
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:24,079
mine me myself and mine but it's it's available and or connected or it

310
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:31,119
lives in a mutuality with this wider world and then

311
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:36,240
there can be generosity that's the selfless generosity that's the heart that's what makes the

312
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:41,280
heart sing and smile that's what nourishes and supports the

313
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:46,319
heart so what is that generosity

314
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:53,480
how can we learn it how can we enact it how can we

315
00:54:54,720 --> 00:55:00,240
uh give ourselves permission to do wonderful things to turn on the

316
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:07,040
light of that generosity that care that love that compassion turned on so that

317
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:12,240
it's those wonderful things for the world around us

318
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:17,200
and not because it's an obligation i don't know you know

319
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:21,640
i'm gonna miss my netflix

320
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:28,960
but rather why would i watch that why would i watch netflix when i can do these wonderful

321
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:35,040
things when there's something in flow of this flow of the natural world it's aliveness

322
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:41,680
and goodness can just flow and be here and and i feel more alive and everything is

323
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:47,280
kind of free in this generosity and in this doing in

324
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:53,520
the world so uh

325
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:59,119
so this mutuality and this intimacy with the world that's possible

326
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:04,799
i think for me is represented by the emphasis that buddhists will have on

327
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:11,280
finding the four elements within us these four elements are

328
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:18,079
said to be earth water fire and air

329
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:24,799
and what this means is that um there are certain characteristics sensations sense feelings that we can

330
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:32,240
have that are identified as being somehow this behaving in the same way within us

331
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:38,160
as we can find out in the natural world so the the finding the quality or

332
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:43,760
characteristics of earth within us is to find where there's support

333
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:49,119
what supports us the ground supports us

334
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:55,119
and uh and in us there's there's things that are solid and heavy and

335
00:56:55,119 --> 00:57:02,960
supportive that hold us up and allows us to sit upright for example and and uh receives the weight of our body

336
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:09,440
and provides support i kind of little bit delight in the this idea that if

337
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:17,040
how important it is that we have this earth to support us because without it

338
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:22,559
we would just be like floating around in space i see sometimes photographs of the

339
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:29,200
astronauts up in the space station and they're just kind of floating around up there

340
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:35,280
and i guess there's a small enough space they probably push themselves off the walls but imagine if the earth wasn't here we

341
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:41,520
couldn't get you know we would have to find our way back to the earth to push on something you know and we'd probably just kind of

342
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:46,799
like be helpless from the air but the earth has gravity that pulls us

343
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:52,720
down it keeps us and then and supports us just enough just the right amount so that we don't float away

344
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:58,480
but we don't get crushed by too much uh gravity so the earth so everything else is the

345
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:05,359
same thing and then there's uh the uh water the water element is said

346
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:12,400
to be the characteristic of water that we can feel they say is cohesion like water droplets put next to each other

347
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:18,160
they stick together they get more and more of them together that cohesion there's also

348
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:25,280
that phenomena where water goes up a little bit on the edges of a glass that's holding on and sticks

349
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:31,520
capillary action and plants that pulls up the water of the tree of these big redwoods we have here imagine that

350
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:38,319
redwoods because of the nature of water properties of cohesion and water it pulls water to the very top of our

351
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:44,880
redwood tree it's a big tall tree there so this cohesion and so so much of what

352
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:50,480
we are we're held together we're held together by the skin the muscles the tendons

353
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:55,520
all the stuff that holds us here together and if we didn't have the cohesion

354
00:58:55,520 --> 00:59:02,079
you know we all our particles would just kind of float away but we're held together

355
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:09,040
and these are natural phenomena that somehow has evolved over time not of the cosmic soup

356
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:14,559
and the fire element and they say that what you how the fire

357
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:22,000
element is is that everything that's animated within us and uh so you know it's

358
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:28,319
all the energy that keeps us alive every sensation we have is an expression of something energetic within us the firing

359
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:34,960
of the nerves firing nerves is a kind of a fire and uh and they had all the energy we

360
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:41,680
have that keeps us alive and going and some way or other has originated from the sun

361
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:48,079
and you know sunlight comes down and the plants turn it into photosynthesize and turn it

362
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:54,960
into you know carbohydrates and we eat them and and now or something else eats them and

363
00:59:54,960 --> 01:00:01,280
then eventually if we eat the food and and we transform it into

364
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:06,400
somehow or other into energy and and then you know

365
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:13,440
so in a sense we're a con there's a continuity of that energy from the sun that keeps us going and so we can feel

366
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:19,040
that continue the energy the aliveness the vitality it's part of the net it's not only the natural of this earth but

367
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:24,799
at the of our solar system i think it's so cool

368
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:30,960
and then the air element is is uh they say it's the quality of movement

369
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:37,359
and uh we're moving beings we're not plants rooted down we can we can get around we can walk

370
01:00:37,359 --> 01:00:43,760
around we can move our limbs we can move our chest our diaphragm to

371
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:49,839
to so we have this exchange of oxygen and and carbohydrate

372
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:55,760
carbon dioxide and so this idea of kind of feeling

373
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:04,000
within ourselves characteristics or qualities or aspects of what we can see outside

374
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,680
makes it so that suggests that there's not actually such a strong line between self and the world

375
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:14,880
around us we're all sharing so much of the same material

376
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:19,920
it said that each of us is made from recycled materials

377
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:25,200
how's that recology you know they're going to do a line of business

378
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:30,880
you know that they were all just all recycled i mean we're all the material that we built of has been

379
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:37,519
in many different places and times and oh you know down through the millennium

380
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:43,680
and uh it's possible that each of us is breathing in now at least one particle

381
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:49,440
of air that the buddha brave breathed because there's so many you know billions little

382
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:55,359
particles that of water and air that go into us to the way it's statistically the way it

383
01:01:55,359 --> 01:02:00,880
spreads out this is a good possibility we're breathing in something that would have breathed so

384
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:07,280
long ago so this kind of feeling of you know this interconnectedness and interdependency is phenomenal thing to

385
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:14,559
feel and to feel it in such a way that we want to be generous

386
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:20,559
and we want to learn before it's too late learn from the elders learn from the people who are

387
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:26,400
studying it learn how to use it to live in harmony with it

388
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:32,079
how to enjoy maybe the sacrifices that we need to

389
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:38,400
make sacrifice meaning making sacred

390
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:45,039
maybe the lifestyle that some of us are living is not sustainable for this planet

391
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:50,480
and is there an alternative lifestyle that we can enjoy that we that delight

392
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:56,480
us and this again i think for coming back to buddhism buddhist practice the

393
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:03,359
possibility of learning how to enjoy life without needing the latest and greatest

394
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:10,240
technology without needing a lot of consumer goods not needing a lot of

395
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:15,599
doing things that require air travel and even car travel just like just to feel

396
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:21,039
the delight and the joy one of my delights on sunday morning

397
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:26,799
uh is to walk down here so it's about a 30-minute walk from my house

398
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:32,400
i enjoy it so much but what a waste of time right i mean i

399
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:38,319
i mean i could have been 25 more minutes at home you know it takes only five minutes to drive here and

400
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:44,480
i'm sure i could have spent 20 good 25 more minutes checking out the news again

401
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:49,920
you know or reading we're looking for more websites and just kind of searching you know i mean that 25 minutes could

402
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:54,960
have been you know productive and useful and all kinds of things i could

403
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:02,160
have done with netflix but i actually enjoy the walk act like

404
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:07,599
some of my you know just a beautiful wonderful thing to walk down here and

405
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:13,680
and so the example is supposed to be the example of how can we this practice of

406
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:20,640
ours it's mindfulness attention being present how can we let that bring forth these

407
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:26,720
beautiful potential that we have this phenomenal potential we have so that

408
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:33,760
we are inspired we're delighted we're happy to live a radically different life a

409
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:38,960
radically selfless life where of course we want to

410
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:45,920
live differently different lifestyle it's not a sacrifice i would say that if i had decided to

411
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:52,960
drive down here saved you know so just five minutes to get here rather than 30

412
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:58,559
so that i could to do more web searching or whatever i do

413
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:04,960
that that would have been a loss that would have diminished me

414
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:11,680
is the walk that enhanced me so i don't know if that example works for all of you but there are maybe you

415
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:18,559
have your own examples i hope when i die i don't look back in

416
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:22,200
life and say yeah

417
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:30,000
you know i think i should count up how many websites i visited you know probably you know and then and

418
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:36,400
celebrate on my deathbed yeah i visited 232 000 websites over my lifetime

419
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,200
what a great life

420
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:47,440
or look back and say actually the feeling of joy delight well-being

421
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:54,240
grandness i had from what these walks i take that is a good

422
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:59,920
visceral memory that to die with wow that is good or the people that i

423
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:08,720
touched or i was touched by remember those these deeper connections and love and that's something to have

424
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:16,400
so earth day mother earth she's knocking at your door

425
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:22,880
she's been forgotten she's starving him

426
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:31,039
what do you do send her away saying continue the party

427
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:36,319
what do you offer what do you have to offer

428
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:43,039
and what do you save what life do you save by stopping long enough sitting down

429
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:51,119
with her long enough to offer your generosity and to learn and study from our

430
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:54,798
great parent the earth parent

431
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:05,440
so let us appreciate this wonderful earth that we have and all the inhabitants

432
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:11,200
and care for the earth and its inhabitants equally they are inseparable

433
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:17,760
may all beings be happy may all beings be safe

434
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:25,200
may all beings be peaceful may all beings be free

435
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:32,079
and may the earth thrive in this wonderful

436
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:38,880
way that the natural world lives in harmony and homeostasis let us support this harmony and homostasis whatever way

437
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:43,838
we can thank you
