1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:10,160
so hello hello and welcome to this edition of happy hour everyone

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:18,850
so for today's practice um i'd like to invite us to consider

3
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:27,920
[Music] this practice of granting others autonomy granting others their autonomy

4
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,550
in our hearts and our minds with a sense of well good will for them so

5
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:40,640
[Music] it's a practice of i think one way to think

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,559
of this practice is the practice of but maybe tonight i'd like to invite us

7
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,559
to lean into it as you know you care for someone a friend a relative

8
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,399
um maybe a child in this i've heard comes

9
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:05,439
up a lot for adult children especially when they're all grown up and yet um you care for them so much they can

10
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:12,080
also come up with parents when we grow up and we want to care for our parents there's such a sense of

11
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,439
care and love and menta and oh

12
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,040
we just wish it would be different right for them we just wish

13
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:30,240
um gosh that would make different decisions or or if it wasn't so hard at this point we

14
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,159
somehow want to make it all better make it go away make the pain go away make

15
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:42,799
the difficulty go and we really want that we care for for this friend for this child for this

16
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,640
parent for this for this other being but this other being could could

17
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,040
also be a pet could be a four-legged friend or an animal so we want so

18
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:02,960
much um to make it all go away and yet and yet and yet we know that

19
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,599
by really wanting to make it all better it doesn't work for them it doesn't work

20
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:16,239
for us we can step on their toes they might feel belittled

21
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,800
as if they don't have a sense of autonomy and so how to manage how to manage holding

22
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:30,400
with a sense of care and love not with aloofness not with oh okay i'll just turn away and not

23
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,239
look at all the the sense of care and yet respecting respecting

24
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,840
their autonomy that every being all beings have their own journeys

25
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:49,200
and their lives equal unfold their lives our lives all of our lives

26
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,280
unfold according to causes and conditions that have been set in

27
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:03,040
motion when long before we arrived with our genes with our experiences and

28
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,159
of course the decisions that we make are part of those causes and conditions but

29
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,959
not the entire picture so so this is an invitation to nitrix to

30
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:21,680
practice engage with this practice in the way of continuing to love and care

31
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:28,959
for this being and also honor appreciate their path that need

32
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,080
they need to go through as it needs to unfold for them to

33
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,840
perhaps learn the lessons they need to learn um through the challenge through the

34
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,879
difficulty through the dukkha through the suffering that might be presenting itself

35
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,640
at this moment and continue to care continue to care

36
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,920
so so with that as the frame

37
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,519
like to invite us to engage in this practice so let us

38
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:11,200

45
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,680
now

46
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,638
letting the breath be received

47
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,440
in the abdomen sensations of the breath

48
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:29,000
lowering the center of the gravity from the head to the abdomen

49
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,039

receiving the breath received in the abdomen

59
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,560
just connecting connecting as if it's a cleansing

noticing the sense of well-being with each and every breath

64
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,800
as much well-being as there may be maybe a tiny bit

65
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:43,959
or might be if founded received

66

70
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:25,440
their lives and part of you wish you could make it all go away

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,600
bringing that being into your mind into your heart space

72
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,519

74
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,760

has brought into your life for this being could be a pet

76
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,360

78
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,320

79
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:31,839

this care this meta for them

86
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:05,720
it's feeling coming forth from a sense of appreciation for them

87
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:02,720
and now allow this sense of care this meta to meet the challenge they're going

88
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,240

and now

100
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:44,559
allowing practice of compassion karuna

101
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:52,280
to transition to practice of equanimity upeka

102
00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:00,480
bringing to heart letting the heart still be warm with care

103

appreciating that this being

105
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:22,880
the unfolding the unfolding of their life right now

106
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,600
is happening according

107
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,480
to causes and conditions

108
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:42,000
which you may or may not understand which actually you may not we do not

109
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,559
understand all the causes and conditions the buddha said

110
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:57,559
that's one of the imponderables if you try to understand all the causes and conditions your head will explode

111
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:12,720
so keeping this person this being in mind with care i care for you

112

take away all the suffering

114

may i accept and see that all beings have their own journey

115
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:59,080

123
00:26:53,200 --> 00:27:00,840

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,240
to have your own journey

128
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,799
and i continue to hold you with care

129
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:51,360
may i accept that things are as they are for you right now

130
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:58,200

131
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:13,840
any of these phrases or nuances that work for you you're welcome to use

132
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:07,080
i care for you but i cannot make your choices for you

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:50,960
i care for you and i offer you autonomy on your journey

134
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:58,520
on this human journey that we're both on

135
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:11,360
i care for you and in my heart i offer you autonomy

136
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,840
for the journey you're on

137
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,440
i care for you and i respect

138
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:18,039
that all beings have their own journey

139
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,880
for the last moments of this practice period

140
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:04,000
feeling failing into our care our meta for this being

141
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:13,200
a sense of spaciousness it's not a contracted care it's a spacious care

142
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:19,280
they're happy where they're sad we care

143
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,160
this care is so spacious it's enough space

144
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:33,040
to hold the conditions of their life present unmoving

145
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:40,839
stable equanimous radiating care

146
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:52,920
a sense of spaciousness in our heart stability in our heart body and mind

147
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:07,560
so we can be more available to support the care without being contracted

148
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,400
for this being we care about

149
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,319
may all beings everywhere

150
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,240
taste goodness and freedom ease

151
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,279
feel cared for

152
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,200
including ourselves

153
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:18,280
thank you all thank you for your practice

154
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:25,040
ah so [Music]

155
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:31,079
so what we did was we started

156
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:37,839
started with appreciation well actually we started first by

157
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:44,640
arriving landing with the breath with the body i invited to feel to the breath the

158
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,920
sense of nourishing cleansing refreshing to really connect with the in-breath and

159
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:56,960
out-breath i wonder how that worked for you if anybody wants to comment on that and then we

160
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:04,000
brought in someone we care about might be going through a hard time and with that being we start it with

161
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,160
appreciation with gratitude as a way to prime the heart prime the heart

162
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:17,119
with goodness and then with that appreciation then we

163
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:24,320
opened up to mehta to care the good will for this being

164
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:30,079
and from there the meta touching into the challenge

165
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:35,599
they're going through right now meta plus suffering equals compassion

166
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:40,800
practice turned into compassion practice karuna practice

167
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:46,240
feeling feeling holding the suffering the pain with

168
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:52,560
with well-being with a sense of good will and from that we turned into our final

169
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:58,960
destination and hung out there for a while which was practice of equanimity

170
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,800
offering autonomy continue to care to love to be present

171
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,640
for the being and offer them autonomy so

172
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:17,119
so many so many different a unique path we took

173
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:23,200
this evening and different from the path we've ever taken

174
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:30,079
through this practice before and knew always a new path right isn't it fun always a new practice

175
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:35,119
never a dull moment of happy hour so we'd like to invite you if something

176
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:43,280

177
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:49,680

180
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,680

181
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:13,920
if you don't even want me to read your reflection you can say private as you type it to me alone

182
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:20,720
claire please thank you so much i had to get my hand

183
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:27,040
up this is very personal and i don't know if it will interest anybody but me but you uh

184
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:32,720
gave me an answer to something that i've been worrying about all day i

185
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:38,560
in the early in the morning i ran into someone as a dear friend who has cancer

186
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:45,440
and i listened to her and talked to her and then i left and as i left and right

187
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:51,760
after i left i thought you know i really should invite her to meditate because i believe it will

188
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:59,119
help her but i got busy with other things anyway it came back to mine later in the day but i

189
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:06,160
have learned and it's related to this in the last year that i have tended to be

190
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:13,280
not overbearing but too involved with people's problems and they don't like it actually it pushes

191
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:19,359
them away and so i thought to myself no you know you're just repeating that old pattern

192
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:24,560
so maybe you better not and you know you just reinforced what i had sort of gotten to

193
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:29,760
that this was would not be helpful to her even though it would be helpful to me

194
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:36,960
but not to her and it was just beautiful i mean it was absolutely perfect so

195
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:43,040
thank you beautiful thank you claire thank you so much for this it's beautiful and and i love how you said

196
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:49,040
yeah it's helpful to me because then it feels like it reduces and that's the case for us right right because it

197
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:55,520
reduces our anxiety when they are when they feel less bad like oh yeah you meditate oh you feel better i feel

198
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:01,599
better but can we be okay with our stress arduca our concern for them and

199
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:06,960
and and offer them autonomy exactly oh beautiful

200
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:12,160
thank you claire and i saw hearts in the chat yeah appreciating what you shared

201
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:19,280

203
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:32,079
lydia says i often find nikki's guidance so timely oh that's that's sweet isn't

204
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:37,280
that uh it's pretty wild right things i

205
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:44,960
i have to say i've often found in a various times when i've listened to dharma talks myself and various um

206
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:51,359
offerings just things can be timely so i appreciate that but it does feel timely

207
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:56,960
both for claire and lydia thank you thank you for those gifts

208
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:03,599

abraham hi thanks um

211
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,319
for many years uh my brother has been the source of much dukkha for me

212
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:31,359
and uh and i've done a lot of loving kindness for him and it's been really wonderful

213
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:36,880
and uh it's just i went to see him today so

214
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:44,319
um for various reasons causes and conditions he is very separated from the

215
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:51,280
rest of the family i'm the only one who goes to see him and it's hard and the previous time that i went to see him i

216
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:57,440
was just really going like wow i don't know how much longer i can do this um

217
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:06,160
what do you get out of meditation why do you go on retreat you don't do anything that kind of a misanthrope a real grump

218
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:11,599
and uh so just to do equanimity you know um i

219
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:17,040
see your suffering he's really suffering and just connect with my compassion for

220
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:22,160
him and just leave it be at that was very timely today so

221
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:30,480

226
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:00,400

227
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:07,119
and and well-being we're going to turn into practice into small groups oh one more reflection

229
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:18,079
the phrase i cannot make your choices for you this is really helpful when i am doing my

230
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:25,680
best to care for others great beautiful yeah and so many uh phrases and and see which

231
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:31,680
one really works for you for for this particular person or being

232
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:38,720
could be unique and and that's the one that really connects so thank you elaine for showing the one um sharing the one

247
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:23,040
mary please so for me um the person who came to mind

248
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:29,040
was my long-term partner and how much i

249
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:34,559
really believe that i can keep him healthy and happy and he will not die

250
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:41,920
before i do and that is just you know i'm obsessed with it and i always have been and we have great

251
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:52,000
humor about it but i encountered how it equanimity about his dying is worse

252
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:58,640
it is harder for me than equanimity about my own dying it's like no i want to go before you

253
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:05,119
and and to have compassion for myself in that

254
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:07,920
stuck place

255
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:18,480

equanimity especially at the end of the day of work yes ah what a great

274
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:21,839
point common to end on after a day of work sitting in equanimity there's a sense of

275
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:27,440
ease right we're flow but i feel too having practice with you because of
