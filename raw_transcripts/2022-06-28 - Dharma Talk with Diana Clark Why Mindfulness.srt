1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,919
so again my really warm welcome even if the ac is on and it's kind of

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,080
chilly i have a warm welcome so

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,480
so tonight i thought i would talk a little bit about mindfulness

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:28,160
and recognizing that this is foundational and maybe even it seems kind of uh

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,360
i don't know like kindergarten teachings or something like this but

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,399
this is something i appreciate so much about the dharma and the teachings is

7
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,360
that we get to hear things again and again and then often we discover something new

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,120
and it's not like there are these secret teachings that are wildly

9
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,960
different you know as we progress on the path to be sure

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,199
there are things that start to unfold and become known as we continue on this path that

11
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:09,520
aren't obvious or available at the beginning but how we practice with them and be

12
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:16,479
with them this really builds on this foundation of mindfulness

13
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:22,000
which of course makes sense so much about what the practice is about

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,600
is being present for what's happening noticing what's happening

15
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,920
and in some fundamental way that's just what mindfulness is

16
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,560
so i'd like to talk about this a little bit also because

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,920
mindfulness is one of the seven factors of awakening

18
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,880
it's the first vector it's kind of like the foundation that supports all these other factors

19
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,679
and the buddha pointed to these factors as really being supportive

20
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:10,640
if not required in some in some form for awakening for enlightenment

21
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,800
so sometimes as i said we tend to think well you know maybe mindfulness you know that's just some

22
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,599
nice to have something to make our life better and to be sure it is that

23
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:30,560
but it's also pointed to you as an integral part of this path towards greater freedom

24
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,640
towards greater ease greater peace

25
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,879
i'll be talking a little bit more about the seven factors of awakening and some subsequent talks but right now i'm just

26
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:48,800
going to introduce the idea of it and just start with the first one the

27
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,599
foundation mindfulness

28
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:02,480
it really is quite something to think about you know like what is mindfulness and we

29
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,159
might say that it's a unique capacity of humans as far as i know

30
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:16,400
to you a unique capacity that humans have to direct our attention

31
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,519
intentionally of course other beings other creatures

32
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,040
you know have attention but uh as far as i know humans are the

33
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,879
ones that we can choose okay i'm gonna pay attention to this particular thing

34
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,760
and not pay attention to that particular thing

35
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:45,360
so this is something that we can really use to support our lives

36
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:52,640
to support the way we show up in the world the way we show up for ourselves

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,040
and so for me and in the context of this talk i will use kind of like the words

38
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,799
attention and mindfulness and awareness as synonyms

39
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,840
sometimes teachers tease them apart and have some

40
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,879
other ways they want to separate the different ways that the

41
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:21,280
mind is aware consciousness something like this

42
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:28,080
some teachers do some teachers don't i've given talks a little bit to where i tease them apart but for here i'm not

43
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,600
going to really tease them apart i'm going to say it's just like noticing

44
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,440
paying attention being aware of being conscious of being mindful

45
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:45,040
kind of put those all together and this idea of you know paying

46
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,160
attention to something and for anybody who has ever tried

47
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:57,199
mindfulness practice you know that one of the very first insights you have is like oh wow

48
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,560
i had no idea that my mind was going everywhere

49
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,000
except where i wanted it to go i had no idea that this actually was

50
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,680
going to be not be so easy even though it might seem simple straightforward to

51
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:20,160
place our attention on an anchor for example often we choose

52
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,560
the breath it can be the body sounds emotions

53
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,120
thoughts those are often the typical things that we place our attention on that we're

54
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,639
mindful of but we have this uh insight like oh

55
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:46,240
i had no idea my mind was like this until we started practice i think this is true for everybody

56
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:52,960
just the way that humans or certainly humans

57
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:59,360
in the modern west i don't know about other cultures other societies but right we

58
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,800
have a certain busyness or a certain

59
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:11,759
maybe i'll even use the word certain little bit of agitation keeps our minds busy

60
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:19,919
so with mindfulness we just bring our attention back to the anchor the breath for example

61
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:26,080
again and again and again

62
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:33,039
and it absolutely does not matter how many times you have to do that

63
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:40,319
hundred one thousand one hundred thousand times it's just this practice of bringing it

64
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:46,478
bringing attention back to the anchor again

65
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:53,680
and we do this in a way that's okay this is what practice is so as best we can we do it

66
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,599
without a judgment without this idea like i wish it were different dang it why am i doing that

67
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:06,240
i'm never gonna get it everybody else is so quiet and i'm not or you know these thoughts that sometimes can arise in our

68
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,880
minds that's extra it does can be a habit to do this too

69
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:19,520
for the inner critic to arise or to be comparing ourselves to others

70
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:27,919
that's just part of what it means to be human also and so as best we can

71
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:35,840
we just bring our attention back in a simple gentle way

72
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,599
letting the judgment the inner critic and all those things letting them just soften and go

73
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:50,319
to the side we don't have to get rid of them just let it be there on the side

74
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:59,120
so in this way mindfulness is really about being present for our life

75
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:06,800
i talked about the breath being the anchor but we can just in our daily life

76
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:13,360
have this intention of being present for what's actually happening

77
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:20,720
it might be that we have this insight early like wow i don't know i had no idea my mind was like this

78
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,319
and then we might also have an insight regarding our daily life this recognition

79
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,840
oh in some kind of way i was sleepwalking or

80
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:39,800
disconnected or not really engaged with my life

81
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,880
mindfulness the practice of mindfulness in our daily life and whatever it is that we're doing

82
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,839
provides the opportunity the encouragement the

83
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:58,160
the setting or the intention to actually be with

84
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,480
our life engaged with our life not so much that our ideas or our conceptions

85
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:11,760
or but the actual experience and bringing this sense of aliveness

86
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:18,640
to the moment whatever it is that's happening whether it's pleasant or unpleasant what we wanted what we didn't want

87
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:26,560
but just to have this aliveness like yes this is my life

88
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:37,560
this can be beautiful just the being present for what it is even if it is unpleasant

89
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,720
and not only so it might be beautiful it might not be beautiful to you

90
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,080
but one thing i want to highlight here is that i'm talking about bringing

91
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:56,640
attention to things that help to bring some aliveness notice how i'm not saying that

92
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,800
mindfulness is getting rid of thoughts it's easy to fall into this trap of

93
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:09,600
thinking like okay as long as there's thoughts i'm not meditating i'm not mindful and this whole meditation thing

94
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,680
doesn't work or i can't do it or whatever it might be

95
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:22,240
because we might have this idea like either conscious or unconscious and to be sure dharma teachers sometimes talk

96
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,560
about you know in between the thoughts or the space around the thoughts or i don't

97
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:35,040
know no thoughts sometimes they talk about this and that is available

98
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,160
but usually that's only on retreat for some time

99
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,480
this isn't like so accessible certainly if we just have a like a daily

100
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:54,320
meditation practice as opposed to being on retreats for a long long periods of time

101
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,640
instead mindfulness is just knowing what's happening in the mind

102
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,920
when we're lost in thought we are lost in thought okay

103
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,440
it's not a problem because we're lost in thought so there's no problem with whatever's happening

104
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:18,399
but then there's a waking up that happens like oh i was just lost in thought

105
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:24,079
at that moment you're mindful there's nothing else you could have done

106
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:32,959
while you were lost in thought but when that ends and you're mindful again you just know oh now i'm mindful

107
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,600
and i just wasn't a moment before

108
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,519
as an aside i'll say well what makes it more likely that these moments of waking

109
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,640
up so to speak happens while you're lost in thought is

110
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:55,040
a moment of mindfulness preceding it so it's just the more mindfulness we do

111
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,800
the easier it gets the shorter the duration we're lost in thought

112
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,639
probably all of us have this experience whether it's a daily practice or being

113
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,839
on retreat or day longs or something like this

114
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:19,839
maybe we'll say then that rather than this idea that we have to get rid of thoughts or something

115
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:26,639
like that it's just you might think about it as keeping something in mind

116
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,800
if we're on the cushion we're keeping our anchor the breath

117
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,440
the body whatever it might be in mind in daily life it's

118
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:46,800
just uh returning to whatever's compelling whatever is easy to be mindful of

119
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:54,399
whatever is drawing our attention we don't necessarily have to put it on anything specific

120
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,839
but why would we do this this is a legitimate question like well

121
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:08,160
okay sounds nice maybe but what are the advantages or the

122
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,760
benefits like why would we do this and maybe you'll recognize some of these

123
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:21,040
for in your own life i know for me this uh first one had a

124
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,639
big uh impact on me this that we can understand

125
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,079
things when we are aware of them

126
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,279
i mean it says seems so obvious to say but we start to understand ourselves we

127
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:42,560
start to understand our lives which isn't always

128
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:50,160
pleasant right we don't necessarily see only you know rainbows and hearts and that kind of stuff but

129
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,839
i remember at the beginning of my meditation practice this whole idea of like okay i guess i'll try this

130
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,120
mindfulness when i'm not formally meditating let's see

131
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:07,360
and of course you know i so rarely remember to be mindful when i wasn't uh

132
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,279
sitting on the cushion but i don't know why there's this some uh

133
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:19,440
reason why this one incident really stood out to me i was standing in line and now i don't

134
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,800
remember where it was if it was the grocery store or something like this

135
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:32,079
and i noticed oh look at that posture i'm standing i had my hip out had my hand on my hip you

136
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:37,880
know i was like like really uh impatient and i had this little bit

137
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:43,440
self-righteousness going on and but i didn't even notice it until i noticed my

138
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,639
posture the way i had my hand on my hip my hip jutted out like

139
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,880
you better get going or something like this and that was so astounding to me like if

140
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:03,519
i hadn't noticed what was happening in my body i wouldn't have really noticed that i had this attitude or this stance

141
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,880
this is happens so much right that our body can inform us and just being aware

142
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:18,079
of what's happening in our body can help us be aware of sometimes what's more subtle

143
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:24,720
for me something that still is happens today is that when i have a little bit of a feeling like oh i'm not sure and i

144
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:31,279
gotta do it i wring my hands is it's sometimes my ringing my hands

145
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:37,600
i'm like oh okay i guess i'm a little bit nervous i don't know what's the next thing to do

146
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,519
is here so these are just some broad examples

147
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:49,120
but i'm sure probably all of you have some examples as well

148
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,279
of how just bringing mindful of things of your posture for example helps you to

149
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,959
understand yourself better

150
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,240
emotions maybe feeling just generally out of sorts

151
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:14,639
if we have this idea of keeping it in mind like well okay i'm feeling out of sorts

152
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:21,279
and if we just stay with okay out of sorts we might notice that maybe there's

153
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:28,880
a heaviness sometimes like the shoulders are drooping or the posture whatever we're

154
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:36,399
doing but there isn't uh there isn't an alertness or uprightness and

155
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:42,000
okay bring with that we might notice that uh there's a little collapsing around the

156
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
chest or on the heart or something and then we might be like oh actually i'm a

157
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,199
little sad yeah there's these sad thoughts

158
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:58,800
i hadn't really noticed it before i am sad

159
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,520
so one of the reasons why we have this mindfulness or keeping things in mind is

160
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:12,640
just to help us learn about ourselves learn about what's happening

161
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,400
so we can just better understand not so that we can beat ourselves up not

162
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:26,319
so that we can insist that we be different just so that we can understand ourselves

163
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:35,280
also being present for our experiences actually grounding right to be kind of with the

164
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:41,200
simplicity of the experience the actuality the reality of what's

165
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:48,960
happening helps us to feel a bit more rooted and grounded a little bit less like being

166
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:55,120
pushed around and like we can't find our way or something like this but

167
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,640
instead to feel connected to feel connected to our bodies

168
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,080
connected to the experience maybe it helps us mindfulness helps us

169
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:12,880
with our social connections people that we love that we care about people that we work with

170
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:19,360
being present also helps us feel connected to our environment nature

171
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,039
so it helps us to feel grounded and this groundedness could help provide

172
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:31,279
some stability in our life which can be a tremendous support

173
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,039
so being mindful also related to grounding and keeping things

174
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:45,600
in mind is also calming we have all noticed this and this might

175
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:52,640
even be part of the reason why some people start a meditation practice is this recognition that it does have

176
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,640
this calming of the mind and the body often right when we're formally

177
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,320
meditating we're not moving around that much

178
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,360
but there's this way that we often don't even notice how

179
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:20,640
busy literally and figuratively like how entangled or caught up with or

180
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,640
thoughts or this never-ending to-do list or whatever it might be

181
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:33,520
you might just be caught up in it and feeling like there's a certain type of

182
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,880
this kind of feeling of a rat race or something but

183
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:45,200
if we can be mindful of that experience like and just again and again

184
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,320
maybe if we're feeling uh really agitated we can choose an anchor

185
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,440
the breath the body just again and again bringing the mind

186
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:02,000
there it just allows some of the busyness the agitation to soften

187
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,159
not because we're forcing it it just kind of runs out of steam

188
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,360
as we're again and again bringing the mind to the present moment

189
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,080
to whatever's happening

190
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,320
so this is one of the things that's worth developing in our life

191
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,400
it's something that can be developed and is worthwhile developing is

192
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,720
this capacity to just return again and again and again in a way that's calming

193
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,159
settling in a way that

194
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,760
helps us to disentangle from those things that maybe

195
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,679
aren't supporting us don't disentangle from those things that

196
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,080
maybe aren't in our best interest

197
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:07,360
another reason to practice mindfulness or something like this is

198
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,400
every time that we bring the attention back to whatever it is we're

199
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:20,320
paying attention to as best we can in a simple gentle way

200
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:26,240
we're not feeding that habit of just jumping on judgmentalism and running

201
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:34,639
with it i'm not going to say that the judgmentalism is going to just stop immediately

202
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,840
but if we're not feeding it then we start to see oh there's another

203
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,360
way to be with my experience to just

204
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,559
accept that this is what's the reality of the moment

205
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:56,080
i'm not saying that we have to accept everything and never do anything and be

206
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:04,080
completely passive i'm talking about there's stuff that we to kind of allow the reality of

207
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:10,720
the moment to show itself for us to align with that reality

208
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:17,039
so often we're kind of maybe it's a little bit like the sleepwalking kind of

209
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:22,159
not really connected to what's really happening

210
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:29,840
there's a way that we are but there's sometimes we're a little bit disconnected too

211
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,760
so this mindfulness with this non-judgmentalism

212
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:43,279
gets supported gets developed this idea of like oh okay this is what's happening

213
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:50,640
that's it we don't have to add extra busyness around it or something like

214
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:57,440
this so some of these things are just to help

215
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:04,240
us have an easier more fulfilling happier life

216
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:10,320
but of course you know mindfulness is part of the buddhist tradition too

217
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,640
and in this tradition the the most common way that the buddha

218
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:23,840
talked about mindfulness was in the context of the freedom from suffering

219
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:32,240
the context of wanting to find more ease more peace more well-being

220
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,919
this was in the context of the eightfold path or the satipatanasuta the four

221
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,960
foundations of mindfulness for those of you who are familiar with that

222
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:51,600
there's a relationship between them of course but mine maybe i'll just say this that the

223
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,840
eightfold path is really uh is a road map towards awakening

224
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,679
the four foundations of mindfulness are also a road road map to awakening

225
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:09,840
but to point out that mindfulness is just one part of this

226
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:16,400
of the buddhist practice has many different elements including all aspects of our lives

227
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,679
but mindfulness really supports all elements whatever it is

228
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:27,440
that we're doing so this

229
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:33,840
freedom from suffering is finding greater ease

230
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:42,880
but mindfulness also addresses this maybe this uh drive or this hunger for

231
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,840
truth and for understanding

232
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:56,158
that um we might have this real wish to know what's real

233
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,919
yeah for me i'll say that uh this kind of wanting to investigate or to understand

234
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:10,640
or to really like be with what's really happening it's been really important i didn't even

235
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:17,840
realize how important it was to me in my life in general i was just forever like pursuing knowledge or something like

236
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:24,880
this but i think it's more about just wanting to connect with

237
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:31,200
some some reality some truth as best as i could

238
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,720
i think this is uh not unique to me this is like all the philosophers talk about this you know

239
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:43,200
through the millennia this idea of truth and so we can talk about like personal

240
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:50,880
truths and i talked about kind of like understanding ourselves understanding our psychology understanding how

241
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,799
conditions in our lives get played out later in our life of course they do how

242
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:02,080
could they not but also about some of these universal

243
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,919
truths about how things are

244
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,279
they don't last forever things are in flux they're changing

245
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:17,840
they are impermanent

246
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,760
inconstant but there's nothing as a lasting source

247
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,960
of happiness we haven't found that yet doesn't exist something that's going to

248
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:38,080
make you happy once and for all forever and this recognition that there actually

249
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:45,600
isn't a separate enduring constant self that's at the center of the universe

250
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,120
often feels like that seems like that but when we go to look for it we can't

251
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:58,159
find it so mindfulness helps us with this

252
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:03,760
addressing maybe this uh this drive this hunger for the truths

253
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,799
about ourselves about our experiences about the world

254
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:18,240
and as we practice continue to practice and maybe this is true for some of you

255
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,279
maybe the motivations the benefits or the reasons why you practice you know

256
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:29,279
starts shifts the more we practice maybe in the beginning it was just to

257
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:36,080
alleviate some difficulties or find some ease or something like this

258
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:45,039
but as we start to practice more and more we discover that maybe it's not only freedom from

259
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:51,278
suffering just for ourselves but for others

260
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:57,520
for all beings this recognition that we don't want

261
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:04,720
anybody to suffer we want everybody to have some

262
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:11,039
well-being so maybe it starts with just trying to

263
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:18,559
solve one problem but then there's this uh this opening that happens is unfolding

264
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:24,559
this expansion of our care of our concern

265
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:32,720
and maybe there's also a recognition of some love that we feel

266
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:39,200
like we've glimpsed or that we've had a little like a taste of where there's this maybe a

267
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:45,520
recognition that our hearts are capable of this greater bigger

268
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,240
love i'll use this word love

269
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,080
maybe mindfulness is a support for that or maybe that's the motivation for

270
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:04,240
continuing practice continuing our mindfulness practice our meditation practice

271
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:11,279
and we could say that one of the actually signs of somebody who've had some deep

272
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:18,320
practice is kindness is care is love

273
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,600
sometimes we don't think about that when we think about mindfulness instead we might think about there needs to be some

274
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:29,679
precision about exactly what we're being mindful of and something like this but

275
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:37,200
there's also this tremendous softening and opening

276
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:44,320
i spoke earlier about how part of mindfulness is this allowing this acceptance this non-judgmentalism about

277
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,760
our our experience of course we do this often enough with

278
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:55,840
meditation practice the mind the heart just adopt this habit

279
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:02,399
of being non-judgmental of being with the present moment in a way that has this

280
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:08,559
openness to it and that openness is a type of warmth a

281
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:14,919
type of caring a type of open-heartedness

282
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:25,600
and so as we become less entangled there's a little more space

283
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:32,559
as we become less getting not all knotted up with whatever is happening

284
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:38,480
a little bit more space around or during our our experiences

285
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,159
and in that space is some well-being and some happiness

286
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:50,000
it's often what is found there and this well-being and happiness kind

287
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,240
of like nourishes and supports us so then we don't have to

288
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,000
defend ourselves or try to get more instead

289
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,279
there's this warm-heartedness this love that's there when we kind of they're putting down

290
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:13,200
this trying to get happy or trying to defend ourselves or trying to prove ourselves

291
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:19,279
or something like that we don't have to do that because now there's this happiness and we got this happiness because there's more space but

292
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:26,279
we got this more space because we were just being present for what was happening as best we could in a

293
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:31,080
non-judgmental simple way

294
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:38,320
so mindfulness also has this quality of warm-heartedness this

295
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:44,320
and as we practice it has this i'm using this word love

296
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:52,880
maybe that's not the word that resonates with everybody maybe there's some other word that feels more comfortable

297
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:01,840
but this openness this warmth

298
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:08,080
as well as this just general receptivity

299
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:14,240
to what's happening allowing ourselves to be touched by the beauty

300
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:20,480
sometimes the difficulties too but by the

301
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:27,679
aw and appreciation kind of like arise just noticing the simple things of our

302
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,720
lives and yes i'm not going to say it's all

303
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,000
pollyanna beautiful but there is a way in which we also have the

304
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,679
capacity to hold it hold the difficulty so they're still

305
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:49,039
painful maybe but the problem-ness kind of like drains out

306
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:54,480
of the pain it's not as much as something that has to be fixed right now and

307
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,799
with a sense of urgency and the world's going to end if this pain doesn't go away

308
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:07,120
i wish i could say would take away all the pain but it doesn't but it just allows us to be with it

309
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:14,080
in a way that's insisting that it be otherwise

310
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,159
so this movement of mindfulness practice

311
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:29,440
turning to some appreciation simplicity some warm-heartedness

312
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:36,399
some of these things that maybe weren't our initial intentions of why we started mindfulness practice

313
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:44,720
but just this natural unfolding of practice leads this direction and then these qualities themselves

314
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:50,799
support the lessening of suffering

315
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,960
that increase of freedom

316
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,000
so as we move towards this completely

317
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,600
non-violent way of being

318
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:17,520
start to see how so many things open up for us

319
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:25,118
i create the conditions for even more opening for more letting go

320
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:32,398
letting go and shedding everything that's extra and unnecessary and it's getting in our way so that

321
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:40,240
we can do the biggest letting go that leads to complete awakening

322
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:50,638
so mindfulness even though it's this we might think of it as this ordinary

323
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:59,119
simple foundational practice it really is so powerful amazingly powerful

324
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:06,800
so with that i'm wishing all of you the mindfulness that supports your path

325
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:13,880
towards greater and greater freedom and peace thank you

326
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,960
so i'll stay up here for questions if any of you like

327
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:31,559
otherwise we'll just end a little bit early tonight so thank you

328
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:47,839
you know what nancy that's a good question are we going to do it with the microphone or uh

329
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:52,240
we can if yeah if anybody has questions

330
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:02,400
and when we yes the bell they always let the first ring completely die out before

331
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:08,640
they did the second which completely they have before they did the third but here in all the groups they do them very

332
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:14,078
close together is that a difference in a tradition or is it just

333
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:20,320
[Laughter] yeah so for the purpose of uh uh

334
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:26,800
for everybody to say come here like you come from a place where they ring and then they let the first bell all the

335
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,920
way die out um whereas here we don't we just do one two

336
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:39,359
three um i've actually never heard that where one goes and then it always uh dies out

337
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:45,599
and then go to the second i'll just say that i've been in meditation centers where they do one at the beginning two at the

338
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:51,920
end three the beginning two at the end three so as far as i know there's no magical

339
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:58,960
reason why we do one or the other i know that often we do three for like buddha dharma

340
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,000
sangha or something like that but i don't know of any particular thing

341
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,079
about this but i can imagine that's helpful to do one and then allow it to die out so that your mindfulness

342
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:16,160
you can just it's another mindfulness object you can just be with that while it gets fainter and fainter yeah thank

343
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:24,880
you yes i found and nancy don't know if this is

344
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:31,599
guessing it's normal um then so your practice deepens

345
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:38,240
do you find that you actually feel more strongly

346
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:45,040
is it just a matter of paying closer attention or

347
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:50,560
is it it just feels stronger

348
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:57,040
yeah so the question was as our practice deepens is it that duke i feel stronger

349
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:03,200
is this is this and you were asking might be like is this normal or something like this

350
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:09,760
yes this absolutely like arises absolutely like sometimes this um

351
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,920
we just weren't aware so much of some of the difficulties and not only that

352
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,839
we also um don't maybe have as available to us the ways that we used to try to

353
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:28,560
soothe ourselves or numb ourselves or however way we would work with that

354
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,160
yeah so in the beginning there can be a certainly a lot of just noticing more

355
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:40,960
and more dukkha but hopefully also there's a little bit more confidence in

356
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:48,079
like okay i i can't be with this it's not fun i wish it weren't here but

357
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:54,000
i know that i've had some difficulties before that i've been able to do this and with this meeting difficulty after

358
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:01,760
difficulty then our confidence grows and our capacity grows and slowly there is a way

359
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,520
in which that um more like that our

360
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:14,079
way that are moving through the world starts to shift as we start to feel like oh i don't have to avoid everything that

361
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:19,119
might potentially be difficult so our lives start to have some more

362
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:24,640
ease in that way that we don't have to navigate and negotiate our lives and

363
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,839
that particular any you know to try to make sure that we avoid things just because we start to

364
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:35,040
have more confidence that we can handle them

365
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:42,800
what i will say is that um it doesn't mean that we don't get angry or we don't get sad or you know whatever

366
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:49,599
it might be but it's often and probably you might have noticed this too nancy it's not that the anger or the sadness has gone

367
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:57,200
away completely but maybe the duration is shorter or maybe the intensity is less

368
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,640
and this is exactly how it happens it's just the duration of the sadness works i'm just making this up you didn't say

369
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:09,440
it but the duration um just for still feel sad for events but

370
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:17,200
maybe it's you know less amount of time and then less amount of time and then it just happens and then we just

371
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,839
maybe this sadness arises and like oh yeah there's sadness yep okay

372
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:28,319
well this is familiar and then you just go do the next thing and maybe there's a little bit of

373
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:33,520
sadness there but you know that it's not going to be the end of the world whereas before it's like oh i can't believe i'm

374
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:39,599
sad and i don't want to be sad and i'm gonna be sad for the rest of my life or

375
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:47,680
whatever it might be i don't know so thank you nancy for saying that too because sometimes if i mean of course we

376
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:54,640
wish that like wow this mindfulness thing is so great and couldn't it be a little faster

377
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:04,839
under the impression that the goal was to

378
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:11,359
really remove the huge peaks and valleys that you go through and sort of

379
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:18,200
maintain a much more growing um

380
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:36,079
yeah so you were saying that's kind of the practice is to not have so much of the peaks and the valleys but to roll with

381
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:41,760
them um i like you what you're saying here it's the idea it's not that the waves don't come but we just learn to

382
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:49,760
surf better right so we're just like surfing on them and they're not thrashing us around is in the same way

383
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:55,119
we could call that equanimity and equanimity is uh one of the

384
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:02,000
really uh it's often it's out of equanimity where the deepest leading goes and the deepest

385
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,359
freedoms are found out of equanimity so yes

386
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:16,119
yes she was dying guess what she said pray for my

387
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:22,800
beautiful also i'll just say for those who didn't hear that um

388
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:28,240
you said that as your mother was dying she said pray that i have equanimity yeah

389
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,839
this capacity to hold it

390
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:57,480
okay okay thank you all wishing you all a good evening
