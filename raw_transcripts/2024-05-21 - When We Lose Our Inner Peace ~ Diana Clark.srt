1
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:11,960
welcome welcome everybody nice to see you

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,720
all so tonight I'd like to start with a small verse that comes from the early

3
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:25,400
Buddhist literature talking about this idea of inner

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:32,200
peace something I think uh all of us are interested in having some peace and ease

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:39,719
and spaciousness well-being Freedom all these types of words having this

6
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:49,120
experience having it be a part of our life so the verse goes like

7
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,280
this internally one can find peace not

8
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:02,359
through another for one who is at peace with themselves there there is no picking up

9
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:09,920
when putting down this is pointing to how so often we

10
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,600
are looking for things to be peaceful outside externally right so that then we

11
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,159
can settle down and to be sure there is value in

12
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:26,759
doing something like going on a retreat at a retreat center where things are

13
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:32,360
pretty peaceful for those of you who've been on Retreat you know that uh after a few

14
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:42,000
days it just gets really quiet everybody kind of moves a little bit slower and uh it's it can be really

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,560
lovely it can also be aggravating if you're feeling really restless and everything's so

16
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:57,079
quiet but the truth is that whatever is outside of us is of

17
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:02,880
course it's outside of our control not that we get to control everything

18
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,360
that goes on inside either but especially things that are outside whether it's other people or whether

19
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,480
it's the situation the weather the news the temperature whatever it is these

20
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,440
types of things we all know this and in Buddhist teachings there's

21
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,239
this emphasis on letting go like not really clinging and holding on this

22
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:35,920
recognition that uh difficulties and tension non peace the UNP

23
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:42,879
peacefulness the agitation arises from like really holding on to

24
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:48,080
views um Concepts uh um ideas about

25
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,239
ourself ideas about how we think things should be or or having some aversion

26
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,360
really not wanting something and just getting tangled up with it in a way that

27
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:07,000
uh have a certain hostility and then that leads towards some some

28
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,840
agitation but what this little verse is pointing to that if there's this inner

29
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:21,040
peace then not only is it easier to let go and we all have this experience of

30
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,239
you know having woken up on the right side of the bed feeling well

31
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:34,560
rested and maybe looking looking forward to something that's going to happen that day something fun or

32
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,120
celebratory and then we're just so much more tolerant right we're not uh cranky

33
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,000
we're able to not get tingled up with things so letting go is much

34
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,000
easier and we don't pick up as much we don't pick up like hearing somebody say

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,519
something and feel like that we have to give them a piece of our mind letting them know how they're

36
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:06,840
wrong or we're not picking up like trying to solve something that uh maybe

37
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,879
it could just unfold on itself I'm not saying that we shouldn't solve problems

38
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:18,320
of course we should of course we should but maybe some things are not as big of

39
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,320
problems as we think they are so often this is the case

40
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:31,759
right I'll read this verse again internally one can find peace not

41
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:38,919
through another for one who is at peace with themselves there is no picking up

42
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:46,120
when putting down I like this word when we don't use this so often in American English but like why would there there's

43
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:53,240
no need for putting down because we haven't put up there's no need for letting go because we haven't picked it

44
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,600
up so with this verse the Buddha is pointing to this possibility of inner

45
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:04,160
peace this inner sense of

46
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:11,039
wellbeing sense of Freedom or ease he pointing to that we don't have

47
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:17,520
to live with this inner turmoil this often this inner conflict or sometimes

48
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:24,319
there's fear or maybe there's like a little aggression or hostility that's feels really uncomfortable towards

49
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:31,400
others towards ourselves just towards the whatever is happening

50
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:40,000
but instead we can touch into this peacefulness that is available to all of

51
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,360
us it's not something that we have to create from scratch it's already

52
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:55,560
there and part of practice is creating the conditions in which we can touch into it which we can hang out

53
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,720
there and for some that'll be with a meditation practice which were able to

54
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:09,280
like settle the body and settle the mind but if this idea of peace is to

55
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:18,360
become something other than just an idea if it's supposed to become something other just than just this abstraction or

56
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:26,479
concept then we have to live our lives in a way that supports

57
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:33,479
peacefulness it's not like we're going to live our lives one way and then Shazam there's

58
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:38,919
peace instead like the goal and the means are really tied together of course

59
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:46,039
they are this is how you know things naturally are that okay we'll have little moments of peace or we'll learn a

60
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:54,080
little bit more about what doesn't bring peace which is just as important and it's just through this

61
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,560
accumulation of learning to live peacefully having these moments of peace

62
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:06,160
more and more in our life that peace becomes more prevalent and more readily

63
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,560
accessible so there's this way in which we can live in a manner which nourishes

64
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:17,599
and supports peace and one way that we can do this

65
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:23,520
well there's a number of ways but one way that uh we can

66
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,720
recognize how to have a little bit more peace in our life is to notice what

67
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,120
takes us away from any sense of calm that we

68
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,240
have a classic way to think about this is with a meditation practice and with

69
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,319
some meditation if there's a certain amount of settledness sometimes there isn't right

70
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:51,560
sometimes just with meditation we feel Restless a lot but sometimes there is

71
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:59,639
time which there's some a little bit of ease and like feels good maybe to just sit

72
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:05,879
and then when the timer has gone off when the bell has gone off for example you

73
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:11,639
feel in like there's a sense of Peace some calm some

74
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:18,199
ease and then pay attention when does that piece go

75
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:24,000
away is it as soon as the bell ends like okay bam you I'm off running and I got to take care of this I got to do that

76
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,759
and I got to you know this way that we often can do but to make it a little bit of

77
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,680
practice just to notice like okay what is it that we think is more

78
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:42,640
important than being calm what are we willing to sacrifice our calm our peace

79
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:50,480
for what is it that we is um causing agitation or that we're getting agitated

80
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,640
about because it doesn't have to be this either or that I'm either meditating and

81
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,040
I'm calm or I'm taking care of my life and going to work and my household and

82
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,600
people I love and care for you know it doesn't have to be that way right we can

83
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,720
bring whatever calm we're discovering in a meditation practice with

84
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,160
us with whatever we're doing so it can be really helpful to

85
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:24,600
notice well what is it that uh causes this to end to go

86
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:31,519
away and there's is there a way that uh we can just look like honestly at the

87
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:39,560
cause of the agitation that we're feeling but maybe as I said there's

88
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:45,800
restlessness or maybe with meditation there isn't even really a deep sense of

89
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:53,200
Peace maybe things are a little bit more calm but there isn't a real sense of ease and

90
00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:00,320
freedom and one reason why this might be and in my role as a dhad teacher and

91
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,480
I have practiced discussions with individuals and it's not uncommon for

92
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:14,040
people to talk about what what I'm calling the inner critic this maybe like you know we could

93
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:20,440
use this expression uh just colloquially as like this subpersonality that's

94
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:27,600
inside of us this uh Voice or something that's constantly putting us down and

95
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,399
belittling us you're not doing do it right um whatever you're doing it's

96
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:38,959
clearly not the correct thing or this sense of um this

97
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:45,040
negativity or this judgment or this uh blaming ourselves or nagging at

98
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:51,680
ourselves oh this inner critic can be so cruel and incessant and

99
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:58,360
mean not everybody has this and it's not there all the time but when it is there

100
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:05,399
it has such a big impact it causes this agitation because this inner critic has

101
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:11,760
this uh tenor this uh attitude this mood of

102
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,120
harshness and it helps like engender this feeling of inadequacy or

103
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,399
insufficiency like whatever I'm doing it's not enough

104
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:29,560
or I'm not enough somehow I have to be better somehow I have to be more and

105
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:36,000
this can be so uh debilitating and there's a way

106
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,000
it just takes uh so much of our life energy in some kind of way just kind of like saps it out of us in addition to

107
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,880
the agitation and for some people it's so

108
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:55,519
prevalent and such a common part of their inner experience they may not even

109
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,040
notice it it's just so familiar like oh of of course I'm always beating myself

110
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,760
up how else am I going to get better of course I'm already being a

111
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:14,360
little bit mean to myself I have to otherwise I would never get out of bed in the mornings I would just lounge

112
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:21,600
around and doom scroll in from bed or something like this

113
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,399
right so and and some people also feel like maybe it's just them that like

114
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:35,000
everybody else seems like they have it together and I'm the only one who feels like I I

115
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,639
don't want to say it's understandable that some people have this or at certain

116
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:49,519
times or more very often whenever there's this way that maybe our

117
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,160
from family or education or certainly our society kind of really supports this

118
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:02,639
idea you should be more therefore buy this product so that you can be more or

119
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:11,240
you know do this thing so you can do more or read this book you know self-help books or something like

120
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:17,399
that there countless reasons why we might have this sense of not

121
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:22,399
being okay somehow being

122
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:29,199
insufficient so I think it's important not to blame ourselves if we discover that there's this Dynamic this

123
00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:34,720
constellation inside of us that's uh putting us down not something that we

124
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,600
willfully created and the last thing we want to do is like well to criticize

125
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,639
ourselves for having the inner critic right because then we would criticize

126
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:54,440
the criticizer and then we criticize the criticizer who's criticizing the criticizer and off we go right this like

127
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,800
this uh incessant Circle

128
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,480
so I just want to just describe a little bit more like one thing that happens

129
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:11,519
with this inner critic is there's this um strong sense of like

130
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:18,800
should I should do this I should not be doing that there's this way in which

131
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:26,199
there's a sense of should kind of like puts this pressure on us and sometimes we feel it like literally like this

132
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:33,120
ug you know kind like it's weigh heavy on our shoulders and even if you come to a

133
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,240
meditation center like this maybe you're thinking I should meditate

134
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:44,040
more or you know I should go on a retreat or you know something like

135
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:49,320
this I know I certainly I've had those thoughts certainly when I first started

136
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:56,000
my meditation practice it it was a little bit of a struggle to be uh consistent and to have a regular I was

137
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:03,440
like oh I should meditate more I was hoping nobody body would notice that I wasn't meditating at

138
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,920
home but this uh this sense this sense of should that creates a pressure kind

139
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:17,839
of like constricts us kind of like constricts the heart and constricts the mind causes agitation so it's anything

140
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:24,399
but peace peaceful or calm as peace has this uh sense of space

141
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,959
and uh openness this inner I just kind of like

142
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:38,680
shuts that down and kind of squeezes it so to support working with inner

143
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:45,319
peace we can work with this inner critic I want to offer a few ideas for

144
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:50,680
this one is as I was saying like you know

145
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:57,319
criticizing the criticizer this inner criticizer and then you know it just

146
00:15:57,319 --> 00:16:03,800
goes on and on and on how many criticizers there can be how many iterations there can be of

147
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:11,079
that but when we notice that we're caught in kind of this Loop of the aversion to aversion or judging the

148
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:16,360
judging whatever it might be when we notice and we feel that we're

149
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:24,480
really stuck in it something we can do that can really change the direction and interrupt the

150
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,120
momentum and really change the mood so to

151
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:37,040
speak is to just ask ourselves how am I right

152
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:44,959
now how am I right now how am I right

153
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:53,279
now and we're asking this not because we have to find the answer we're asking because this is like

154
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:59,560
a big shift this is like a reorientation towards asking or

155
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:05,038
inquiring or being present for like what's what's our experience at that

156
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:12,160
moment with some care with some warmth how am I right

157
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:18,438
now is a way in which there's this such a different uh mood instead of like you

158
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:25,678
should do this you shouldn't do that and now you have an inner critic and now you have to take care of this inner critic instead of just well how are

159
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:31,520
you is this way is it such a different um

160
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,480
attitude maybe it'll be obvious I'm miserable cuz I'm beating myself

161
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:45,480
up but even that just this uh recognition of what's happening is a way

162
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,760
that undermines the authority of this inner critic instead it brings in this

163
00:17:50,760 --> 00:18:00,840
attitude of being present for what's there this kind of respect and care for oneself

164
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,840
and maybe there's this way that how am I right now maybe we can like feel into

165
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,720
the body kind of like undermine some of what the mind is doing right this inner

166
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:19,360
critic often even though its effects can be felt in the body it often is this uh

167
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:26,840
going around and around in the mind so how am I right now I have this

168
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:33,400
lump in my throat and my gut doesn't my belly just doesn't feel good and I'm

169
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:41,000
really agitated now that's something that we can be with and work with instead of the

170
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,760
stories we can still work with like oh yeah I have this lump in my

171
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:52,480
throat and just feel into that what is the lump in the throat

172
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,559
like and now we have a completely different way of going forward to be

173
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:03,880
with our experience in the present moment and this is the

174
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:10,159
practice and not only that it's been with the experience in the present moment with a sense of

175
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:18,720
care which might be a radical thing in the midst of the inner critic to you know have some warmth and care for

176
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:28,400
oneself so that's one thing we can do with this inner critic something that's kind of like stealing our peace is to

177
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:35,039
change change the direction by just asking how am I right now something else that we can do is

178
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:42,280
with our meditation practice just to bring this same attitude of kindness and

179
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:47,760
warmth to meditation it's not uncommon and I

180
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,679
certainly did my share fair share of this when meditating you know I'm supposed to be like meditating on the

181
00:19:53,679 --> 00:20:00,679
breath and then you know lost in some thought about what I'm going to pick up at the grocery store on the way home and

182
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:05,840
don't forget to get this you know whatever and then realize oh wait I'm

183
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:12,600
supposed to be meditating and then there would be this very little quiet dang it Diana when are

184
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:18,440
you going to get it together and I wouldn't even notice and then I would like come back to the

185
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:25,159
breath it took me quite some time to notice that there was like this you know this beat after kind of like waking up

186
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:33,280
after being lost in thought that was a little bit mean and then I would kind of like yank the Mind back to that

187
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:39,360
breath instead can there be like yep that's what Minds

188
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:46,640
do let's let's pay attention to the breath again it's such a different way such a

189
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:54,400
different attitude so this can be such a fruitful place to practice is to notice the

190
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:01,280
moment right after you realize that you've been lost in thought when you've been and intending to meditate and just

191
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,360
notice the flavor the mood the attitude and I know some people I think

192
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:13,720
it was um I think I first heard this from Sylvia borin if I remember correctly and uh she

193
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:19,880
would say something like oh sweetheart oh sweetie you're lost in

194
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:25,960
thought again just come back to the breath so she would throw in a little term of endearment for herself you know

195
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:31,039
just as a way to just really uh um counteract any harshness that might be

196
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:38,720
showing up there's something that I think is kind of sweet about that so maybe we all have our we can use a term

197
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,919
of endearment for ourselves that doesn't make us feel squeamish but instead makes us feel has

198
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:52,400
a some warmth to it and then maybe there's this way in

199
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:58,640
which we can just recognize the inner critic and just

200
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:05,840
say oh there's the inner critic and this wave like okay yep I

201
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,760
guess you're going to be hanging out with me for a while come along you know instead of this idea that

202
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,919
we have to get rid of it and it's a problem and I'm going to fix it and I have this agenda first I'll do step one

203
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:22,440
and then step two and you know to make but instead like oh yep here it is I

204
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:29,360
know quite a few people that have given their inner critic like a a name

205
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:36,080
I heard uh one person this name you know I don't actually I shouldn't say it because what if some of somebody who's

206
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,799
listening that is their name but uh somebody who had shared a a different

207
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:48,840
name and just Ed this as a character that would somehow accompany them during a

208
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:54,840
meditation so as a way to you know like maybe in um instead of turning it into a

209
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:02,080
problem just like giving it space space okay the inner critic is here

210
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:08,000
doesn't mean we have to believe it doesn't mean we have to give it Authority but it also doesn't mean that

211
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,720
we have to like repress or pretend that it's not there just recognize oh okay

212
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:21,320
here it is here is this inner critic and so this whole idea of working

213
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:27,360
with an inner critic I think uh Rosemary traumer um expresses really well in a

214
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:34,240
poem that uh she published yesterday and I was just happened to be uh looking at

215
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:40,000
and I thought oh I'm going to add this to the talk this a she I should say

216
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:47,559
she's a Buddhist practitioner and uh she writes a poem and publishes a poem every day she a beautiful practice a beautiful

217
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:55,240
practice she's uh I think she's an amazing poet so here's Rosemary trummer at the

218
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:03,480
end I'll give the um the title of this poem I don't yeah I'll give the title of the

219
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:11,960
poem and uh this is how this poem goes on a day when I am at war with myself

220
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:18,200
when I battle my own humanness and a longing to be good to be better than

221
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:26,799
good to be perfect when I point to myself with a snarl and a sneer as if I am my own

222
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:33,640
enemy then I know notice how my whole body contracts and I'm a crumpled up map

223
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:39,840
a gray lump in the throat a stone in the gut a crumpled Wing in the chest and

224
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:47,559
it's hard to breathe and it's hard to move that is when I'm grateful to have a

225
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:53,559
body grateful for the way it helps me remember I have a choice to meet this

226
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:59,120
moment with kindness it's as if mid comat I'm

227
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:06,279
delivered a postcard with a forever stamp sent from my wisest self

228
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:12,640
saying dear woman who thinks she is not good enough I see

229
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:19,559
you it's okay to feel this way and what looked like a battlefield a

230
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:25,640
blink ago now looks more like a vast Green

231
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:32,960
Meadow filled with low golden and light where all parts of me are

232
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:41,279
welcome the one who makes mistakes the one who judges the one who longs to be good the

233
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,960
one who thinks she shouldn't have to learn the same lesson

234
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:54,399
again there is no part of me then that is not welcome that cannot be loved and

235
00:25:54,399 --> 00:26:03,600
my body expands like a great Alpine Basin unfurls like an unending White

236
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:12,159
Flag how easy it is then to stand with all of in that field and know what it means

237
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:20,960
to be home if I like this way that Rose Mar trauma she's describing this battle

238
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:27,640
inside and then she says that it's as if mid combat I'm delivered

239
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:35,120
a post card with a forever stamp sent from my wisest self this way that sometimes like our

240
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,840
practice can be a support for us like our meditation practice our loving

241
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:48,720
kindness practice compassion practice this is a way that can just some like show up and interrupt in the same way

242
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:55,080
that when we're meditating and we're lost in thought and then we don't know why then Bo all a sudden we wake up and

243
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:01,320
realize oh yeah I'm supposed to be meditating there can be a way with practice with this uh inner critic like

244
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:11,200
oh yeah I don't have to do this there's a different way I can ask how am I right now I can

245
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,960
give it space I can have a see if there's a way I can be with an attitude noticing my

246
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:22,799
inner experience in particular with warmth and

247
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:31,799
kindness so that's these are some ways to work with this inner critic as a way

248
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:36,960
to support some inner peace then I'm just want to mention a

249
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,360
little bit briefly another way to support with inner

250
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:48,519
peace because I there was a time I for some reason this like seared in my mind

251
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:55,679
I was on a long retreat and some things that I had done earlier in my life that

252
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:03,399
were very harmful came up in my memory oh my gosh that was

253
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:09,600
so painful day after day these memories coming up and like haunting me and I'm

254
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:18,279
like wow and I was like wishing there was anything I could do right I'm in a retreat center very quiet very still

255
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:25,720
nothing to distract oneself and here I am with these memories like again and again and again like oh it was so

256
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:32,000
painful just like you we can't to undo the past right however much we wish that

257
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,320
we could instead we deal with the consequences of some

258
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:44,200
things that we whatever we've done right this is part of what it means to be

259
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:50,960
human and so this kind of like sense of regret or remorse is often a way in

260
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,440
which we feel agitated not the only way of course but that's a way in which we

261
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:02,399
our peace gets second riced or you know it gets in the way of feeling this inner

262
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:08,200
calm and peacefulness and of course every great

263
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:13,480
spiritual tradition talks about the benefit of ethical Behavior like

264
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:21,679
behaving in a way that uh doesn't cause harm to others doesn't cause harm to

265
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:28,880
oneself instead there's this uh emphasis on recognizing that

266
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:36,840
we all of us have this capacity within us to maybe appreciate and take joy in

267
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:43,640
Integrity honesty this uprightness or this ethical conduct or you know warmth

268
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:50,279
of heart or openness of heart and the way that we show up in the world so that

269
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:55,880
we're not causing harm to others or to ourselves it's important right for both

270
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:03,000
of these so this ethical having behaving ethically is such a foundational part of

271
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,240
how we are in the world because there's no end but

272
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:16,679
literally there is no end as long as we're alive we'll be interacting with others or interacting with ourselves in

273
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:23,279
some kind of way and there's always a way in which we can perhaps be like a little bit more skillful a little bit

274
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:28,640
more tuned into what is a way that can provide

275
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:35,720
most benefit and least harm to others self and both self and

276
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:43,279
others often that's not so straightforward it's not so easy in order to do that often takes that we

277
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:48,679
aren't always just doing the path of least resistance but instead we're having difficult

278
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:55,159
conversations instead we're going out of our way to avoid a topic or and but

279
00:30:55,159 --> 00:31:02,639
letting others know that what the harm that's being done in a way that is skillful and supportive in a way that

280
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:08,200
people can hear not in a way that makes them shut down or get

281
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:13,639
defensive but in a way that they want to listen to what you're saying this takes

282
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:20,120
work it's not easy to consistently striving to cause

283
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:27,960
the least amount of harm in this world so ethical Behavior as best we can

284
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:34,880
is something else that can really support this sense of Peace so that we don't have regret we don't have remorse

285
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:42,519
or we don't have fear like there's a thing that I did to that person and now they might retaliate or if they don't

286
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:48,320
retaliate maybe they'll be rude to me or now we feel like we have to avoid them because we feel bad that we did said

287
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:54,120
that thing to them that time or sent that email or whatever it was whatever

288
00:31:54,120 --> 00:32:00,440
it was so I don't know some sometimes when we hear this expression ethical Behavior

289
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:06,840
it feels like ug it sounds a little bit oppressive but I'm pointing to just

290
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:13,840
showing up in the world with a commitment to not causing harm to oneself or to

291
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:21,720
others in the Buddhist tradition this is like the what we call CA ethical

292
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,519
Behavior so the Buddha's teaching and he's really pointing to this possibility

293
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:37,320
this this radical transformation that's available to have this have a pervading

294
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:43,000
sense of peace and to be able to touch into the

295
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:50,120
sense of peace that all of us have even if there there's a big part of us that's feeling restless and

296
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:57,240
unsettled there's a way that can support more and more peace more and more ease more and more

297
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:04,039
well-being and more and more freedom in one way is working with the

298
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:09,480
inner critic the Buddha doesn't talk about the inner critic in particular but

299
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:17,039
I wanted to bring this in just because I often have seen this and with practice discussions and I've experienced it

300
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:22,360
myself and also this uh importance of the way we show up in the world and not

301
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:28,559
causing harm maybe I'll end with reading

302
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:35,679
Rosemary traumer poem again the title is called

303
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:44,000
self-compassion so Rosemary traumer poem self-compassion it goes whoops it would

another sorry about this here we go

306
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:04,600
Rosemary trummer's poem self-compassion on a day when I am at

307
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:12,358
war with myself when I battle my own humanness in aing to be good to be

308
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:21,599
better than good to be perfect when I point to myself with a snarl and a sneer as if I am my own

309
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:27,760
enemy then I notice how my whole body contracts and I'm crumpled up map I'm

310
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:34,800
I'm a crumpled up map a gray lump in the throat a stone in the gut a crumpled

311
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:43,040
Wing in the chest and it's hard to breathe and it's hard to

312
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:49,158
move that is when I'm grateful to have a body grateful for the way it helps me

313
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:55,480
remember I have a choice to meet this moment with

314
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:01,280
kindness it's as if mid combat I'm delivered a postcard with a forever

315
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:08,320
stamp sent from my wisest self saying dear woman who thinks she is not good

316
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:15,520
enough I see you it's okay to feel this

317
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:21,440
way and what looked like a battlefield a blink ago now looks more like a vast

318
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,920
Green Meadow fil filled with low Golden Light where all parts of me are well

319
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:34,960
welcome the one who makes mistakes the one who judges the one who longs to be

320
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,880
good the one who thinks she shouldn't have to learn the same lesson

321
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:47,560
again there is no part of me then that is not welcome that cannot be loved and

322
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:56,640
my body expands like a great Alpine Basin unfurls like an unending white

323
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:03,560
flag how easy it is then to stand with all of in that field and know what it

324
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:11,560
means to be home very nice I think I'll end there

325
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:17,160
