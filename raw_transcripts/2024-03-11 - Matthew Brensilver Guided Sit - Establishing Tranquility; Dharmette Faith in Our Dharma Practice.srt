1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,080
so um let's uh let's settle in we

2
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,960
set

3
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:53,719
so we just settle into the posture and we see what uh the

4
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:58,920
silence wants to tell us this morning this

5
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,920
day

6
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,600
maybe it's less like we tell ourselves what to do when we start

7
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:35,520
meditating and more like we listen to the

8
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,320
silence and take our cues from

9
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,840
that

10
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,200
re relax whatever can be

11
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,800
relaxed Grant permission for whatever tension remains to

12
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,680
remain

13
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:54,120
as we relax maybe in traumatic ways or subtle

14
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:01,680
ways the view changes

15
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:14,959
the view from the vantage point of some Tranquility changes everything looks

16
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,880
different it's not that uh the problems of our life the complexities of it all

17
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:28,320
resolve but everything looks different from the vantage point of

18
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,440
tranquility and so even if there's just one degree of

19
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,320
Tranquility you notice

20
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
this

21
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:05,360
Tranquility is a supported by uh narrowing the

22
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,120
attentional

23
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,639
field not insisting that other experiences

24
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:27,560
stop or turning anything into an enemy of

25
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
meditation

26
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:42,960
but the attention Spotlight some

27
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,039
phenomena and leaves the rest of the

28
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,360
world in the background in the

29
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
dark

30
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,759
and so maybe the sensations of

31
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,840
breathing or

32
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
spotl

33
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:18,560
and that's like we we just make our home

34
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,839
there not bracing as the rest of the world knocks on that

35
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:33,760
door but our home is there become more

36
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,040
more intimate with the sensations of uh

37
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,839
breathing our world what we call our

38
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,600
life becomes uh much

39
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
simpler

40
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:59,480
and of course our our worry begs for our atten attention

41
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:09,720
demands or attention and says there's so

42
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:16,639
many things to solve contingency of our existence and

43
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:25,000
each uh demands

44
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
attention

45
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:42,519
and yet if all were ever doing is solving the problem of another

46
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:51,399
moment and it's very possible to live a whole life only ever doing

47
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:59,560
that if that's all we're doing [Music] something

48
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,680
the heart gets

49
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,199
fatigued so we consent to the kind of

50
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:20,480
vulnerability the exposure of non

51
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:30,760
worry of not keeping tabs on every problem we have or

52
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,560
house we develop a kind of

53
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,920
faith in the

54
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
silence

55
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:23,399
so I'll be quiet for some minutes as we uh deepen

56
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:31,959
the intimacy with uh this smaller app sure of uh

57
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
attention

58
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:47,880
stabilizing the inner gaze even with our eyes closed it's

59
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:53,000
almost like uh visual attention

60
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:00,039
is surveying the landscape for

61
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,640
threat problems that need to be

62
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,559
solved so

63
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,320
we stay stabilize the inner

64
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,400
gaze kind of soft gaze at the the blankness behind our closed

65
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:52,600
eyes keep feeling being nourished by our

66
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,480
breathing whatever pleasure might might be

67
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:10,039
there the ways they inhale answers our oxygen

68
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:17,440
hunger the way our exhale expels what's used

69
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
up

70
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:59,520
often our suffering involves some measure of a

71
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:07,360
kind of hyperarousal not always but

72
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:17,600
often so we nurture this uh

73
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:29,520
Tranquility kind of Refuge of making the aperture of attention smaller

74
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:37,120
the ways we feel less bombarded by

75
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,960
experience then we notice how the view

76
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:55,399
changes when there's some measure even a tiny measure of Tranquility on

77
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,519
board

78
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:12,559
all experience is preceded by mind the

79
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
Buddhist

80
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
for

81
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:17,120
okay so welcome ah welcome

82
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:25,320
folks it's nice to uh nice to say with

83
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,240
you so uh

84
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:38,159
theme this week uh is uh is facets of uh of

85
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:44,320
faith in Dharma practice

86
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:51,720
um that word that word faith uh has kind of like historically evoked some some

87
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:58,080
measure of uh of Suspicion in me kind of

88
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:04,120
you know I thought that was what um that word was what people invoked when they

89
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:10,760
didn't have evidence for believing something but wanted to believe

90
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:17,960
anyway and early in uh early in

91
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:25,799
practice I I I sort of intuitively sense the power of the Dharma that it was It

92
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:34,559
was kind of pushing deep buttons inside me and in sensing that that kind of the

93
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:41,799
power of it I I sort of felt a little intoxicating you know like I could sense

94
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:47,799
the intoxicating potential of like giving myself over to

95
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:54,600
something and I didn't know what I was giving myself over to I wanted to be careful I wanted to be careful not to

96
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:01,120
give away too much of my mind so I kind of like dip my toe into practice and

97
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,960
then pull my toe out it's

98
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:15,000
okay and uh at the same time I did have a sense

99
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,720
that uh some measure of of surrender was was

100
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:28,279
really required to to deepen that that the kind of Gates of

101
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:33,880
Dharma are closed to those who will not

102
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:40,480
surrender and that was that was 25 about 25 years ago quarter quarter Century

103
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:48,679
it's really kind of wild and maybe without knowing it uh

104
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:55,880
Faith kind of snuck up on me and now just animates Dharma practice

105
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:02,240
to to a a large extent so what is what is this what is

106
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:10,320
Faith it's not faith in in Sam S like it's not faith that everything works out

107
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:17,080
okay it's not um yeah it's not naive a naive some kind

108
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:24,159
of naive hope and it's not pretending that some data some aspects of our

109
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:31,880
experience need to be discounted okay I can be faithful if I'm paying

110
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:37,039
attention to this but if I actually allow all that all that pain in or

111
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:44,159
something then I don't know the faith wobbles

112
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:50,760
but when we don't have trust in the path of awareness it seems like some

113
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:58,159
experiences must be disavowed but that gets us us into a

114
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:05,000
kind of pretend mode where we we write off some aspects of experience pretend

115
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,599
they don't exist when we pretend when we pretend we

116
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:16,200
confuse ourselves we alienate ourselves the Dharma never asks you to pretend

117
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:24,118
Faith your faith never asks you to pretend right it might ask you

118
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:31,159
to check out a different View but it never asks you to

119
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:40,118
pretend and so faith is is compatible uh with uh kind of openness

120
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:47,720
to all data and evidence and I've

121
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:52,839
uh I've come to associate faith not

122
00:34:52,839 --> 00:35:01,359
with naiv but with a certain kind of dropping of defensiveness dropping of

123
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:07,640
defensiveness that faith is less a a kind of rigid set of views and more the

124
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:15,480
heart's gesture of uh of surrender and this is how we let go

125
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,400
into into our

126
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:27,359
path and so faith faith tolerates not knowing it it's not

127
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:34,400
uh it's not filling the kind of unknown or uncertainty with with with rigid

128
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:40,720
views or something like this it's more a kind of trusting

129
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,560
something about one's heart one's heart and

130
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:53,119
emologic um the the word apparently is some

131
00:35:53,119 --> 00:36:01,480
some uh connotation of like uh uh to to place your heart upon where

132
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:09,240
where do you place your heart where do we seek our our

133
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:16,078
Redemption uh where do we invest Our Hope where do we invest Our

134
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:26,160
Hope Ain U aan suito um said something like you know

135
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:33,680
generally um generally people say the path um begins with wise view then we establish

136
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:40,000
wise view that's where the path begins he said yeah fair enough but uh

137
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,640
the path truly begins when the the Buddha walks into your

138
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:52,720
heart walks into your heart that that is the arising of a certain kind of

139
00:36:52,720 --> 00:37:00,720
faith and I recognize that has uh that language parallels other Traditions but

140
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:06,480
there's something about that that feels feels right the Buddha walking into

141
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:13,119
one's heart faith I I realize is a certain

142
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:19,400
kind of um optimism you know it's an optim that's a word I don't know if I've

143
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:25,599
ever used that word in a Dharma talk actually optimism

144
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:30,880
uh but it's weird because it's like we talk so much about Dua I've been

145
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:38,599
studying comprehend Dua Dua you know suffering in unsatisfactoriness like all

146
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:47,440
all these years of comprehending Dua and yet at some level it's made me

147
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:54,560
quite optimistic optimistic about at least about some things it's not it's not uh

148
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,880
kind of uh unwavering optimism about the world or something like that I have

149
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:07,160
incredible incredible reverence for the destructiveness of greed hate and

150
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:15,960
delusion for the ways in which that gets scaled in our world the ways in which it

151
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:22,040
it's being scaled by technology incredible respect for the

152
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:27,560
power of that so not optimistic in certain ways

153
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:33,800
but optimism about the heart mind and optimism about

154
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:42,119
uh about capacity of our own heart and if I had to to characterize them I

155
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:47,440
might say like Buddhist teachers tend to be a little bit um maybe a little

156
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:55,520
bearish about the future bullish about human potential

157
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:02,440
capacity there's uh there's an optimism about

158
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:09,680
about looking about awareness that no matter what pain is being known The

159
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:16,880
Knowing of it makes something else also

160
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:24,680
true an optimism about this kind of longing for veracity like just to this

161
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:32,319
truth seeking that whatever whatever we discover will make love more

162
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:38,559
rather than less urgent there's a faith in

163
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:47,200
that uh knowing that yeah the truth can hurt it can hurt a lot um but um it

164
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:53,560
won't harm your heart and that's very different that's very different it's a

165
00:39:53,560 --> 00:40:02,599
faith in something like like the uh samada will will um yeah will will hurt

166
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:07,440
for sure but need not harm your

167
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:15,200
heart faith is what uh allows surrender to feel safe enough to feel safe

168
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:22,960
enough uh faith is a willingness to to fall a lot of Dharma about

169
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:29,680
falling sometimes gracefully often without any

170
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:36,400
Grace whatsoever but it's about falling it's about

171
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:43,520
groundlessness but a trust that develops that in the

172
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:51,200
groundlessness in the falling yeah

173

excluded from the Buddhist Grace and you no longer feel like you're

178
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:33,599
kind of like following someone else's path that you're assimilating to someone else's path

179
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:42,200
