1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:10,200
hello on this uh Monday Monday morning in Redwood City

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:17,080
California as I sit here at the inside meditation center and

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:26,000
uh for this morning's meditation I'd like to evoke the idea of

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,199
wholeness that one of the ways to meditate is to sit with with the whole

5
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,719
of what's happening and to begin that way the best that we can a global experience of the

6
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:45,960
whole show and it means we don't select out any particular thing to focus on but

7
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,000
rather uh in the way that you might

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,079
um kind of gaze out upon a mountain in the distance or clouds floating by in

9
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,920
the sky or outer across um the ocean once at the

10
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,680
beach that um there's a kind of just like just uh broad attention wide

11
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,000
attention to include the whole and if the attention falls on any particular

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,119
thing just welcome it and say this too is included in the

13
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:28,520
hole and um and one way of understanding this is that um we're letting our

14
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:34,240
attention uh be the widest Circle possible within which

15
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,759
all things are allowed to be all experiences are allowed to be equally

16
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:47,560
without being for or against without welcoming or unwelcoming any

17
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:54,399
particular experience that's uh happening and um so it's all included

18
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,719
all allowed here and that's just the beginning

19
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:08,720
uh with that capacity to kind of include everything with almost with the little

20
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:15,319
saying this too this too is included this creates the conditions

21
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:21,280
upon which wisdom can operate where Clarity understanding can operate and

22
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:28,480
where there can be a wise discernment a wise letting go or a wise picking up or

23
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:36,360
a wise selectivity of where the attention goes it might be the sense of whole

24
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:42,599
allows us to discover uh like there's a big circle of everything's included we

25
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:51,640
might be able over time to discover where the center of that big circle is and we would sit at that Center like

26
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,840
a big round trampoline um we would sit in the middle

27
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,800
of a trampoline the trampoline net would sink right there would rest there so we

28
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,840
find that place in the middle of the hole to rest but first we have to just

29
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:17,840
kind of be at ease with all this too is included so to assume a meditation

30
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,360
posture and whatever posture you take you might have the attitude or approach

31
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:31,319
it as if your whole body is included some way in which nothing is

32
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:36,680
left out sometimes if we sit meditating in a

33
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,560
chair and we're sitting with the legs crossed in some kind of casual way that

34
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:49,400
uh somehow the legs or one of the feet are not really fully part of the whole

35
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:56,560
process but if the feet are both legs are both kind of squarely there in the chair and knees more or less at a right

36
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,680
angle and the soles of the feet kind of touching the floor everything's kind of more included in

37
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,480
the process in the posture so that was just an example uh but

38
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,799
uh so it's a sit in a way that there's a little bit of

39
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:22,240
intentionality in the way that you position your body and that intentionality is to begin

40
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:29,280
including the whole body as part of the bigger hole

41
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,800
and then to begin expanding through that whole wholeness of the

42
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:44,840
body maybe it' be nice for you to take some deeper breaths almost as if the circles of

43
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,639
attention expand as you breathe

44
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,120
in and welcome everything in as you breathe out

45
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:12,000
expanding outwards as you deeply inhale and relaxing settling inward as

46
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,280
you

47
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:31,240
exhale and then letting the breathing return to normal and when there is

48
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:38,039
tension it's useful to think of that as a way of becoming partial the way

49
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:47,319
of selecting or cutting off or over validating some part of the

50
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:54,199
whole and that relaxing the tension starts making room for all

51
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:57,919
things to be included

52
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:07,960
relaxation makes space for all things to come into

53
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,599
their native

54
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:25,000
way breathing normally on the exhale going through the

55
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,880
body and finding places of holding and tension and on the exhale relaxing softening in

56
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,120
the body

57
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:12,440
a significant way in which we are not part of the whole of who we are is being

58
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:18,160
overly concerned with our thoughts and stories and

59
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:30,720
ideas and that over involvement sometimes involves mental or

60
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:38,360
physical tension or tightness pressure associated with

61
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,000
thinking and if there is as you exhale soften that

62
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,039
tension relax the

63
00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:02,479
pressure soften the thinking mind for

64
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:49,519
sometimes we might operate with a spatial awareness

65
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:58,959
awareness of ourselves in space and location it's possible to feel or sense

66
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:04,399
or imagine imagine the

67
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,240
space around the

68
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:18,079
body how we're sitting in a particular room particular spatial

69
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:23,200
situation and to with the eyes closed to feel and

70
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:32,560
sense beyond the edges of the body the space the room

71
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,959
the around

72
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:03,720
us and as if that space is the widest Circle of our personal

73
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:10,800
wholeness anything that happens within that Wider

74
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,760
Circle is allowed to be known and held in

75
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:26,240
awareness and every particular thing that happens see it as part of the

76
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,320
whole all of who you are one piece

77
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,920
whatever you're feeling emotionally or mentally or

78
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:49,760
physically maybe it's easier to let it be there if it's seen as just part of a

79
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:57,360
whole it's accompanied by everything else here and now

80
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:18,240
and maybe at the center of it all like the center of the

81
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:25,639
trampoline is the gentle movements of

82
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
breathing

83
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
for

84
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160

for for

103
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:07,158
perhaps in these few minutes

104
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:15,039
left to sit meditating welcoming

105
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:23,200
all of who we are forgiving

106
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:33,960
everything putting down conflict and right and wrong and good and

107
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:41,600
bad success and failure just to sit here in a very

108
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,200
simple

109
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:53,960
way all things included as we

110
00:22:53,960 --> 00:23:00,440
breathe accompanying all things

111
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

112
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

113
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

114
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

115
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,278
e e

116
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:08,000
and then as we come to this end of this meditation to

117
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:14,480
consider how you are now after these minutes of sitting

118
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:21,880
meditating how is it that how you are now can help

119
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:30,240
you to have a more friendly caring attitude for other people

120
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:41,000
is there some way of being present for all of who you

121
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:48,159
are might from time to time give you the ability give you the

122
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:54,120
occasion to first and foremost be present for all of someone

123
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:59,480
else who they are before judgment before needing to

124
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,760
address issues but it take time to allow someone

125
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:10,399
to be themselves without us imposing any

126
00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:16,919
restrictions or judgments or requirements on

127
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:23,120
them maybe that's a gift that brings peace and well-being

128
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:30,080
and respect to others may it be that this meditation

129
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:38,159
practice we do allows us to enter into the world of

130
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,919
people with greater equinity and respect and

131
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:51,159
care maybe even reverence for the whole experience of

132
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:56,200
being human being that others

133
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:03,000
have the whole exper experience of this difficult and challenging human

134
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:12,799
life may we see people with care may all beings be

135
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:18,399
happy may all beings be

136
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:29,120
safe may all beings be peaceful and may all beings be free

137
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:40,579
[Music]

138
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:51,200
thank

139
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,080
you e

140
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:42,159
so hello everyone and welcome to Monday and the first talk in this

141
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:50,039
week's series and the topic for this week will be what's uh commonly referred

142
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:55,399
to as the eight uh worldly

143
00:29:55,399 --> 00:30:01,399
winds the eight conditions by which people people get caught by circumstances in the

144
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:10,440
world the winds that they can change and they blow this way and that way and we're battered around by them sometimes

145
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,960
um the victims of these in the way that because of how much we allow them to

146
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:22,960
take over or impact who we are and I in to introduce these first I

147
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,960
want to say that um it's common enough in Buddhism and meditation circles

148
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:37,080
to have some idea of uh an ideal state to attain ideal meditation to experience

149
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:43,960
where we're just kind of floating in equinity we're just kind of feeling so peaceful and at ease and everything

150
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:50,320
seems so nice and that that's the goal and if we're not there then we're not really

151
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:57,559
meditating properly and and you know so we have some fault but we have to kind of figure out the secret of how to get

152
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:05,279
into this kind of blissful State something something like that in contrast to that I think what

153
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:11,000
mature meditation is like mature mindfulness is not that we're living in

154
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:18,960
some kind of blissful State all the time when the practice really matures then there's a keen willingness

155
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,240
a keen interest a keen um

156
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:30,760
welcoming of taking a deep look at at what gets in the way of mindfulness what

157
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:36,080
makes mindfulness difficult what trips us up where we get

158
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:43,679
attached and one of the earliest teachings of the Buddha is that what characterizes a wise

159
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:50,279
person is um they know how they get caught they know understand and are

160
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:58,399
mindful of their clinging and and um and their their challenges

161
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:06,080
so isn't that a wise person knows how to be peaceful all the time but the wise person really understands all their

162
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:11,880
difficulties and that is the stepping stone to peace and we don't want to

163
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:17,960
bypass that or override it in order to find some degree of Peace but it's by

164
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:24,919
knowing ourselves thoroughly that we can come to a place of peace and knowing how we cling how we

165
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:32,279
get caught and so this is a phen phenomenally important part of Buddhist practice and uh there are some people

166
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:38,559
who prioritize the lofty ideas the wonderful ideas of Nirvana and freedom

167
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:45,440
and Liberation lofty ideas of compassion and loving kindness and all kinds of things

168
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,960
that are very you know ideals that are very positive and in doing so they

169
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,679
Overlook the basic foundational work of Buddhism which everyone needs to do

170
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:01,720
including the the most mature practitioners and that

171
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:07,880
is to kind of take it really understand themselves really understand how we get

172
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:14,919
caught how we're not peaceful how we're not equanimous how we're not loving and

173
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:23,120
generous not to understand it with criticism not to understand it with it that makes us a wrong person but rather

174
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:28,159
this is the means the ways of opening up more it's a stepping stone to free is

175
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:34,600
stepping stone to not being caught and the way not to be caught is to

176
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:41,840
understand how we get caught first so there's this deep work that has to happen and not a bypass it's not jumping

177
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:48,760
over it's not finding some wonderful solution so we never have to address any of our

178
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:55,279
issues and um so

179
00:33:56,279 --> 00:34:01,399
um so the uh these eight worldly winds are

180
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:10,520
examples of how human beings often get caught and um so there are there there

181
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:16,960
four pairs gain and loss Fame

182
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,520
and disgrace or fame and disrepute and

183
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,760
um blame and praise

184
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:38,800
and p uh Pleasure and Pain so gain and

185
00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:47,358
loss praise and fame and disgrace then blame and praise they're different and

186
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:56,000
pain and pleasure pleasure and pain so uh the first one is gain and

187
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,640
loss uh the the weather changes all the time when I lived in Tennessee their

188
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:07,960
saying was if you don't like the weather then um wait five minutes the weather

189
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:14,440
changes and moves and it's this way and that way and um we for a little while we

190
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:20,680
gain the Sun and then the Sun goes um uh the party is washed out in

191
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:27,800
the rain and then um but then something else happens and so there's a gain in

192
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:34,880
loss all the time uh we gain something new we buy a new thing we new socks soon

193
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,000
enough the socks are old and they have holes in them uh soon enough we lose one

194
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,359
of the socks socks in the washing machine and we now we only have one of the

195
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:51,359
pair these silly little examples though uh get magnified in all kinds of ways

196
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:57,240
that we gain and lose gain and lose abilities we gain and abilities as we

197
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:04,880
grow and we're young and then as we get older uh there's may be more recognition of losing certain things and abilities

198
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,160
there is uh gaining wealth and losing wealth I've known plenty of people who

199
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,240
have um overnight in a day uh somehow or

200
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:21,160
other uh lost much of their savings and I've known people who were surprised by

201
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:27,280
suddenly receiving something that they hadn't expected um I knew one person who wanted

202
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,960
to go to college didn't have the money and then was suddenly surprised one day that

203
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:40,240
there was Anonymous donation that made the college possible and uh so gain and loss that's

204
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,680
built into human life and um and so how

205
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:51,160
do we relate to those when they come and certainly there can be Mita

206
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:59,560
some Joy some Delight that healthy gain and there could be some disappointment with loss but as a worldly wind it means

207
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:05,000
our inner stability our inner Freedom our inner kind of certain kind of Peace

208
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:12,400
uh is um uh is sacrificed uh in our relationship to them and the way the Buddha talked about

209
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:19,560
it is that um uh when there's gain we get caught in

210
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:25,079
welcoming it and approving it and validating it and when there's loss

211
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:30,240
there's hostility to the loss there's 's opposition to it one translator calls it

212
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:37,680
there's a rebelliousness to it and um so uh so there's an attitude there's

213
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,079
a way in which we then interact that's more than just a very simple

214
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:49,280
appreciation or very simple maybe um feeling of that that was

215
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,920
unfortunate but but we're actively involved in approving welcoming this is

216
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:03,839
great I really like this and this holding on to it maybe building up a sense of self maybe um uh almost

217
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:11,040
sometimes it's almost like a drug we G gained something and we're pumped up in some kind of way WI a lottery ticket

218
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,400
with lots of money and now we're all excited and elated and and we can't wait

219
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:22,880
to start buying everything we want to buy and then the next day we find out there was a mistake and our number

220
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:28,119
didn't win the lottery and and now suddenly we crash and we've not only

221
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:34,599
that but during the 24 hours there we've spent our savings because we thought we were getting more and now we've lost our

222
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:40,599
savings because of it then now we crash and are disappointed and and um and uh

223
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:48,079
Furious and angry with ourselves and and so we swing from one to the other and

224
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:53,240
it's just swinging and uh and uh back and forth

225
00:38:53,240 --> 00:39:00,079
almost sometimes as a counter reaction to each other backlash swinging one having our hopes up swing the other

226
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:07,640
direction and having our hopes crash around uh loss gain and

227
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:14,920
loss and um so part of a wise life a Buddhist wise Buddhist life is to be

228
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:20,319
cognizant to recognize clearly as it happens through the day now there's a

229
00:39:20,319 --> 00:39:25,440
gain now there's a loss and um and then

230
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,839
what is our relationship how does that affect us have we is the wind of gain

231
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:36,359
the wind of loss um pushing us and grabbing us and we're kind of riding the

232
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:44,240
wind or being pushed by the wind or are we being reactive in some way are we overreactive are we um is there an

233
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:51,560
enthusiasm and an approval and a welcoming that it's a form of attachment and expectation and thinking it's always

234
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:57,880
going to be this way or um and when there's a loss uh are we

235
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:03,000
disappointed in some deep way do we sink are we deflated uh do we think now it's

236
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,640
going to be this way and are we angry do we have sense of hostility this is not

237
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:15,920
fair this is not this way and you know and um and so the pendulum swings and

238
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:23,079
some people the pendulum swings with every gain and loss and um and in fact

239
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:29,359
uh it's almost because the pendulum is in one direction that the other it swings as far as it does in the other

240
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:35,119
direction if we're really feeling delighted and fantastic about the gain

241
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:40,560
um maybe how lated we are around the lottery um then we have further to

242
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:47,400
swing uh when with when we realize we didn't lose the lottery and the sense of disappointment is so much

243
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:56,119
more and um and is there a different way is there a way of recognizing in a wise

244
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:04,599
way in a careful way in a caring way this is loss this is gain this is nice this is

245
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:13,480
not so nice but let's not invest so much into it let's not uh uh tie ourselves to

246
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:18,839
gain and loss and so in his teachings about these four World these eight

247
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:26,560
worldly wins the Buddha said that someone who is well practiced that they are ready to see

248
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:35,280
when there's gain that that is also changeable that also is impermanent Inc constant changing

249
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:42,000
when there's loss that's also in some way or other it changes it'll change

250
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,160
it's in constant my experience of it is in constant I'm in constant things will

251
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:53,599
change it's not going to be only lost forever something different happens and

252
00:41:53,599 --> 00:42:00,560
this idea of the changeability of our experience in our life for the Buddha uh helps with a certain degree of stability

253
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:05,640
certain degree of not getting invested in the pendulum swinging to one extreme

254
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:13,280
or the other and in doing so rather than dampening some dampening us down it

255
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:19,000
makes room for a deeper sense of well-being a deeper sense of stability

256
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:24,280
and feeling at home feeling at peace that is has more to do with our

257
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:30,880
wholeness our fullness our deep inner connection to ourselves that we don't

258
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:38,040
have when our sense of happiness and sadness is tied to gain and loss in the

259
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:43,480
world to things that gain and lo we gain and lose as opposed to some deep inner

260
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:49,839
place that is not about gain and loss but about a sense of at heness peace

261
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:55,559
stability here with ourselves that is something that over

262
00:42:55,559 --> 00:43:01,599
time that medit meditation can connect us too and the stability the calm the

263
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:08,240
Peace of meditation can feel so much more satisfying than winning the lottery

264
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:13,640
um in fact so much so that we win the lottery the attitude might be well let's

265
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:19,640
see what happens this is maybe nice maybe not we don't know let's see what happens

266
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:26,240
now or if we uh lose our sock who knows what'll

267
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:33,960
happen or something more are serious maybe we'll see what happens maybe this is not so good maybe it's not

268
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:39,520
um but let's just see let's see what happens next we don't know what this is

269
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:47,400
going to go to so the first of the eight worldly wins is gain and loss and now if this

270
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:54,640
seems at all interesting for you you might go through the day today for the next 24 hours looking to

271
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:02,480
see where there might be uh gain and loss um through the day that will teach

272
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:08,720
you about how you your pendulum swings more than necessary how you react how

273
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:14,640
you get caught in it and get attached how you're uh overly welcoming overing

274
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:22,200
approval of a certain gain and overly critical OPP oppositional even hostile

275
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:27,920
to certain loss so um please do this with care and

276
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:33,920
respect for yourself and uh human life is difficult and we want to find our way

277
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:41,359
through this with Grace so thank you very much
