1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,759
so good morning and welcome or good

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:13,240
day and um so the theme overall for these beginning of the year is

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:19,640
samadi the practice of samadi the experience of

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:27,640
somebody and um this first week setting the

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:35,120
foundation for exploring this and for this fifth day last day of

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,960
the week as a foundation or background or context for practicing

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:48,000
somebody is Compassion Care anampa

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,520
karuna meta mudita that all the different care

9
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:02,079
giving care feeling feelings that we are capable of

10
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:08,040
is the context for samadi that the purpose of samadi is not

11
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:14,000
for its own sake is not to have some wonderful good experience uh just for

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,240
its own purpose certainly it's invaluable to some of the experience of samadi that can occur but uh the purpose

13
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:30,240
of samadi is not for its own experiences but rather to

14
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:38,240
be able to meet the suffering of the world our own suffering and care for it in a profound

15
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:45,960
and effective way to care for it not with our reactivity but to care for it uh where

16
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,040
we meet it with um the place deep inside

17
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,479
where the heart can be open enough to hold the whole

18
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:03,200
world the place of stability and steadiness where love can gaze

19
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,920
Upon Our Own Suffering The Suffering of others and care about it to offer it a k

20
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:18,599
a tender love to offer it um um The Gaze upon it as something that

21
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,800
deserves our respect our care our love

22
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,080
our just like if you encountered a child

23
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:35,879
who was injured maybe a very young child or an animal or a friend or an

24
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:41,879
elder you would offer your heart to them you would

25
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:46,920
stop and and uh care and maybe at first you

26
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:54,480
wouldn't do anything uh you just let them know that there's someone here who cares and is holding them and holding

27
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,840
the context of their challenge to accompany them they're not

28
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,319
not alone so we have this profound

29
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:11,440
capacity in our hearts maybe deeper than our hearts within us

30
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,280
to have a care for the world and a care for

31
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:24,599
ourselves and samadi the context for that for samadi is to practice

32
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:31,439
somebody out of that care with that care for the purpose of that care

33
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:39,480
and uh and to not lose sight of that is um uh will make the whole

34
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:46,239
practice of zadi more meaningful more satisfying more

35
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:53,280
inspiring and more transformative so as we sit

36
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:01,200
today to experiment with what it's like to sit

37
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:08,040
with a kind of deep care for yourself where you are

38
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,400
accompanying yourself with love accompanying yourself with compassion

39
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:21,600
kindness friendliness and all these words can be a high high standard to measure Yourself

40
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:30,320
by maybe you can meet yourself with respect samadi is a i is a

41
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:39,320
sacred in a sense it's a area of reverence at least for me and so can be your experience of

42
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:45,360
yourself the attitude toward yourself that a certain reverence and

43
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,880
respect a sacredness of holding all of who you

44
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,240
are including whatever is challenging so this is a context for

45
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:05,639
somat so to begin this meditation practice to gently close your eyes or

46
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,680
lower the Gaze if you want to keep them

47
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:19,520
open and to appreciate that however you are in this

48
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,919
present moment in your body in your mind in your

49
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,639
heart with the challenges of your life

50
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:42,120
that here in meditation that you've come to hold it in

51
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,080
care to accompany it with

52
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:55,720
care to begin by not trying to fix it or judge it or be overwhelmed by it if

53
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:05,280
possible but rather to assume that a deliberate posture of care

54
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:12,160
attention of accompanyment and for some

55
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:19,720
people the deliberate posture of meditation helps us to step out of

56
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:26,680
our normal states of mind so we can better accompany what is

57
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,680
here

58
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,680
and the same with breathing to begin maybe if you hav't a

59
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,319
shift of attitude where the Deep taking a deeper

60
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:54,080
few breaths is done in a way that you care for

61
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:00,240
yourself you want well for yourself as you supply

62
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,680
fly oxygen

63
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,560
presence and relaxation

64
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:22,800
calm into your system taking some long slow deeper

65
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:29,560
breaths and relaxing with the exhale

66
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,479
and then returning to a normal

67
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,159
breathing and if there's some very simple ways you can adjust your normal

68
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:05,000
breath so it's more comfortable or

69
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:12,199
Pleasant so it's more sensitive to your Deeper

70
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:19,199
Life maybe you can exhale little just a little longer

71
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,520
than usual Maybe by letting go

72
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:44,080
maybe there's a greater stability in breathing if you relax your belly

73
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:18,120
maybe there's a feeling of welcoming the inhale

74
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:54,240
and then relaxing whatever is agitated or tense

75
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,800
in your body mind or heart

76
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:24,560
and whatever way that you're sitting here in meditation whatever Way You Are

77
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:36,880
can you imagine that there's a

78
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:47,079
wide field around you of care love

79
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:58,200
compassion that you're the radiance of your

80
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:06,880
care spreads wide enough so all of who you are occurs within it

81
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:44,360
and then then the center of it all Center of that Radiance of love or

82
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:53,920
care the center of your thoughts and your imagination of

83
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,240
love the center of it all for there to be breathing

84
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:19,720
and with the rhythm of breathing in and breathing

85
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:30,360
out is what massages care and compassion and love

86
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:37,120
is what

87
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:46,040
spreads a tenderness and a gentleness of

88
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,880
love into your meditation

89
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:10,040
and you might once in every cycle of breathing in and breathing out ever so

90
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:15,120
softly say to yourself a word of

91
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:21,639
care love or compassion

92
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:29,440
kindness or the word care itself say these words as a reminder her

93
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:37,959
to touch in to these feelings these

94
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:43,040
attitudes as you sit here with whatever is

95
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
happening

96
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

97
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

98
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
for

99
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920

100
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

101
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
for

102
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
for

103
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
for

104
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

105
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

106
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

107
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
for

108

e

109
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

110
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,559
for for

111
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:09,640
if you are a little calmer or more subtle than at the beginning of the

112
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:17,520
sitting see if you can find on the edges of your

113
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,559
calm edges of your subtleness

114
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:32,440
embodiment attitude or feeling of Compassion

115
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,639
Care a tender kindness

116
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:05,600
and then breathe into those edges breathe into those

117
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:17,440
attitudes maybe allowing it to be the flavor or the weather of

118
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
attention

119
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
for

120
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

121
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
for

122
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,320
for for

123
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,559
and then as we come to the end of this

124
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,799
sitting to take a two or three breaths

125
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,720
to gaze upon yourself in

126
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:41,799
appreciation no matter how challenging

127
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:47,760
or easy or meditation has been for

128
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:54,559
you it's a profound offer of care gift that you give

129

yourself to give yourself an attitude of respect an attitude of valuing

130
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,919
yourself enough to do this

131
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,960

you e

154
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:24,799
so welcome now to this fifth talk introductory talk to the

155
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:30,159
topic of Samari and and um this

156
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:35,600
uh experience the dedication the practice of

157
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:43,639
Samar lies at the heart of Buddhist Meditation practice and it's a integral to

158
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:50,799
both uh the development of deep concentration and to the development of

159
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:59,000
uh mindfulness itself Bas itself that uh um mindfulness and basana are not the

160
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:06,760
same thing mindfulness is a practice and vasana is a consequence of that practice

161
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:14,559
the word vipasa refers to the Deep insights liberating insights that can come when the practice of

162
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:22,200
mindfulness is conjoined is united with a strong stable

163
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:30,519
steady focused uh still attention when it's mind with

164
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:37,480
samadi and um so in the way the Buddha taught

165
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:46,120
samadi it's always um uh there's always preparation for it there's not a direct

166
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:52,279
frontal assault on somebody and um not a few people maybe

167
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:59,720
highly idealistic or will learn about meditation learn about samat and say by

168
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:06,320
golly I'm going to do this um there's a story of the kind of a

169
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:11,600
fable of a very capable young man who

170
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:17,279
success successful at school successful in sports successful in many different

171
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:22,679
areas of life very capable who for some reason decides to

172
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:28,919
address his suffering by going to a monastery to practice and he asked asks the Abbot

173
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:35,240
abbis you know it explains the abbis you know I'm quite dedicated I learn quickly

174
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:42,000
I'm skilled in uh in many things and I can really apply myself I have a a

175
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,799
dedication I have discipline and um if I come to the monastery to live here to practice how

176
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:55,880
long um will it take to um become enlightened and the abis says well

177
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:03,679
probably 10 years and that seems pretty long for him and he says no you don't understand I I can really give myself

178
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:09,358
wholeheartedly to it and apply all of myself to this and really do it fulltime

179
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:16,960
and how long will it take if all my capacities are engaged and she said oh in that case

180
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,560
it'll take 20 years so to uh have the wrong attitude

181
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:31,280
of dedic of of uh willfulness with some body which is not uncommon for people uh

182
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:37,320
is not the preparation that's needed and so uh this week has been

183
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:44,440
about some of the things we can do to prepare ourselves and they're all kind of a set

184
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:50,960
together and they kind of support each other these five qualities and

185
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,679
um so they don't they don't necessarily have to be in order but the first that

186
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:02,000
we gave was discovery that uh and this is why mindfulness is so

187
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:09,200
helpful that it it's so invaluable necessary for somebody to

188
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,640
know yourself well I've known people who have practiced concentration maybe

189
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:22,079
sometimes not even practicing it I've known people as uh young children who have had very very difficult lives maybe

190
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:30,880
with a lot of suffering maybe a lot of violence and the only the relief they could find was by somehow separating

191
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,400
themselves detaching um disassociating themselves from their ordinary life their ordinary

192
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:42,400
mind and had the ability to go into very deep states of

193
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:49,560
concentration and uh it gave them safety it gave them a place to go that was away from all the the challenges of their

194
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:57,040
ordinary daily life sometimes at home um and uh but they had never really

195
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:02,720
opened up to really experience and be associated with themselves be connected

196
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:08,240
and healed what was there and um and they come these kind

197
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,800
people who have this deep quick ability concentrated is often a sign that um

198
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,960
they don't they don't know themselves very well and for sombody not just

199
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:27,640
concentration somebody to really be effective the idea is that it needs to include everything and so discovering

200
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:34,079
who we are knowing who we are and as we practice new things will appear and

201
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:40,560
about ourselves and to welcome that oh this too needs to be included this too needs to be

202
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:47,520
known the second thing we talked I talked about was the very awareness the attention

203
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:54,079
that discovers and is present for things is to experiment so that attention is

204
00:36:54,079 --> 00:37:00,280
not there's no strain in it there's no forceful in it or willfulness to it that

205
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:05,960
there has a lightness to it that there's a feeling that attention is open maybe

206
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:12,880
receptive maybe accepting may be um available and non-c

207
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,920
contentious um that there's a light touch and of course that light

208
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:24,960
touch lightness of attention um makes it easier for thoughts to hijack attention

209
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:31,520
and to mind to wander away and so the art of of meditation practice is how to

210
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,079
have a deliberateness and attention uh inent

211
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:45,119
intentness for being attentive without having strain and that takes a while to learn

212
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:54,160
and one of the ways to learn it is to understand that we are when we're doing suade practice we are not consciously

213
00:37:54,160 --> 00:38:03,160
bringing all of our life with us even though we want to include all of who we are in it uh there's a a samade practice

214
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:08,640
is to enter into a Sacred Space a special

215
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:16,280
time where um uh you know you might go into a sacred place in nature a place a

216
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:23,240
Grove of trees where things are really peaceful and still meaningful uh feels like you you can

217
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:28,359
really relax and be whole and feel like you belong now to the world and there's

218
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:36,040
a quiet and peacefulness and you've left the World Behind but in that peacefulness all of

219
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:43,560
you can be there that's still there and so you can feel yourself and know yourself in a deeper and Fuller way that

220
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:48,720
if it bring with you all your preoccupations concerns desires fears

221
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:55,079
into samade so to have this light touch that doesn't wander off into thought there

222
00:38:55,079 --> 00:39:01,680
has to be an appreciation that this is is a distinct time and place and now to

223
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:07,200
be here in a different kind of sacred environment that is

224
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:13,400
meditation and to be somewhat deliberate about that so some people will bow some

225
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:19,280
people will light a candle light incense some people will put on a Shaw

226
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:26,400
meditation Shaw or some people have robes um some people uh close the door

227
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,920
lower lower the light or do something or some people like to meditate outdoors

228
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:37,240
and go someplace Outdoors under a tree do something that's intentional

229
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:43,800
that feels like now I'm going into a different time and place it's very valuable to go meditate

230
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:51,119
in the same place every day so the association with the place has to do with meditation so that deliberateness

231
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:58,200
that Association that familiarity kicks in when you're there

232
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:03,440
and then today to have compassion care

233
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,480
love and the whole uh uh family of

234
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:14,119
caregiving emotions that we have um is a

235
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:20,839
pallet that we can choose from some people uh experiences love different

236
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:27,520
ways some people for compassion is what's close at hand some people it's

237
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:34,280
friendliness and kindness some people it's a very simple feeling of care that

238
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:40,800
uh maybe wouldn't be called love but has a gentleness and a tenderness to it or a

239
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:48,119
warmth to it some people it is just the feeling of warmth loving

240
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:54,359
warmth all of them what they have in common is care is appreciation is a

241
00:40:54,359 --> 00:41:01,520
valuing and a respect for the object of that love that care and in

242
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:07,960
Samaria practice that can be for ourselves and to sit and have and create

243
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:13,040
an atmosphere and part of the intentional deliberateness of entering into the

244
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:19,520
world of somi that supports the lightness of awareness is to somehow

245
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:25,319
Infuse or connect that lightness of attention with something that's tender

246
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:31,400
and soft and warm that feels like maybe uh dropping into a

247
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:38,680
warm bath or uh on a cold day sitting in front of

248
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:46,040
a warm fire with a blanket over you something that kind of uh and there might be other examples

249
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:53,319
rather than mine that helps you feel like this is a special time for care for

250
00:41:53,319 --> 00:41:58,440
love for warmth so that that when we're

251
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:04,920
practicing samadi there's not a lot of greed and force there is not a lot of

252
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:10,520
disappointment and discouragement that it's not going well like we're not getting

253
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:19,480
concentrated um that's to get concentrated with samadi uh happens can happen without

254
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:26,040
concentrating in the normal kind of way it there can be a settling into a

255
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:34,800
center rather than focusing on a central point and sometimes um the movement

256
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,280
toward somebody is best approached kind of from the sides or

257
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:45,920
from the back not this frontal kind of this is what I'm going to do now and be

258
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:51,319
determined some people that works for very well but what I'm trying to

259
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:58,559
emphasize this week is to is to deliberately uh and if it this idea

260
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:03,839
works for you ritualistically like a ritual with a ritual to create the

261
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:12,119
conditions to focus on putting them into place and um and for today the last one

262
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:17,240
is to have compassion as part of it and that can be the overall

263
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:24,440
motivation for samadi practice that um subar practice as I've been saying is

264
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:30,359
not for its own sake but really the purpose that Buddha offered samadi is so

265
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:37,440
that we can see things as they are clearly with care with love with

266
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:45,800
compassion um so we can become free of our suffering so that we can enter the world

267
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:53,240
live this world um free of suffering free of clinging free of distress free

268
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:58,599
of anxiety we can live stable

269
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:05,599
strong settled peaceful with a Clarity of

270
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:12,839
purpose that we can meet the suffering of the world we can live a meaningful

271
00:44:12,839 --> 00:44:18,960
life so um so the purpose of

272
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:25,119
samadi uh points back to how useful it is to

273
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:31,359
prepare for samadi if the purpose of somadi is to be free of suffering and to

274
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:38,920
awaken a care for the world then the preparation for it is uh

275
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:47,800
to begin with care to begin with compassion as a context for doing this

276
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:55,200
practice so thank you very much and uh we'll continue this for number of

277
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:02,920
weeks that I'm here and so next week I'll be back and we'll continue thank you
