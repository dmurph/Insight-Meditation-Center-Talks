1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,160
so hello folks very happy to be here and

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,160
welcome to this meditation session and uh

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,880
this will be the last uh morning for a while perhaps to being here at irc the insight retreat center

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:28,640
and [Music] it's been nice to be here in this wonderful meditation hall

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,800
some of you have been here and maybe some of you will be here one day and i look forward to the chance to welcome

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,960
you welcoming you here in this wonderful place

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,520
so

8
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,320
yesterday i discussed um

9
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,320
that one can use posture as a reference point for the state of mind

10
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:11,840
for the attitudes that we have get expressed in our posture and uh so attending to posture and

11
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,080
having a reference point of a upright posture can indicate when we

12
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:25,759
lose that and then we can look at why and what's happening inside the other direction works as well

13
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,040
in a sense that we can assume certain postures

14
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,119
and and that can be a reference point for the attitude for the mind

15
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,320
our minds can change to a certain degree by the postures we take

16
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,840
and so the

17
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,438
the image of the buddha meditating like we have here in the altar

18
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,880
is a wonderful example of a balanced posture

19
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,079
that balances of attitude of confidence

20
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:11,039
and calm confidence and trust perhaps

21
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,720
and and you might find it interesting to

22
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,480
when you meditate to assume a posture of confidence

23
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:31,920
and maybe a posture that expresses manifests a certain degree of strength

24
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,200
and which is not going to be energetic in a way that's tense

25
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,440
and which will also allow you to become

26
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:52,480
and i think that confidence sometimes is a underappreciated

27
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,760
quality and that more confidence can be

28
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,920
available to us than we maybe can access through the

29
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:12,159
mind and one way is to do it physically physical posture of uprightness

30
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,760
of and i suspect every posture

31
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,360
there's possible to find a way of being that somehow feels

32
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,959
like he now this this holds my confidence or expresses confidence

33
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:35,440
and if i don't feel confident sometimes

34
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:42,959
the mind is influenced by the body and so if the body takes a

35
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,360
confident posture maybe something begins shifting inside

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,480
so assuming taking entering into a posture

37
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,239
for meditation and perhaps for today you can

38
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:08,239
see if you can take a posture that expresses some physical

39
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,200
strength or confidence

40
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,880
maybe by opening up the chest a bit more

41
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,560
ever so slightly bringing in the spine between the shoulder blades that

42
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,600
also bring opens up expands the chest a little bit

43
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,199
maybe your head can be a little bit more confident

44
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:48,320
maybe regal straightening out the neck

45
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,919
maybe lifting the head up there's a when i

46
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,280
first started doing meditation the instructions were to imagine a string

47
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:10,440
from the back top of the head lifting the head up towards the ceiling

48
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,000
and then to gently maybe confidently

49
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,639
close your eyes

50
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,639
and as if you are filling your body with strength

51
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:49,360
or confidence on the inhale and relaxing on the exhale

52
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,759
take a few long slow deep breaths

53
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,840
taking in some deeper breaths than usual

54
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,599
almost as if you're claiming your right to be here and now

55
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,478
maybe a kind of regal

56
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,120
right or place

57
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,680
and then letting your breathing return to normal

58
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,400
and if you have taken some brought in some confidence to your

59
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:14,720
posture does that have any influence

60
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:23,039
on how you're aware of breathing and how you're aware of

61
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,160
the experience of the body breathing

62
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:58,440
with a normal breath breathing normally on the inhale gently

63
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:05,360
filling yourself with some degree of confidence and strength

64
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:12,039
confidence in the value of being present here and now

65
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:21,840
and then the exhale relax soften

66
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,599
holding tension in your body

67
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:41,159
as you exhale perhaps letting anxiety melt away

68
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,320
and then simplifying

69
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:41,279
yourself to settling into the rhythm of the body breathing

70
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,920
breathing

71
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:03,800
that comes with the support of a confident body

72
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:31,840
one of the words for confidence in nepali language

73
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:39,679
is pasada which also means

74
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:46,640
bright kind of like luminously bright

75
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:54,640
also means peaceful serene calm

76
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:04,960
and what kind of confidence strong confidence

77
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:11,679
even unshakable confidence might you have

78
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:22,240
that also has qualities of peacefulness and clarity as part of it

79
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,158
a peaceful confidence

80
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:39,120
and if you imagine yourself having

81
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,720
some form of peaceful confidence

82
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:51,200
and that that peaceful confidence was the [Music] channel

83
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:58,440
for your love for your career

84
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:04,158
for your good will for the world

85
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,919
what would your love be like

86
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,840
radiating from such a confidence

87
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:25,720
may whatever confidence and strength we've developed through this practice

88
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:31,279
it be supportive

89
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:39,960
may it be channeled and used for the welfare and happiness of others

90
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:47,679
may we live benefiting this world

91
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,640
may all beings be happy

92
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:01,600
may all beings inhabit their natural strength

93
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,960
may all beings

94
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,399
be safe partly as a

95
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:20,520
outgrowth of their confidence

96
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,640
may all beings be peaceful

97
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:33,080
because they walk through the world confidently

98
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:42,640
may all beings be free confident in the value

99
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:51,399
of non-clinging may all beings be happy

100
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,919
so thank you

101
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:23,679
so today we're going to begin discussion of the third exercise

102
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:30,799
in the satipatana sutta the discourse on the four foundations for mindfulness

103
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:36,880
for awareness and now one way of reading this text is

104
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:43,679
that these first four ex first three exercises are kind of progressive

105
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:50,440
that one can lead to the other and so the first one is

106
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:57,120
[Music] meditation practice meditation practice centered on breathing

107
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:04,960
and as we get focused concentrated settled here in our breathing calm settled very present

108
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:10,320
we bring that calm presence with us into our activities

109
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,760
and the simplest way is to then also know our postures we stand we know we're

110
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,398
standing as we walk we know we're walking and so forth

111
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:27,519
as uh if we can stay mindful and present kind of inhabiting awareness as we go

112
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:35,279
through just to begin our activities out after meditation then there's a other things and we do

113
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:41,279
things only half attention or quarter attention to the activity that we do there's a

114
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:46,480
delightful kind of calm presence for the activity

115
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:52,399
maybe in such a degree that it's actually enjoyable to just be there and feel and experience the simplicity of

116
00:33:52,399 --> 00:34:00,399
what we're doing and that uh it's actually more enlivening more rich more beneficial

117
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:05,600
than the alternative wandering often thought

118
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,118
and concerns with the activities of the day and

119
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:16,720
then we do our things better when we have that kind of presence and attention

120
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,679
so um i'll read you the passage

121
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:30,679
the exercise it's a one of the longer ones but uh

122
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:46,079
a practitioner is one who acts in full awareness

123
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:52,878
when going forward and returning when looking ahead and looking away

124
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:58,079
who acts in full awareness when flexing and extending the limbs

125
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:03,359
who acts in full awareness when wearing their robes

126
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:09,440
and carrying their outer robe and bowl this is referring to monastics so

127
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,440
it applies to us but not with the same

128
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:22,400
who acts uh in full awareness when eating drinking consuming food and tasting

129
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,800
who acts in full awareness when defecating and urinating who acts in full awareness when walking

130
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:34,320
standing sitting falling asleep waking up

131
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:41,119
talking and keeping silent so these are all ordinary daily

132
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:48,880
activities that many people do and here it uses the word full awareness

133
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,160
the word is some pajana and it's um

134
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,760
and the and exactly what it means i love this

135
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:05,839
translation where it says full awareness i love the i'm not completely sure what it means i

136
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:12,960
have a good sense from my own experience but i just love the feeling of fullness of awareness that as we go through our

137
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:19,280
lives and what we do the tradition understands it as being

138
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,400
a fuller understanding of what we're doing

139
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,520
so as we you know come out of meditation and start doing the activities we're

140
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:35,119
doing um we're aware of more

141
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:41,359
than just the activity itself so if we're doing walking meditation we're

142
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:47,520
just settling in and doing walking and that's all we're doing but if we're walking to our kitchen

143
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:53,920
we know we're going to our kitchen as well it's not just walking there's also the knowing of going to the kitchen

144
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,119
if we're reaching for a cup to have tea

145
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:06,400
we know that we're reaching the cup in order to have tea for the purpose of having tea

146
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:12,880
if we are uh you know reaching for the faucet to put

147
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:19,119
water in the tea kettle we have a sense that we're doing this for a purpose for

148
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:25,680
both to have water come out to fill the kettle to make tea because it's you know

149
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:31,520
thirsty and it's good to be hydrated so there's so this starts to be it

150
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:38,720
the in the immediacy there's a number of things that are clear the purpose of why we're doing it the

151
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:44,160
context in which we do things we walk into some place

152
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:50,800
and we're going to walk through the room but we know there are other people in the room it's not just walking as if

153
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,920
that's all that's going on we take into account the context of the people maybe we take

154
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:01,760
we walk around them rather than walking through them or expect them to move

155
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:07,359
so this full awareness takes in much more in

156
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:12,480
and and so here we're beginning to use a little bit more of the intelligence of

157
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:18,880
the mind it's not uh we're not using our intelligence to fantasize

158
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:26,640
about tomorrow or get lost in fantasy and thoughts about something or other as we do it

159
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:32,480
as we reaching for the faucet we know we're doing it we have someone asked us about it later

160
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:38,880
but we're not really present it's not their full awareness of the activity and the context and the

161
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:46,240
purpose we are um you know already started thinking about

162
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:52,960
i don't know um can't wait for lunch and i wonder what we should have for lunch and we haven't

163
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:58,400
even had breakfast so um so

164
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,599
here this is this exercise now is a call to bring our mindfulness into our daily

165
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:10,240
activities into all our activities and i love it ends with both talking

166
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:16,800
and remaining silent and putting them both in the same level of importance

167
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,480
um and to have a full awareness to know when we're talking to know that

168
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:28,560
why we're talking to know the context for why we're talking and the same for silence

169
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:35,838
to know why we're silent the context for the purpose of silence the context of it the appropriateness of it

170
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:42,640
the the tradition also says that this full awareness

171
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,319
also means that one knows

172
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:57,200
in what part of ourselves we stay grounded in as we do the activity

173
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:04,960
that we stay explicitly says we stay connected to the four foundations for mindfulness

174
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,560
so sometimes we know we enter into the world of the activity very much with our

175
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:17,200
bodies some of these these activities are physical sometimes we

176
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:23,440
we're we're present for our mind states the quality of our mind sometimes we're aware of the feeling

177
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:29,920
tone sometimes they the mental processes involved so these are all kind of the mental the exercises

178
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,680
we'll be talking about as we go through this suta but

179
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,720
but it's uh to really practice mindfulness with all these different aspects of ourselves

180
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:46,720
mindfulness that keeps us here rooted in the present moment grounded in the present

181
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:53,520
and capable of taking in this fuller context purpose values of what we're doing the

182
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,440
impact of what we're doing the influence on what's happening influence on us

183
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:05,359
in what we're doing so it's one thing to walk and be aware that we're walking it's

184
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:11,200
another thing to feel that we're walking in such a hurry that we're getting tense

185
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,240
and so full awareness would notice that tension or walking in a way that feels

186
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:21,280
nourishing that feels delightful and feel satisfying to walk

187
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:27,680
and then we walk with that satisfaction and feel that and um

188
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:33,119
so the um mindfulness so one way of understanding

189
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:38,720
this it's mindfulness inactivity it's very common among english

190
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:45,200
practitioner english speaking practitioners to refer to mindfulness in daily life

191
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:52,560
which is a great top great concept however it's very abstract daily life just means too much

192
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,599
for the buddha was always kind of more concrete more specific

193
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:03,839
something more tangible and so here it's mindfulness and action

194
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,119
and and and to infuse our activity

195
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:14,480
with awareness with attention and and it isn't so much that we have to think

196
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:20,319
actively about the context think about the purpose but it's one kind of a a

197
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:25,920
relaxed open awareness that that's taken into account that scene

198
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:32,160
that's understood that arises as well it's a rich world

199
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:40,160
so the activities that i just read are generally pretty simple ones uh eating and defecating and urinating

200
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:47,760
and and extending your arm and doing these different activities

201
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:53,200
um falling asleep waking up

202
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:59,839
you might uh in over this weekend look for simple activities

203
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:05,839
that you do that you can try to do or practice full awareness with

204
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:12,560
full understanding of what's happening there as you do it and not searching and analyzing for that

205
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:18,960
but is there some way of being really present for the activity you're doing

206
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:24,880
that there's a clear knowing of the context of the purpose

207
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:30,800
of the influence it has on you and because you're so present for it

208
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,880
but your system is taking that in is registering that and knowing that as part of the

209
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:43,760
full picture of your present moment experience abiding in the present moment

210
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,680
calm and confident available to take in the full picture

211
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:55,920
of the fuller picture of what the activity is about and how it's going

212
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:03,440
so to choose a few activities through the day maybe washing dishes or sweeping the floor or

213
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:10,240
driving or you know different something simple that you can practice and experiment with this

214
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:15,839
as so that the this mindfulness awareness can begin growing and

215
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:23,040
expanding and spreading into more of your life so thank you

216
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:30,280
very much and i'll see you back at imc on monday
