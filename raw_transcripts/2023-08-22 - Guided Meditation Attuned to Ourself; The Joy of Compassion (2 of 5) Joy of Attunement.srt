1
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:06,440
so good morning everyone and uh or good

2
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:16,160
day nice to have the idea that I'm saying hello and greetings around the

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:23,640
world and uh was a time when that couldn't be

4
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:31,960
done so

5
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,440
so I want to begin by saying

6
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,120
that when we give mindfulness instructions or try to practice

7
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:56,160
mindfulness that often people will try too

8
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,239
much uh it's like you try now to make your mind mind be present or focus on

9
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:10,600
the breath or do something like that and the mind wanders off and we bring the Mind back and bring my mind back and I'm

10
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,280
and that can be done in a beautiful way harmonious way but often there's uh

11
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:23,200
there can be a strain or a push or a uh you know an effort to be

12
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:32,799
mindful and uh there are other exercises that uh might evoke a more harmonious

13
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,840
form of mindfulness a mindfulness that follows along and is there kind of as a

14
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:46,079
support just comes along um and it isn't that we're emphasizing mindfulness but

15
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,719
mindfulness is there it has to be there in other ways of

16
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:58,840
being and the one what I want to emphasize today is atunement and there's a practice of

17
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,920
becoming attuned to our life to our experience but for

18
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:11,440
this morning in meditation I'd like to emphasize Attunement to

19
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,760
U oneself we sit down to be present for

20
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:23,959
ourselves with ourselves by ourselves uh to become attuned here to

21
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:29,239
what's going on for us and there are some definitions of

22
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:34,920
Attunement and

23
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,640
um the uh the ones

24
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,400
that so there are some definitions of Attunement and ones that I like are to

25
00:02:51,400 --> 00:03:00,120
be ready and res aware and receptive to be aware and receptive to

26
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:06,799
be receptively to be just to be receptive requires awareness and to be in

27
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:14,239
harmony with what you're receptive to or what you're aware of and um and this idea of Harmony is

28
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,280
what I want to emphasize today because Harmony means we're no longer in

29
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,519
conflict with anything We're In Harmony with it even if we have to say no to

30
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:30,760
something um there's a harmonious way of doing that that we're not setting up the tension

31
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,439
of oppos tense opposition or uh or

32
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:44,159
contracted kind of uh um disagreement with something or

33
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,840
criticism of something and um we're we're receptive

34
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:57,200
so especially when we're sitting here meditating with ourselves is there way of being receptive to all of who we are

35
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,239
and to not be in conflict with anything and to find what does it mean to have

36
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:09,799
the question what does it mean to be in harmony with this it does not mean giving into

37
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:18,959
anything there's a wisdom factor that comes into play that oh I'm in harmony with this by not interfering with it

38
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,360
without getting involved in it without pushing it away letting it kind of take

39
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,720
its course to be in harmony to with uh the

40
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,320
natural world to be in harmony with our natural world within ourselves and if we do that then

41
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:41,000
mindfulness will follow there has to be awareness if we're asking how to be

42
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,600
receptive and in Harmony and uh in this absence of

43
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:53,880
conflict absence of strain is one of the things that brings joy to meditation

44
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,960
practice and the joy of Attunement the joy of finding harmony with what's here

45
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:08,240
now and um so we we'll meditate

46
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,840
to find a harmonious posture for

47
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:25,039
yourself a posture that's harmonious with finding a greater

48
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:31,479
harmony with ourselves a greater alignment a greater

49
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:38,560
Attunement a greater non-interference to

50
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,199
the aliveness that can be here

51
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:51,360
within sometimes if we take too relaxed a posture it might feel

52
00:05:51,360 --> 00:06:01,479
comfortable but it might not allow for the free harmonious flow of

53
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:17,639
vitality and aliveness and it

54
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:30,280
gently relax your eyes whether they're closed or open

55
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,840
maybe letting the your eyes rest in their

56
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:48,000
sockets resting the eyes so there's no effort to to look at

57
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,319
anything if the eyes are open a

58
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:02,199
focus it's not that's soft and wide

59
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,759
and not trying to see

60
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:23,599
anything and to take a few long slow deep breaths with the

61
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:30,360
inhale just getting to know discovering

62
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,960
what reveals itself in the

63
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:51,280
body feeling the body more fully on the inhale and in the longer

64
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,720
exhale settling in to this body

65
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
relaxing

66
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:21,879
letting your breathing return to normal and a lot of the information we

67
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:31,240
need to find in Attunement to ourselves is found in our body

68
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:45,399
to be receptive and [Music] aware of how the body

69
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,880
is maybe not needing it to be any other

70
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:04,399
way but in the Attunement to how the body

71
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:12,079
is a gentle but greater sensitivity

72
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:17,519
receptivity to whatever Sensations exist in the

73
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,120
body not prioritizing any one set of Sensations

74
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,800
or but tuning on ourselves to the global

75
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,200
experience of being in a

76
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,720
body and to to be attuned is to be aware without

77
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,399
strain tightness

78
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:22,160
contraction even if there is strain or contraction there's an art of Attunement

79
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:31,040
to that as you would be attuned to a friend

80
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:38,040
may be in a difficult State being present and open

81
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:44,160
and maybe you're a calm presence in harmony with your

82
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,160
friend

83
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
attuned

84
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,720
and within this body as part of the

85
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,760
body there's the experience of

86
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:30,959
breathing not focusing on the breath or but rather to be receptive

87
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,200
attuned to how the breathing is breathing

88
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:46,120
itself or how it's breathing with strain or

89
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:01,839
effort finding a way of relating of no knowing the

90
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:08,200
breathing that feels in harmony with it or feels ATT tune to how it

91
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,160
is an Attunement that allows for a

92
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
care

93
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
for

94
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
e

95
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
e

96
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
for

97
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
for

98
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:43,399
not trying to change anything in meditation but instead

99
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:51,519
to be attuned to ourselves in the present

100
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,839
moment as we

101
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,880
are a kind of deep

102
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:07,680
listening deep

103
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,800
sensitivity that is not in conflict with

104
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:20,000
anything but instead

105
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:30,519
available to know it to sense it as it is

106
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
for

107
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
for

108
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
for

109
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
for

110
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
for

111
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
e

112
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
for

113
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
for

114
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:41,559
to be attuned to oneself as one

115
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:48,200
meditates so one is not in conflict with

116
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:57,039
anything but rather aware receptive

117
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
attentive

118
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:13,360
harmoniously appreciating whatever degree of non-conflict you

119
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:21,440
have sitting here in the middle of your lived

120
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
life

121
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
for

122
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
for

123
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:08,360
and notice if there's any Joy

124
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:16,720
or well-being found within whatever

125
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:23,278
Attunement you might have with yourself sitting here meditating

126
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
here

127
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
e

128
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
e

129
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:39,360
and as we come to the end of this

130
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:48,880
meditation the more we are ATT tuned to ourselves the more we're not

131
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:55,640
divided from ourselves with inner conflict the greater can be our

132
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:03,278
Attention our awareness of others our receptivity and

133
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:11,360
sensitivity so we could also find a way of being attuned to how they

134
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,000
are tuned

135
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:25,360
in understanding sensitive to the state of others without

136
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,240
conflict and without

137
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:36,360
assertion without an overlay of interpretations

138
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,840
and

139
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,480
meaning many people value being listened

140
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:03,200
to and Attunement is is just a expansion of

141
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:11,278
listening to our whole being listening or

142
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:21,480
present may we find ways to be deeply

143
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:28,440
attuned to others so they feel respect did and

144
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,679
cared for and recognized they don't so they don't feel

145
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:43,279
judged or criticized or belittled or used for our own

146
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,799
purposes May our meditation

147
00:27:53,919 --> 00:28:02,039
practice be a support for promoting the welfare and happiness

148
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:08,639
of this world may all beings be

149
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:14,000
happy may all beings be

150
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,919
safe may all beings be

151
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,080
peaceful and may all beings be

152
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
free

153
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:40,309
[Music]

154
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:47,980
thank [Music]

155
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,399
you

156
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:14,960
so so hello and welcome to this second talk on the joy of

157
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,080
compassion and I think this is a very important concept that can there can be

158
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:27,960
joy and compassion and to keep this as a reference point for our compassion

159
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:36,799
is is a protection from The Compassion becoming uh tense or strain full or

160
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:42,519
oppressive or exhausting um it's can be difficult to

161
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:48,000
be present for suffering in oneself and suffering for others and part of the

162
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,880
medicine for suffering is compassionate presence care and for that to be healthy for

163
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,399
everyone involved um it has to avoid tension and

164
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:06,159
strain and assertion and collapse and the kind of way of being that is not

165
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:13,559
sustainable because there's exhaustion or and um and so there just the very

166
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:19,919
idea that there's joy or well-being in the experience of compassion puts a

167
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:28,000
question mark next to any other way that we are any strain full or difficult way that we are when we have compassion

168
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,080
and I'd like to believe that the notion of Joy it get of compassion uh

169
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:40,720
encourages us to slow down with our compassion to not be in a hurry to act

170
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:48,080
but rather to take the time to find a healthy way of relating to the suffering

171
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:53,559
of others suffering of the world and one of those ways is to be

172
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:58,600
attuned to find a way to certainly be aware aware of

173
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,799
it and but not just to be aware of it to have a certain kind of openness or

174
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:10,320
receptivity to receive it just as like we would be receptive to rece uh

175
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:17,559
receptive listener to hear a friend of ours talk about their challenges uh the friend doesn't feel

176
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:23,200
that we are you know we're reluctantly listening listening or half-heartedly

177
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,279
listening or or somehow listening in a judgmental

178
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:34,760
way and but we're just listening receptive and aware so in in the same

179
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:41,279
way uh we we attune ourselves to the suffering of the world before we act

180
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:47,559
before we rush to to do something and because that

181
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:54,880
atunement is uh an absence of strain an absence of assertion an absence of

182
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,919
conflict with ourselves or for the others um there can be Joy there can be

183
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:06,000
a well-being there can be a sense of nourishment there can be a lightness

184
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,480
there can be a sense of rightness even if it's painful to be very painful

185
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:16,840
sometimes to be with suffering in the world um Attunement that maybe don't

186
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:22,399
feel necessarily Joy but there's something that feels right to be present

187
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:28,600
there's an openness a relaxedness ah okay this is how it

188
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:33,679
is and um and uh and this is also where

189
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:40,519
it's very important to be attune to oneself sometimes with compassion the idea is that it's all about the other

190
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:45,720
person that we or other people or the suffering out there and we're not

191
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:53,760
supposed to count and we lose touch with ourselves in their rush to to act or in their rush to be

192
00:33:53,760 --> 00:34:00,360
somehow focused on this the suffering out there but uh it's important to be present and

193
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:07,559
attuned to oneself and this is where the kind of guideline of um dividing our

194
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:16,118
attention 5050 between out there and in ourselves allows for actually a greater

195
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:22,679
attentiveness to others than if we just give our attention to others and the reason for that is we're tuned to

196
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:28,679
ourselves or we're here we we tend to uh overcome the conflicts the

197
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:34,720
distractedness the tightness the ways that we are that lets our attention out

198
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:40,520
there be incomplete be partial but if we keep enough attention

199
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:46,320
here for ourselves we can relax and open up and actually have much greater

200
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:53,158
attention than it to others than a partial attention which straining that seems like we're only

201
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:58,800
paying attention to the other person and so rather than it being a

202
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:05,240
loss 50/50 like less compassion less care for others uh there's actually more

203
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:12,079
when we are attuned to ourselves as well and when we learn the art of not being in conflict with anything that's going

204
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:17,200
on inside of ourselves even those things which are unfortunate or not so

205
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:23,760
wonderful about ourselves because we've learned to be attuned without giving into it attuned without being pushed

206
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:30,280
around by it or acting on it so we can make SP space for how we are and as we

207
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:35,760
make space for ourselves we develop the capacity to make space for others and to

208
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:42,640
begin there before we rush to judgment before we rush to fix and to

209
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:47,800
change and so this lack of conflict this Attunement this

210
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:54,560
harmony uh is a delight and uh it just feels so good uh

211
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:03,000
it's kind of refreshing to be in the World attuned um because I mean partly because

212
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,319
Attunement to self and others means that the very Act of Attunement is not a

213
00:36:08,319 --> 00:36:13,520
strain the act of Attunement is a kind of opening a kind of relaxing outward

214
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:19,640
and being present and receptive and here and it just feels delightful to be alive

215
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:26,079
in this way and to have this capacity to connect to others this way and and um so

216
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:32,200
there can be a joy in the Attunement and so if we're going to

217
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:40,040
really allow our compassion to flow out of atunement then the compassion will share

218
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:45,839
in that Joy share in that lightness or that sense of well-being or sense of

219
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:52,200
Freedom or sense of of rightness I want to give many many words not just call it

220
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:59,040
Joy because suffering is so difficult some sometimes that it's you know to say

221
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,200
that there's joy and compassionate presence for it is um maybe too much or

222
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:09,720
not quite right but there is something that feels that does feel right a

223
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:15,319
rightness uh a goodness a sweetness

224
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:22,560
a gentleness so I'm not you know there's many I don't know different circumstances maybe different positive

225
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:30,119
states are present uh in the compassionate Attunement to others and the com these

226
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:35,319
these positive States uh can be a nourishment for

227
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:40,599
ourselves it can have a positive influence on ourselves and maybe if we

228
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:48,839
lucky a nourishment or positive influence the world around us um I've rushed to take care of

229
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:55,079
problems and uh and the in the rush to take care of people or something I don't

230
00:37:55,079 --> 00:38:00,480
really show up with the best the best of how I am and maybe I'm for example I

231
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:06,359
might feel strain or tension and so that tension comes along and people can feel

232
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:15,160
it but if I arrive attuned and without that tension then uh my presence I hope

233
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:21,720
is helpful to other people to relax with their challenges um and then as we become more

234
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:27,160
and more attuned and uh then at some point we're ready for action

235
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:34,119
and uh to do something but as we did in this series so far um the emphasis is

236
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:41,440
whenever there's a chance set in the set that set create the foundation for

237
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:48,160
compassion uh don't have a rush to compassion and um and uh and then as

238
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:56,240
you're compassionate as you even act with compassion um stay attuned to yourself

239
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,520
to to recognize is there Joy is there a

240
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:07,200
well-being uh is there a sense of freedom because it's so easy to lose it

241
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,400
as we get involved in the action and relatedness relating to other

242
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:18,319
people so the joy of compassion it's m many forms of joy that

243
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:23,480
can come along yesterday I talked about the joy that comes with being aware and

244
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:31,400
having an awareness practice today it's the joy that come excuse

245
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:39,720
me today it's the joy that comes from um be uh being

246
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:47,359
attuned and having a practice of Attunement so the joy of not doing

247
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:52,520
something 100% successfully all the time but the joy of engaging in the process

248
00:39:52,520 --> 00:40:01,000
of doing it well so that there's room for our you know for our tentative efforts or

249
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,319
maybe incomplete efforts or you know ways in which we're still practicing and finding our

250
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:15,160
way so and may um May you find the joy of

251
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:20,960
Attunement the joy of listening the joy of staying present and being sensitive

252
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:27,640
to the suffering of others and your own and you might today

253
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:34,040
uh look around as you go through your day uh it can you find

254
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:40,040
occasions where there might be some sense of the joy of

255
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:45,119
Attunement in being present and being ATT tune to

256
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:52,520
others the joy of being in harmony of not being in Conflict even when there's

257
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:58,240
disagreements so um

258
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:06,240
thank you very much and um tomorrow we'll talk about the joy of

259
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:13,440
appreciation that uh appreciating others which maybe seems like a easier understanding of uh how there can

260
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:20,000
be Joy but for now Attunement thank

261
