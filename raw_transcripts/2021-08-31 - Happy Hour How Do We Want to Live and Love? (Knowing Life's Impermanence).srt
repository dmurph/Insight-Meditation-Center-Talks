1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:11,679
okay so so hello and welcome everyone to this

2
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,920
rendition this edition of happy hour so

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:25,680
so for today's happier um it's interesting because i was sitting

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,720
earlier and and thinking about what to share for today's

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,120
practice different thoughts came up and and um

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,960
and then so i i prepared a little darmette on a different topic which i'll

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,680
present another day and then something else happened what happened was just before

8
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:58,160
i opened the room i was sitting in meditation i became really really aware

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:05,600
of my own mortality that time is very very short

10
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,880
and as many of you know mindfulness of mortality befriending

11
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,159
mortality is is a topic that i practice a lot and

12
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,439
teach a lot so guess what when one practices this a lot it shows up in

13
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,799
moments on its own very important ways so

14
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,720
with respect to meta then the question that came up was

15
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:39,520
how do i want to show up how do i want to be and the feeling was so strong just

16
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:47,840
before you came on that i decided no i feel like this is the topic that i'm called to present tonight this is

17
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,560
it see it feels like this is what's moving through um and often my

18
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,320
my uh invocation my intention prayer is

19
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:08,640
let the dharma move through me whatever needs to be presented in this moment let that come through it's not so much about

20
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,400
so much about me in the middle but whatever needs to come through and so this is the topic that wants to come

21
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,680
through tonight especially it might be relevant i

22
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:28,000
realize because as we are entering yet a new phase of

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,150
of the coronavirus and the delta variant and the various

24
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:41,120
[Music] shutdowns around the world and and challenging and

25
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,440
um and not just with with some so many cases so many caseloads increasing and

26
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,879
life feeling really precarious our lives and others lives that's one aspect to

27
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:59,760
really have this this contemplation love in the time of

28
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,120
of uh corona um

29
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,480
giving a nod to this famous uh book by

30
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:17,840
gabriel garcia marquez love in the time of cholera love in the time of corona so

31
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,200
love how how do we love how do we love when really

32
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,120
whether we are vaccinated or not or or or um

33
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:36,560
or whether we have some underlying health conditions for us and our loved ones life seems precarious

34
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,080
um and without having fear about it in the sense of

35
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:49,760
life is always precarious right it's always precarious you anything can happen at any moment it

36
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,879
really can anything can happen at any moment

37
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:01,519
especially feels more more more juicy perhaps more

38
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:09,120
prominent and also another way that this reflection can be quite

39
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,280
supportive is for many of us perhaps

40
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:22,079
life is feeling not for everyone but really for many might it might feel like

41
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:29,360
the movie groundhog's day that we're at home again and again

42
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:38,000
every day is the same shape or form maybe we have some zoom meetings we sit in the same chairs eat the same food

43
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,280
same it's it is groundhog's day i definitely do feel that especially with

44
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,199
the air having been particularly um air quality having been bad from the smokes

45
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:58,160
and fires here so being at home not going out indoors and yet and yet with

46
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,080
that sense of groundhogs like gosh oh this life is gonna end

47
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,080
it is not infinite it might feel like again okay same same thing but anything

48
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,800
can happen at any moment it's it's gonna shift it's gonna change

49
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,199
and unbeknownst without without any planning who knows so

50
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:30,080
but one thing that we know is that we have limited time we know we have limited time we live as if we're gonna

51
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:38,000
live forever we go through our groundhog's day day as if it's gonna last forever

52
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,800
this show this show are called our life but it doesn't so so how do we want to show up for

53
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:53,360
ourselves for others in the midst of what's happening with all the issues all the relationships

54
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,199
we're having in our lives with that knowledge with that

55
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:05,919
stark realization that time is short it's limited it's going to come to

56
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:12,560
an end how do we love how do we love

57
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,720
how do we love how do we let go

58
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:26,240
how do we let go how do we love

59
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:34,639
so with that as the introduction

60
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,840
let's begin our practice together dear sangha

61
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,639
i invite you to settle to rest

62
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:54,680
to arrive in your seat in this body

63
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,880
in this mortal body mortal frame [Music]

64
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:18,840
which is alive for this period for this limited period of time

65
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:53,560
connecting with each breath as if it were or last

66
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:09,759
with ease with ease with the freshness of spring

67
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,840
in breath bringing life

68
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:22,599
out breath goodbye relax soften

69
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:34,000
and if thoughts arise it's okay it's all right be kind to your mind

70
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,680
it's used to thinking that's what it likes to do

71
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,360
as if you've noticed

72
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,959
a young child wandering off come come sweetie it's okay

73
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:59,200
come back come back to the breath to the body

74
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:07,920
to your mind settle rest take refuge

75
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,000
and the freedom that impermanence provides

76
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:32,320
just connecting with this moment with this fleeting evanescent moment in

77
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,640
time

78
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,600
this breath is in breath come and gone this out

79
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,360
breath calm and gone

80
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,839
not hanging on

81
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:36,800
just this breath just this in breath

82
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,839
noticing aliveness at the end breath

83
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:59,079
with the out breath leaning into relaxing letting go

84
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,120
embodied

85
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,920
and if this were if this were this moment in time right

86
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,839
now unbeknownst to you

87
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:25,720
if this were your last days last week last month

88
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,000
feel free to chew the time frame that doesn't bring too much anxiety but but

89
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,519
brings a sense of limitedness of time time is short it's not guaranteed to run

90
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,600
forever definitely not

91
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,519
how would you want to show up

92
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:08,680
first of all how would you want to show up

93
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,759
for the people with whom you're close

94
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,519
if you knew this was let's say your last month

95
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,959
how would you want to show up

96
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,040
choose one person so as to not to get overwhelmed

97
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:51,519
choose one person in your life who's dear to you an easy person let's start with the easy category

98
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,399
someone who's easy

99
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:10,480
where your relationship isn't complicated to meta kindness flows with ease

100
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:19,918
could be a child could be a pet and how would your kindness

101
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,918
your love how would it express itself

102
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,439
your good will towards this being

103
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,520
you're well wishing knowing that time is short

104
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:32,880
can you allow your meta your good will your kindness to flow to this being

105
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:40,480
since person from this place of generosity knowing

106
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,840
time is short

107
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:57,520
no matter truly how much time you have left with

108
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:03,840
each other it is still short and whether

109
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,480
you have a month left or not right now there will be a time

110
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:17,440
when you only have a month left with each other and you would only have known that

111
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,679
in the rearview mirror so so trying it on for size

112
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,720
now this practice this experiment

113
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:39,039
of good will cultivating kindness good wealth feeling into your goodwill kindness

114
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:44,559
for this being important in your life from this perspective of time being

115
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,559
short

116
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:24,640
you're welcome to bring other beings or beings who are near and dear

117
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,240
to you easy category if you wish or just stay with this one but spend some time with

118
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:39,000
each one not jumping too quickly from one to the next which can unsettle the mind

119
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:27,240
the true phrases that come up for me this practice

120
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:34,559
from the perspective of time being short unreliable

121
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,799
life's impermanence with respect to dear beings

122
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:46,559
the two phrases that come up with the in-breath and out-breath for me are

123
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:52,320
thank you thank you

124
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,840
i love you

125
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,039
thank you

126
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:13,360
i love you see what comes up for you

127
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:20,200
it's an expression of meta from this perspective

128
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,880
or you can borrow mine

129
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:56,720
and now invite invite into your mind's eye maybe

130
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,000
someone with you with whom you have a bit of a complicated relationship just a little bit

131
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,200
not the most complicated one yet but just a tiny bit

132
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:15,320
and if it feels okay inviting them

133
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:23,120
to your mind's eye from this perspective of time is short

134
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:29,840
it's very short you have no idea how short it might be

135
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:40,440
notice what might come up in the way of

136
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,720
things being let go of on their own meta-rising goodwill

137
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,440
for both of your humanities the way you've been entangled

138
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,559
if it gets complicated it's okay let it go if you're not with the mind the heart

139
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,520
isn't ready for this

140
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,840
come back to an easy being

141
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,799
if not then stay

142
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,080
stay with the slightly challenging category

143
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:14,039
time is short time is short time is always running out

144
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:15,880
we all must die all of us all of us earthlings

145
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,840
the dharmapada the buddhism

146
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,480
all of us all

147
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,960
all those earthlings we must not those who realize for

148
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,120
those who realize this truth

149
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:58,399
quarrel's end for those who realize

150
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:05,200
emphasize really realize this truth of common humanity that we

151
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:11,480
all must die all quarrels end

152
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,919
now i'd like to invite you

153
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,559
to turn your gaze upon yourself

154
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,640
this being who is you

155
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:22,840
as if you were gazing upon a beloved other who has limited time

156
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,640
with this truth realizing this truth how does your relationship shift

157
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,480
how would you treat this being who is you

158
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:59,480
this earthling was limited time

159
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:22,640
this real fling being yourself how do you want to show up how do you want to be

160
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:38,278
the stories the stories that we tell ourselves about ourselves

161
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:55,360
would some of them not be needed or get loosened the ones that are not helpful

162
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,600
not productive

163
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:11,519
hold us back from living

164
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:17,518
our limited time according or according to our values

165
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:29,279
do we get freed from entanglements of

166
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:34,760
our heart that are not helpful entanglements

167
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,398
time is limited do we really want to spend time

168
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,480
with ill will

169
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:06,518
do we really want to spend time with lack of generosity of the heart

170
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:31,960
how do we want to show up for ourselves and others

171
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:27,598
if you knew your time was limited which it is

172
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,878
how would you want your heart to love to shine

173
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,320
upon yourself and others

174
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,920
loving and living our days as if it were our last

175
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:39,800
because one day it will be

176
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:14,079
and for the final fleeting moments of this practice period together

177
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:22,520
letting go of however this practice period was

178
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:29,119
letting go no need for judgment

179
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:34,480
but to just love and appreciate yourself

180
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,960
thank you for showing up just the way you could just the way you

181
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,880
did do your best thank you

182
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,838
i love you

183
00:37:54,950 --> 00:38:04,880

for this practice

186
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:33,079
i felt like i wanted to sit longer but it had already been 30 minutes so

187
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:40,880
such a rich reflection practice to bring in

188
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:47,520
mindfulness of our mortality together with the practice of metta

189
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,880
of love cultivating love loving kindness

190
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:01,920
profound practice which i vow to bring to do more often

191
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,480
here at happy hour

192
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:15,359
yes i see thumbs up for that so

193
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:21,200
so we have time we have time for reflections

194
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:29,200

195

the gems of your insights your humanity

196
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:42,160

198
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:58,880
love to hear from you bring your voices in

199
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:07,440
one reflection coming in [Music] that was truly gay great thank you you

200
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,838
are welcome you're most welcome

201
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:20,480
yeah remind me christine says the reminder we are only here for a short time brought

202
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:27,040
up panic and anxiety that can happen as a part of mindfulness

203
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:33,680
of mortality practice also it can definitely happen so

204
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,960
the invitation i have for this is to titrate is to titrate go into it a

205
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,560
little bit and then come back out into mindfulness of body

206
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:51,839
mindfulness of of breath to calm yourself and then let it in a little bit a little more because

207
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:58,000
that way your capacity for it will get expanded

208
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,359
but that's a very good point and one can work with it one can we can

209
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:09,280
absolutely bring it in and support it in this practice and work with it aura says thank you so much for

210
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:15,760
this i recognize that even when i don't know i'm striving i'm striving

211
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:21,839
beautiful forrest says i missed the intro but this practice helps me get out of a negative

212
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:27,280
mind state metta is such a beautiful way to leave this world yes

213
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:34,319
absolutely another reflection this one sent to me only so i read the reflection not the

214
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:40,960
name that's our common practice here

215
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,000
the next reflection thank you that was very powerful tears

216
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:52,720
came to me thank you and mercy christine says thanks thank you

217
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,680
mark christine for raising that very important

218
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:04,319
nav says sharing a carl sagan quote it's a long one i'll read it the world is so

219
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:10,240
exquisite with so much love and moral depth that there is no reason to deceive

220
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:17,280
ourselves with petty stories for which there is little good evidence far better it seems to me in our

221
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:23,280
vulnerability is to look death in the eye and to be grateful every day for the

222
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:29,839
brief but magnificent opportunity that life provides beautiful thank you love

223
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:35,440
yes exactly exactly

224
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:42,839
eileen says thank you for this it helps not to feel alone with this awareness of mortality yes we're not

225
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:48,400
alone one more reflection my dear 80 year old mother-in-law was present with

226
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:54,640
me oh her cancer has metastasized and she continues to live in joy and service a

227
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:01,359
great teacher beautiful oh inspiring thank you for sharing that

228
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:07,920
another reflection sadness came up i the thought was if my life ended next month i should

229
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:15,200
probably be kinder and more generous to myself than i am being right now how i'm living right now is not how i

230
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:23,040
would like to treat myself if my time were very limited fantastic that is wholesome sadness that

231
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:30,560
is wholesome sadness when you realize that you're when you really recognize and connect

232
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:36,800
with your true values intentions and you realize

233
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:43,680
the the little misalignment when you realize there's a misalignment problem which many of us

234
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:49,200
have um beautiful i am so delighted to hear that

235
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:56,160
this came up of course because our time is always limited and wonderful to remember that to be kinder and more

236
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:03,599
generous to yourself to ourselves jerry says focusing on the brevity of

237
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:09,119
our lives and of the time as species made me appreciate the gift

238
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:14,560
of my life and of all yeah yes

239
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:22,400
what do i mean by misalignment says murray christine misalignment so this idea of what our values are and how we

240
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:29,200
actually act and spend our time is called the misalignment problem

241
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:36,000
so so what the person was reflecting was oh i want to be kinder more generous to

242
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:43,920
myself but i realize i'm not so that is the misalignment or if you realize that you really want to

243
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:50,720
serve the world but let's say you're in a career that's not really serving at all

244
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:58,000
so the oh misalignment between the way you're spending your life and your values so misalignment problem

245
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:06,160
on youtube patricia says a sense of urgency came up in waves for me very profound

246
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:11,839
indeed i found that mindfulness of the breath was very supportive thank you yeah thank

247
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:19,119
you and the sense of urgency is very common with this practice of mindfulness and mortality it's actually

248
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:24,160
with respect to practice it's called some vega some vega s-a-m

249
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:30,640
v-v-e-g-a some vega there might be an h in there somewhere with the transliteration from

250
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:36,560
poly to english but um the idea of spiritual urgency their

251
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:43,040
sense of spiritual urgency comes up with this practice which different ones of you are talking about

252
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:48,400
in different ways and more reflection my daughter is my role model she died

253
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:54,319
five years ago oh while fighting her cancer she lived her

254
00:45:54,319 --> 00:46:00,240
life more fully became involved in a new spiritual tradition and got married oh

255
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:05,760
that is so beautiful oh thank you for

256
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:11,680
sharing the beautiful beautiful life of this beautiful being your child

257
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,680
hmm

258
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:23,680
ah thank you all thank you for sharing your goodness and beauty

259
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:29,680
this limited flash of time that we have like

260
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:34,960
stars in the sky we're crossing each other we're crossing

261
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,640
so yeah one last reflection before we go into

262
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:46,079
groups hearing your words at the beginning describing the groundhog's day sense

263
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:53,040
many of us are having coupled with the current seeming or immediacy of death was initially confronting but as i went into

264
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:59,040
the practice i found peace and love for myself and others over the weekend i was very ill

265
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:05,119
following the wallop of the second shingles vaccine oh i had the experience of feeling super

266
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:11,119
ill not even wanting to speak with friends on the phone yet at the same time knowing it was only my body

267
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:18,400
building immunity being that sick took me to an unexpectedly happy place without much to

268
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:23,920
be anxious about as i often am when i'm physically well and thinking about the

269
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:31,040
world life and my own little problems yes yes thank you deborah

270
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:36,720
profound practice to practice when we are ill

271
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:41,920
is profound practice it simplifies so many things let's go over because we don't have the

272
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:48,000
energy the usual around our energy to get tangled in fact i think some weeks ago i

273
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,680
did this practice maybe months ago practicing as if you are ill practicing

274
00:47:53,680 --> 00:48:00,800
as if you are ill so that's an audio dharma so dear ones we have come to the time

275
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:08,079
when we hold each other these mortal beings that we are and we meet each other

276
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:13,280
in small groups and connect with each other and support each other

277
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:21,359
so let us join each other in small groups

278
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:26,559
with starting with 15 seconds of of meta

279
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:33,280
as always mettak or karuna compassion for ourselves for each other and then share

280
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:38,559
as little or as much as you like with each other about this practice so

281

296
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:36,079
contemplating or we're at the edge of thinking about our own deaths and the deaths of people we love

297
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:42,800
and it even in the small group for very few moments that i can feel it bringing us
