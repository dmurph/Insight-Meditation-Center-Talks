1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,440
so good morning a good day good afternoon good evening

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,379
welcome to our meditation time together

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,960
and uh imagining that

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,560
what it would look like if there was somehow lines looking from space looking

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,680
down at the Earth and seeing lines drawn between all of us

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:37,739
a line from each of us to all the others and what a marvelous web or net they

7
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:45,480
would create and maybe it's a line of Goodwill

8
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:53,359
friendliness care so thank you for being here

9
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:02,160
one way of understanding meditation is that

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,720
it can be a continual Act of appreciating oneself

11
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:15,560
and appreciating oneself and sometimes is in short supply

12
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,340
and so we practice it we practice it not to override or to

13
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:29,340
pretend or to have some kind of pollyanish attitude towards ourselves

14
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,280
but we find a way to appreciate ourselves

15
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,680
even knowing that we have maybe false knowing we have challenges

16
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:52,380
knowing we have things that maybe are hard to appreciate

17
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:58,500
but to not Define ourselves by the our faults or what's hard to appreciate

18
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:06,420
do not limit how we relate to ourselves based on those maybe even because of those it's so

19
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,780
important to expand the vision to see how we can respect our basic

20
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:19,500
Humanity just like we would respect to everybody else and in that respect to

21
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,959
have a fundamental appreciation

22
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,980
for our value for being alive for being a person for capacities

23
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:39,480
for our potential and that we're as Buddhist practitioners we are living ourselves into our

24
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:46,140
potential to be free to be kind to be caring

25
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,599
to be not caught

26
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:58,640
in anything that we come across in ourselves or in the world around us

27
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,680
and to have the opposite of appreciation for ourselves is to be caught in

28
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,739
something so to a continual Act of appreciating

29
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:17,720
ourselves this morning so to take a

30
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,440
um to assume a posture

31
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,500
that is right for you that would support you to be alert and

32
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:38,659
present and support you to have this practice of

33
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:42,659
self-appreciation self-respect

34
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:56,959
and to Relax The Gaze of your eyes

35
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:04,280
soften the muscles around your eyes

36
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,379
and if it feels comfortable closing your eyes

37
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:37,220
and then approaching your body

38
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,478
settling into your body

39
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:47,180
with a gentleness

40
00:04:51,419 --> 00:05:01,520
to awaken a greater sensitivity to to your embodied experience

41
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:08,820
being here with a body with the weight of your body resting on

42
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:14,240
the chair a cushion floor a bed

43
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:32,699
and one way to appreciate oneself is to appreciate that you care enough

44
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,620
about yourself that you're meditating

45
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:45,259
that you're engaged in this practice is a wonderful thing

46
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:57,960
and there's a way of appreciating how caring for your breathing

47
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,759
is a good thing and you might gently

48
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:13,698
be quietly and without ambition to breathe in a little bit deeper

49
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:21,259
Fuller breaths Fuller inhales Fuller exhales

50
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:30,440
depreciating your breathing feeling it more fully

51
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,280
relaxing as you exhale

52
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:05,039
and letting your breathing return to normal and if there are difficult States for

53
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:11,699
you emotions or concerns

54
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,000
it's okay to have them to be that way

55
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,120
maybe appreciate yourself with them

56
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:34,259
in that whatever preoccupies you maybe at the root

57
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,580
they exist because

58
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:48,060
you're important you're valuable your well-being counts

59
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,680
your safety counts

60
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:15,599
appreciating that something deep inside wants to keep you safe once they keep you well

61
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,960
and

62
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:32,479
and if you have some sense of that to rest there breathe there

63
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:38,479
maybe that's one of the ways to appreciate yourself as you meditate

64
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,040
and if the mind wanders off in thought

65
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:06,779
appreciate yourself as you notice that that's the

66
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:13,220
case when you wake up to the fact you're thinking

67
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,100
in with appreciation or with delight

68
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:28,740
Begin Again with the breathing with the body

69
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,779
with present moment awareness

70
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,459
okay

71
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:50,120
in the last minutes of the meditation time

72
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:58,380
see if you can rest or abide

73
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,080
in a relaxed self-appreciation

74
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:11,539
in appreciation which takes very little effort

75
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:21,679
from which you recognize that non-appreciation takes more effort more stress

76
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:26,760
relax allow

77
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:33,559
Ed for an appreciation of yourself

78
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:43,580
or appreciation for this expression of life

79
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:51,080
that exists here in you with you in this body

80
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:16,460
and then to end this sitting

81
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:22,700
dedicating our practice for the welfare of others

82
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,159
and I would propose that

83
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:36,600
the less we appreciate ourselves the less were able to dedicate for the

84
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:43,220
welfare of others the more we appreciate

85
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:50,520
here this life within us this heart within us

86
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,140
this being we are

87
00:29:56,039 --> 00:30:03,380
the more we have to offer others the more appreciation the full Earth

88
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:13,080
the stronger the more understanding more resonating

89
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:18,140
is our appreciation of others

90
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,760
and finding a way to always appreciate

91
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:31,220
always meet others with good will

92
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,000
so that our wish for the welfare and happiness of everyone

93
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:44,299
can be that way for everyone no one excluded

94
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:51,380
may all beings be appreciated

95
00:30:52,740 --> 00:31:00,140
may all beings be respected

96
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:10,640
may all beings be free of our

97
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:16,460
judgments and hostility prejudice

98
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,740
may all beings

99
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:33,200
know that they are cared for may all beings be happy

100
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:40,919
safe peaceful

101
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:47,399
and free and may our capacity to appreciate

102
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:53,210
others support this as a possibility

103
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:56,450
[Music]

104
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:07,900
[Music]

105
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,059
thank you

106
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:16,559
this is so here continuing with um

107
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:22,039
third talk on the joy of compassion

108
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:27,779
and perhaps it's the easiest to understand

109
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:33,179
that this Third Kind Of Joy related to compassion

110
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:40,919
and that is the joy of appreciation and when and when we appreciate others

111
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:49,159
when we appreciate anything ourselves included appreciation has a kind of a positive

112
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:55,980
feeling to it it's an uplifting feeling it's an opening feeling it's a

113
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:02,220
it's a delightful feeling and the Delight of appreciation the

114
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:10,740
light of saying oh this is good this is valuable this is something I care for this is something that is important and

115
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:16,740
this is something that um is well done and this is

116
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:23,520
something I celebrate so this idea of appreciation usually comes with a

117
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:31,800
positive disposition a positive feeling and so it may be easier to find the joy

118
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:38,638
of compassion this way and uh and this means that it's actually

119
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:46,020
important to practice appreciation or find how to appreciate others if we're going to be compassionate

120
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:51,960
I think it's easy enough to feel obligated to be compassionate to feel

121
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:57,300
that we feel the suffering of the world or suffering of others and we kind of

122
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:03,480
are buffeted by it or oppressed by it or contracted or tense because of it and we

123
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:09,540
feel like I have to do something I have to be compassionate and so one way or the other there's a

124
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:14,820
headlong movement into compassion into doing compassion doing what seems like

125
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:20,940
the right thing to do doing the helpful thing but it's not as long we want to be we

126
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:26,640
want to be heart long moving in with a heart we want to ideally take time

127
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:32,579
so that we're not doing compassion out of obligation we're not doing it as a

128
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:38,760
should that we have to kind of now deal with things but we want to do certainly want to act

129
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:45,960
compassionately in the world but let that compassion be a flowering of what's wonderful within us a flowering of

130
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:53,220
something which is medicine for the world and the world does not need more people who feel the weight and the

131
00:35:53,220 --> 00:36:01,740
heaviness of obligation and its responsibility and uh and it kind of headlong you know attack on the causes

132
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:08,160
of of people suffering or something the world needs us to address the

133
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:13,619
suffering but to do it in a way that's medicine for the world that's uh that

134
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:19,800
supports it that's healing for the world and and brings out the best and best in people

135
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:25,920
and so appreciation for me is one of those qualities to take the time to

136
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:32,280
appreciate and of course sometimes it's hard to appreciate others so that the the kind

137
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:39,480
of in the same categories appreciation I I think of as I think is respect

138
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:45,900
that to respect everyone to express their respect their autonomy their

139
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:53,640
dignity their value respect their potential the two even if we disagree with someone

140
00:36:53,640 --> 00:37:01,220
even if we feel like what they're doing is wrong

141
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:06,599
we never want to condemn people we never want to have hostility towards

142
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:15,800
anyone rather we want to have respect and with respect or with appreciation to say no

143
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:22,800
with with respect and appreciation of who someone is and say you know I

144
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:29,640
appreciate you I care about you but no you cannot do this this is not right

145
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:35,880
um uh but the the person clearly feels that we're not condemning them we're not

146
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:44,520
closing them down we're not judging all of who they are it's like that you're now a bad person or a wrong person

147
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:50,099
always so if you can't find appreciation maybe we could come to find

148
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:57,300
a place of respect and that relates to ourselves as well that if we can't find appreciation for

149
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:04,020
ourselves can we at least respect ourselves respect our basic human dignity basic

150
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:11,280
human value autonomy um the um

151
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,440
uh and there are professions in the world

152
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:22,380
where the fundamental ethical attitude that people are supposed to have like

153
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:28,200
doctors or nurses and medical folks is to have always respect

154
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:33,900
the dignity respect for the autonomy of people that are supporting

155
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:39,420
they might not love them but but they still have that respect

156
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:45,359
and so uh appreciation respect taking the time for that

157
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:51,480
uh finding out where you know and sometimes that's all that's needed is a little bit of time

158
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:59,280
I've been struck many times by how easy it is to rush through the supermarket

159
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,380
line where the clerk is there and you know kind of just not really take time

160
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:10,619
to to take in the clerk um but then at other times where I take

161
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:16,079
my time and the you know the extra second or two to look at this the

162
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,839
checkout clerk in the eye or appreciate them or ask a simple question you know

163
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:27,000
how are you or um you know so some some little comment

164
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,420
uh that makes a human connection and how there's this can be a spark of kind of

165
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:40,099
familiarity or recognition of something really nice that happens that doesn't come with

166
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:46,260
any requirements that it means in means or anything else or implies anything

167
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:52,460
else than just a recognition of our kindness or appreciation

168
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:57,720
many people are not appreciated enough in our society and so one way to

169
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:04,500
cultivate appreciation great appreciation for others is actually to take the time to appreciate folks say

170
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:12,599
thank you that was well done or that was uh helpful or you know that wasn't that

171
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:19,380
was wonderful thank you or find ways to appreciate people and and say it

172
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:25,859
and find out what goes on inside of you that it resists the expression of

173
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:32,280
appreciation I know for me sometimes it's been embarrassment sometimes it's been well if I appreciate them they're

174
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:37,320
going to want more from me and I'm kind of opening up myself to kind of not be

175
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:43,619
taken advantage of or um or it'll seem policy in pollyanish or

176
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:49,440
something but learning to find a way to in a healthy way appropriate way to

177
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,540
appreciate people because a lot of people are underappreciated for who they are

178
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:59,640
and um and uh I think there's a

179
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:05,400
a huge kind of um starvation of appreciation in many corners of our

180
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:13,500
world and so to offer appreciation helps to kind of move and and oil the gears of

181
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:19,500
appreciation inside of ourselves and what I found is that as I've

182
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:24,780
appreciated people more it seems to be kind of natural to appreciate myself

183
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:29,880
uh not that I'm trying extra to do it but just there's more space to do it

184
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:37,260
more room more less kind of being caught up in the negativity of life in the

185
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:43,140
version of how things are appreciation is a beautiful thing

186
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:48,599
so that but it takes time and I'd like to propose that kind of

187
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:55,099
healthy compassion takes time slow down

188
00:41:55,099 --> 00:42:00,599
uh wait before you act compassionately and see if you can

189
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:06,060
have a little heightened awareness a little heightened Attunement and a

190
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:11,099
heightened appreciation uh and in doing that

191
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:21,119
finding the joy that the light the positivity the lightness the ease the openness it's a

192
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:26,579
beautiful thing to be compassionate it's wonderful to find that wonderfulness

193
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:33,119
it's wonderful to find that beauty that sweetness it's medicine for the world it's

194
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:38,660
medicine for ourselves so um

195
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:47,880
so today if you'd like to experiment or stretch yourself in this regard see if there's simple ways and

196
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:54,300
underscore the word simple so so because it can get complicated if it's if it's

197
00:42:54,300 --> 00:43:00,720
complicated or or really big the appreciation but in simple ways I

198
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:07,980
appreciate the people around you I appreci appreciate strangers appreciate people who are helping you in

199
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:16,140
clerks or stores or places of work or anything offer appreciation and see what happens

200
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:23,220
to you as you appreciate others learn about yourself as you appreciate

201
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:28,800
so thank you and I certainly appreciate that all of you are here that you're

202

203
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:42,300

204

205
