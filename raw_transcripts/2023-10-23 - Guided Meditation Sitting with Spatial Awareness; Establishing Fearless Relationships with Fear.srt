oh begin with this word

17
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,239
pause just pausing

18
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:31,760
momentarily it's kind of a process to pause right here

19
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,000
we just no to seeing this body

20
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,080
sitting this a passing has an

21
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,599
effect it allows ourselves to become

22
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:12,280
present maybe [Music] momentarily becoming mindful of what's

23
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,599
Here and

24
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:35,360
Now maybe pausing

25
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:48,959
deliberately with an intention to become more and more

26
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,519
present and may notice that our mind

27
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:07,200
tumbles along with the momentum to think

28
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,400
plan to remember the

29
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:28,039
past right this being patient and

30
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
persistent

31
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:40,600
to pause and stay

32
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,319
connected with what's here and

33
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,560
now maybe a few long deep breaths

34
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,800
mindfulness is

35
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,000
present noticing the sound

36
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,600
and the silence in

37
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
between

38
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,759
when this pausing come to an

39
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:33,080
end one may become more Mindful and

40
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:47,360
present a felt sense of the body naturally

41
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:58,000
arise you may notice the body making contact with the

42
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,400
floor sitting

43
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,720
here the weight of the body settling

44
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,360
down can rest your

45
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,199
attention right where the contact of the

46

gravity do its own

55
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:21,040
thing sitting like a

56
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120

thinking planning

128
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:44,879
storytelling whenever we notice that we have a

129
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:50,840
choice we can choose to pause

130
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:02,880
again can choose to step out of the unconscious

131
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,840
flow of our thinking

132
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:17,519

for

145
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:12,240
good morning and welcome to IMC and thank you for that guided

146
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,079
meditation and good morning y

147
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:33,119
Chan yeah good morning everyone and um if you need to move about and shift a

148
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:39,720
post uh shift the postures or um do some things to help the body don't hesitate

149
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:44,839
to do that this is a good time to transition

150
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:51,760
um happy to be with you all feel just very delighted to be able

151
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:58,680
to spend this morning with you all and um

152
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:08,680
the topic I brought with me one part of it is

153
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:14,079
fear I feel a little something me to just name

154
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:23,119
that and there is also a second part and that is uh how to establish Fearless

155
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:29,000
relationships with fear and so don't Panic

156
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,920
so so there are there is this two sides uh with um today's

157
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:45,400
topic and so and the word fear itself may bring a wide range of um emotions

158
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:55,440
and reactivities or responses inside of us but we can't deny that uh fear is a

159
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,560
very potent emotion in our human

160
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:09,480
lives and and it arises in all kinds of um maybe arises from all kinds of uh

161
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:15,880
aspect of Our Lives or all kinds of dimensions of Our Lives can arise out of

162
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:23,440
uh physical challenges illness aging death and can arise out of emotional

163
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:31,839
responses of something the loss of loss of loved ones loss of uh Financial

164
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:38,640
stability and you know all kinds of loss can evoke uh the emotional response and

165
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:44,720
can be a a psychological um kind of of uh fear uh

166
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:51,640
maybe a sense of self self-image um a sense of who we are gets

167
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:57,280
challenged and there can arise a fear of some different kinds

168
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:05,440
and even in the uh spiritual Dimension um there can be uh fear arise

169
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,880
and so for uh many people who practice in the Buddhist tradition and maybe many

170
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:17,319
other spiritual Traditions religious Traditions that will come to a point uh

171
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:24,720
where there is a recognition that all kinds of things that we thought

172
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:32,119
uh we have Reliance on actually we can't really rely on them

173
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:37,920
because they're ever changing it feels like the rug gets pulled from under and

174
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,319
that can be a terrifying kind of sense and so there

175
00:39:43,319 --> 00:39:50,560
can be a spiritual fear um arise even in the uh in the in this domain so it's

176
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:57,800
quite pervasive um and yet uh and how do we

177
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:04,200
understand fear and how do we relate fear relate with this

178
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:11,880
emotion um is a big part of our U Buddhist um practice and and then I want

179
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:17,760
want to say is there is a way that we can relate to

180
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:28,400
this um strong uh Force within each of us uh wisely compassionately and so that

181
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:33,960
this can be a force that is rather transformative rather than we feel like

182
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:39,839
we're narrowed down or limited and getting stuck by

183
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:46,040
this and so um so I kind of decided

184
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:51,319
we'll talk about this uh in two Dimensions so the first part of this

185
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:57,520
talk will be we uh learn a little bit about a fear and then we understand it a

186
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:05,079
little bit and so I thought and I looked it up and the definition the dictionary

187
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:10,200
definition of a fear actually is a pretty good one and so I thought I'm

188
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:16,560
just going to start right there and the dictionary definition of a fear is an

189
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:23,400
unpleasant emotion caused by here is a whole list of keywords to pay attention

190
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:32,280
to so it's a a unpleasant uh emo uh emotion caused by belief

191
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:39,079
perception imagination uh recognition

192
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:46,960
expectation of some kind of danger or thread which leads to

193
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,400
pain that's there's a lot in this definition right here I was amazed when

194
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:59,480
I read this and so uh let's tease this apart a little bit

195
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:06,960
the first one is fear is an unpleasant emotion I think we all know this right I

196
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:12,200
think all of us experienced some kind of fear worry and it's

197
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:19,800
unpleasant it's unpleasant kind of emotion and it rises out of causes and

198
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:25,920
conditions so it's not just something randomly pop up but the cause is a

199
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:33,000
condition is this long list of keywords here perception belief expectations

200
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:39,119
imaginations and recognitions of some kind of danger that's

201
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:44,839
there and this is a fascinating and when I when I saw this

202
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:50,920
word imagination I realized wow how many times we're afraid because we have

203
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:56,680
certain imagination about a kind of a thread

204
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:02,599
me this is on earthquake Zoom you know we're actually on a fault IMC is on

205
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:08,040
earthquake fault and and now if we can if we start

206
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:13,920
imagining what this might happen we could be panicking right

207
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:20,559
now and so many of our fear kind of arise out of

208
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:26,520
that and um I'd like to differentiate a little bit here and which is quite

209
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:32,160
important in this definition uh the difference between

210
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:39,160
danger and fear so danger we can't avoid um by

211
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:46,359
being human we have a human body mind heart uh there is danger in this world

212
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:52,760
um like the potential danger of earthquake right here and the danger we

213
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:58,760
can't deny it's uh um it exists and you

214
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:04,240
know we have a danger that I didn't walk properly and break my leg might getting

215
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:10,680
off this platform and that's a possibility but the danger doesn't

216
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:16,400
necessarily mean fear a lot of times we mix these two

217
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,599
things up I think danger me it's fear you know you're going to immediately

218
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:28,800
worry and immediately panicking but that's not not necessarily

219
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:35,839
so um there is a kind of Primal response

220
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:42,480
that's a survival response that built into this system in response to a danger

221
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:49,280
like you know um um a car comes in front of you you you jump out that's Primal

222
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,440
Instinct it doesn't necessarily mean immediately we're going to panic and we

223
00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:00,720
actually just know that we get out of of the way to be safe but it's is true that

224
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:06,160
often uh fear can happen but I'll teach that apart a little bit I want to stay

225
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:11,480
with this point of danger doesn't necessarily mean fear you all probably

226
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:19,920
have heard a lot of um stories of great exam Master tikna

227
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:28,040
Hong uh who spoke about um um people sitting on the refugee boat

228
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:33,440
to go across ocean um it's dangerous no

229
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:42,040
doubt but if one person is calm and peaceful the whole boat can be saved a

230
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:48,000
whole boat of people might survive this but if everybody

231
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:54,880
panicked nobody might survive and it's possible in this

232
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:02,040
situation that that someone is Cal and that is possible or you can say

233
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:07,559
oh wow you know that's Zam master I'm not really sure and that's possible so I

234
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:15,040
want to give a personal uh example and that uh I think all of you

235
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:20,400
probably have experienced something like this but for me this personal example

236
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:27,280
was uh quite powerful in my own um in my own experience in my own kind of path of

237
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:34,559
a practice so this was uh some years ago I was uh driving and I was emerging on

238
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:42,280
an expressway uh on the kind of from the right hand uh right hand side and I um I

239
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:49,040
saw a Jeep coming towards on this Lane that I was merging on it was a very fast

240
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:54,559
uh driving but it was very far away so I thought okay you know they will see me I

241
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:59,599
will be able to merge they can change a lan so and I had just this few thoughts

242
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:07,960
and I said okay I'm going to go so I merged onto this express lane and as soon as I got onto the lane

243
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:16,920
I looked back from the uh rear mirror this Jeep wasn't going to slow slow down

244
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:24,760
or change lane and the people in this Jeep were waving and shouting and I just

245
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:30,040
thought wow this is not stable I'm not really sure what this Jeep is going to

246
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:39,400
do so I felt the danger right there and um so my instinct was to pull off uh the

247
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:45,920
Lan completely got to the sidewalk and I guess this uh shoulder and I pulled off

248
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:51,680
and I just stopped right there and then the Jeep Zoom you know just zipped

249
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:58,240
through me and the people were still shouting and yelling and and and right at that that

250
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:03,480
moment what came to me was may you be

251
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:10,000
safe may you know peace may you know the deepest deepest

252
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:18,760
well-being I kind of surprised myself I was like wow okay I didn't panic and and

253
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:27,640
um I didn't curse them that that just came spontaneously

254
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:35,359
um and I recognized that was a powerful moment learning moment for me that it's

255
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:44,599
not automatic that we would just become panicky or we become um angry or even

256
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:49,680
have rage and um that doesn't have to be the

257
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:55,680
case and so that was a really powerful moment for me to recognize and that was

258
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:02,680
was a possibility and that was a moment of uh the fruit of a practice showing up

259
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:11,559
it's not so much about me and you know I did something it wasn't it wasn't it was just spontaneously came that um but but

260
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:19,920
by recognizing that um I came to have so much trust and the

261
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:25,240
confidence in the practice I know yeah next time something

262
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:31,599
like I might trip again because that's just you know habit forces I have that

263
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:38,319
but it doesn't have to be the only way so through the practice some other

264
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:44,640
possibility can become available to us I think maybe each of you have those

265
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:53,760
moments that you can recognize wow okay you know it's not automatic that we

266
00:49:53,760 --> 00:50:00,520
should we all just going to be panicking in situation X Y YZ is so there is a

267
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:08,280
different a different possibility

268
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:17,920
um but it is true sometimes you all

269
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:26,040
probably have noticed that that um it often happens that even when

270
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:32,680
we got out of the an uh got out of the danger like you jump out of um the

271
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:41,920
racing car coming at you fear can come immediately after that and why and this

272
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:47,920
definition give a pretty good uh explanation or you we could notice this

273
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:54,440
ourselves we can begin to imagine what could have

274
00:50:54,440 --> 00:51:00,240
happened well that is scary even though we're out of the danger we're kind of

275
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:08,760
safe now but that imagination can happen that belief can happen wow this could

276
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:14,440
happen really bad and building upon that imagination

277
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:20,119
we now can start panicking we can begin to have a

278
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:26,000
fear so this is very interesting this is very interesting and

279
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:32,400
so many times our fear and worry can happen like that even though we're not

280
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:40,160
physically or even emotionally in the danger zone we can have this Downstream

281
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:48,960
sequence in of reactivity and so the deep root in this

282
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:56,880
process is that uh fear is a reactive movements emotional move movements based

283
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:03,359
on this set of imaginations and beliefs and perceptions of something dangerous that

284
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:11,920
may be there um but it's a a form the deep root of this is in the present moment we're

285
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:20,760
not clearly seeing and knowing what is really happening here we did not see

286
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:27,119
that we're actually in a SE safe zone right now we didn't not see oh this is

287
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:33,480
my imagination at work or this is a kind of a perception that's at work and we

288
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:38,920
also do not see often times that the fear is

289
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:46,280
present it's just a form of an emotion that's present and so what can happen is

290
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:53,480
often fear doesn't stop at just this momentary movement of the emotion we can

291
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:58,599
become Frozen and we can become frustrated and we can

292
00:52:58,599 --> 00:53:06,000
become angry we can become depressed and you know it can get very contracted and

293
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:12,359
you know we may even do something harmful to ourselves and

294
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:18,760
others and so there is this whole sequence of reactivity that can happen

295
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:27,160
that become in fact rather dangerous to ourselves and to others

296
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:31,079
and so

297
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:41,720
um some kind of some understanding about this the this AAR maybe just kind of

298
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:47,520
from our logical mind and conceptual conceptual mind but I also don't want to

299
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:54,000
diminish this um we're not alone in this department it's not like we get you know

300
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:00,680
we're specialized staying this department and and this is a strong forth

301
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:07,960
um now and strong forth sou thousands of years ago I was looking into the sutas

302
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:13,880
and poly Canon sutas and I was interesting in our U Buddhist tradition

303
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:20,640
most people know the uh three unham roots of great hatred

304
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:25,760
delusion uh but in fact if you look at the sutas there is a whole set of a

305
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:34,440
sutas that talks about the list of four with fear in it so so you know it's a

306
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:41,200
strong force and so that's one of those uh in the list of three that we often

307
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:47,559
known and and so it's it's a strong force but I'm going to shift to talk

308
00:54:47,559 --> 00:54:52,960
about and there is a possibility to uh through our practice

309
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:59,160
to begin to establish uh some more wholesome relationship or skillful

310
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:04,920
relationships with um this form of emotion called

311
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:11,640
fear uh this is what I called Fearless relationships and so I unpack a little

312
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:14,318
bit about

313
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:25,119
that and the first thing uh maybe is to write along what we been speaking about

314
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:31,039
out so far uh the first kind of relationship that's helpful to establish

315
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:38,319
with fear is this word befriending fear befriending

316
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:45,160
fear kind of this is part of us being human and

317
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:52,240
um befriending when we befriend something we can know we can learn about

318
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:58,599
them and we can begin to understand them uh when we have kind of aversive and

319
00:55:58,599 --> 00:56:05,000
push away and get rid of a Runway kind of relationship we can't know them we

320
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,480
just can't know them and so the first uh uh step in this whole process of

321
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:20,359
establishing skillful relationships is to be friend be friend our fear it's like um

322
00:56:20,359 --> 00:56:27,160
if you have a terrified child um if you're meeting a terrified

323
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:32,240
child you don't want to just beat them up or you know trying to make them happy

324
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:39,079
it doesn't happen like that you give them a very kind safe open space for

325
00:56:39,079 --> 00:56:46,280
them to to be to feel that they can be themselves and then they can soften they

326
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:52,359
can Tha in that field and the same thing uh is that's

327
00:56:52,359 --> 00:57:00,480
maybe analogy for being with our own uh fear our own emotion is to make

328
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:07,280
space so that the fear can feel safe to be here and so they don't feel like are

329
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:14,160
we going to you know fix them up right away and so befriending

330
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:21,400
fear and there is a process to befriend fear um it takes you know I'm going to

331
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:28,280
just say a few steps it doesn't work you know mechanically like that but I have to say

332
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:35,400
something that feels a little logical but the first thing is um uh to be bef

333
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:43,559
friend fear uh is to come to a conscious relationship with it if we're flowing in

334
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:49,440
this unconscious stream of reactivities we not even know that ex ex

335
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:57,480
existed in us we just keep on doing something to try to fix it up and getting ready of or uh we never really

336
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:04,280
pay attention that it's here so the first one is just to become aware oh

337
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:11,079
this is present in me and so that's the practice of mindful awareness oh yeah

338
00:58:11,079 --> 00:58:19,960
okay I can pause for this now once I know that the Second Step um is to begin

339
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:26,359
to feel and sense the texture of the fear and kind

340
00:58:26,359 --> 00:58:31,760
of um the form of the fear and to get to

341
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:37,240
know it now I use this word deliberately uh

342
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:43,640
feeling and sensing it because the fear is a form of emotion it doesn't speak

343
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:49,839
necessarily English emotions are movements their

344
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:55,440
motions they move it's a energy form in us that moves

345
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:04,400
through so often we use our logical mind the conceptual mind to try to deal with

346
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:10,319
emotions often times we'll find out you know I got this you know I I

347
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:15,760
want to get rid of it and you know I I got a lot of strategies to deal with it

348
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:22,640
we know it doesn't quite work um emotions you can think of it as

349
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:29,720
if you're going to a different country country that speaks different language from your your language you don't just

350
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:37,720
keep talking with them using your own language you know no one going to understand you but you can you can be in

351
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:44,720
that environment at least for a while to observe them to feel them to kind of

352
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:50,559
feel their body posture and and you body language facial language and how they

353
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:57,319
move in the space and you kind of you can get a sense how they they are you know you're with your animals kind of

354
00:59:57,319 --> 01:00:02,839
like that also you know um being with animals are kind of like that in a way

355
01:00:02,839 --> 01:00:10,960
it's kind of like our animal nature being shown so um can we feel and sense

356
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:16,680
into our emotions and can we really

357
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:25,480
listen not using necessarily all of our Logics analysis to try to map it

358
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:33,359
out and that's very important and I was looking up um at the Chinese characters

359
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:40,960
there's a whole ton of you know fear is not just one thing so there are so many words that even in English uh that kind

360
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:49,240
of are in this domain of um of uh fear in Chinese characters and

361
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:55,480
almost all of them have the character of a heart in it

362
01:00:55,480 --> 01:01:02,799
um it's quite somatic you feel like heart Quivers or um heart feels

363
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:09,760
constricted or heart feels tight it's kind of very somatic and so we can get

364
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:16,720
to know fear through our somatic experience through a embodied sense get

365
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:22,280
to know that and so those are the two steps into

366
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:28,559
kind of a be begin to understand and know to feel our emotions is to become

367
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:35,319
aware and begin to really feel them and sense them and at some point and our

368
01:01:35,319 --> 01:01:41,359
logical mind uh may have some recognition of what is happening but we

369
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:46,839
don't wanted to have our logical conceptual mind to always dictate

370
01:01:46,839 --> 01:01:55,000
everything has to happen based on what I read in the book you know okay and let yourself really feel into this

371
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:02,480
and once we bef friend fear and we keep practicing this way then um we can begin

372
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:09,599
to open ourselves to new kind of relationships with this kind of

373
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:16,559
emotion um and one of those really important

374
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:22,880
relationships is to not be afraid of our

375
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:28,440
fears oh yeah you know

376
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:35,319
um fear tend to have really bad rep and so we almost automatically have a sense

377
01:02:35,319 --> 01:02:40,440
that it needs to go away you know

378
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:48,640
um it doesn't work that way and so for me the turning point of my relationship

379
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:55,319
with fear was this point and that I recognized oh

380
01:02:55,319 --> 01:03:02,240
I don't have to be afraid of my own fear wow that's liberating okay you know

381
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:09,160
you're allowed to have them but they don't have to just immediately go away or don't have to

382
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:16,520
beat them up and then yeah I can just be not afraid of it and so

383
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:22,400
um and so that's the one possibility and uh when we're not

384
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:28,720
afraid emotions are our movements they actually have a chance to move through

385
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:34,119
us we kind of have this more open space for it to move through

386
01:03:34,119 --> 01:03:43,119
us and um befriending fear and becoming Fearless of a fear creates possibilities

387
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:51,960
for us to then uh establish a wide range of wise relationships with

388
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:59,680
fear I think a sooner are or later we all know there is no one siiz fitall

389
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:08,559
kind of way to be with this strong potent um domain of our lives and so we

390
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:14,559
um we needed to learn a wide range of skills and maybe cultivated capacities

391
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:21,319
to be able to relate to fear um and I use a couple of examples

392
01:04:21,319 --> 01:04:27,240
and you know because I said there's no one way so part of this is to discover

393
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:35,400
for ourselves what might be needed at different times uh sometimes uh those emotions can

394
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:41,079
be like tornado they're very overpowering you know it's in the middle

395
01:04:41,079 --> 01:04:47,200
of it's like wow you know it's just not steady and it's really strong we get

396
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:55,599
swept away and and how to be with that when it's very overpowering over

397
01:04:55,599 --> 01:05:04,119
overwhelming uh one thing to know is that um that is a strong form of energy

398
01:05:04,119 --> 01:05:11,920
so we have a choice to redirect the energy strong energy in some other way

399
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:17,079
and so you can get physical meaning not

400
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:23,440
to punch it away um but you can get moving get going

401
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:31,319
um go for a hike maybe a rigorous hike and um go do some exercise or

402
01:05:31,319 --> 01:05:37,839
movements and um being in nature sometimes allows us to have to to shift

403
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:45,480
that energy in some way it's not helpful when that kind of strong form of um uh

404
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:52,480
reactive energies are doing are doing its thing that we just going to um get

405
01:05:52,480 --> 01:06:00,400
stuck with it we kind of feel feel like there's absolutely no other option but know that there are other options

406
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:08,319
um in Chinese martial art and there are forms of chiong that when you're moving

407
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:15,160
with certain movements it releases uh certain emotions uh through the

408
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:20,520
movements and maybe in other um kind of a movements that has a certain kind of

409
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:27,480
effect on that and this is a skill it's not kind of some kind of Escape

410
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:33,079
it's something that we come to know oh this is the one way that I can be in

411
01:06:33,079 --> 01:06:41,000
this territory when it becomes overpowering and um doing this it's also

412
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:47,000
kind of like um a Chinese medicine and that is I know I'm using a lot of

413
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:52,359
Chinese things because that's my background uh in this domain so it's

414
01:06:52,359 --> 01:06:58,520
like Chinese medicine that often it's not targeted and so you work around it you

415
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:03,760
work around the system rather than kind of a being with it being with it we T

416
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:11,720
get looped in and overpowered by it and so uh redirecting your energy

417
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:20,119
into other uh forms can be very uh useful uh in uh other cultural

418
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:25,240
backgrounds sometimes uh in really strong

419
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:32,440
powerful uh emotional reactivity forces uh there uh they know they and they

420
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:41,319
don't have resources to be with that uh they chant they come to a temple they chant

421
01:07:41,319 --> 01:07:47,839
they chant out loud you know that kind of that that way of being with it some

422
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:55,119
people take refuges and just come and bow to the Buddha and bow to to a Buddha

423
01:07:55,119 --> 01:08:02,680
statue uh it can be a way to kind of shift our orientation and we don't not everyone

424
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:08,240
have that culture um background or kind of that way of a being with a really

425
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:14,559
strong forth and but that can be useful for um people and for

426
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:21,278
myself and uh in a strong ways I don't know what else I would do to be with

427
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:29,600
this I'll just come and really bow I bow a lot and when I finish I feel wow

428
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:37,679
something opens up in me or or something that was really bothering me and it's not there anymore okay I don't have to

429
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:44,278
solve them and

430
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:49,520
um maybe the last part uh that I'll talk

431
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:55,838
about oh no there is another aspect is so there is this overpowering uh time

432
01:08:55,839 --> 01:09:02,159
and then there are other times when uh you feel you're resourced enough you

433
01:09:02,159 --> 01:09:09,640
have the inner capacity uh to be with the fear just as they are then you have a choice to oh

434
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:15,880
yeah I'm just going to be here and feel it and see how it comes and how it goes

435
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:24,278
and and just be with it and there is um um suta in Ma nikaya and called

436
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:31,278
fear and dread and this is uh talking about and the Buddha meeting his own

437
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:39,238
fear and so uh before he's uh awakened so he lives in the

438
01:09:39,239 --> 01:09:46,040
wilderness you know there are fears come the tricks making sound and something

439
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:53,318
you know makes sounds and fear comes but um uh and he said you know

440
01:09:53,319 --> 01:10:01,080
I've developed a lot of capacities inner capacities to be with fear so so I'm

441
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:08,159
going to be with this and he used very specific language here and he

442
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:13,360
said when I'm walking if the fear

443
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:20,320
arises I'm not going to change my posture I'm just going to walk and be

444
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:28,199
with the fear until it goes away and if the fear comes when I was sitting

445
01:10:28,199 --> 01:10:34,520
I'm not going to change my posture I'm just going to sit and be with a fear

446
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:41,320
until it goes away and and so on so forth with the different postures it was

447
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:47,360
um quite interesting what is a pointing to is it

448
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:54,920
did not say that um I'm going to um I'm going to do something different

449
01:10:54,920 --> 01:11:02,360
to get rid of this or do something to fix it up but Buddha has a deep

450
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:08,040
understanding of the fear is a movement that comes and goes and he has the

451
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:15,560
capacity to just be with it without doing anything

452
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:23,000
different so not even changing the posture and so this is the uh the notion

453
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:29,239
of a being that with that terrified child that you don't do anything the

454
01:11:29,239 --> 01:11:34,800
system has its own way to dissolve to fade

455
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:41,639
away and as long as we are uh waiting to be with this that's

456
01:11:41,639 --> 01:11:50,320
good enough that's good enough not only that we can then really know fear in its

457
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:56,320
raw way not with what we believe leave needs to be you happening something

458
01:11:56,320 --> 01:12:01,400
needs to be happening so we can always go Tinker with it there always there a

459
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:07,560
force you know I got to do something you I got go interfere with this no it was

460
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:15,880
the instruction was so simple you know fear comes when I'm walking I'm just going to keep walking with

461
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:23,000
it so and that's a possibility doesn't mean doesn't mean any of this is the

462
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:31,080
only way um but it's an example of there may be a wide range of ways to be with

463
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:40,960
fear and the last piece that I'll talk about today is and as we uh cultivate wise

464
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:47,800
relationships with fear will come to know that this is a gradual training you

465
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:53,520
know it's not like you know we kind of there will be a lot of times that uh we

466
01:12:53,520 --> 01:13:00,960
get caught up or get stuck um but there is a way to cultiv cultivate a whole set

467
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:07,199
of inner capacities and resources and skills to become wiser and more

468
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:13,719
compassionate with uh fear and I'll um maybe name a few this

469
01:13:13,719 --> 01:13:19,920
might worth yet another talk of its own but I want the name of few and so some

470
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:25,000
of you are already cultivating this and you know yeah that's part of working

471
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:33,080
with a fear and so first one is to develop

472
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:39,040
Sila ethical conducts that can feel like it's so far away you know what it doesn't have

473
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:44,159
anything to do with fear well so many of our own worries and

474
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:51,719
concerns and fears has to do with I did something not quite uh you

475
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:57,639
know that can cause cause a sense of a concern for ourselves and concern that

476
01:13:57,639 --> 01:14:04,880
we get blamed or I just kind of cause a lot of uh emotions that doesn't sit in

477
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:10,520
ourselves very well and so when we know that we live in

478
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:17,760
this world are not harming in the way of killing or taking something

479
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:24,719
lying our heart and mind are at ease and the whole host of kind of kind

480
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:30,199
uh fear and worry would just not

481
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:36,880
come and the Buddha himself uh in this discourse uh spoke about yeah I'm kind

482
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:44,040
of really skilled in Sila I'm Skilling other um capacities the second one is

483
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:49,679
develop somebody collected mind settled mind

484
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:54,880
unified composed uh capacity

485
01:14:54,880 --> 01:15:01,760
somebody is a very beautiful uh inner resource and sometimes when we rest in

486
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:07,960
this peaceful quiet abiding we allow things to move through

487
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:14,440
us without being shaken by it and some people will say oh you know it feels

488
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:21,719
like a spiritual bypass not necessarily if this is the only way you deal with fear I would say

489
01:15:21,719 --> 01:15:28,360
yeah yeah may want to look into it but this can be a skillful resource if this

490
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:35,239
is one of the ways that that you can use to um to meet with the strong emotions

491
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:41,199
or different kinds of ways yeah uh meet with emotions and somebody is also a

492
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:47,840
very healing place a lot of physical uh things can heal a lot of emotional

493
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:56,040
things can can heal in this uh samadi space and and we don't have to do

494
01:15:56,040 --> 01:16:02,880
anything and third one is develop um paa and some some of you know this is Sila

495
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:09,120
Samar and paa uh three parts of the practice paa is

496
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:15,040
wisdom and we spoke a little bit about de developing wise

497
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:20,880
relationships and some of the deeper insight into the nature of our own uh

498
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:29,280
being and nature of uh our our lives uh when we have um when they

499
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:34,880
become available to us in our own livid experience

500
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:41,639
um it allows us to become become wise with many things not just the fear but

501
01:16:41,639 --> 01:16:49,800
many uh things and so for example uh one of the three key uh insights that arise

502
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:55,159
through the cultivation of AIA is the uh

503
01:16:55,159 --> 01:17:01,360
um anicha impermanence and so when we know fear is

504
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:08,840
impermanent emotions are impermanent and we know that deeply within

505
01:17:08,840 --> 01:17:15,239
ourselves then we can begin to have um a different relationship with it it's when

506
01:17:15,239 --> 01:17:21,400
we only feel like we're so stuck this is never going away you know then we kind

507
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:27,320
of like we start having you know just kind of a different relation kind of you

508
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:33,800
know feisty relationship with but when we know deeply this is moving this is

509
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:40,320
flow this is impermanent something else can open

510
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:46,719
up um developing Brahma viharas loving

511
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:54,880
kindness compassion uh equinity joy and so for me me that example I use

512
01:17:54,880 --> 01:18:02,760
for merging onto Express langing is some of this um Brahma bhara practice has a

513
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:09,000
momentary uh fruit a bearing fruit in that moment in fact the story about The

514
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:16,600
Meta practice came about the monks got haunted by the tree Spirit like like oh I can't practice

515
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:23,239
here and then the Buddha said uh you know I'm going to teach you a loving kindness practice and so they become

516
01:18:23,239 --> 01:18:29,320
Fearless with a tree Spirit the last one but not the least

517
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:36,639
one and is Kalia namita it's so good we don't have to do this

518
01:18:36,639 --> 01:18:43,400
alone um we can practice this together and this room full and all the people

519
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:51,360
who are on YouTube if we're in a dangerous situation right now here together and

520
01:18:51,360 --> 01:19:00,920
there's one person in this situation can express peace wow that gives everybody a

521
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:06,040
possibility it doesn't mean that we have to be like that all the time but if one

522
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:11,679
us one of us in one situation have a capacity to show up

523
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:16,719
with calm and ease and love that's good

524
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:23,120
enough and so we don't have to do this alone and we're always being affected by

525
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:29,280
each other and so allow that to uplift us and

526
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:35,600
to allow all of our own practice maybe to affect people all

527
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:43,320
around so I'm going to end that uh with this note um by just appreciating us

528
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:51,679
practicing together and um explore dhma together and may this benefit all beings

529
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:54,840
everywhere yeah
