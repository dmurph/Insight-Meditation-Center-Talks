00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,960
and considering meta as a way of

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:44,160
homecoming coming home to ourselves only coming home to ourselves

7
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,600
no matter what is going on whether we feel

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:56,559
challenged tired over exuberant whatever it might be

9
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:04,000
going on it's all okay it's all okay i'm coming home

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,600
coming home to to ourselves with

11
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,759
showing up for ourselves with a sense of showing up showing up even if sometimes

12
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:22,000
it might be so hard to just do that and and it's okay for all human beings there

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,560
might be times that it's hard to show up and we still do it we just crawl we crawl and

14
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:37,040
show up like okay i'm here now what ah it's okay it's okay

15
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,799
you've showed up you've showed up you've showed up you are here you're whole

16
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,078
you're home in your body your home in your heart

17
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:55,200
ah and landing with things just as they are so

18
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:02,159
so relating to meta not as a grim duty not as something that we should

19
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,640
cultivate that we should do it's a should but it's coming home

20
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,879
there's nothing that needs to be done if you tonight as i lead it if you feel like

21
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:21,280
using the phrases great if you don't want to use the phrases don't

22
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,800
this is just sense of kind presence kind presence coming home

23
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,200
coming home reconnecting with yourself connecting arriving being

24
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,360
with with care and that sometimes that's enough that's all we need sometimes

25
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,879
there's more energy for more for cultivation for phrases for for

26
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:51,440

27
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,560
what is here so whether today

28
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,000
you're in the space where you just want to be with what is gently just ever so

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,560
gently or if there's more space to expand and hold it's all good

30
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,319
but i'm leading us into a more gentle way of

31
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,319

whole crowd of sorrows as in the poem translated from roomie by coleman barks

give back your heart to itself to the stranger who has loved you all your life

172
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:17,280
whom you ignored for another sit

173
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,839
feast on your life

174
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:19,520
thank you all thank you for your practice may we all feel home

175
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:24,800
welcome ourselves home in every moment

176
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:33,200
of being so

177
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:38,240
as i mentioned during the guided meditation

178
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:46,640
i mean the meta phrases we the first one is to wish ourselves

179
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:52,640
and others safety may you may i be safe from inner and outer harm there's the sense of

180
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:59,839
may you be safe there's this wish for for that so another way the way we

181
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:06,720
found ourselves in ted today is feeling at home feeling safe

182
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:13,839
again for most people maybe not for everyone but home has a sense of connotation of

183
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:19,599
safety ease meta love so

184
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:24,720
really holding ourselves greeting ourselves

185
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,640
at our own door as derek wellicott put it this feeling

186
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:37,280
of being at home is a way of expressing meta metta is not one thing it's not just the

187
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:43,119
phrases it's just there's so many ways to practice cultivating good will

188
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:48,240
kindness well-being for ourselves

189
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:54,480
so that we can offer it to the world filling our own cup so that we can then

190
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:01,838
offer it to the whole world so so with that

191
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:10,079

yeah um thank you so much and uh i i couldn't help but smiling at the

203
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:40,640
beginning uh when you uh talked about just showing up and uh that's about what i did tonight

204
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:47,440
and um uh but it was great and it was um as somebody just mentioned

205
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:54,640
just uh just what i needed and um so i i thank you so much and um

206
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:00,960
and i was thinking a bit about uh this sort of um letting b

207
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:09,359
and or making space and it's sort of harking back to our conversation last friday about

208
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:16,800
you know tonight is or other sort of issues that one might be having and um

209
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,400
and so it was really helpful for me as i was sort of

210
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:28,000
just incurably stiff back and just going oh welcome steph back

211
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,760
and um thank you thank you don

212
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:39,119
thank you for that reflection and and beautiful that you showed up you

213
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:44,640
showed up that's that's that's all there is to life showing up for

214
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:50,880
ourselves feeling at home thank you don for those wonderful reflections and also

215
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:57,119
connecting this to our conversation on friday with making space and

216
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:04,000
welcoming yeah bill asks how do you welcome unwelcome

217
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,079
house guests like anxiety oh yes yes yes yes

218
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:16,560
claire says what a wonderful concept i'm not sure if it's about that but i'll assume it is yes of course that's

219
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:21,680
exactly the idea so so anxiety too

220
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:28,960
um [Music] pain anxiety tinnitus you you name it

221
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:34,000
making space for all of these especially anxiety

222
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,960
if you try to push it away if you if you try to um

223
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,160
you know anxiety can be like a wild horse with energy

224
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:53,839
and if you try to put it in a small pen and contract it it actually or or push it

225
00:43:53,839 --> 00:44:00,480
away it doesn't quite work so treating it as an unwelcome guest

226
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:07,440
bill and others would be actually giving in more energy it causes more suffering

227
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:14,079
whereas the guest is here already you know anxiety is visiting right it's

228
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:19,359
like you can't ignore guess that's like it's it's delusion if you try to fight

229
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:25,839
reality if you try to fight a guess who's here you're not gonna win i mean

230
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:31,359
or rather if you try to fight reality reality always wins

231
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:37,359
so so a um a guest such as anxiety is part of

232
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:43,680
reality so not fighting not trying to push it away but being

233
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:51,119
skillful with it giving it space giving it space similar to tinnitus so how what does

234
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:59,119
that look like for anxiety imagine that it's a wild it's there's a

235
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:05,200
that the wild horse again if you put it in a small pan it'll kick the door open

236
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:13,200
but imagine you give it a whole white pasture and i've had many practitioners report that this method actually this

237
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:20,160
way of treating it works so and i've explored it myself so the

238
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:27,440
anxiety can be there oh yes run around yes but there is so much space

239
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:33,920
there is feeling at home anxiety can be there it's not the focus

240
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:39,760
it's not the only thing that has that gets the megaphone

241
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:46,079
um so that's the way you would work with get there are no unwelcome guests if you

242
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:52,560
if you call them unwelcome then you're already working with them in the way

243
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:59,359
that um that's that's that's giving them more

244
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:07,119
energies like trying to push them away and just pushing away as i described in detail on friday actually hooks them up

245
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:13,800
hooks them in place trying to push them away helps them in place

246
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:21,119
laura asks about tinnitus yes uh we talked about tinnitus and similar

247
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:29,359
things on friday so that is on audio dharma and also on youtube so you're welcome to

248

249
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:43,920

250
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:52,560

251
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:58,319

252
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:05,599
lovely saga and i know that folks appreciate showing up for each other so

253
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:10,880
again tonight showing up for yourself showing up for each other

254
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:19,760
in groups and starting with 15 seconds of silent meta

255
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:25,359
and then sharing as little or as much as you like just showing up that's all it takes so

256
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:32,720
rooms are created take care of yourselves take care of each other welcome back everyone

257
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:37,839
rooms are closed and we have a couple of minutes for reflections and

258
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:44,160
deborah's hand was up so deborah i invite yes great fantastic here you are

259
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:50,720
i hope it is still relevant to people but when you talked about anxiety someone brought up anxiety it reminded

260
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:56,079
me of a beautiful story that a friend a spiritual teacher peter rangel said

261
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:01,200
he said that one time he and his little boy when he was like six years old was in his hot tub

262
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:08,800
and it started getting really dark and the little boy got really scared and his dad said well that's just fear

263
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:15,040
and the little boy said hello fear and then a little while later

264
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:21,040
he said goodbye fear and then the next night

265
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:27,440
they were there and he didn't say anything about the fear he just said hello fear

266
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,960
so you reminded me like we can just say hello anxiety and then it takes it away

267
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:39,200
from enveloping us in some way sometimes yeah it's i i love

268
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:45,440
that story deborah thanks for sharing and in this way it's also it's not an unwelcome guest right it's transforming

269
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:53,680
by seeing and saying hello fear hello anxiety hi welcome here you are yeah my old friend

270
00:48:53,680 --> 00:49:01,599
my old friend my more and more my more and more present friend

271
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:07,760
