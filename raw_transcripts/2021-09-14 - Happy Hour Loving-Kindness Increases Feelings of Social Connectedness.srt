1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,600
so hello hello everyone hello and welcome

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:13,160
to this edition of happy hour so so

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,240
for for those of us who have been practicing uh meta

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,560
loving kindness for a while um we know

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,680
we trust we have a sense of the shift and changes

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,920
that happen over time when we practice both for ourselves the way we relate to

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,960
others and

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:50,399
and uh there have also been studies on loving kindness practice

9
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:57,600
um research studies psychological studies etc etc and sometimes it's kind of nice to see

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,000
things that we already know again verified oh yeah we know this

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,520
already and yet here it is it's kind of fun you know we don't necessarily need

12
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:16,880
validation from science and yet it's kind of fun when both come through and as a as a scientist myself you know

13
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,119
there are times that um anyway that's a much longer conversation i will get into that but

14
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,479
just to say so something i want to bring in tonight is um

15
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:34,079
is a study that was done in 2008 and

16
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:42,079
it has a pretty cool title so the title is loving-kindness meditation

17
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:48,560
increases social connectedness increases social connectedness

18
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,240
and it's a study done by hutcherson

19
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:03,119
emotion various places and basically let's just say a few were since i brought it in they brought

20
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,119
people into the lab they had them do a short loving kindness meditation

21
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,560
and then they measure the sense of you know

22
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:21,280
their their sense of friendliness or connection towards

23
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,120
others towards strangers and so so um

24
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:34,720
so one sentence that they have at the end which i particularly like especially at the time of kovit

25
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:41,920
at the time of many of us being socially isolated all of us having less social connections

26
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,840
than we did a couple years ago the sentence says the results suggest

27
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,920
that this easily implemented technique may help to increase positive social

28
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:00,480
emotions and decrease social isolation ah

29
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,720
kind of fun and yet this is what we know already we know that when we practice meta when we

30
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:15,599
practice loving kindness for ourselves for others even if we don't see our loved ones

31
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:23,200
there is a sense of being connected to ourselves being connected to others being connected to life there's this

32
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:30,319
sense of connection because again we know again from other studies and

33
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:37,519
our own experience that when we imagine something that imagination if you imagine

34
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,720
you are hitting a golf ball or you're imagining doing a particular exercise

35
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,720
actually there's some more recent research that that shows that if you imagine doing

36
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,720
for example some weight training actually your muscles get slightly more toned

37
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,640
you don't actually have to be weight lifting those weights so so this act of

38
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,840
bringing something to our imagination whether it's physical exercise which

39
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,920
amazingly actually changes the structure of our body our physical

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,040
muscles and not so different in terms of our psychology for imagining in our hearts

41
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:26,240
in our minds being connected with others wishing them well wishing them well wishing them well

42
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,160
there is a sense of connection we feel less lonely we feel less alone

43
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,160
um so and the opposite way if we don't

44
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,600
practice or if there's a sense of lack of

45
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,840
meta lack of good will or say ill will towards ourselves ill will towards

46
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,639
others you might have noticed there is more sense of alienation we

47
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,960
feel more alienated from ourselves we feel more alienated from others

48
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:10,560
as if we don't belong as if there's a sense of this social

49
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,600
uh fabric gets disconnected when there's a sense of ill will

50
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,360
so so we know this already we know we know

51
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,120
this and i bring this this one study for example as a way to remind us to remind

52
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:34,160
us remind us of what we already know in a different way

53
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:41,039
so coming together practicing in the sangha with a happy hour sangha and also there

54
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:48,800
is a sense of social connection of coming together in sangha whether on zoom or youtube

55
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,639
so as we practice loving kindness tonight um

56
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,479
for ourselves for others sense of how

57
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,400
tuning in tuning into the sense of social connection that

58
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,960
it actually fosters in the way of well-being both for ourselves and the way we show

59
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,360
up for others so

60
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,560
so that is the setup for tonight

61
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,400
let's get started in our formal practice so

62
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:37,120
i'd like to invite you to land in your body to arrive

63
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,720
to settle to connect

64
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,479
to invite your heart to your mind your awareness

65
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:59,000
to connect with this body with yourself

66
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,478
hello body

67
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,918
hello breath

68
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,360
greeting ourselves creating the sensations

69
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,520
of this moment's experience inviting the body to relax

70
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,360
to let go of any tightness or tension

71
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:49,120
nothing needed in this moment nothing to do nowhere to go

72
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:56,080
just relaxing all the muscles ah

73
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,080
receiving

74
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,400
taking refuge in this moment

75
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,000
unlike thoughts to be put down

76
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,320
thank you not now

77
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:15,440
receiving each in-breath the entirety of the opera

78
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,720
settling arriving landing

79
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,839
one breath at a time

80
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,800
this

81
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,360
spending a few more minutes to just arrive and settle

82
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,240
with the breath and the body

83
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:07,839
and let's begin our meta practice

84
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,480
by extending good wealth to this being who is me

85
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:23,680
greeting this person who might be tired

86
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:30,079
might be distracted [Music] it had ups and downs today which we

87
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:36,399
intimately know their challenges

88
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,440
meeting with friendliness with kindness

89
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:56,639
wishing well for the being who is me

90
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,240

92
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,959
may i have ease in my life

93
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,839

95
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,839

98
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,839

99
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,720

100
00:16:52,880 --> 00:17:00,320

may i love and accept myself just as i am

102
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,559
i invite you to experiment with putting palm of your hand

103
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:51,120
the middle of your chest your proverbial heart center just to connect with yourself connecting

104
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:57,200
the physicality of your palm with your chest

105
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,400
just connecting with this person with this being who's you holding yourself

106
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,039

imagining both of you perhaps being together sitting together

towards you sometimes equally including both of you in your loving kindness

132

167
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:54,240
name and reflection and if you haven't shared verbally for a while you're welcome to

168

169
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,440
as i wait for your reflections i'll share something that

170
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,640
i noticed that for me today practicing that

171
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:18,240
the beginning you know i'm pretty tired tonight and i was tired and as the practice continued

172
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:25,760
i found myself smiling and smiling more and more sharing meta for

173
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,359
for dear ones and including myself and expanding the circle and it just became

174
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:36,880
so joyful but i had so much gratitude i felt so much

175
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:42,000
gratitude for doing this practice i'm happier than

176
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,280
than before we started so that's my practice report

177
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:53,838
what did you notice eric please

178
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,319
everyone i just noticed um when i got distracted

179
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:06,480
near the end of the sitting it was i just went back to the practice without

180
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:12,800
kind of scolding myself being distracted and i've been doing a lot of concentration practice and i wonder if

181
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:19,359
since i did meta practice this time that it just kind of primed me to not need to scold myself the

182
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:25,200
more generous nice nice

183
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:30,720
thank you for sharing that eric and i know it's actually very significant is

184
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:36,800
um you know that metta is also a concentration practice

185
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,880
is isham at the practice you know that um and

186
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:48,400
also that your if you're you know you might be practicing anapanasati

187
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:55,119
mindfulness of the breath as your practice concentration practice just so

188
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:03,280
you know you already know this but so that you you hear it again if you don't scold yourself there also

189
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,720
the mind will settle and become absorbed and settled and calm

190
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:15,760
much more quickly so this practice of meta can be really helpful with mindfulness of the breath

191
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,800
practice also so yeah yes beautiful that you discovered you were not

192
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:30,119
scolding yourself yay that is yeah very significant thank you for that

193
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:36,800
jamie please um well nikki first off i just want to

194
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:43,200
thank you for um you're saying that um i accept myself and love myself just as

195
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:49,280
i am that was just such a wonderful thing to to say to myself um i mean it was just

196
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,880
like a gift thank you um and yeah i just wonder if you have

197
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,480
any comments on um sex and sexual energy as part of meditation and i'll tell you

198
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:06,880
why um i thought about my dear one today was a friend who's who's kind of recently

199
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:15,040
revisited and redefined her sexual orientation and um i as i thought about her i um

200
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:22,240
my wish for her i said may you have sex that makes you feel more alive more connected

201
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:28,480
to your partner and more joyous and after saying that to her

202
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,680
i thought i want that and it was really easy to extend to

203
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:39,680
other friends and people i know and to the whole world because i thought everyone will be better with that

204
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:45,839
and i i have to admit i have like i become aware of my own sexual energy

205
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:52,000
sometimes during meditation it's just not a topic i've ever heard discussed in my uh still budding practice so i wonder if

206
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,880
you have any suggestions or response to that yeah thank you for

207
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,720
bringing that in very important um so with respect to this particular

208
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:09,839
because sexual energy is such a big topic but i'll keep my comment in this

209
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:16,000
case um specific to what you asked and what you came what came up for you regarding your

210
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:23,680
friend and your wish and it felt really genuine and joyous that you're wishing them well given the transition

211
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:30,160
yay may you have well-being in this area of your life that must have been confusing and challenging for you dear

212
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:36,960
friend and then and then oh i may i have that too and may so many people have that yay

213
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:43,839
so so in the way that i'm hearing that and also us being lay people

214
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:49,520
um to me the way it sounds to me it feels like your wish of well-being may you

215
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:57,920
have wholesome well-being experience that brings you joy that's how i'm hearing it so yay beautiful

216
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:05,599
and now bringing a little bit of historical context these practices most of the practices that are

217
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:11,440
taught are taught to monastics and monastics are celibate

218
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,800
so sexuality and sexual energy is something that they renounce renounce

219
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:22,800
when they enter uh monastic life which is not the case for our us lay

220
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,079
people so and and um so

221
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:34,400
just to put the historical context you know traditionally you would not see or hear this like that but you know it

222
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:40,800
would be kind of funny for monks to be wishing that for themselves or others it's like feels right and

223
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:47,520
given that again they've given it up or announced it and yet given [Music] that we are lay people and the spirit

224
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:52,640
with which you shared this jaime it feels like a good will wish may

225
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:58,319
you have happiness in different areas of your life you know the way we wish may you be happy or may

226
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:04,400
you have happiness in this sexual area of your life with with partnership so

227
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:09,839
um sounds good to me if that brings you joy this is there's a way of way for you to

228
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:17,040
express your good will then it feels wholesome to me in this context thank you very for bringing that

229
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:21,520
up thank you thank you

230
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:27,920
and we have a reflection from dawn the research is really

231
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:33,359
interesting i feel disconnected at times so good to hear about this as a means to

232
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:41,200
feel more connected thanks for sharing this you are very welcome and in fact i will share the the link

233
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:48,240
in the chat when you come back so so given that today's theme is about

234
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:55,040
connection and interconnection especially if you are on zoom and these

235
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:00,319
are the times that you think okay we're going to do small groups bye bye if you can stay

236
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:07,599
given that it is about connection interconnection challenge yourself gently gently to stay

237
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:15,280
to stay see what happens if you have connection especially if there have been any moments of lack of connection or

238
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:21,760
loneliness throughout your day see what happens if you stay you don't have to say anything brilliant just show up and

239
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:28,400
just be silent but just show up in the small group that's my invitation and if you absolutely have to go because of the

240
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,599
commitment no judgment but please don't jump off just out of fear

241
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:39,920
of connecting with other human beings so with that we're going to turn our

242
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:46,800
attention now into small groups um and practicing together

243
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:54,319
would be groups of maybe three or four and feel free to share anything you like

244
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:59,760
about your practice we'll start with 15 seconds of silent meta

245
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:06,960
for yourself for each other and the rooms are created and i'm going to

246
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:13,520
open them up and here you go take care of yourself take care of each other

247
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:21,760
okay welcome back everyone the rooms are closed

248
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:29,119
so we have just a couple of minutes for any reflections uh oh and also i'll post the

249
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:35,640
information about the study uh violet please

250
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:41,119
hey so um so yesterday i was

251
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:49,040
walking alone in berkeley in a residential neighborhood and a man came up to me and

252
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:54,480
basically harassed me tried to touch me like sort of like walked after me

253
00:48:54,480 --> 00:49:01,599
and i did you know my usual defensive practices that most women know how to do in those situations

254
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:08,079
and he came up for me during the meditation tonight in the form of like connection

255
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:13,200
of like feeling connected to this man in some way and just like my

256
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:18,880
heart was breaking for his loneliness and his lack of connection

257
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:24,160
like how deluded must he be that that's his only way that he even

258
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:31,200
knows how to reach out to people or like is trying to get some kind of connection with people and it

259
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:37,359
yeah and it just it broke my heart in like a really sort of lovely and scary way to feel

260
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:40,160
connected to him

261
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:47,680
thank you violet i feel so touched and i see others are

262
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:53,359
too by by sharing your practice

263
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:59,200
it's it's amazing right it's amazing and of course you did what

264
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:06,079
was appropriate to the defensive at the time and yet not to carry that as a

265
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:11,839
resentment and hatred but ah to feel a sense of compassion for

266
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:19,520
this person who must be so isolated and disconnected just really speaks to the beauty and

267
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:27,160
transformation of your heart thank you violet thank you so much for sharing this

268
