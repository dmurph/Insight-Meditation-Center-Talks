37
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,520
today so um so for the theme of today's practice i have to say

38
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,759
i've been really relishing the the mudita practice really getting to

39
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:16,000
the habit of it and usually in happy hour you know before we started this regular

40
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:24,080
theme of going through the one brahmavihara like metta and then we did compassion

41
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:31,360
and then beta we would you know do different things different night but it's the consistency is nice to explore

42
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:38,560
one uh practice for a period of time and kind of explore it

43
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,240
for the heart to get um some footing in it if there are challenges which is fine so

44
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,759
so if you've had challenges with with vicarious joy empathic and pathetic

45
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,919
joy um it's and you think oh we're gonna do more pathetic joy

46
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:03,840
actually let it be yay we're gonna do a more pathetic job because you get to explore it you really get to explore

47
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,360
what can work for you what is challenging so instead of just doing

48
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,440
it for you know one session and then moving on to the next it's like when you're traveling if

49
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:21,840
you're you know there are these tours where each day you know you're in a different city so

50
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:28,639
you kind of get a little bit of it i don't know real wind experience so but it's kind of nice to explore

51
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:36,880
walk the walk the city the walls really get a sense of it so this is just like that so so

52
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:45,039
um so we'll explore the practice of vicarious joy one more time and and a show of hands

53
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:52,800
would be helpful who is new either to happier or to or to this practice of vicarious joy and

54
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:00,639
you can click on reactions and then raise your hand which is below on the bottom of

55
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:09,520
the various things so i get a sense of how many people are new to this practice of vicarious joy mudita

56
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,960
i'm not seeing anyone raise their hand so seems like you've all showed up in the

57
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:22,479
past few days and practiced before okay great so

58
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,840
it's helpful to know so um one more thing i want to say before we

59
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,440
start about this practice is um

60
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,039
yeah given that you've all practiced with this before

61
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:45,599
as none of you raised your hand we've been doing it now for about a week a couple of weeks

62
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:53,200
um yeah while you're doing it also be a scientist of your own mind

63
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:01,040
see what are the ways that you can really connect with happiness of others happiness of yourself

64
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:07,519
and and in what ways um

65
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,360
yeah what what are the challenges and try to be gentle with yourself and working with those challenges and

66
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:20,560
maybe what aspects bring up jealousy if any or envy and just be both be a practitioner and also

67
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,800
a scientist observer of what's happening and kevin on youtube says uh they're new

68
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:33,600
great and so is jonathan great so yeah you we can all also

69
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:40,160
uh attend to this practice as if that's the other aspect of it even

70
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:47,440
though many of you have done this before attend to it with a beginner's mind

71
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:54,880
as suzuki roshi said in beginner's mind there are lots of possibilities it's

72
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:01,120
open to possibilities it's open to exploring open to being surprised

73
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,880
open to learning whereas the expert mind oh i've done

74
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:13,040
this practice before i know what's going to happen oh it's closed to the possibilities it's

75
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,320
close to the surprises they're always surprises so

76
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:25,040
i'm inviting all of us including myself to have a beginner's mind

77
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:31,839
today with the practice of vicarious joy and at the end i'll ask you did you

78
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:40,160
notice something did you observe anything that surprised you about your practice tonight so

79
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,240
so this will be yeah so let's bring a sense of curiosity

80
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:52,959
newness beginner's mind to our practice today just one more thing to say about the

81
00:10:52,959 --> 00:11:00,320
practice of vicarious joy it's about cultivating joy

82
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:07,200
it's about turning our hearts to joy happiness for our own happiness and happiness for

83
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:14,320
the happiness of others and it's a happy making practice

84
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:21,040
especially supporting us to have more joy in our hearts and in our life not as

85
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:29,200
a way to avoid and turn away from challenges but as a way to make more space

86
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:36,640
to be more available to have more resilience to think about it that way okay so enough

87
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:43,519
introduction let's do it so i'd like to invite us all

88
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:49,040

all thoughts all preoccupations that have come before

94
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,720

let your forehead be smooth

110
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:58,320
let the inner muscles of your face behind your eyes

111
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:07,199
behind your cheeks behind your chin behind your ears

112
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:20,079
fight all the muscles internal in your face

113
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,839
ah to let go

114
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,560
resting the attention resting in the belly

115
00:15:52,720 --> 00:16:09,839
noticing each in breath and out breathe

116
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,038
as you let go of any tension in the body

117
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,799
letting the tension drop

118
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:40,000
with each out breath relaxing softening even more

119
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,640
and if your thoughts are rising

120
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:53,600
with each outbreak letting them go [Music] releasing your hand as if they're helium

121
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:02,960
balloons letting them float away gently coming back to the breath

122
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:15,840
in the belly just settle in the right

123
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,400
attending paying attention gently

124
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:19,200
to the breath in the abdomen with a beginner's mind as if this

125
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:26,320
is a new breath it is a new breath you don't you haven't

126
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:35,919
met this one see see how this in-breath this out

127
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:44,640
breath is new is a little different

128
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,840
made it fresh right here in the moment

129
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,080
no preconceptions

130
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:07,840
beginner's mind fresh

131
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,880
the thoughts are arising in this moment ask yourself

132
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,799
whatever i'm thinking is it necessary to think about this right now

133
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:54,879
now the sense of humor about it kind of laugh at yourself it's okay let it go

134
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:06,799
no judgment ah see how this works so much better

135
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,679
than chastising yourself

136
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:27,840
the smile coming back to the breath and the body to settle

137
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,880
and let's start

138
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:22,480
our sympathic and pathetic pathetic joy practice by bringing

139
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,640
to mind someone for whom your care

140
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:34,480
flows easily you care for them

141
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:42,640
maybe when you think of them the smile shows up there's just a sense of ease safety with this

142
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,240
this being and that you naturally feel happy when they're happy you feel

143
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:57,360
happy for them for their good fortune bringing up bringing to mind this

144
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:06,799
this deer this deer being either human or pet or a child

145
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,320
and feeling [Music] their presence and bringing to mind

146
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,840
something they're happy about something that's a good fortune in their life

147
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:30,840
a blessing something they cherish they take

148
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:37,120
delighted and know that not every aspect of their life needs to be happy

149
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,158
they could have plenty of challenges but this aspect

150
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,690
they're happy about they're grateful for and you feel happy for them

151
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:52,640
[Music] you celebrate it with them

152
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:03,200
start where it's easy where it's really easy

153
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:15,840
not a complicated relationship

154
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:34,240
and seeing this being happy delighting grateful for this blessing in their life

155
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:40,559
for this goodness and you as a person who cares about them

156
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:46,400
loves them sharing sharing their happiness

157
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:58,720
i'm happy for your good fortune i'm happy for your happiness

158
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,278

202
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:40,000
savor them long enough to have honored them

203
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:49,838
before moving on to the next

204
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:41,839
letting your heart expand enjoy gladness for your own gladness

205
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:44,640
and notice something perhaps surprising or new about the way

206
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:52,319
this practice is unfolding for you in this moment

207
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:05,838
or something some way you need to relate to it for it to expand

208
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:19,839
and connect

209
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:08,480
perhaps notice also how gladness for your own good fortune

210
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,880
naturally turns to a sense of gratitude even if we don't call it that

211
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:29,838
that's what it becomes naturally

212
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:59,839
now bringing to mind

213
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:11,760
again your dear being [Music] inviting them back

214
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:18,720
and this being who also cares about you

215
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:25,839
to see them happy for your your happiness see them delight

216
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:34,160
celebrate reflecting your joy

217
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,839
happiness for your good fortune

218
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:55,920
let yourself receive this reflected joy your joy reflected in someone else

219
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:07,838
who cares about you

220
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:17,920
notice if there are aspects of this reflection back and forth that are nuanced

221
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,838
and new and interesting to land into

222
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:35,839
perhaps see them looking at you with happy eyes

223
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:50,240
celebrating what you're glad about

224
00:41:53,839 --> 00:42:03,838
even if it's something small or subtle saying their gladness for you

225
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:17,839
may not be as big as a celebration but just simple quietness

226
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:31,760
and now as if joining their gladness for your

227
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,960
gladness joining your own gladness for you all

228
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:45,838
for your very own happiness both of you happy for your happiness

229
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:59,838
for this goodness

230
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:09,200
as if both of you are dancing with joy for this goodness in your heart

231
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,838
in your life

232
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:36,480
and see how you need to modify what blessing you need to consider

233
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,839
for this practice to really connect for you

234
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:05,119
and for the last moments considering that everyone practicing with you in this

thank you thank you all for your practice

250
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:16,960
so wondering what you noticed with your beginner's mind and your practice tonight

251
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:24,480
i noticed so much joy expanses as if my heart was beaming with

252
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:30,720
bright light in this practice and also the reflection which we hadn't done

253
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:38,880
the past few nights this reflection of one's own gladness in somebody else reflected that

254
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:46,720
adds more nuance more delight more celebration really celebratory mirroring reflecting and

255
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:52,800
mirroring that was just lovely so that's what i noticed and would love

256
00:46:52,800 --> 00:47:00,079
to hear what you notice you can raise your hand you can type it in chat

257
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:05,839
if you type directly to me i won't say your name it'll be private if you type to everyone

258
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:14,400
i'll say it out loud and of course you are invited to raise your head and share what you noticed

259
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:21,440
what worked what was challenging it's all good so

260
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,838
take it away

261
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:53,280
yes please carlo and shivani is it carla or giovanni

262
00:47:53,280 --> 00:48:00,800
great carla please i noticed today um there was still some uh some

263
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:07,920
tightness that i hadn't had in the last couple days it was more euphoric the last couple days but i noticed i

264
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:13,359
could still go from tightness to feeling joy and

265
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:21,280
happiness and go back and it would come back and then go back so it was like it didn't

266
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:28,000
it didn't go all one way but it didn't go all the other way so i could balance kind of between the two which

267
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,079
was kind of nice i didn't get lost in one tightness for me it was exact opposite

268
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:41,119
it was easy today and i felt like i'm feeling warm

269
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:48,079
like i was excited and like a whole body warmth sort of like heat not even warmth but

270
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:55,200
heat kind of came i still have it so yeah it was exciting today

271
00:48:55,200 --> 00:49:02,720
lovely beautiful thank you both for your reflections i i feel warmed by

272
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:09,040
by both of your reflections this is lovely i have one question for you carlo

273
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:16,079
when noticing the tightness and and then the the the gladness the joy of the

274
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:23,280
practice and then ah the tightness would come back uh and there was gladness of not being lost or

275
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:29,440
just in the tightness did you notice was there something that mediated

276
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:36,960
or or or brought the tightness back or in anything you noticed curious and if

277
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:42,319
you didn't it's all good um i

278
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:48,160
i don't think it was a thought that brought the tightness back i think it was just

279
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:54,480
um yes and just sensations of of tightness kind of being

280
00:49:54,640 --> 00:50:01,280
disconnected from my my heart and then get reconnected again be up in

281
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:07,680
my head not just even in thinking just sensorially so it was kind of that um

282
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:14,160
dance i see okay okay great i appreciate the clarity of the

283
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:19,839
observation so so one invitation for you and others who would kind of notice the

284
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:26,000
oh the titan is somewhere maybe it's in the head it's higher up it's not quite connected to the heart center or this

285
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:34,079
feeling which is what i'm picking up you say did i pick that up correctly yeah so one is what um

286
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:40,319
one is to actually try to to settle into your body some more and try

287
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:47,440
to expand the sense of subtleness of the heart center and in the in the abdomen kind of settle in and

288
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:54,480
expand and if the tightness kind of is is kind of expand to if

289
00:50:54,480 --> 00:51:00,720
land into this more in order to for the tightness to be included for it

290
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:07,760
not to be separate okay does that make sense what i'm pointing to yeah i think i'll have to try it and

291
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:17,040
yeah great great awesome great thank you so much thanks to both of you sweet emily says the practice felt so

293
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:31,520

294
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:38,319
thank you emily it's lovely the way you've put it expanded the impact of the blessings

295
00:51:38,319 --> 00:51:46,400

298
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:11,200
so so dear ones this is a great time to bring our practice into

299
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:16,960
this sense of gladness and gratitude that can actually feel even bigger when we

300
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:23,520
practice in real time with others so this is the invitation for tonight and don't hop off just yet

301
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:30,640
for those of you who are a little shy about practicing with others in the small groups what what you guys

302
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:36,319
have shared is the 30 seconds of silent joy silent modita for each other just

303
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:41,359
seeing each other's um images on screen and feeling happy for

304
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:46,480
each other's blessings you don't yet know what they are but everybody has blessings just feeling

305
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:52,640
happy may happiness continue and see what it feels like when you do that in real time for

306
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:59,200
someone you don't know or you've just met maybe um and then after the 30 seconds of silence

307
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:04,640

310
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,960
closed in your heart but now see what it feels like real time because in this way you

311
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:26,559
can actually take it to the real world when somebody at work when somebody a

312
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:32,400
friend when then some stranger says something then yay

in small groups so so i will actually invite you to

316
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:56,079
start practicing by looking at each other on the screen feeling happy for each

317
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:04,480
other's happiness while i set up the groups it'll take me a moment to do that uh

318
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:13,119
and and okay and um

319
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:20,079

321

323
01:01:54,559 --> 01:02:01,039

324
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:08,480

325
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:13,760
meet you it's it's sweet it warms my heart

326
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:20,240
like i catch the tail end of some of your your warm-hearted connection and conversation it's sweet

327
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:27,200
so so we have a minute uh if you like to um share

328
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:33,599
share reflections uh yeah yeah bill says i find this practice more

329
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:42,079
challenging than just meta but i don't understand why um yeah i um it can be

330
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:48,240
this can be more it can be a little more complicated than than meta there's more happening here

331
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:54,240
it's not just good will but it's it's meeting um good um

332
01:02:54,240 --> 01:03:00,000
the good fortune of others with good will so there is more there that can come up and it is a purification

333
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,839
practice so yes it is a little more challenging in general it's more complicated different things can come up

334
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:10,880
so and and it's good to stay with it even if intellectually don't quite understand

335
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:18,559
what's going on both for you and others who are finding this a little more difficult stay with it gently gently gently

336
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:24,000
remember that maybe with the times you found bento challenging if any of you did like oh yeah through

337
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:31,440
practice it becomes a little easier and i see neil's hand is up so yes neil please

338
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:36,799
so you know i i find this very difficult too right i find

339
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:42,559
generally i just lose focus right which you know i mean happens of course all the time when i meditate but

340
01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:48,319
i seem to do it much better when i'm practicing mudita um you know and i'm wondering you know

341
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:56,319
sort of what practices i should do going forward you know to try to you know try to overcome this difficulty

342
01:03:56,319 --> 01:04:03,359
yeah yeah so i think one aspect of it might be

343
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:09,680
i mean as you said you'd mind wandering but one but given that this

344
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:15,599
specific practice there the the mind doesn't want it finds it challenging so when something is

345
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:21,440
challenging the minds like to do might be more fun to kind of think about something and plans and

346
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:28,640
so so that's really where where it is so i suggest you start this practice you continue

347
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:33,839
this practice where it's really easy whether it's your own blessings

348
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:39,280
dear person a child a pet whoever just start where it's

349
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:45,119
really easy so it's not hard so the mind doesn't go like oh my god this is hard work i rather think about what i'm going

350
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:50,720
to have for lunch tomorrow so just kind of stay where it's really really easy

351
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:57,760
then the mind goes oh actually i'm liking this is fun i can i can do deal with this

352
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:05,039
and then go to the slightly more difficult category maybe just four percent difficult four percent more

353
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:10,960
difficult where the mind is like okay i'm on the edge and i choose yeah i'm just on the

354
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:19,359
edge of like yeah i can still it's not so challenging that okay i'm out of here and it's not so it's not it's

355
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:26,160
never boring but it's not so challenging that's out of so that's what i would recommend neil or sticking with this

356
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:32,799
practice as you practice on your own excellent question both of you so
