1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,879
so hello everyone and welcome to our

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,120
practice and discussion of the buddha's teachings on

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,439
cultivating cultivating awareness cultivating a strong stable clear

4
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,720
awareness with which to go through our lives

5
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:34,880
and that's a great pleasure to do this it's a wonderful thing and i find that the path to that every

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:41,280
step along the way is wonderful and then we come to this exercise in the

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,120
satipatana sutta which some people skip over some people are

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,760
perplexed by and some people don't like and that is that of the

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,120
meditating on the parts of the body and um

10
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:06,240
and i want to uh orient ourselves around this or kind of present some an idea from the early text

11
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,479
that might be helpful uh though at first people often don't like this

12
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:20,400
so the idea is that um first first time say that uh

13
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:28,080
the use of the of what we call imagination is uh included as part of maybe a small

14
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,320
part a part of the path of meditation and teachings of the buddha it's very simple acts of imagination but

15
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,000
in doing so he distinguishes distinguishes between uses of the imagination that involve

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,079
delusion that are fantasy that are have no real connection to reality

17
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,280
and and for those maybe we can use the word concocting

18
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,640
the word sometimes is translated to english as conceiving

19
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,200
and and so giving birth to concoctions to just imaginary ideas

20
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,120
and manyati and uh and then those which are

21
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:18,239
understood to be metaphors and uh similes uh and very simple acts of imagination

22
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,239
of visualization of uh reflection that um

23
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,080
point us in the direction of being present support us to let go of our preoccupations let go of those which the

24
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:37,360
imagination that helps us to let go of imagination the imagination lets us let's let go of being caught

25
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,120
and so imagine maybe you bring to mind some part of your body

26
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,160
maybe something is not too challenging for you that the the body image of it is a concern

27
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,519
for you maybe it's something a simple maybe it's i hope it's simple but

28
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:02,319
for example um your your fingernails maybe they're too long today there are

29
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:09,040
times you don't get around to cutting them and they're kind of longer than you think they should be and so you're concerned about the image

30
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,519
of your fingers and your fingernails and what people think about you and and you're going to a very important

31
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,800
meeting and you haven't had a chance to cut your fingernails let alone clean

32
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,120
them and they're still dirt from an ins and them from working in the garden or maybe something a little bit more

33
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,640
challenging and maybe you have concerns about your the length of your fingers

34
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,159
they're too short they're too long or maybe they're too stubby or fat or something

35
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:44,080
and and you feel embarrassed don't want to show it to people you keep your hands in your pocket so people

36
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,799
don't notice and so it's a concern with body image so something like that

37
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:57,760
now imagine that you do something really wonderful maybe it's a wonderful

38
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:04,400
hike in nature maybe it's a wonderful exercise

39
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:11,120
maybe it's uh you feel really refreshed and kind of wonderful and clean after a shower or

40
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,840
a deep satisfaction maybe after sex or something that maybe you've worked hard

41
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,520
physical work manual work and you feel so contented and a little bit sore but so contented and happy in

42
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,520
your body there's kind of a vitality in the body and imagine yourself sitting down

43
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,360
and maybe closing your eyes in a nice comfortable chair and just feeling the vitality the

44
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,440
surging of energy the the working and tingling of the muscles and

45
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:48,160
that feels pleasant and nice a deep satisfaction that feels embodied after doing this physical thing

46
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,680
the deep content physical contentment a job well done a situation well

47
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,479
experienced very contented and now with that kind of contentment

48
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:07,039
think about your fingernails being too long or your fingers being too this or to that

49
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:14,960
and and notice how it takes you into a world of thoughts ideas concepts concoctions

50
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,479
that um you know it takes you away from the coursing of good

51
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:26,479
feelings satisfaction contentment in your body and um

52
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:32,000
so feeling kind of the alienation certain kind of alienation from an embodied

53
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,039
wonderful feeling of oneself in one's embody in one's skin

54
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,400
by going into the world of thoughts and comparative thinking and ideas of what's

55
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,639
ideal and not ideal how things should be and shouldn't be these are two radically different worlds

56
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,240
of weight relating to the body and so this the parts of the body

57
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,960
exercise is one that recognizes that one is not so satisfying one is not so helpful to

58
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,479
be in and if we get caught in the world of concocting and comparisons

59
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:12,800
then may sometimes we need some help to be able to come back into the lived body

60
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,319
where we fit perfectly inside our skin where we

61
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:24,639
the experience of the fingers for the fingernails for themselves in and of themselves the fingers don't care if

62
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,000
they're short or long or stubby the fingers just are

63
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,360
in fact if we just settle into the sensations and the fingers unless you have arthritis or something

64
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,759
that the sensations of the fingers just tingles and feels nice and they're totally happy

65
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:48,080
whatever the fingers are don't mind what's what length or size they are fingernails don't mind if they're

66
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,199
haven't been cut for a while maybe or dirty so there's a different kind of way to

67
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:59,840
live and so these 31 parts of the body are sometimes called unclean

68
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:06,800
and the later tradition labels titles this exercise um

69
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,199
the repulsive that they talked about the repulsive the repulsive these parts of the body

70
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,240
but the tradition i'll talk more about later is not making a categorical

71
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,240
judgment about the body it's rather making a judgment about the

72
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,800
way we get into the concocting world of attachments around the body that is what is the ancient world

73
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,639
unclean in our world we might use other language we might use that say it's suffering

74
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:44,720
it's stressful we might say that it's alienating it takes us away that makes us separate from our

75
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,759
experience from our body we have maybe used different language in the ancients do

76
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,960
but the movement in the same direction away from the secondary

77
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,000
judgments about the body seeing that as a problem that's what's

78
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,120
unclean in a sense and settling in for the body's experience of itself

79
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,840
so assuming a

80
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,759
meditation posture

81
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:28,560
and close your eyes and just feel your breathing

82
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:35,599
feel your body feel what's happening in your body

83
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,159
from me talking and listen you listening

84
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,560
what is what energies are coursing through your body what sensations

85
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,480
what tensions are in your body

86
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,959
and are there thoughts ideas concoctions in the mind

87
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:13,639
that keep you at a distance from feeling the body in and of itself

88
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:30,160
maybe you can relax the thinking mind calm the thinking a bit

89
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:37,120
calm your activity to feel and sense the experience of your

90
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:45,080
body from the inside out

91
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:01,200
and this difference between what's concocted and what's felt and experienced

92
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,079
applies to the breathing

93
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:25,200
whether the breathing is comfortable or uncomfortable let the breathing be the breathing

94
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,399
independent of thoughts ideas

95
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,839
judgments expectations

96
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,560
as if each breath is just what it's supposed to be

97
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,399
each inhale each exhale

98
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,640
with a relaxing into your breathing

99
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:41,079
perhaps as you exhale relaxing the shoulders and belly

100
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,160
and then feel or imagine

101
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,600
yourself physically content

102
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,399
if you felt deeply satisfied and contented in your body

103
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,959
where would that contentment and satisfaction reside

104
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,120
independent of what you think

105
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,760
what is the body's own experience of that contentment and that vitality or

106
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,880
sense of

107
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:22,720
whatever is happening in the body the body is enough to just write for itself

108
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:37,200
what what energy tingling vibrations sensations

109
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,360
would you allow yourself to feel

110
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,800
if this embodied experience at this moment

111
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:07,360
was just right just the thing that's supposed to be happening

112
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,279
whether comfortable or uncomfortable

113
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:39,040
maybe as you breathe you can feel your skin

114
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,040
over your torso your chest your belly

115
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:50,800
stretch or move on the inhale

116
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,639
settle back on the exhale

117
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,600
maybe your skin pushes against your clothes

118
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,399
as you breathe feeling your skin

119
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:25,600
letting the skin have its own experience independent of what you think

120
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,760
just skin feeling

121
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,839
and whatever is inside your skin

122
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:17,279
fits perfectly within your skin like a good pair of shoes or a good pair of

123
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:24,160
well-fitting clothes and with inside your skin

124
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,120
there's your flesh

125
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:37,839
maybe it also moves in the belly or elsewhere in your body as you breathe

126
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:48,519
breathing with the fleshes like how the flesh the muscles

127
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:57,959
how it feels itself its own experience sitting here

128
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,959
and then deeper than the flesh is the bones

129
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,559
the structure which holds all the flesh

130
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,600
some of the bones move as you breathe the rib cage

131
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,480
maybe in the shoulders or the spine

132
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:43,320
we can have thoughts and ideas about our bones

133
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,640
but what would we like to feel or sense or imagine

134
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:57,000
the bones how the bones experience themselves

135
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:04,240
or feeling like knowing your bones without those thoughts

136
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:11,400
judgments fears just bones

137
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:39,520
and so freeing yourself from body images you might live by

138
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:46,640
gently breathe with experience of skin

139
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:55,120
breathe with the experience of flesh breathe with experience of bones

140
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:03,799
letting each have its own experience free of judgments thoughts ideas

141
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,480
letting each one help free you

142
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,000
from a kind of alienation from the body

143
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:36,399
that the world of self-image and and bodily perfection

144
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:44,960
might do for you sitting here content and peaceful

145
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:51,880
with the body as it is skin flesh bones

146
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:52,679
as we come to this end of this sitting imagine

147
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,200
that you're comfortable in your skin

148
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:06,840
imagine that your body is at home in itself

149
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,919
your body is perfect the way it is

150
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:23,120
and the body has the opportunity he has the capacity

151
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:29,799
to feel itself be at home in itself independent

152
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:35,440
of the stories and thoughts and ideas and predictions

153
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:43,519
you have about your body even if the body is uncomfortable

154
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:54,559
maybe there's a way in which you can still be at home in your body

155
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,240
at home in your skin in your flesh and your bones

156
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,960
we're at home in some deeper embodied way

157
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,039
and now imagine

158
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:33,440
that when you look upon other people you don't look upon them

159
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,720
based on their attractiveness or or

160
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:48,158
your judgments or ideas of how their body appears

161
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:57,679
but rather you look upon others with kind of an act of imagination

162
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,720
you look upon others how they would be if they were at home

163
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:08,720
in their own body as if their body is perfect

164
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,200
no problems

165
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,159
if they were at home in their own skin comfortable in their skin and their

166
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:27,919
flesh and their bones imagine looking upon people that way

167
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:34,320
how nice it would be if they could be comfortable in their own body

168
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:42,320
putting aside your ideas of attractiveness or

169
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:48,320
your orientation towards what might will be unusual about their body

170
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:57,039
your judgments the stories you make up

171
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:09,799
and how wonderful would be if everyone could feel comfortable in their own body

172
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,640
if everyone can have some deep acceptance of their body free of

173
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:27,519
the cultural conditioning ideas and thoughts the social comparisons that are made

174
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:35,399
all the painful ways in which we relate to people's bodies and skin

175
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:45,039
objectifying people imagine how great it would be if all the

176
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:52,799
people you know and all the people you meet could feel at home happy in their body

177
00:30:52,799 --> 00:31:00,000
safe in their body at peace in their body

178
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,880
a freedom embodied freedom

179
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:16,840
may it be that how we look upon others how we regard

180
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:23,600
others maybe regard others kindly

181
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:31,480
caringly may we regard others seeing them

182
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:41,200
in ways that support them feeling at home in themselves

183
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:50,240
comfortable in themselves in their own body may all beings live happily

184
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:57,519
in their bodies may all beings feel safe

185
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:04,320
in their bodies may all beings

186
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:10,559
feel peaceful in their own bodies

187
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,840
and may all beings be free

188
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,320
with an embodied freedom

189
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,440
may the way that we regard others support this as possible

190
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:53,799
[Music]

191
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,919
you

192
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:30,720
so today's uh this will be the

193
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:37,839
the last talk on this fourth exercise of the satipatana sutta

194
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:43,559
and it is um

195
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:55,200
i think it's as easy to overlook this part it's easy to which i did for many many years

196
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:01,359
it's easy to be dismissive especially for a western audience because it has such it refers to the

197
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:08,079
body as parts is unclean and and it's not in the original text but the later editors added added a title

198
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:14,240
for this exercise that that refers to the repulsiveness of the

199
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:21,040
body and that's even you know i mean many people in the west even more reactive to that why would you see the body as

200
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:28,880
repulsive or unclean and perhaps i shouldn't try to

201
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:36,320
guess at what the ancients were doing and thinking when they had this but i do know

202
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:42,640
that the buddha sometimes talks about

203
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,560
the the our bodily form our bodily feelings

204
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:55,760
our bodily our our perceptions are mental activity and concoctions

205
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:01,520
creations and something that we often call consciousness in the west

206
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:08,079
that uh he has sometimes very negative language for it and sometimes he says it's impermanent

207
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:14,240
it's empty it's vain it's a tumor it's an illness it's a fat it's a burden

208
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:21,040
it's uh you know it's you know it's just kind of it has a long list of things which are very kind of negative

209
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,240
and if you read it out of context it's like wow these buddhists are

210
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,599
completely world negating and you know uh opposed to the body and all this and

211
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:38,480
and you know treat the body as some kind of you know as a you know a boil a blister

212
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,520
something you know just look sore and um

213
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,560
but the context of teaching these teachings about how uh you know

214
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:54,640
these things are in sickness and illness or something like that it's it's um

215
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:01,280
it uses the word as if and it's a particular context to use it

216
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,800
and the context is deep some of the deepest sense of well-being

217
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:14,240
happiness and joy that can be experienced in meditation the joy of uh deeply being absorbed and

218
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:20,560
concentrated that comes with deep concentrated meditation and for some people this is the highest

219
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:26,880
like like the pinnacle of of uh joy and happiness that they've ever experienced in their life

220
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:33,839
um and in a sustained way is when they're when they drop into these deep concentrated states

221
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:40,240
and in that context where there's so much well-being and happiness

222
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:47,119
then be careful then not to be attached to the body

223
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:52,720
and to perceptions and feelings even consciousness any attachments any preoccupation any

224
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,760
fixation on them in that context

225
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,839
just feels like a drag feels like now why why would i

226
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:09,920
um uh uh agitate or muddy or lose this deep sense of well-being that

227
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:16,560
the whole body feels like it's beautiful and glowing and and um and alive and

228
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:22,960
settled and finally i'm at home in my body and it just like seems like a wellspring of well-being

229
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,079
why would i separate myself into the world of concoctions the world of immense

230
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,359
stories and ideas and shoulds and shouldn'ts even ones any even ones that are

231
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:40,000
celebrating the body when the celebration of the body is also a separation from it all

232
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:47,440
and um and uh and so in that context the buddha said uh if all this well-being relate to

233
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:53,359
these parts of these areas as if they're a drag

234
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:59,040
so that you can stay connected and i think what you know so you don't get attached to it so you can stay

235
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:05,440
connected to this well-being that is onward leading and leads to liberation from all attachments

236
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,720
so you know this is uh so in terms of these 31 parts of the

237
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:18,000
body then the fourth exercise where it talks about being unclean i interpret it in that in that way

238
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,320
that in the it's in a context of developing greater and greater well-being and happiness and being at

239
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:30,160
home in one's body feeling comfortable in one skin and just settling in and experiencing it

240
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:36,480
independent of the concoctions the stories the interpretation the opinions we have

241
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:44,400
and it feels so good to do that that why get involved in the opinions why get involved in all these things

242
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:51,359
and and so uh and so when is it that it's helpful

243
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:57,119
to be pre in being present for the body to really see that there are certain

244
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:02,400
ways of relating to the body that are undesirable

245
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:09,280
uh maybe unclean if we because it kind of mires or dirties the waters of attention and

246
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:17,839
our experience and so as we kind of do this 31 as we get into the 31 parts of the body

247
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:23,359
then more and more we're beginning to free ourselves from the from

248
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:28,960
the concoctions we're using our imagination a little bit the visualization and inner sense

249
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:35,520
and focus to focus if you do the practice steadily on 31 you know each systematically going

250
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:42,079
through each just each body part but you're developing greater and greater embodiment presence in the body

251
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:47,520
and a greater sensitivity to the way that the mind concocts the mind makes stories and ideas

252
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:53,440
and how we could let go of that and to stay with the body

253
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,560
and this is phenomenally useful for as the satiputana suta keeps going

254
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:04,079
deeper and deeper into the the basic practice of just mindfulness of body feelings

255
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:12,079
mind and damas that we've beginning to help loosen up the grip of stories ideas and some of

256
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:18,240
them are very connected to the body so this is one of the functions of this 32 parts of the body is to free us from

257
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:23,440
that grip but also to begin appreciating and being increasing sensitivity

258
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:29,520
to the concocting nature of the mind the story making of the mind because as we go deeper and deeper in

259
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,800
the satipatana practice we're becoming freer and freer of this concocting

260
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:41,280
nature of the mind but we'll see though that when we start tomorrow on the four

261
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,880
elements we're still using the imagination to some degree for that

262
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,960
and uh so we're still learning learning these lessons tomorrow we'll do the four elements

263
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:58,800
start there the fifth exercise and um uh the

264
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:05,839
the core the original the the pasana instructions the mindful instruction

265
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:12,160
which much of much of the western uh the pasta movement is based on the inside movement that comes out of

266
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:19,280
the jack and joseph and sharon and and came from those of us who went to asia

267
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:26,400
to study something called the a particular form of bipassnam practice called mahasi mahasi practice it's named

268
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:32,800
after the teacher mahasi mahasi sayadaw and his practice was really centered

269
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:40,000
on the four elements and he was a for it was from he doesn't he wasn't explicit about it always and

270
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:47,520
it wasn't conveyed to the western practitioners but the foundation of uh the modern western whole experience of

271
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,880
of mindfulness-based stress reduction and teachings of spirit rock and ims and all

272
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:59,920
that the fun it was this four elements meditation so it has a the pedigree or the or the

273
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:05,680
lineage we're in is one that really centers on this and so i'll talk start talking about that

274
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:11,200
tomorrow and the one thing about the

275
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:17,760
last thing about the 31 parts of the body meditation there's a wonderful teacher a pasta

276
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:23,760
teacher in santa cruz named bob stahl and every year he does almost a year-long course

277
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,520
on the 32 parts of the body meditation and it's very popular in people in santa

278
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:35,760
cruz so i say that not many of you are not close to santa cruz but that

279
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:41,920
there is a people who do this practice find a great love for it

280
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,440
and maybe you'll try it out memorize the list

281
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:53,680
and or some of the lists usually people memorize them groups of five or six and then

282
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:59,760
and then just practice it like the way we did today with the skin flesh bones but using the different

283
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,040
parts um

284
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:11,440
so a couple of little announcements is that today i posted it in youtube if you're

285
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,800

286
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,640
the text there's the text for this 31 parts of the body and also there's a

287
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:29,680
link we'll keep in there to go directly to imc's uh the page on imc's website where we have

288
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:35,200
my translation of the sati patana suta

289
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:40,480
and so as we go through this you want to see the kind of

290
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:46,079
you know the reference point i'm using for this and kind of my understanding of this text in the translation you can

291
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:51,280
find that translation there and you can also find it under the resource menu

292
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,319

elements tomorrow
