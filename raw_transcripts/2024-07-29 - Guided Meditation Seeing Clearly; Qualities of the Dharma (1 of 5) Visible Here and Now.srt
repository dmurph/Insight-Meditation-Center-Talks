1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:10,360
[Applause] so one of

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:19,520
the well I just mentioned that for the last three weeks or almost four weeks I've been living Outdoors uh mostly in a

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,640
sleeping bag under the stars at night and um natural settings teaching mostly

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:33,079
teaching in that context and there's something quite marvelous about the immediacy of living

5
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:38,120
outdoors and the contact with the natural world and the Awakening of our

6
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:44,160
natural senses and uh this speaks to uh the topic for

7
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:51,800
today which I'll introduce uh for the meditation by saying that Buddhism

8
00:00:51,800 --> 00:01:00,160
begins and ends Buddhist practice with being in the present moment a radical

9
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,320
clear seeing of present moment

10
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,560
experience and um in between the beginning and the end

11
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,439
it's seeing clearly that thoughts about the future thoughts about uh the past

12
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,280
are occurring in the present and uh to see them really as

13
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,560
present moment occurrences that everything we need to describe discover in the Dharma for the

14
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,040
purposes of the kind of deep liberation of heart that Buddhism

15
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,439
teaches is uh found by a simple

16
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:48,200
attention to present moment experience and it's fascinating to watch

17
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:57,039
how difficult it is for the mind sometimes to stay in the present how it travels off into the land of thoughts of

18
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:04,439
the past thoughts of the future thoughts of fantasy and

19
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,039
um so um this morning let's

20
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,440
see how to be here and now with a clear

21
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:23,440
seeing of present moment experience without wondering off and of

22
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,200
course you will wander off and then the task is always coming back to clear

23
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:37,840
seeeing no need to analyze judge no need to

24
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,120
criticize if you can return to the clarity of seeing Oh this is present

25
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:51,760
moment experience uh this is what's

26
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,519
immediate this is what is inviting me to see more deeply into reality the reality

27
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:06,159
as it unfolds in the present moment so to assume a meditation posture

28
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:14,400
whatever posture that is appropriate for you and in that posture that you take is

29
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:21,000
there ways of adjusting it so that the mind can be a little bit more

30
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,879
alert sometimes that's by adjusting the body in the posture so that there's a little bit

31
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:33,720
more intentionality in meditation

32
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:46,400
posture and then as almost as a ritual of entering into the present moment of

33
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,640
meditation to take a few long slow deep

34
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:58,720
breaths and as you deep as you breathe in

35
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,760
deeply to experience the Torso expand stretch

36
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:14,400
open and as you exhale to relax soften

37
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,759
settle maybe gently closing your eyes

38
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,520
and letting your breathing return to

39
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,120
normal for some people breathing is

40
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:05,759
the is the primary connection or tether to the present

41
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,000
moment if you know you're breathing you know what's happening in

42
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,280
the present breathing is always

43
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,880
now and if you're not able to stay with the

44
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,600
breathing can you see as present moment experience

45
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:37,240
what is taking you away don't get swept into the past or

46
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,400
swept into the future swept into

47
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:50,080
fantasy [Music] commentary but let there be a clear

48
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,720
relaxed settled settling

49
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:01,160
attention to this is thinking about the past

50
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:07,840
this is thinking about the future this is telling stories in the

51
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:17,840
mind commentary and after clear seeing of

52
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:25,960
that notice what the experience of breathing is like has it

53
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:34,039
changed has it tightened up for gotten more held

54
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:39,080
or or has it gotten softer and more

55
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:47,919
gentle whatever way it is is fine just notice how it

56
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:56,319
is moment after moment return to

57
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,520
seeing what the present moment experience is

58
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,160
a kind of Refuge in the

59
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
present

60
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440

81
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:43,919
present to see it clearly what can you see clearly at this

82
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:57,000
moment what can you see without commentary judgment being for or against

83
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:08,760
so that you appreciate the act of seeing or

84
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:16,000
knowing it's Simple and Clean

85
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,440
spacious just this is

86
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:30,720

for

88
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

89
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

90

for for

95
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,440
and as we come to the end of this

96
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:19,559
sitting perhaps you're a little calmer or more

97
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,159
your capacity for present moment

98
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,200
awareness almost as

99
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:48,320
if you're standing at the entrance of

100
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:56,320
a at the gate at the entrance of a new

101
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:03,720
territory and you're able to watch what comes through the

102
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:09,158
gate the gate being the present

103
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:19,639
moment and everything new has to come through that gate

104
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:37,559
and to relax and settle back and see it

105
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,760
clearly and find your freedom in that

106
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:48,360
Clarity in the Simplicity of knowing

107
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,240
and may our ability to see

108
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:15,919
clearly translate to our ability to see others clearly

109
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:24,120
without judgment and bias expectations

110
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:31,360
demands fears to see

111
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:37,960
clearly as an act of generosity Act of care and

112
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:46,279
kindness May our ability to be present for others be a means for us to offer

113
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:53,158
profound respect to each and every person we

114
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:59,679
encounter may all beings be happy

115
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:05,120
may all beings be

116
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,880
safe may all beings be

117
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,520
peaceful may all beings be

118
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:22,120
free and can our ability to be present for

119
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:29,200
others contribute to that possibility

120
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:44,319
[Music]

121
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,200
thank

122
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,158
you e

123
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:54,360
so hello everyone and I'm glad to be back that I've been

124
00:28:54,360 --> 00:29:04,360
gone for about a month and um and uh had a wonderful time um for about

125
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:11,600
three weeks being involved in a training program to train people to be Buddhist

126
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:17,000
teachers in the context of the natural world the Wilderness Wilderness Retreats

127
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:24,279
Wilderness back uh um uh you know periods of time of living

128
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:29,600
in the natural world and that's what I've been done for the last

129
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,760
month except for the last uh four days or so that I went backpacking with my

130
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:43,158
wife to add to the time uh living outdoors and camping and quite

131
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:53,240
wonderful so for this week's um teachings I'd like to go through the

132
00:29:53,240 --> 00:30:00,159
five qualities of the Buddha's teachings the the way it's uh uh

133
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:07,880
described is it's the um it's the description of the wells spoken

134
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:14,159
teachings of the Buddha and

135
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:20,760
um and the word for teaching is dama which is a very rich word and and it

136
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:27,000
could also be uh mean reality the truth itself but for now I'll call the

137
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:34,240
teachings and it's the five characteristics of the teachings and the importance of these five is seen in the

138
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,799
fact that the monastic terad Community chants these

139
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:46,880
every day as part of their liturgy they're being reminded of these five qualities on a daily

140
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,960
basis and um

141
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,840
excuse and um

142
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:05,840
so um this is how it goes in English in

143
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:12,080
Translation the Dharma is well proclaimed well spoken by the blessed

144
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:20,960
one it is visible Here and Now immediate inviting to be seen for

145
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:29,399
oneself onward leading and personally realized by the wise

146
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,399
so these five qualities of what the Dharma is are also the instruction or

147
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:41,639
the pointing out instruction for how to practice where to look how what to where

148
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:47,760
our focus is for discovering what these teachings are they're not about finding

149
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:53,240
them in a book it's not by finding them in lists but rather it's pointing to a

150
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:59,440
direct experience that we can have ourselves and and

151
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,480
um so it's visible Here and Now is one

152
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:10,159
translation uh Sun Dio is the poly word

153
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:15,360
and um di here has the the meaning of um

154
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:23,559
to see or to view or to observe um sun with for oneself with

155
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:30,279
seeing and uh it's not to be contemplated it's not to be logically

156
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:35,639
figured out it's not to be learned externally there's something that we're

157
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:43,799
looking for to see that's directly visible here and now and so the question is what is that

158
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:49,399
and um and the times when the Buddha describes what this is uh we could in

159
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:55,399
Modern English call it uh seeing certain psychological States in particular

160
00:32:55,399 --> 00:33:01,120
seeing uh in the simplest way he says it is uh to see

161
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:08,000
directly uh greed hatred and delusion as it's uh

162
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,600
present and when there is no greed hatred and

163
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:20,000
delusion when we see that the absence of this then we're seeing the Dharma so

164
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:27,279
this is not a teaching into states of Mind into meditation into uh metaphysics

165
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:35,919
into Phil philosophy it's about seeing the the psychological State psych state of mind

166
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:45,440
that is free of Affliction free of the stress free of the suffering that comes

167
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:53,000
with greed hatred and delusion if you see that you're seeing the Dharma that's visible here and

168
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,120
now and uh and the rest of it follows is what the Buddha says as well it's

169
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:03,480
immediate you see something that's here and now it's not of time it's not

170
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:10,040
something that um belongs to the world of time because it's a very present and

171
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:17,800
immediate and that um this teaching about this kind of seeing this teaching

172
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:24,919
is saying for you it's inviting you come and look for yourself discover this for yourself

173
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:30,638
don't have to believe it don't have to memorize it just come come to see for

174
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:36,280
yourself and see for yourself what the absence of greed hate and delusion is

175
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:42,599
like see for yourself how uh the absence of GRE

176
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:49,919
delusion is onward leading it provides a it's a guide It's a guidepost for

177
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:55,638
ourself it's a North star to have some experience of this kind of Freedom The

178
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:02,320
Joy the happiness the peace that can come from this kind of absence is

179
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,480
um is uh a guide for how to see it again

180
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:14,359
to find it to look for it to live by it and this is something that is not

181
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:21,760
supposed to be uh believed but something to be experienced by the wise and here

182
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:28,440
the word the wise is you that you are you are the wise person who is learning

183
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:34,359
how to see clearly learning how learning what to recognize what to

184
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:39,760
know and for today I just emphasize this absence of greed hate and

185
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,440
delusion uh this is kind of the umbrella term for all kinds of states of

186
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,760
Affliction excuse me

187
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,760
thank you as I clear my throat I bike down here to from I'm seeing the cold I

188
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:14,480
think that somehow trigger a little bit of um maybe some reaction to

189
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:20,480
something and um so

190
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:29,880
um so the um this ability so the emphasis is here

191
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:36,599
is a deep seeing into ourselves into the states of mind the qualities of mind the places of

192
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:43,160
attachment the places of clinging not to not so that we hang out there and see it and suffer because of

193
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:50,640
it but so we can look past it look Beyond it uh to see a mind that's free

194
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:57,040
of Affliction free of these particularly difficult States psychological States

195
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:03,720
and so I fond of saying that Buddhism is sometimes more psychological than it is philosophical

196
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:10,560
more psychological than it is religious because it's pointing to something directly to be experienced in our own

197
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,680
mind our own the way our own mind operates and works and that it's there

198
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:23,000
that we discover Freedom if we're spending time trying to solve the problems of the world

199
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,480
something that's very important to do uh it's important to know that that's not where we're we're going to find Freedom

200
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:35,319
we might rearrange the world to be perfect just the way we want it to be

201
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:42,640
and um it's not going to stay that way not for long and uh very quickly things will

202
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:48,640
change and not be perfect anymore uh but if we turn the attention to

203
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:57,200
ourselves that's where a certain kind of perfection can happen that's where we can learn how to find our freedom how to

204
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,359
find find our freedom in an imperfect world how to find our non-reactivity in

205
00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:08,040
a world where people are reacting all the time where we can find our wisdom in

206
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:14,960
a world where there is no wisdom and the wisdom that we're building on is the

207
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:21,319
wisdom that arises from knowing for ourselves that it's possible to live

208
00:38:21,319 --> 00:38:27,760
without greed hatred and delusion so um that's the direction what

209
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:34,119
practice is going toward this is what the Dharma is what the Buddha is pointing to this

210
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:39,560
possibility and um and it's something that's directly

211
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:45,200
visible that's immediately here and now this word stico can also sometimes

212
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:52,119
translated as it's here and now to be seen here and now and

213
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:58,680
um and um so much such a a healthy way of

214
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:04,760
living in the world can arise so much wisdom can arise when the reference

215
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:10,680
point for how to live in the world is to be free of afflictive

216
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:17,599
States now to be a free of greed hate and delusion in some permanent way is a

217
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:23,400
big task but I hope that each of you have moments through the day where you

218
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:29,280
find yourself maybe accidentally free of these afflictive states of stress of

219
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:37,240
greed of hatred and delusion and um and uh fle free of clinging free of

220
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:44,800
grasping free of pushing away free of anger free of fear and um and maybe it's accident

221
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:52,880
Dental maybe you go for a walk in your neighborhood and you see someone has a beautiful garden and or a beautiful tree

222
00:39:52,880 --> 00:40:00,280
and something about seeing the tree or the garden um settle something or releases something for a few moments

223
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:06,800
just the appreciation the Delight The Joy right there are moments of

224
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:15,240
Freedom um you there right there we're seeing the Dharma that it is possible to be free of

225
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:22,880
afflictive States so uh look for those through the day uh appreciate the small ways which

226
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:29,760
they occur they are teaching you the Dharma and then from seeing those

227
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:36,680
clearly then you might begin understanding the afflictive states more fully when they appear later and you

228
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:44,839
might not be as waited to them so committed to them you might not want to invest so much time energy mental real

229
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:53,160
estate to uh being uh caught up in um obsessive

230
00:40:53,160 --> 00:41:01,560
thinking caught up in clinging caught up in resistance caught up in uh anxiety there is another way of

231
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:07,000
being that uh we're free of it and if you can see it in small ways through the

232
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:15,720
day those can build those can grow those can um inform you how you can live don't

233
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:23,040
underestimate the value of seeing the small ways in which we are

234
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:28,760
free it's those that we build on to experience a greater greater freedom in

235
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:35,839
our life a freedom which um is visible Here and Now

236
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:43,079
immediate inviting us to come and check it out for ourselves onward Le leading and

237
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:49,800
personally realized by the wise so

238
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:56,880
um thank you and uh I'll go through the next four of these qualities over the

239
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:05,319
this week week and hope that um it helps you to uh understand Dharma and practice

240
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:12,520
in a in a intimate way thank you
