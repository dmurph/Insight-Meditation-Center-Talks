1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,400
okay so we'll go ahead and get started

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,840
so welcome to the imc monday night sit

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,640
and i hope you're doing well this evening or whatever time of day it is for you

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:28,000
and we'll begin with settling in to the sit so finding a posture

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,280
where you can be upright and also relaxed

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,879
somewhere where you'll be comfortable for the half hour or so that will be

7
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,879
sitting

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,239
and just gently allowing your eyes to close

9
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:59,120
and bringing the attention inward to the feeling of the body sitting

10
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:06,920
or if you're lying down or standing whatever posture you're in [Music]

11
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,400
just taking a moment to gently let go of whatever we were doing before coming

12
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,400
here

13
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,079
and allowing the mind to be present

14
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,640
sensing into the body perhaps the contact point where your

15
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,720
seat is on the chair or the cushion

16
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,000
legs or feet are against the floor or maybe you're lying on a surface

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,159
or just feeling where the contact is where you're being supported

18
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:14,319
i'm finding some balance there so sometimes if i'm sitting i'll rock

19
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,840
back and forth slightly just a little bit or forward and back just to find that

20
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:28,400
central balance point where the body can be upright

21
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,400
if you're lying down it's also possible to tune into the straightness of the spine the balance of

22
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,480
the body against the surface

23
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,599
and perhaps on the next exhale letting go a little bit farther into

24
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:04,280
that support allowing it to support you

25
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:25,360
and it can also help to deliberately soften some parts of the body that we often

26
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:32,239
hold tense perhaps the muscles of the face so

27
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,040
letting the expression on the face be soft

28
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,440
softening the eyes and the eye sockets they tend to get a little tense when

29
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,400
we're looking at a screen

30
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,799
and softening in the throat the neck

31
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,958
feeling into the shoulders

32
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,720
we might let the shoulder blades slide down the back so that the shoulders are dropping

33
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,759
without rounding forward

34
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,000
down through the chest area

35
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,639
feeling the front back and sides of the ribcage

36
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,080
down into the belly area letting that be

37
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,520
round soft

38
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,490
we can let go of any layers of tension [Music]

39
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:46,080
down into the hip joints and into the thighs

40
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,880
softening the knee and ankle joints

41
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,440
i'm connecting into the feet and the hands

42
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,000
so just inviting ease through the body

43
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:29,160
when the body has some ease it's actually easier to be mindful

44
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:17,360
and then perhaps returning to the area of the chest

45
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,840
having a sense of openness or even a slight lift

46
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,800
to the heart area

47
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,160
as if someone were touching our back right between the shoulder blades

48
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,160
gently

49
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,919
this focus of the bodily posture

50
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:59,000
can actually evoke a slight sense of confidence in the mind

51
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:14,319
just a reminder that we're doing is

52
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:21,680
valuable worthwhile effective

53
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:30,160
can be very supportive for practice to touch into our degree of confidence or trust in this

54
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:37,719
practice which we all have to some degree since we're doing it

55
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:01,839
maybe just for a few breaths letting that confidence pervade the body and mind

56
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,360
and then settling back into

57
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,800
the breath or the body your usual object of meditation

58
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,240
noticing if there might be a slight sharpening of the energy in the mind

59
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,560
when we feel our confidence in the practice

60
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,839
to whatever degree

61
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,439
and as we settle a bit more into the meditation

62
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:53,320
you may begin to notice the quality of the attention in the mind

63
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,880
how is the mindfulness

64
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,639
if there's a bit too much energy in the mind

65
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,560
you may wish to calm it down a bit

66
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,199
focus the mindfulness a bit more

67
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,360
whereas the mind is a little dull

68
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:33,600
might sharpen up the attention [Music] perhaps through a stronger connection to

69
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,839
the body

70
00:13:53,680 --> 00:14:00,040
noticing what the mind feels like when it has mindfulness present

71
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:27,760
and it may be that the mind is still quite busy

72
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:35,679
minds will do as they do but to whatever degree you have a sense

73
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:42,799
that the mind is a bit more gathered gathered together than it was when you

74
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,840
started you can appreciate that

75
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,720
perhaps there's even a subtle joy

76
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,840
in being present with experience

77
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:11,520
some ease some joy some peace to whatever degree these are present

78
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:18,200
appreciating them allowing that to pervade the body

79
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,960
um

80
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,880
[Music]

81
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:33,840
and as we move into the last five minutes or so of this meditation

82
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:42,320
you might bring to mind the knowledge that you carry

83
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:48,400
the benefits of dharma practice or meditation

84
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:58,400
perhaps even just in the course of this sitting you've been reminded of the value it brings

85
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:05,679
and that in turn feeds back to the confidence that we began with

86
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:15,600
so just bringing that knowledge to mind and then letting it fade back and resting again in your

87
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,880
meditation object

88
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:31,640
letting this understanding resonate in your system

89
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:58,480
and as we gently approach the end of this sitting

90
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:04,240
perhaps bringing to mind any wish that you have for

91
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,278
the benefit of others through your practice

92
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:18,000
do you have some intention that what you do here will benefit

93
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,200
yourself and others and both out in the world

94
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,320
just bringing that to mind

95
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:36,960
okay so this evening i'm going to start

96
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,080
by tracing backward from the world

97
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:49,200
into our own mind and i'm doing so in a particular way

98
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:55,440
so you can start by looking at the world

99
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:03,360
and we see in many ways something of a lack of wisdom

100
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:10,480
people making choices that are not necessarily for their own welfare the welfare of others

101
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:16,480
and the welfare of both there's a text that says

102
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,799
a wise person of great wisdom does not intend for their own affliction for the

103
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:29,919
affliction of others or for the affliction of both rather when they think they think only

104
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:35,760
of their own welfare the welfare of others the welfare of both and the welfare of

105
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:42,559
the whole world but we see that this doesn't always happen

106
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:50,640
and we might ask well why is that well it it does take a particular

107
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,240
clarity and focus of the mind to be able to see

108
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,519
how we can be of actual benefit how is it that we could act for the welfare

109
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:08,320
of ourselves and others so we need to have a clear understanding of how things unfold

110
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:16,000
how to think how do things work and this requires some stability of our mind in order to to do

111
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,840
that but we may not have that and so then why is that you know why

112
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:27,679
don't we have an ongoing stability of mind and clarity about how

113
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:33,840
things work well often this has to do with not

114
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:40,000
paying close attention and not remembering actually what's important to us

115
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,480
and so it takes some continuity of attention to see how things work which means that we have to remember to

116
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,840
pay attention but of course you know this is not easy in human life

117
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:57,360
often we're distracted by our phone our relationships our

118
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:04,240
emotions our self-image other things that come up and to be sure our world right now does

119
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:10,399
not make this easy for us to to have a clear continuity of attention

120
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:15,760
but truthfully it will never be easy there is no time

121
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:22,399
in the world when everything is simple and easy so now is as good a time as any

122
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:28,880
but we don't you know we don't have this um remembering to pay attention

123
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:35,600
and then why is that well um in many ways it's it's just easier to

124
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,760
go along you know to gather up our energy for a directed

125
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:47,200
purpose and to be consistent and persistent about that may not be as high

126
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:53,120
on our agenda as just being comfortable or fighting against

127
00:33:53,120 --> 00:34:00,640
things or acting out our identity you know we have other agendas in our life um

128
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,679
and so we don't put together the energy to kind of gather ourselves toward this

129
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:11,118
purpose of paying attention carefully so that we can act well

130
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:18,158
um and so then why is that you know why don't we gather ourselves up well i think there are a number of reasons

131
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:26,240
maybe we don't think it really matters maybe we don't know that paying attention has a good effect or

132
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:31,440
we may know that external things are still out of our control but we may not really

133
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:38,079
believe that it can have that much effect to change the way we are in the world or maybe why don't know that real

134
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:44,720
happiness is available through our inner life through cultivating attention and other such things

135
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:51,118
maybe we don't realize that there's any alternative to either fighting or complying with how

136
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,720
things are so what i've done is

137
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:01,920
go backward through a list in buddhism it's called the five

138
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,119
faculties so um starts with

139
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:12,160
the order i went in to go backward was wisdom you know we start with why is it

140
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:18,000
that we're not able to bring benefit to the world which is one of the definitions of a wise person

141
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,839
well we don't have so much concentration so much stability and clarity of mind

142
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:30,720
and then why is that well there's not there's so much mindfulness available to us and why is that well we

143
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,760
don't bring up the energy and the persistence and consistency to

144
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,920
create that mindfulness always and why don't we bring up that energy well we may not

145
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:48,320
have faith or confidence that it's worthwhile in some way

146
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:56,000
and so this is a scenario for how things can unfold in ways that are not so favorable

147
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,240
but the five faculties this wonderful list of faith energy mindfulness

148
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:11,119
concentration and wisdom are actually available to us all the time and they can be used well

149
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:16,720
we may not think they're available all the time but these are actually ordinary qualities of mind

150
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:23,920
the buddha didn't say that these are special things that come into being through dharma practice we all have them

151
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:29,040
to some degree and the reason that we have them is they're they're actually the qualities

152
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:34,800
of mind that we use in learning skills whenever we're learning something new

153
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,400
which we do throughout our life we bring to bear some combination of these five

154
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:46,800
and they're they're not that means that they're not automatically spiritual qualities so we have them but they may

155
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,560
not be connected to our spiritual life and they become spiritual

156
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:59,119
when they are applied to the task of freeing the mind so in buddhism

157
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:06,079
liberation of the heart is considered the best benefit that we can offer you know at the top of that list of wanting

158
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,119
to benefit ourselves and others and both the liberation of the heart is

159
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:17,119
considered the greatest benefit that we can offer and so suppose that we want to begin

160
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:23,040
acting out of our own benefit for the benefit of others and for the benefit of both

161
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,320
it might take some time to really come into that and cultivate it but we can

162
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:34,640
so i want to talk tonight about these five faculties in their spiritual form

163
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,760
so the way that we bring the dharma dharma to life through our life if you

164
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:45,440
will the way the our life itself can enliven the dharma

165
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,640
and just to let you know in advance we'll spend most of the time on the first faculty

166
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:57,200
this is the groundwork from which the rest can unfold but we'll touch into all of them

167
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:03,040
so to begin this journey of becoming a real benefit to ourselves and others

168
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:09,440
will start with what in pali is called satta or faith

169
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:15,680
or there are other translations also but before i get to those this is the

170
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:21,680
idea that there is another way you know there is another way to live our life besides

171
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:30,400
just running around and being busy and chasing after pleasures or our identity

172
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,720
other things um and so so we have this word sada this idea of

173
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:41,920
faith this doesn't mean um blind faith but there is some

174
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:49,520
initial movement towards something that we don't know some idea or aspiration that we have

175
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:57,440
sometimes people use trust or perhaps later we would use confidence i'll probably use faith

176
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:03,200
this evening just because it's an easy word to say and because i've come to appreciate it but i'm aware that for

177
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:09,200
some people that word doesn't doesn't work so you could substitute one of the other

178
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:18,560
ones this is from rodney smith another teacher

179
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:26,160
the first moment of our spiritual journey may begin with a glimpse of a possibility that offers relief from all

180
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:32,800
this stress we hear a talk read a book or deeply sense something that suggests

181
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:39,599
there could be a different way to live this touch calls us from beyond toward a

182
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:46,240
mystery that re-prioritizes everything and provides a context for our struggles

183
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:51,920
this calling does not fit neatly within our conventional lives but we cannot

184
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:58,160
shake it off a spark has been ignited but we are not sure what to do about it

185
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:03,200
so this is kind of the very initial spark of faith that we might have and

186
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:10,160
often it's ignited through suffering of some kind suffering has a way of pulling aside the

187
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:16,079
veil of our life where we're just going along and you might consider if there's some

188
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:22,839
some experience like that that you've had so rodney smith uses this word

189
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:28,319
calling and this calling which is a positive response to suffering

190
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:34,960
i would say is another word for faith and interestingly it's also the first glimmer of wisdom

191
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:40,880
but it needs to be unfolded more before we get to that the first glimmer of faith is also the

192
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:47,680
first glimmer of wisdom so then how do we unfold this how do we

193
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:53,520
go forward from this first spark that we're getting so there are plenty

194
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,680
of external suggestions if you will for objects of faith and they're helpful

195
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:06,960
sometimes we need to start with something that comes from the outside or some suggestion from another in buddhism

196
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,400
we would usually refer to the initial object of our spiritual faith as

197
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,760
the triple refuge or the triple gem of buddha dharma and sangha

198
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,839
but the you know we could even talk a bit about these terms so the suit does talk about

199
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:29,359
faith in the buddha's enlightenment not necessarily the person of the buddha

200
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:34,560
but we have a sense at a heart level that freedom is possible

201
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:41,599
and we we have some sense that yeah somebody somebody really did this maybe this is really true

202
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:49,280
maybe there's somebody who has done this and knows what they're talking about and describing it or offering instructions

203
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,720
for it and so then we would connect with those instructions with those teachings and

204
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:01,599
this is the the dharma the dhamma and we can come to have faith

205
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:08,640
in the process i guess of the dharma um we can't maybe see or even imagine the

206
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,839
end point of where we're headed toward but we trust that it's going in a good

207
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:19,040
direction this is sometimes how i think about faith in the dharma eyes

208
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:26,319
well i don't necessarily know what this process is going toward and sometimes it can be a little uncertain

209
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:33,839
or uncomfortable what it is that the dharma is asking of us but i do have trust that it goes in a good direction

210
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:39,599
and that it's worth following in that way so that's the kind of confidence we

211
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,880
might have in the dharma and the quality of the teachings

212
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:51,599
and then in addition we can find either a teacher or some mature spiritual friends who are

213
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:57,520
actually embodying the qualities that we respect and value so we have some kind of a

214
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:03,280
living example of what the teachings are pointing toward and hopefully

215
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:10,400
some guidance about how we might be able to follow those ourselves so we also have some trust or confidence

216
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:16,400
in the sangha and then i'll mention also that

217
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:22,240
as we're exploring this quality of faith or confidence or trust

218
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:28,240
there's a connection between faith and joy in the teachings and so

219
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:33,599
i'd like to emphasize that we need some kind of positive basis

220
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:39,119
and we can we can ask ourselves you know what what might we do each day to nourish

221
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:46,480
joyful faith this positive sense of aspiration or

222
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:52,960
sometimes even excitement about walking the path i think of this as as i think of this

223
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:59,040
i'm reminded of a time that i practiced in sri lanka for a little while

224
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:04,880
and i noted that they have a very faith-based practice maybe more so than

225
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:12,400
we do definitely more so than we do here in the west at least in the inside movement and i found it quite delightful

226
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:19,680
i was staying at a monastery for example where at a certain time in the morning the

227
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:25,839
monks would come walking out of the monastery for alms in a neat row

228
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:33,920
walking together with their bowls mindfully could see in the way they were walking and we were at a retreat center

229
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:39,599
actually that was just next to the monastery so we would watch we could watch them come out from kind of a

230
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:45,599
position on the walking paths of the retreat center and when the monks came out

231
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:52,240
the retreatants would stop walking meditation and just watch it's kind of a cultural thing that we would just watch

232
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:58,480
quietly while the monks went by and one day one of the sri lankan yogis

233
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,560
turned to me she spoke english and she just said with a smile on her face

234
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:10,960
it's so nice you know since she just meant you know being there and watching the monastics

235
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:16,800
go by so there was some kind of this nice feeling that we were celebrating in this

236
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:23,040
faith-based quality of the dharma and it nourished our retreat practice for sure

237
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:29,599
so all of these you know ideas or external cues or

238
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:35,839
you know reflections that we have or watching monastics are meant to serve

239
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:41,200
actually to strengthen our inner sense of faith so these outer ideas are

240
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:48,319
actually meant to point toward our inner sense of faith the actual feeling in our own heart

241
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:53,440
i have a friend who was doing tibetan practice and one of

242
00:45:53,440 --> 00:46:01,280
the ways that you begin that is to do sometimes people begin by doing a hundred thousand frustrations

243
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:08,560
so we don't do that in our tradition but it's um you know it's something that takes a while to do of course and this

244
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:13,680
person found that um this discipline of doing lots and lots

245
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:19,359
of frustrations each day and adding them up to make sure he was getting to a hundred thousand

246
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:25,839
um resulted in him being very clear about his deep motivation for undertaking this

247
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:31,520
practice you know you have to be connected with that in order to

248
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:37,599
continue all the way through that many frustrations so he started to realize that was the point of them it wasn't

249
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:44,000
that he needed to you know get his body in shape to be able to do that although he did

250
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,560
but he realized oh okay what this does is it really instills that inner sense of knowing why you're doing this

251
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:56,560
practice so this is very healthy good way to start

252
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:01,920
but nonetheless as we go along this quality of faith will get replaced

253
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:07,040
slowly by knowledge as we have direct experience in the practice

254
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:13,119
there's a story in the theravada teachings of sariputta the buddha's chief disciple

255
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:18,480
where the buddha asks him if he has faith that developing the five faculties

256
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:25,440
will lead to awakening and sorry putta says no and he then goes on to explain though

257
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,960
that he has direct knowledge that developing the faculties leads to awakening and so he doesn't need to have

258
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:36,800
faith in a statement like that so there is this understanding that they

259
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:43,119
proceed from faith through the others to wisdom to knowledge and you know we may want to be careful

260
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:49,040
between you know jumping too early to the conclusion that we know something and you know maybe

261
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:55,599
instead just deciding that we know something well enough to to keep going but nonetheless there is this this

262
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:03,280
transformation and then there's also an image

263
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:10,079
that's given you know in the teachings that says just as at a crossroads on a level

264
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:15,760
ground a great banyan tree becomes the resort for birds all around

265
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,800
so the person endowed with faith becomes the resort for many people

266
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:26,880
monastics and lay followers alike so then this same suta says later that

267
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:32,480
people who have this quality of sadha will get more opportunities so people

268
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:37,920
will ask them to do favors for them which connects them and gives them the

269
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:44,240
chance to do generosity and it even says that people with faith in the teachings are

270
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:50,640
more likely to receive teachings somehow teachings will come their way because they value them

271
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:57,200
so the idea here is to consider what the quality of confidence or trust

272
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:03,680
will attract into our lives this is interesting right we're not talking about blind faith at all but a

273
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:09,280
very clear sense of what we value and placing that at the center of our life

274
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:15,359
as a way of honoring it and so this is a teaching on causes and conditions

275
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:23,280
faith is a quality of the mind or heart that can be cultivated and which has real effects then on how

276
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:29,599
our lives unfold so if we have faith in the teachings or

277
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:36,960
confidence or trust or conviction then our practice will unfold differently than for the case of not

278
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:43,440
really having that hard connection while established so how does this work

279
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:49,119
in the context of these five faculties the next one after faith is

280
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:55,359
energy or effort so when we understand that something is important to us and we have some

281
00:49:55,359 --> 00:50:00,640
confidence in it that it will bring good effects then we demonstrate that by

282
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:06,400
acting upon it if you will so this second faculty of effort

283
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:12,559
is often equated with perseverance sticking with the practice having some

284
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:18,480
continuity and that takes some some energy since the mind might not be used

285
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:24,160
to devoting itself to the dharma or to practice in this regular way

286
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:29,200
and i find that these middle three of effort mindfulness and concentration

287
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:35,920
kind of form a set that play off of each other um doing things plays off with paying

288
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:41,359
attention and they mutually reinforce each other in kind of a

289
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:47,440
virtuous circle if you will there's a little bit of an iteration that goes on where you know we put in

290
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:53,119
effort uh initially but then we have to pay attention to the effects of how we're

291
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:58,720
practicing and how our effort is working out and then we through that we realize that

292
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:04,160
we might need to make effort slightly differently or we might need to change it over time and then we again pay

293
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:11,680
attention to that and over time we have a gathering of the mind around the effort that it's making

294
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:18,640
the attention that it has the intention behind the aspiration that we're carrying so concentration is

295
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:25,599
slowly developing the gathering of the mind and all the while the mind is letting go of things that are not useful

296
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:31,040
for its effort and so the perspective it has and the playing field if you will

297
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:38,000
keep changing so i think i don't want to present the five faculties as just a

298
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:45,200
linear chain that we have to do one and then the next and then the next it's more that they

299
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:51,440
really begin to mutually reinforce over time so when the attention and the effort are

300
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:58,319
getting harmonized we can feel the mind settle into this more unified state

301
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:04,720
as if all the disparate components of it get aligned it's a state of

302
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:10,079
high energy and high attention at the same time so this is this

303
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:16,400
fourth quality of samadhi concentration as the fourth faculty

304
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,440
so in in life somebody can feel like sometimes what's called flow

305
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:28,240
we know what we're doing our energy is well directed and without tension and there's a stability such that we

306
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:33,520
can't easily get knocked off course so this when the mind is in a

307
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:39,359
state like that is when we get to experiential learning and that becomes integrated into our

308
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:44,720
system which is also what wisdom is about so

309
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:49,920
when we're kind of able to manifest what we originally had faith in

310
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:56,160
this is wisdom being able to act with benefit for ourselves others and both

311
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:01,200
somewhat paradoxically although there was a lot of setup to get to this point

312
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:06,319
of being able to manifest what it is that we were first valuing the state

313
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:12,720
actually feels quite natural so we start to get a sense of the dharma as a way of life we have to do all this

314
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:18,079
set up just to be natural if you will so i want to kind of bring things

315
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:24,880
together at this point we often talk about the dharma as if it's a fixed thing

316
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:30,880
but in its most basic definition dharma actually just means nature

317
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,720
so the dharma arises in our life in the way that we evoke it

318
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:43,119
and part of the art of dharma practice is to learn how to be natural

319
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:49,599
so we mostly present ourselves prevent ourselves from being natural we need to stop doing the things that are getting

320
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:55,599
in the way of being natural and being in line with the dharma and cultivating the five

321
00:53:55,599 --> 00:54:02,000
faculties is one way to get into this alignment so that the they're sort of supportive

322
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:09,040
dharmic forces carrying our life along [Music] i'm relating this now to an image from

323
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:16,160
an essay that gill wrote and i like it because it talks about needing a skill remember that the five

324
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:22,480
faculties come into play whenever we're learning a skill so he writes

325
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:27,920
the way the dharma arises can be compared to floating in fresh water

326
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:35,040
floating is a learned skill that depends on our having both the intention to float and the skill

327
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:40,720
when we float we may say that the water supports us but in fact the water alone

328
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:46,160
is not sufficient to keep us from drowning if we don't know how to float and we

329
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:52,480
thrash around in fear or only relax and trust the water won't hold us up

330
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:57,680
so the dynamic interplay of the water and our body and our intention and skill

331
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:04,000
creates the floating so then he analogizes this to the dharma

332
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:11,280
as a support for our lives the dharma is like the floating the dharma is not found simply by

333
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:17,359
letting go any more than floating safely in water simply requires relaxing there are

334
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:23,760
certain skills and intentions that need to be present for the dharma to appear and to function

335
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:29,760
and it's through the way that we live that the dharma can have a role in our lives

336
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:37,680
i like that a lot and i i picked it out in particular because this floating image i think with some

337
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:42,880
not too much effort you can pull out all the five faculties from from that

338
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:50,079
short reading i did so we do have to relax and trust we're not thrashing around in the water

339
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:57,040
but this isn't the only thing we don't stop with faith we go on to make some kind of intentional effort

340
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:02,319
so having some energy in our ability to float or to bring the dharma into our

341
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:07,920
life and we'll need to be paying attention as we do that to our body and the water and

342
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:13,200
how that's um how the floating is working and then we'll need to balance all the

343
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:18,480
different factors the dynamic interplay of the water our body and our intention

344
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:24,640
all of that means that we're gathering ourselves around this idea of floating

345
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:32,319
and so we have a concentration factor and then through all of this we come into a genuine experiential knowledge of

346
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:39,280
how to float so it becomes easy um and then similarly we can gain this

347
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:45,520
intuitive knowing of when and how to do things in order to float on the support of the dharma

348
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:50,960
so we'll end by going back through the five faculties in our life

349
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:58,880
so as we begin to trust in approaching life in a different way than

350
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:04,799
we do when we're just busy and scrambling around we have some trust that there's another way

351
00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:11,040
then we will start to make effort that's more harmonious it's less about just getting what is

352
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:18,240
pleasant and getting rid of what is unpleasant and more about developing what is wholesome and renouncing what is

353
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:23,680
unwholesome those are very different kinds of effort so we move toward this cultivation of

354
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:30,880
the wholesome and then it's natural that we'll be more attentive and we have to watch and remember to stay present in

355
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:36,720
order to keep our mind and body in a good state and then as we do that we will see more

356
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:41,839
and more clearly and will feel more and more aligned and stable in our heart

357
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:47,520
and as we have that stability of attention we'll be able to see how it is that we can actually be of

358
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:53,440
benefit how it is that our life can be more aligned more harmonious with the

359
00:57:53,440 --> 00:58:01,599
values that we have and the fruition of that is that we will be of benefit to ourselves others both

360
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:07,520
and the whole world so we will come to embody wisdom

361
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:15,280
so these five faculties really do lead to a harmonious and balanced life and when

362
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:20,319
they're applied to the dharma they can also lead to liberation

363
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:26,960
we can come to maybe at least have faith in that and i hope that someday we will all know

364
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:35,280
that for sure so it's not maybe so easy as i laid it out in that nice

365
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:40,319
arrangement and yet it is kind of easy you know kind of like floating

366
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:46,240
not so easy but pretty easy when we when we get into it

367
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:51,599
so these are my thoughts for this evening on the five faculties and life

368
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:57,280
and i wish you all very well in your ongoing cultivation of each and all of

369
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:02,200
them thank you be well
