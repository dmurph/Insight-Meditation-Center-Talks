for you may you hold it with care and

11
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:28,040
warmth so we'll start with a guided meditation

12
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,640
taking our meditation

13
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:53,118
posture seated ight and feeling the

14
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,398
uprightness like how the body is oriented in space

15
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:16,319
uprightness as well as some ease some dignity as well as some

16
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,959
relaxation finding this posture can be a practice in

17
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:35,200
itself that reflects both both Our intention to pay

18
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:44,080
attention but without some straining without striving without

19
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,959
grasping but with ease

20
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:12,000
so to sit and know you're sitting feeling the

21
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,159
pressure of the chair or cushion couch

22
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:25,000
bed whatever you might be sitting on and whether you're sitting literally or

23
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:31,720
metaphorically but feel whatever the body is contacting feeling the pressure against

24
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:40,560
the body you're here now

25
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:19,959
and then to notice that the body is breathing and tuning into the movement

26
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:27,040
of the chest the movement of the abdomen or maybe the feeling of air going in and

27
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,479
out of the nose

28
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:43,080
and just noticing the sensations of breathing

29
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,639
nothing in particular needs to be happening

30
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,680
we're just noticing the sensations of

31
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:54,240
breathing and when the mind wanders which it is likely to

32
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:02,720
do we just very simply gently begin to again

33
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:40,000
can we let go of any idea that the breath needs to be

34
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,680
controlled the body knows how to

35
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:55,800
breathe can we just allow it to breathe the way that is comfortable

36
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:02,758
feels natural not constrained contrived

37
00:07:55,479 --> 00:08:01,879
can we let go of any idea that things have to be

38
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,039
different than how they are right

39
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:19,520
now can we allow them to be how they are they actually are the way they

40
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,360
are can we align ourselves with the reality of the

41
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
moment

42
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,440
for e

43
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:56,920
when we do mindfulness of breathing and we find ourselves lost in

44
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,320
thought we don't have to make it a problem

45
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,880
emem we let go of the

46
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,880
thoughts and turn towards the breathing

47
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:23,079
again in a way that has a generous attitude towards

48
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:28,920
ourselves of course we're thinking chances are you've been

49
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:34,600
thinking all day and there's this

50
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:49,360
momentum what would it be like to have a generous attitude towards

51
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,839
yourself and your

52
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,279
practice e

53
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,240
can we have an attitude of

54
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:49,720
generosity towards ourselves towards our

55
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:59,480
experience the spirit of giving away rather than hold holding

56
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:05,360
on tightly clinging rather than demanding this is

57
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:13,320
mine it has to be this way can we hold things

58
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,959
slightly allowing the experiences to come and

59
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
go

e e

87
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:46,480
having this attitude of

88
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:51,000
generosity towards ourselves when

89
00:26:52,279 --> 00:27:00,520
meditating of course can come Al alive or be expressed

90
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:05,640
when we're not meditating as generosity not only

91
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:15,320
towards ourselves but towards others that is giving the benefit of the

92
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:21,840
doubt letting go of insisting that things be a particular

93
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:30,960
way and being openhearted and

94
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:40,120
open-minded so in this way generosity can support our mindfulness

95
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:45,840
practice if we allow the inner critic to

96
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:52,398
quiet and instead we have a generous attitude towards

97
00:27:54,159 --> 00:28:02,760
ourselves and also support our intention to be generous towards

98
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:11,120
others so that our meditation practice benefits not only ourselves but

99
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:18,200
everyone that we come in contact with so that we might have the benefit

100
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:24,960
give them the benefit of the doubt and be openhearted so in this

101
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:32,279
practice I'm sorry in this way may our practice be for the benefit of all

102
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:36,279
beings everywhere

103

[Music]

104
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:31,080
good evening good evening welcome

105
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:39,679
welcome I want to say it's nice to see you all but of course I don't actually see you all but I'm

106
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:46,159
imagining that uh we're all practicing together it's very nice for me to be

107
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:51,200
practicing with others even if we're not physically in the same

108
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:58,519
room so a number of years ago I was at the Asian Art Museum just here in in San

109
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:03,559
Francisco and I saw this beautiful statue of the

110
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:09,600
Buddha and I read the inscription that was underneath the statue

111
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:17,679
and I had to like it had a piece of scripture that I had never seen before

112
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:27,440
never heard about and I was like quite confused by it and this beautiful statue was maybe

113
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:34,600
the same size as this one and is in the same position as this one that is with

114
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:42,120
the right hand down and the left hand in their lap so I was a little bit curious what

115
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:47,480
is this this Museum I thought of course the

116
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:53,159
curator must be mistaken because never heard of this this was a number quite a

117
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:58,639
few years ago and I didn't know all the sutas or all the stories but never heard

118
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:04,880
that story that was associated with it well since then I have discovered

119
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:11,519
this story and I'd like to share it with you of about the Buddha that's in this

120
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:17,960
position it's a common one that we see with the I forgot what it is buis I

121
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:23,240
forgot the name in uh poly or Sanskrit of the mudra the the gesture of the

122
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:29,120
hands but with one hand pointing down and the other hand in the lap

123
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:35,559
and it has to do with the night of the Buddha's Awakening and the Buddha before he

124
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:41,240
became the Buddha was called the bodh satva and I think probably all of you

125
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:47,000
know there the story is that after a childhood of these

126
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,639
princely uh pleasures and comfort that he had some

127
00:31:53,639 --> 00:32:00,679
disillusionment and he fled home and did six years of meditation and

128
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:07,840
aesthetic practices including nearly starving himself to death and then he abandoned his

129
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:13,200
aesthetic practices started to eat again and then sat down underneath the booty

130
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,080
tree vowing that he wasn't going to get up until he achieved

131
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:24,159
Awakening so I just said there in one or two minutes you know which often is a

132
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:30,399
really long complicated beautiful story and then what happens next there's a

133
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:35,480
bunch of different versions of the story and I like to think of it as just like

134
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:41,840
every good story there's gets retold and retold and different tellings have

135
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:47,000
different emphases or maybe different interpretations different embellishments

136
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,200
or so here's one version that we find in the

137
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,440
nadana which is not uh commonly read um

138
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,760
it's in the Canon but uh not it's the introduction to the jica tales but

139
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:10,240
that's just a little aside so the story is that Mara who is

140
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,320
that personification of obstacles that's one when one way that we could

141
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:20,600
understand this character Mara that when he realized that the bodh

142
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:25,679
satva was sitting underneath the tree and was determined to become

143
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:32,000
awakened and Mara likes to keep people not awakened in

144
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,840
what we would call samura because Mara can influence individuals beings who are

145
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:45,399
here in samsara who are in this realm of existence unawakened maybe that's one

146
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:51,760
way that we translate some Sor that are unawakened and and Mara is perfectly

147
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:58,200
happy if everybody's having a wonderful time and even practice diligently Mara

148
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:04,840
just doesn't want them to become awakened so when he realized that the

149
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:10,638
bodh satva was really determined to become awakened he's wanted to put a stop to

150
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,839
it so he approached the Buddha and he was writing on this big giant elephant

151
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:21,480
there's a description of how big this elephant is you can imagine at that time

152
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:27,960
in Ancient India right the elephant is probably one of the biggest most powerful things that's known

153
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:33,599
right they of course they don't have any Motors or anything like this so an elephant is the most powerful thing and

154
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:39,638
this is a big elephant so not only is Mara riding on

155
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:44,839
this elephant but he has this giant army that's accompanying

156
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:51,358
him and and the intention is to get the bodh

157
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:57,280
SATA to move and disrupt his concentration or disrupt his vow to get

158
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:03,560
awake or whatever they can do so they have this rain this delu on

159
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:11,880
the bodhisatta and the rain of different objects and maybe some of you know this story so at first Mara raised a

160
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:19,280
tornado and then the had these winds that and the the story is that would

161
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:27,400
have shattered mountain peaks right these are some incredible winds but then um the text goes but by

162
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:33,839
the virtue and Majesty of the bodh satva the winds lost their force and on

163
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:40,040
reaching him they were not able to shake even the Hem of His

164
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:46,440
robe so it's quite something right to go from shaking Mountain Toops to not even

165
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:54,240
rustling one's clothing so in the same way Mara causes this downpour of rain actual

166
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:02,800
rain and this great flood came because of the the rain was so much and the flood like was submerging entire Forest

167
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,599
but then when it gets to the bodhisatta it um doesn't even dampen his

168
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:14,560
robes as much as a DW drop would so I kind of love these greatly exaggerated

169
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:21,480
stories but you get a sense of the power and the the power of

170
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:27,359
Mara and the power of the bodh SATA and Mara is trying to do whatever

171
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:34,920
he can to get the body SATA to get up and there's a a total of 10 different

172
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:42,160
things that get rained on spewed upon the bodh SATA so a shower of

173
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:48,200
rocks and uh weapons coals hot ashes

174
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:54,520
sandstorms mud all these things Gloom this darkness and all these later things

175
00:36:54,520 --> 00:37:01,319
when they that is the weapons and the coals and the lashes Etc when they are

176
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:08,240
uh thrown towards the bodh satva they all turn into flowers or garlands or

177
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,760
perfume or you know these beautiful things so pretty soon that bodh SATA has

178
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,800
all these flowers surrounding him and still he

179
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:26,160
sits determined to become an awakened and then Mara demanded that the

180
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:32,119
bodh Safa leave his seat claiming it as his own he says rise

181
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:38,079
sedor from that seat it is not meant for you it goes to

182
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:47,160
me a little twist to the story that Mara is saying well if anybody's going to become awaken it's going to be me not

183
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:54,079
you and sortha that's the name of the bodh SATA the give a name in this version of the

184
00:37:54,079 --> 00:38:02,560
story and he replies Mara this seat is not meant for you I alone have the right

185
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:09,000
to it claiming his right to sit there in that

186
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,839
seat and then he goes on and this part is what is kind of interesting is often a part of the story that we don't hear

187
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:22,560
about so then the bodh SATA says Mara who will testify to your having

188
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:28,240
been generous I can imagine maybe Mar is

189
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:36,200
scratching his head a little bit but then he replies by he stretches out his arms and looks to uh all the armies that

190
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:41,839
he has all these beings that are with him and he

191
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:50,200
says all of these are my Witnesses so Dortha who will testify for

192
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:55,480
you being generous right the bis SAA is sitting there by himself underneath the

193
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:01,160
tree and sedara responds by saying for your

194
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:07,319
generosity you have sentient Witnesses but I have no sentient

195
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:14,839
Witnesses looking around there's nobody else there it's just Mara and his

196
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:20,800
armies and then the body SATA says this solid

197
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:27,440
earth though not sentient Bears witness he took his right hand from

198
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,760
under his robe and extended it towards the great Earth as we see

199
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:40,000
here saying in my life as ventara I made the great gift of the

200
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,880
700s do you bear witness to that or not so he's talking to the Earth and the

201
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:51,560
Earth responds and Roars I was your witness

202
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:58,599
yes and then Mara with his on his elephants Mara's elephant kneels before

203
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:04,280
the bodh satva and then Mara and all of his army

204
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:13,920
turn around and run away so it's this recollection of his

205
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:23,240
generosity that bodhisatwa he remembers he brings to mind some generosity that he had done

206
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:30,480
there's a whole story around that we won't go into that now but it's it's quite something this is what made Mara

207
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,520
the elephant Neil and Mara to run away might be a little bit surprised right we

208
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:41,160
might expect some magnificent insights or some knowledge or some supernormal

209
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:48,720
Feats or something like this but it's his recalling his

210
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:54,880
generosity that created the conditions that caused Mara to leave obstacles to

211
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:02,240
leave and then he becomes awaken and becomes the Buddha the awakened

212
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:09,359
one so the sign he's calling to Earth his witness as his generosity as and this is one of the

213
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:16,760
favorite subjects in Buddhist art it's as you can see here is common for um statues but also in all kinds of Art and

214
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:24,760
throughout southeast Asia why generosity of all the topics that uh

215
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:33,119
could have been talked about then or some great wisdom or something why

216
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:39,040
generosity well we could say that generosity is foundational to Buddhist

217
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:46,839
practice in so many ways it's really foundational it's out of generosity so

218
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:52,599
many things flower and Blossom that are support for practice and are

219
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:58,520
practice and one is generosity is a type of letting go

220
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:05,319
it's a type of giving and in a way all of our practices

221
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:11,760
come down to Letting Go letting go we let go of our

222
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,440
attachments we let go of clinging we let go of our underlying

223
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:24,040
compulsion to cling to our desires to cling to our opinions instead we have

224
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:28,520
some open-heartedness and open-mindedness

225
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:35,960
we allow things to be as they are doesn't as well as putting effort to

226
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:41,480
make things to work towards making things wholesome and abandoning the UNH

227
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:47,359
wholesome but we don't do that by clinging and grabbing we doing it by letting

228
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:54,640
go we also let go of a sense of self that is this idea that there's a me

229
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:00,880
this all important me that's at the Center of everything we let go of

230
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:06,400
that this often doesn't really make sense until people have that experience

231
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:14,359
it's definely an experience rather than just a logical or logical idea or a belief you

232
00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:21,280
have to adopt instead it's more of an experience of noticing when there isn't a strong

233
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,480
sense of self maybe like when there's a sense of flow when you're doing one of your

234
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,960
favorite activ activities dancing Hobbies playing music listening to music

235
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:39,799
these are often times when there isn't a strong sense of self it's kind of a pointer towards

236
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:45,880
that so letting go so this practice is about letting go it's not about

237
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:51,559
acquiring getting I'm I'm kind of like grabbing my

238
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:57,400
fingers it's not about uh grasping

239
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:05,200
but so we can let go of an actual object or the grasping of that

240
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:11,920
object because this practice isn't that we have to let go of everything we just let go of those

241
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:18,920
things that aren't helpful unskillful UNH wholesome and those things that are

242
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:25,160
skillful and wholesome we just let go of the clinging to them but we still hold

243
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:31,000
them so maybe just do this right that Gil does this which is so helpful right

244
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:37,400
that it's not we can still hold things with a outstretched Palm as opposed to

245
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:44,880
clinging holding on to them but it's one thing to talk about it

246
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:51,839
to hear about it but to have the confidence and the trust to open the palm of the

247
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:57,200
hand this is a practice to gain this confidence this

248
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:03,079
trust to know that the way forward is to is that movement is that gesture of

249
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:11,599
opening the hand and generosity generosity is the

250
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:16,960
practice powerful practice that can really help us

251
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:23,480
to feel the beauty to feel the freedom but it's implicit whenever

252
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:28,800
there's this opening of the hands the opening of the heart and generosity by

253
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:37,040
definition is a letting go is an opening so that's one way in which

254
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:42,559
generosity is foundational to a Buddhist practice is that it really supports a

255
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:48,119
sense of Letting Go whether we're actually giving

256
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:55,119
objects material things money gifts objects or whether we're giving our

257
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:01,119
Attention our maybe our expertise our energy giving

258
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:07,640
the benefit of the doubt whatever whatever it might be this way generosity

259
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:12,720
is a type of way that helps cultivate

260
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:18,640
and and develop just this movement this gesture

261
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:23,960
of letting go but

262
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:29,440
generosity also has the op opposite

263
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:35,359
um the opposite impact and that it connects

264
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:42,000
us so it connects us to other people recognizing that we can't walk

265
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,119
this path all by ourselves sometimes we might wish to and there might be seasons

266
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:54,160
of our practice in which we spend a lot of time practicing on our own meditating but there will also need to be seasons

267
00:46:54,160 --> 00:47:01,160
in which we practice with others are supported by practice with

268
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:07,920
others and I have the wisdom of others to guide us and to support us and maybe

269
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:14,680
help us find our way so we might be giving our time and

270
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:20,559
our attention so again it's not only things but sometimes it's giving feels a

271
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:25,680
little bit awkward or we don't really know how to be generous in that

272
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:33,319
way um and I'm inspired by this writing by David White he's a poet and

273
00:47:33,319 --> 00:47:39,079
essayist and here's an excerpt from an essay that he wrote that it's not

274
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:46,480
exactly about generosity but um you'll see how it's uh connected to generosity I'll say that

275
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:52,119
when I heard this I felt inspired to be

276
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:58,280
generous and that's part of what this practice is also is to be connected to

277
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:05,559
what is inspiring what inspires us to be the best versions of ourselves okay so here's this passage

278
00:48:05,559 --> 00:48:11,880
from David White it's an essay but you can tell he's a poet a little bit by the his

279
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:20,200
writing it may be that the ability to know the necessity for help to know how

280
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:26,280
to look for that help and then most importantly how to ask for it is one of

281
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:33,520
the primary transformative dynamics that allows us to emancipate ourselves into

282
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:39,359
each new Epoch of our lives without the understanding that we

283
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:44,960
need a particular form of Aid at every crucial threshold in our lives and

284
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:51,079
without the robust vulnerability and asking for that help

285
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:56,280
we cannot pass through the door that bars us from the next dispensation of

286
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:04,200
Our Lives Liv we cannot birth ourselves every transformation has at

287
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:11,280
its heart the need to ask for the right kind of

288
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:19,359
generosity every transformation has at its heart the need to ask for the right

289
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:25,520
kind of generosity so David White is writing

290
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:32,559
from the perspective of asking for generosity but just hearing this it

291
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:38,559
feels like oh yes giving generosity giving help so that we

292
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:45,520
can assist be part of support these

293
00:49:45,799 --> 00:49:51,440
Transformations he writes with the next Epoch in our lives and to emancipate

294
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:57,359
ourselves into each new Epoch of Our Lives

295
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:06,040
and I think every crucial threshold in our lives requires some help and for us

296
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:14,799
to ask for that help and the vulnerability of asking for that help what a privilege it is to help

297
00:50:14,799 --> 00:50:22,880
others what a beautiful meaningful thing it is to be generous so that we can help

298
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:30,280
others with their Transformations whatever that might be wherever they are in their life whether

299
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:36,039
it's a young person an older person and in between AG

300
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,760
person whether this transformation is going from singlehood to being married

301
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:47,200
from maybe being married back to single again

302
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:53,280
maybe from becoming a I don't know there's so many different

303
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:59,359
Transformations we do in our lives right and some of them are just very gentle um

304
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:08,359
slide in and some of them are really uh abrupt and there's diagnosis deaths in

305
00:51:08,359 --> 00:51:15,480
the family these types of things so one way to frame

306
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:22,480
generosity is to help others but help others help themselves not because we

307
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:27,880
have all the answers or because um

308
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:34,559
they that we somehow are uh Superior in some kind of way but

309
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:40,319
just to whatever way that we can to help these Transformations that all of us go

310
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:45,960
through they're not easy so that's one part of generosity is

311
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:54,400
to connect us with others and to help others when they need it in a way that's

312
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:01,119
appropriate but also also generosity supports our relationships in other ways

313
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:07,160
too and the Buddha noticed this and he knew this and here's a quote from one of the

314
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:12,240
sutas generosity kind words doing a good turn

315
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:18,000
for others and treating all people alike these means of sustaining a

316
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:24,319
favorable relationship are like the Lynch pin of a rolling

317
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:31,760
Chariot I'll read it again generosity kind words doing a good turn

318
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:37,880
for others and treating all people alike these means of sustaining a

319
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:44,720
favorable relationship are like the Lynch pin of a rolling Chariot so they're

320
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:51,720
vital they if we don't have the this Lynch pin then the wheel gets disconnected from The Chariot and off it

321
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:57,440
goes and the charot doesn't go anywhere right

322
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:05,200
generosity kind words doing a good turn for others that is you

323
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:11,319
know helping them out is a way that can really support our relationship so

324
00:53:11,319 --> 00:53:17,839
generosity and thinking about others what would be helpful for them what would they like not in a way that we

325
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:23,960
abandon ourselves and not in the way that we allow boundaries to be crossed

326
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:29,559
or barriers to be crossed that are inappropriate but just to

327
00:53:29,559 --> 00:53:34,760
recognize that how generosity can really be a support for

328
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:42,079
relationships in whatever way it is one time I was on a walk with a friend of mine who

329
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:48,720
was a another Buddhist practitioner and it's lovely to walk in the neighborhood right

330
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:55,240
and see some of the people have beautiful landscaping and sometimes there's roses

331
00:53:55,240 --> 00:54:00,359
and we we were walking and there's this beautiful rose

332
00:54:00,359 --> 00:54:06,280
bush you just really in beautiful that you wanted to stop and admire and smell

333
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:14,319
the roses of course right but then I felt really touched when my walking partner said

334
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:19,599
here I'd like to offer this Rose to you without picking the rose or anything

335
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:26,880
like this but just just uh kind of like the generous Spirit it was so great cuz

336
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:32,520
that Rose I I felt so happy that it stayed on the bush where it could be fresh for longer and other people

337
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:39,720
walking by could see it so sometimes generosity just has a simple gesture

338
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:45,559
like that but it made me feel realize oh this person really cares about me it was

339
00:54:45,559 --> 00:54:49,960
a very tender lovely

340
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:56,799
gesture so generosity connects us also because it

341
00:54:56,799 --> 00:55:03,359
supports our relationships and then also generosity

342
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:10,319
is related to the Brahma viharas that is these four qualities of the

343
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:16,640
heart probably all of you are familiar with them but at the moment of giving at

344
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:24,559
the moment when we're being generous we're letting go we're letting go of desire and

345
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:30,760
grasping and we're also letting go of ill will letting go of aversion and that

346
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:36,799
moment when we're giving whether it's a material object or

347
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:41,880
not there's these beautiful qualities of the heart that are

348
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:47,240
present and so there might be some loving kindness might feel some Goodwill

349
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:54,839
towards the person who is receiving our generosity we might feel a connection

350
00:55:54,839 --> 00:56:02,160
with them rather than some alienation or we there's a our being

351
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:09,400
generous is an expression of we want them to be happy so loving kindness and generosity

352
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:14,640
generosity and compassion we wish the person to be free from suffering maybe

353
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:22,039
that's why we are helping to help them with some difficulty and we also when there's

354
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:29,960
compassion there's a certain tenderness there's a openness of the heart and generosity often has that too right

355
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:35,200
this sharing this tenderness in the

356
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:42,640
heart and compassion also I'm sorry and generosity also is

357
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:48,039
associated with sympathetic Joy the third Brahma vihara that is that we

358
00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:53,119
Delight in their happiness their happiness in receiving whatever it is

359
00:56:53,119 --> 00:57:01,559
we're being generous about this is why it's so so wonderful to go to birthday parties right to see people uh receive

360
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:07,359
gifts and to see how the recipient is happy and we like to make people happy

361
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:12,520
in that way and to see their happiness for us to be happy in their Happyness

362
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:21,880
and receiving and we want their happiness to increase this is why we're giving them a

363
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:28,839
gift and generosity is also associated with Quin imity that is that means that

364
00:57:28,839 --> 00:57:37,680
we have an object that we're willing to let go of or maybe it's not an object it's a a view or a stance that we're not

365
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:43,359
holding too tightly we're willing to let go of that is we have a balanced

366
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:49,880
relationship with it and that we are willing we're capable to be without it

367
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:56,680
and we're allowing others to be with it if necessary so in this way

368
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:03,039
generosity also connects us to others through the Brahma vajar through

369
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:09,440
helping and just supports our relationships and then as I started to

370
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:15,640
say that generosity is also about letting go this kind of movement of letting

371
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:21,480
go so in some ways we could see how generosity why the Buddha right before

372
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:26,640
his Awakening and what kind of frightens Mara and has him run away

373
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:34,280
even though he's so powerful with these big armies powerful armies is

374
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:40,920
generosity it's foundational to so many practices and anybody can do

375
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:47,880
it it doesn't require a meditation practice it doesn't require that you know with some Buddhist

376
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:54,200
teachings we can be generous in our daily life we can be

377
00:58:54,200 --> 00:59:00,280
generous towards ourselves and the attitude we have towards ourselves or the way that we show up in the

378
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:06,799
world so my invitation is when you have this inclination to be generous when it

379
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:14,880
the thought arises in your mind to be generous go ahead and be generous don't hesitate don't maybe talk yourself out

380
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:22,640
of it or or rationalize it away I heard Joseph

381
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:27,799
Goldstein one of the kind of the senior members of our

382
00:59:27,799 --> 00:59:34,200
Community talk about how he had this as a practice to always be generous and I

383
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:41,200
figured well if it's good enough for Joseph Goldstein it's good enough for me and I have to say I have never regretted

384
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:47,039
it when I've been generous and I have regretted those times when I thought oh

385
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:53,200
it'll be a little bit awkward I'm not sure if I want to give this to this person I've always regretted that I

386
00:59:53,200 --> 01:00:00,920
didn't so generosity supports letting go and also supports

387
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:08,640
connecting to others so may your generosity be a support for your practice and be a

388
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:16,280
support for others around you so that all beings without exception can be free

389
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:21,400
from suffering thank you
