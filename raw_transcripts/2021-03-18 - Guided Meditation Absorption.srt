1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,440
so warm greetings everyone

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:21,359
and we're continuing this process of

3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,960
this exploration of samadhi and often in buddhism in

4
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,120
english buddhist buddhisms often enough the deepening levels of samadhi are

5
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,719
sometimes called absorptions to be absorbed

6
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:47,920
and in some ways it's an apt uh description of them the um

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:55,760
if we liken it to the idea of uh being absorbed in a good book or absorbed and listening to music or

8
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:03,840
um absorbed in some hot craft that we're doing that absorbed in a movie that uh

9
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,159
to absorb just to be fully uh attentive to it where kind of all our

10
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:17,920
senses are either focused on what we're doing or the senses kind of have receded from

11
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,000
receded from getting much attention from us so if you're absorbed in a book you

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,280
might not be listening so much to what's going around you someone might even talk to you and you don't hear them

13
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,520
because you're really absorbed and but not in meditation it's not a

14
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:43,119
it's an absorb that kind of absorption is one of great interest or usually there's a kind of sense of

15
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:49,759
goodness or wholesomeness and people usually part of the joy of being absorbed in a book or something is the

16
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,439
absorption itself and so same thing with samadhi it's a

17
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:02,240
very nice state of absorption it's not a turning off of the world but rather it's letting the

18
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:10,239
world around us fall away as we enter into a very wholesome healthy

19
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,599
state a healthy kind of and all the you know steps of anapanasati these

20
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,840
steps of deepening meditation are steps that are opening up and

21
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,480
evoking healthier and healthier states of being inside and of course it's not always going to

22
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,480
be that way and it's a process to get there but to know that we're looking for the inner health

23
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,920
we're looking to recognize where nourishment is what's wholesome is here and so we do that in the very beginning

24
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,440
trying to can we approach meditation in a healthy

25
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:52,959
wholesome way without greed or contraction or conceit or pouncing on things or

26
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:59,920
strong aversion trying to escape and push things away can we have a spirit of generosity

27
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,360
of kindness a warmth of good will and ease as we start engaging

28
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:15,040
our attentional capacities our ability to bring attention and then we begin finding where as we

29
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,840
pay attention how to evoke and spread and develop good feelings in the body partly because

30
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,680
we're starting to relax this process of relaxation is such a healthy thing to do

31
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,519
and and so as as a meditation deepens at some point the inner

32
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:40,080
health the inner goodness the nourishment the wholesomeness feels so great that it becomes easier

33
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:47,599
and easier to be absorbed in that to feel connected to it to be really there and

34
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,280
so to be absorbed and i also delight in the idea that that

35
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:01,680
of using the metaphor of a sponge a sponge absorbs water and the same way

36
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,640
there's a we absorb the sensations we absorb this experience of breathing

37
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,599
we allow it to just kind of like the whole body is the sponge and um and we just kind of like are

38
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,440
there to receive and be take in the whole experience of the present moment

39
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:28,320
in a receptive way in an open way and and the sponges i don't think force the

40
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,639
world to force the itself to absorb water just that's what it is

41
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,919
sponges do they just absorb so this absorption that absorbs the absorption

42
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:47,680
that really let's allows there to be a kind of a intimacy and a receptivity in a

43
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,759
to our experience to our breathing to be absorbed in the breathing

44
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,280
so assuming a meditation posture

45
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,560
and perhaps sitting in such a way meditating such a posture where the chest is a little bit more

46
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:13,360
open open to be receptive and sometimes when the chest is a little

47
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,400
more open it's a little bit more useful than or

48
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:26,240
capable to relax the belly so softness throughout the front of our

49
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:34,240
body soft front and sometimes it said that in meditation

50
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,600
we have a soft front and a strong back

51
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:47,039
and so to feel this especially if you're sitting upright to feel a little bit of strength

52
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:53,520
in the back stability

53
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:00,160
maybe adjusting the vertebrae a little bit so the spine is a little bit more aligned

54
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,160
centered and instead of strength

55
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,639
maybe some of you prefer the word stability

56
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:23,039
stability strength of the back and the softness and openness in the front

57
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:35,840
and to gently close your eyes and to take a few long slow deep breaths

58
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:46,560
kind of a ritual procedure for adjusting your state of mind

59
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,520
your state of body your attitude

60
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,599
into one that can begin to be absorbed in this practice of meditation

61
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:05,440
that is put aside temporarily its concerns of the past and the future or other

62
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:13,039
places other times it is prepared preparing itself

63
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,840
to settle in here and now

64
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:30,000
and then letting your breathing return to normal

65
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,800
to continue this process of softening the front of our body by as you exhale softening the face

66
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,840
face is where we present to the world so much but in meditation we don't need to

67
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:59,840
activate the face we can let it rest

68
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,919
on the exhale softening the shoulders

69
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,319
releasing to the pull of gravity the weight of the shoulders

70
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,840
adjusting your arms so that they can be loose and relaxed

71
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,839
softening in the chest

72
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:55,839
and relaxing the belly

73
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:02,080
and wherever you feel you're breathing the predominant place the common place

74
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:10,000
for experiencing the body breathing imagine that location

75
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,480
is a sponge for the sensations

76
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:23,440
of breathing so it's not so much that you're in the control tower

77
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,839
thinking looking down at breathing it's more like you

78
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:37,920
are that sponge in the body especially the inhale absorbing

79
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,519
the sensations of the inhale

80
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:53,839
and if those sensations are like water then in the exhale spreading

81
00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:05,839
the goodness of that water throughout the body

82
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:17,519
absorbing the inhale and releasing it all on the exhale

83
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:33,839
throughout the body

84
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,880
and can you adjust your mind a little bit

85
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:51,759
so your mind is more like doing tai chi mental tai chi of receiving and flowing

86
00:10:52,240 --> 00:11:01,839
moving along with the breathing

87
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:14,640
maybe as if the mind becomes more and more like water flowing

88
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,560
with and over and through the breathing

89
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:43,839
or as if the mind also gets absorbed into the body the body sponge

90
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:57,839
and abiding in the body breathing

91
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:08,839
abiding in intimacy will you turn yourself over to your

92
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:16,399
breathing entrusting yourself to your breathing

93
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:24,880
absorbed in the goodness of breathing

94
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:31,360
and whenever you exhale and you need to remember to let go of whatever takes you

95
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,680
away from your breathing let the breathing be the center of it

96
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,959
all the foundation of everything

97
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:53,839
the beginning of it all the end of it all just breathing

98
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:56,320
being absorbed in breathing not as a rejection of anything else

99
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:02,480
but in a way let everything else recede to the background

100
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,600
where your interest your involvement

101
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:18,558
your life energy

102
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:24,319
is intimately involved connected to

103
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,840
breathing

104
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:32,880
perhaps it's easier to be absorbed in the breathing if you make a small half smile with your

105
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,799
lips just turn up the corners of your lips just a little bit

106
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:50,720
it maybe shifts the mood just enough then it's easier to flow with the

107
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,840
breathing

108
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,240
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

109
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:54,880
to bring forth whatever

110
00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:04,080
good will tenderness love that might live in your heart

111
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:12,640
that lives within you in whatever way that that caring

112
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:20,640
loving part of you can come forth as we sit here

113
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,840
and breathe with that

114
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:40,080
let that be absorbed into the bodies the sponge as you breathe in

115
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,840
and may that spread through your body as you exhale

116
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:57,200
like water being absorbed and then dispersed

117
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:09,840
the water of love and kindness compassion good will

118
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,760
and without any responsibility to act on your love your goodwill

119
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:25,039
to simply sit here open to it

120
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:36,080
feel it and see if you can

121
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:45,360
sit quietly for a few moments more gazing kindly with kind eyes

122
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:52,720
on the people of your life those you know well those you barely

123
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,880
know

124
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:09,039
strangers and perhaps and thinking about

125
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:15,679
maybe some of the people you will encounter today without needing to do anything with them

126
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:23,039
at all this while you're sitting here see can you gaze upon them kindly

127
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:33,840
can you hold them in the warmth of your heart

128
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:42,720
and taking a few moments to do this he expresses our a wish

129
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,720
that our meditation practice supports us

130
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:57,120
in bringing helpful healthy attitudes to this world

131
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,799
around us that meditation is not just for ourselves

132
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:08,240
but it's also for how we see and relate to others

133
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,840
and maybe we unders discover more and more how that's the case

134
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:23,279
may it be that we meditate for the welfare and happiness of all beings

135
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:31,039
ourself included may all beings be happy

136
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,880
may all beings be safe

137
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:45,278
may all beings be peaceful

138
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:57,840
may all beings everywhere be free

139
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,080
you
