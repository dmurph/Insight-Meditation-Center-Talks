1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,280
so warm greetings from redwood city

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:18,240
and as we continue this

3
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,880
series on mindfulness of breathing

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:34,640
the mindfulness practice has both a deliberate side of the practice

5
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:42,000
and that which is non-deliberate or to say it may be

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,239
maybe in a clearer away that which is active that we do and that which is

7
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:57,680
passive that we allow for and the balance between those two shifts and changes as the practice goes

8
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,280
along so certainly if a person has never heard of meditation before

9
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:11,040
and they maybe read a book about it and say i'm going to meditate they have to actively put themselves

10
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,159
maybe into a meditation posture and kind of get themselves started and

11
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:22,400
change the maybe the the momentum of their mind even from what

12
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,759
they have been doing to have the momentum of the mind being being little bit

13
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:34,079
different now the momentum of the mind is to be present to be present without a

14
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:41,119
lot of thinking about things or reacting to things but to have some ability to stay present

15
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:47,840
and maybe to stay present in a very simple way in the present moment with something like the breathing just

16
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,240
being with the breathing staying on the breathing and and so there's a deliberateness to

17
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,399
that there's an active quality to that that um that needs to be there

18
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,000
as the practice deepens or as it were able to stay more and more in the present moment

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,920
there's uh less of the deliberateness is needed um it's almost as if the deliberateness

20
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,959
is set in place the motion to let go of all the distracted forces

21
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:24,480
all the different things we might be doing and uh and so now we're kind of at rest staying

22
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:32,720
here present and we don't have to do any more deliberateness in it and so to borrow from an ancient

23
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,879
metaphor um if a um

24
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:47,440
someone who herds sheep a shepherd is you know the sheep have

25
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,040
gathered all over the mountainside and the shepherd deliberately travels around

26
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,640
the mountains searching looking trying to find the sheep to gather them together

27
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:05,120
so there's a deliberateness and active looking for those sheep once all the sheep have been gathered

28
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,640
and they brought back to down by the river where they're in the

29
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,760
core pasture area is perhaps and they're all gathered there and they're happily eating in the

30
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,200
in the pasture then the shepherd can lean back against the nice

31
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,599
trees trunk of the tree and the shade on a warm day maybe looking out across the pasture

32
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:34,959
and then there's not much deliberateness in the looking anymore there's not much intent to look and find

33
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:42,319
and find the sheep now the shepherd can just sit back and gaze in a kind of more receptive

34
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,680
open passive perhaps way of just kind of

35
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,959
gazing upon and rather than looking for the sheep

36
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:59,040
the shepherd is content just to see the sheep to allow the seeing to happen without

37
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,360
needing to search or look to be intentional so the same way with mindfulness practice as it

38
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:13,599
initially there's an active quality deliberateness the training come back focus be there and

39
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,880
and with time uh everything gets gathered together all the desperate parts of ourselves

40
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,919
that have been lost up in the mountains and wandering around have been gathered

41
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,600
together come back to the pasture where they can kind of

42
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:37,759
eat what's nourishing and supportive the buddha called mindfulness when it's really gathered in

43
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,199
and centered on the body the feelings the mind and the mental processes

44
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:51,040
to be a pastor for the meditator and everything's gathered together here and now what we can do is we're not so

45
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,800
active but we just we just observe there's

46
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,759
there's seeing but no looking in sense that looking being the active

47
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:10,160
engagement of the eyes and seeing is just what happens when we allow the eyes to operate

48
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,479
like the difference between listening which is active and hearing which

49
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:23,280
doesn't have to be active it just we hear something without trying to hear it

50
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:31,680
so the emphasis today is um is to kind of begin appreciating

51
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:39,840
the the way in which mindfulness can be a passive receptive quality

52
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,560
that doesn't require so much work it's not so deliberate because a deliberateness has brought us

53
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:53,600
to the point where we can let go of that deliberateness and um and so at this point the buddha

54
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,199
actually uses the language of observing just observe

55
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,840
and so this is the direction we go today in the

56
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,800
meditation so taking a comfortable

57
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:18,840
upright posture upright meaning engaged and

58
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,478
intentional the deliberate posture even if it's laying down

59
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:34,080
and then taking some long slow deliberate breaths deliberate way

60
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,360
of deliberate ritual almost

61
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,960
of turning towards this experience here and now

62
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:53,759
and deliberately as you exhale to relax the body settle in

63
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:03,840
deep breath in and then settling into this body

64
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:11,759
letting your breathing return to normal and then to

65
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:19,520
as you exhale deliberately bring your attention to different parts of your body

66
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:26,000
and deliberately actively relax those parts

67
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:34,319
so and sometimes a sense of deliberateness is a way of being definitive or

68
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:41,440
clear that this is what i'm going to do now is be here in the present moment

69
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:50,240
so bring the attention to the face and relaxing on the exhale

70
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,759
all the muscles of the face

71
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,280
softening around the eyes

72
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,840
and if the eyes are trying to look

73
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:17,039
intentionally searching for something maybe let the eyes rest

74
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:27,840
soften the eyes in their sockets

75
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,680
into as you exhale

76
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,839
to soften the chest

77
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,839
bring the attention to the shoulders soften the shoulders

78
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:14,720
bring this the attention to the belly and as you exhale softening the belly

79
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:28,320
and then bringing the attention to the global body whatever way is easy for you

80
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:36,560
to have a global awareness of the body

81
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:51,839
and as you exhale relaxing the body

82
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,880
and there can be a deliberateness around the mind as well

83
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:06,880
to bring your attention to the mind where you feel the mental

84
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,800
activity and thinking the most

85
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,240
and as you exhale to soften

86
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:32,000
the mind to quiet the mental activities

87
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,839
calming the thinking mind

88
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,480
and part of the reason we get pulled into distractions

89
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:58,880
is because there's some emotional force motion emotions that

90
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:07,279
they're kind of pushing us in a direction or evoking the thoughts

91
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,279
and whatever

92
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:21,920
anxiety there might be see if you can relax it and soften

93
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:33,200
in a way that's reassuring to yourself it's okay to be here

94
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,079
relaxed

95
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:50,320
if there's excitement or desires or aversions or resentments

96
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:57,839
annoyances that are driving your thinking

97
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:08,079
on the exhale perhaps you can gently lovingly settle those

98
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,839
quiet those

99
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:59,760
and then to settle into your breathing to deliberately maybe even

100
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,399
lovingly

101
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:21,839
turn your attention over [Music] to the experience of the body breathing

102
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:38,800
making room in your body for the body to breathe just the way it does

103
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:47,279
lots of breathing rumor to breathe as you're breathing as

104
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,040
the breathing is breathing itself

105
00:13:53,519 --> 00:14:02,240
whatever way your breathing is okay make room for it feel it

106
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:17,839
hang in there with it

107
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,800
and then imagine that you're at ease resting against a

108
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,639
trunk of a tree looking out upon

109
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:28,160
a pasture perhaps an expanse and simply see the breathing

110
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:37,759
in a receptive allowing non-deliberate way

111
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,839
but more receptive way

112
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,920
from the kind of observation

113
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,839
it doesn't interfere with what's being seen

114
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:08,000
seeing just allows the breathing to be as it is

115
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,680
simply as something to be seen to be observed

116
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,680
as a naturalist would observe

117
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:26,560
animals and nature without disturbing them just observing them

118
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,519
without judging them just observing

119
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:43,680
settle down settle back and observe the inhales and the exhales

120
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:50,880
allowing everything else around you to settle down and relax

121
00:16:50,880 --> 00:17:05,839
because all you need to do is to observe your breathing

122
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:19,039
when your mind wanders off intentionally deliberately bring it back

123
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:27,600
and then when you're back see if you can relax the deliberateness

124
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:36,640
to observe to just sit back and watch observe the breathing

125
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,000
observe your experience in the present moment

126
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:52,880
as an uninvolved non-interfere observer

127
00:23:52,880 --> 00:24:05,840
just observing

128
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,840
so

129
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,760
when we actively are intentionally deliberately

130
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:08,400
looking we might not notice the things we're not

131
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:15,200
looking for but when we're seeing settling back

132
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:24,000
opening up relaxing we might see a wider range of things the observation the observing

133
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,520
might be broad and more inclusive

134
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:36,080
as we come to the end of this sitting i'd like to say the same thing is true

135
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:42,080
for love as wonderful as

136
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:51,278
intentional deliberate love and acts of love can be

137
00:27:51,919 --> 00:28:00,080
there is loving which is not so deliberate intentional

138
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:07,760
it's more of an open field like observing

139
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:16,000
just observing the scenery there's something about

140
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,480
love when it's not directed not so deliberate

141
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:31,039
that can grow wide and broad and encompass so much more than what we're

142
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:35,360
direct directing our love towards

143
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:45,279
and so with our good will to bring these two together love and

144
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:51,600
observation to settle back and just observe the

145
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:59,840
the layout the scenery the broad open non-interfering way

146
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:05,840
can make room for our love to be the same

147
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:13,600
broad expansive encompassing without interfering

148
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,799
without directing without needing

149
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:26,000
sitting in with our trunk our back against the trunk of the tree

150
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:33,679
looking out across the pasture with a love a good will a kindness

151
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:42,559
for it all the full expanse of love

152
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:54,799
so in the last moments of this sitting perhaps you can feel your way or

153
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:00,960
to a way of kindness good will love which

154
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:09,120
needs nothing from others which is secure in itself

155
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:16,159
that can just be broad and encompassing at all

156
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:23,840
broad and non-interfering kindness good will

157
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:32,640
expressed in the words may all beings be happy

158
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:41,120
may all beings be safe

159
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:50,880
may all beings be peaceful

160
00:30:50,880 --> 00:31:05,840
may all beings be free

161
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,960
and resting in this kind of good will

162
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:18,480
may we deliberately express this good will
