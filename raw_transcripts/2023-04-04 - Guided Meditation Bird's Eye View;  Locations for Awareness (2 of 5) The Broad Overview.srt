1
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:12,440
so hello everyone and

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,740
welcome

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:27,180
and uh the topic for this week is changing

4
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,619
perspectives for awareness and um

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,340
the um

6
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,620
so often we are aware we might be mindful we're aware

7
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,079
with intention or without intention but we never question the perspective

8
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:01,199
with which we're aware the orientation and

9
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,840
some people are very much aware and with their head or their thinking

10
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:14,420
some people are very somatic and aware with or through their feelings

11
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:22,040
so this we can and so without questioning I think this is the way it is and when we do mindfulness practice

12
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:29,759
we can begin questioning the way that we're aware not so much to feel that one way is

13
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,979
necessarily better than other all the time but to have a range of perspectives

14
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:42,140
range is a way of being aware so we can know how to shift it according to what the need is

15
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,119
uh so for today

16
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:53,159
I'll offer you a little guided uh imagery

17
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,380
to begin this meditation to maybe give you a sense of a

18
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:05,719
perspective that's sometimes useful so to

19
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:12,800
assume a meditation posture

20
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,200
gently closing your eyes

21
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,519
and to take a few breaths deep breaths to settle in

22
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,319
to relax into here

23
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:32,599
and then to let your breathing be normal

24
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,519
and take a few moments here kind of uh

25
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:46,459
Broad awareness of your posture whatever posture you're in

26
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:04,519
be aware of whatever is happening for you The Experience that's within the posture

27
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:10,640
emotions thoughts feelings Sensations

28
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:20,840
the way you would check in with yourself if someone asks you how are you

29
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:36,300
and then to and now

30
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,259
imagine

31
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:48,419
the room that you're sitting in if you're sitting indoors if you're Outdoors imagine the location

32
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:55,699
you're in with your eyes closed see if you can reconstruct a bit

33
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:06,600
the location in which you're sitting the windows the walls

34
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:13,759
objects in the room where the door is

35
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:27,840
in your mind's eye either visualizing it or just with your thoughts recalling the

36
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,880
different parts of this room that you're in

37
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:45,479
and that as if you have a bird's eye view of the room

38
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:50,580
now imagine yourself sitting in the room Just the

39
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:56,100
Way You Are from a distance

40
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:02,900
kind of seeing the room from a distance with this person in it who is meditating

41
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:12,479
maybe uh a fly on the ceiling

42
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,860
what it would look like to look down upon the room and see this person there

43
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:29,720
and maybe in the room around you there's Stillness

44
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:35,660
there's no movement in the room except for maybe you breathing

45
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:45,300
there's a lot of space around you

46
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:51,419
it's visualize or sense the space the distance

47
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:55,819
between objects in the room and you

48
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:05,580
and from this distance imaginary distance of looking down upon

49
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,080
the room and you meditating

50
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,900
recall how you were feeling at the beginning of the meditation

51
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:29,720
and what's it like to be aware

52
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:36,060
of yourself from the distance of like a fly in the ceiling

53
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:44,840
in the context of this room to be aware of yourself from a distance

54
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,039
or some things easier to be aware of

55
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,080
something's more difficult

56
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:07,560
but might there be from a distance of the ceiling less identification

57
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:14,940
less activation or entanglement just seeing everything feeling

58
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:21,440
everything as if seeing it from a distance with lots of space around it

59
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:35,640
or you can imagine that you're a bird high in the sky looking

60
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,200
down in the building you're in

61
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:55,459
and from that distance what's it like to be aware of yourself

62
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:02,839
be aware of the dramas of your life the concerns and fears of your life

63
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,100
the stories the events

64
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:16,459
to be aware of it all from a distance maybe high in the sky

65
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,079
one person among many people

66
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:31,279
on a great planet sitting quietly meditating

67
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:09,620
and now imagine that you zoom back into your room

68
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:17,339
maybe a fly on the ceiling just as close head now closer in

69
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:22,519
aware of this person that's you sitting in the room

70
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,320
and now to zoom even closer in

71
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:39,560
and settle into your usual way of meditating with yourself

72
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:48,899
but this time baby with a little bit more

73
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:56,399
openness equanimity spaciousness non-involvement

74
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:06,260
just allowing things to be quiet and simple whatever it might be

75
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:16,680
a sense of non-entanglement without being bothered by anything

76
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:24,740
whatever you're feeling or thinking just something else to be aware of

77
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:31,680
with a kind of babies ease or distance

78
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,540
as if you're aware from far away

79
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,440
foreign

80
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,559
thank you

81
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,539
come here

82
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:28,340
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

83
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:35,340
to engage your imagination a little just enough

84
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:41,960
to imagine that now you turn your gaze out to the world

85
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,980
maybe with the bird's eye view

86
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:54,539
gazing kindly and all the people in your life

87
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:58,700
in your neighborhood in your town

88
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:05,899
in your province Wherever You Are

89
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:13,559
see if you can gaze upon them with a gaze that's like rain gentle rain

90
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,980
that

91
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:24,440
brings kindness care respect

92
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:30,778
seeing everyone as important valuable

93
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,960
granting everyone their dignity and

94
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:45,659
a broad wide gaze of kindness of care compassion

95
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:56,419
the broad view the bird's eye view

96
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,720
through which the heart's love can

97
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,620
flow outwards wishing everyone well

98
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:19,100
having good will for all beings

99
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:25,340
may all beings be happy

100
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,260
may all beings be safe

101
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:37,580
may all beings be peaceful

102
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:42,919
may all beings be free

103
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:54,919
and may we follow or get the Gaze of kindness

104
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,919
to be kind in this world

105
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:19,158
[Music]

106
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:28,279
[Music] thank you

107
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:44,159
foreign so hello and welcome to the second talk

108
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:49,559
and um it involves changing the this week the

109
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:56,159
topic is changing our perspectives or locations for how we're aware

110
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:02,039
and I'll give you um somewhat no known well-known Chinese

111
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:08,520
story of a very skilled painter

112
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:14,700
I had a very big canvas and on that canvas he was painting a

113
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:22,440
very realistic life-sized tiger and um and he was um

114
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:28,260
so in there with the details of the tiger doing the doing it all and then when more or less had finished

115
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:35,220
the tiger the artist stepped back 10 feet to look at this big picture and

116
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:41,580
what he had done and it was so realistic he got afraid and ran away

117
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:46,860
so when he was close up the details of it didn't bother him but stepping away

118
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:53,640
the full picture seemed too realistic for him the opposite can also happen

119
00:31:53,640 --> 00:32:02,899
that we can be frightened by being really close up to something and when we step back then we

120
00:32:02,899 --> 00:32:08,360
are no longer frightened the um

121
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:14,159
I once took my son to the San Francisco Zoo and there was this big room you will

122
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:20,100
go into and and it went under the room was a big cage with very thick solid

123
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:26,039
bars behind which was a lion and my son was very young so I was

124
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:31,500
holding him carrying him in there and the way it worked you could actually get very close to the lion I think maybe

125
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:40,320
we're three feet away and um and looking at it and the lion roared

126
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:46,500
and these solid Bars were between us and the lion but boy that I don't know if I got

127
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:52,620
afraid but I certainly got a lot of respect for that lion so much so that I

128
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:59,100
turned around and left and from outside the big door going in I could look back on the lot on the lion

129
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:05,480
and you know it's just a lion in a cage and I felt a little bit sorry for it being there

130
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:13,200
so you know how close we are how far away we are makes a big difference and so learning to shift our

131
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:19,799
perspectives in some ways sometimes with the help of the imagination to get a different perspective uh either being

132
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:25,220
really close to being a far away today I want to emphasize this being far away

133
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:30,480
sometimes if we're sitting with a lot of difficult emotions like a lot of fear

134
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:37,019
and we are kind of caught in it and concerned with it reacting to it and it

135
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:43,919
just seems too much in there it just seems like we're overwhelmed by it sometimes that's because of the

136
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:51,000
perspective in which we're being aware it's difficult enough what's happening but where the awareness is kind of in

137
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,159
the fear caught in it or entangle with it or wetted to it kind of right up

138
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:02,039
against it close it's almost like the fear takes over the whole room because the room of awareness

139
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:07,280
is so small so with an act of imagination we can

140
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:13,679
spread and expand our awareness maybe imagine that we're standing 10 feet away

141
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:19,200
and looking at ourselves and from 10 feet away from there we can feel the

142
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,599
fear we can see the fear we can be with the fear we can't be with the fear close in

143
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:31,679
but step back 10 feet I've known people who you ask them to step back maybe on the hillside that's

144
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,898
maybe 300 yards away or something and look back at themselves can you be with

145
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:42,720
your fear from that distance and they say oh but that distance is okay and then they have a little bit more

146
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:48,658
Equanimity a little more space less reactivity to their fear and it's a whole different thing

147
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:53,878
the same thing with pain physical pain sometimes is easier to be

148
00:34:53,879 --> 00:35:00,839
aware of for really close in which is a topic for tomorrow or it can be easier to be aware of if we

149
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:06,540
just open up really wide and imagine that we're seeing the whole landscape

150
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:12,480
and the fear is just one little piece of it and then we might realize that how much

151
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,640
we were reactive to the fear and kind of living right connected to it kind of as

152
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:25,200
if it was the most important thing it was a crisis and this has had to be dealt with or something but to step back step back step back

153
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:32,579
take that backward step so that we have some distance and some spaciousness around the pain and the pain is still

154
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:40,079
pain but some of the intensity of it goes away because some of the intensity of it has to do with our reactivity

155
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,480
you know pain is a complicated phenomenon it's not a unitary single thing

156
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:52,020
same thing with emotions they're not unitary single things there's a lot that goes into the construction of pain the

157
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:59,940
constructions of emotions and some of that has to do with how close in or how far away uh how much

158
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:06,359
space how little space we feel like we have for what what we're experiencing

159
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:11,520
so finding ways to open up to be spacious to create lots of room

160
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:17,339
and one way to do that is to imagine that your your eyes your inner eye your

161
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:25,740
perception your sense has taken a backward step really far away and looking back on you in a situation

162
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:31,380
now this could also be used to be disassociated and aloof from the experience

163
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:37,740
but that's not what I'm suggesting what I'm suggesting is getting this bird's eye view of yours

164
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:43,560
what's happening with you step back enough so that you can have some non-reactivity

165
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:48,960
in the awareness so you can be less entangled or reactive to it

166
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,780
and then you can start seeing it more clearly and then you might be able to see not only what's happening you know

167
00:36:54,780 --> 00:37:02,099
the the emotion the pain or whatever but you might also be able to start kind of

168
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:09,078
working on understanding your relationship to it all the reactivity itself

169
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:14,400
one of the first times when I had an aha moment around this kind of Shifting of

170
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,820
perspective was um in in when I was in college I was

171
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:24,960
on the balcony it was looking back through the window and some friends

172
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:31,740
talking in the in the living room of the apartment we were in and uh and I couldn't hear what they

173
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:37,740
were saying but they were expressing themselves quite vigorously with their hands and their I think they

174
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:45,240
were having a good time but it was like quite animated with their bodies and and I kind of gazed at them without

175
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:52,740
being able to hear what they said and I could feel how I was just kind of marveling at their communication and and

176
00:37:52,740 --> 00:38:00,000
kind of appreciating them in a different way in a nicer way but maybe than I had

177
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,220
if I had been involved with the conversation or if I'd been knowing what they said and I was thinking about what

178
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:11,640
they said that that distance kind of made a difference it changed the perspective and it wasn't like it was a better

179
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:19,320
perspective it was just a different it was nice to have that difference or I've been in in groups of people that

180
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:24,359
have been having a lot of difficulty and arguing talking hotly and things and

181
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:30,780
then for some reason had to step away and then when I came back I stood from the distance watching the group kind of

182
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:36,780
in their whole you know upset way kind of talking and I didn't

183
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:43,079
feel like I was in the upset anymore I could just kind of watch it and I could watch it with kindness with compassion

184
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:50,460
and and take it in and get a bigger picture of what was going on oh I see what's happening here so and so is like

185
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:56,640
this so-and-so's like that then looks like they're missing each other and and I got a whole more useful perspective

186
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:03,660
than if I'd been in the frame itself so in your in meditation this can be

187
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:08,700
done if you might be in the middle of The Fray You might be so preoccupied in

188
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:15,480
thoughts and stories and what happened earlier today or what's planning for tomorrow or the emotions might be quite

189
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:21,599
strong and difficult and and if you just kind of show up for your

190
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:27,300
experience with an usual attention you have that might not be the right attention

191
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:33,900
for you to have some kind of balance as you're with it and you might be too close it might be

192
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:41,940
too claustrophobic too tight not enough space and um and so learning how to step back

193
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:48,780
the backward step that creates space the the resting back with awareness to make

194
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:54,240
bigger awareness for the situation imagining that you're far away looking

195
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:01,800
down uh on your on yourself and then maybe then being able to see

196
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:08,940
what's going on in a clearer more peaceful way less identified with it

197
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:15,599
I think that this intensive identification where we have a sense that I am the fear I am the story I am

198
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,820
the experience tends to make our lives kind of claustrophobic kind of narrow and tight

199
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:25,920
and sort of step back wide enough so that we don't feel like we are these

200
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:31,320
different things and um and uh it can be a really helpful

201
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:38,339
sometimes in meditation of course it's possible to do that then be disassociated to kind of be aversive

202
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:45,980
and and be so far removed from experience that you might feel a little bit kind of calm but it's a really uh

203
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:51,300
disconnecting with the experience it's not a crime to do that it's okay it

204
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:56,820
might be have its function as well but the idea is to find the place of

205
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:03,240
being clearly aware of what's happening in the present moment and being able to do so with some degree of equanimity

206
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:08,760
some degree of non-reactivity and one of the tools for this is to get

207
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:15,540
the bird's eye view to get a different perspective and and how far back how how far away

208
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:21,180
you need that varies from situation to situation sometimes you need a lot of distance

209
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:27,240
like up in the mountain and in doing so you're enacting a little

210
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:33,960
bit what the meaning of Equanimity is the poly word for Equanimity is upeka

211
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:39,300
and it means something like having a higher view an overview looking from

212
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:45,180
above and the Buddha actually used that metaphor sometimes of standing on a hill

213
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:51,119
looking back down at the Town bustle of the town and from the hillside we're not

214
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:57,200
in the hustle and bustle we were peaceful and nice

215
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:04,380
so so to cultivate Equanimity and non-entanglement non-reactivity

216
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:10,079
and so one of the ways to do that is to imagine your stepping away stepping back getting a

217
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:17,640
distance so you might try this today in your life you might uh it could be some simple

218
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:24,359
things like if you're in a room with people and if it's you know the polite and it's not impolite to do so or

219
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:30,480
awkward to do so you might see it further away from people than you normally would and see what it's like to

220
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:37,760
have that kind of more distant view as opposed to being right in the middle of it you might

221
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:44,099
you know if you're in even one-on-one with someone uh you know without them thinking you're

222
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:50,400
pulling away you might physically kind of sit a little bit differently so you're a little more distance and see if

223
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:56,820
that distance creates more non-reactivity in space you might um you know if you're really

224
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:02,160
caught up in some preoccupation maybe go out into an open field or a wide park or

225
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:07,260
something where you get help with the imagine with the awareness expanding and

226
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:13,079
becoming much more Broad and open so it's easier to feel that there's more

227
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:19,079
space and distance from the entanglement the caught upness with what's going on

228
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:24,420
to find ways of changing the perspective and for today the perspective of having

229
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:30,480
kind of a bird's eye view that large view of the situation

230
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:37,020
and uh see what that would how that helps you and also see how it begins helping you

231
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:43,380
understand that you have a choice of the perspective that you use in being

232
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:49,380
mindful some people never occur to them they have a choice they're mindful but they're just mindful in the same way

233
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:57,839
every time and maybe that same way is not the best medicine for some situations we're in

234
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:04,020
so thank you very much and um may your

235
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:11,299
capacity for awareness bring you much delight
