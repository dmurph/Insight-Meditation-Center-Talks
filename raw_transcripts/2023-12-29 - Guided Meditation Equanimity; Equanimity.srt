1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,040
good day everyone it's wonderful to see all your greetings on

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:12,960
chat so our week of Brahma vihara practices is coming to its completion

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,840
today with the fourth and very indispensable Divine Abode

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:28,160
equinity equinity is an unshakable balance of mind and it

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,840
develops through these other Brahma viharas and also from insight and from

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,000
mindfulness practice looking at the world around us

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,719
and how life goes we really get to see how difficult it is to attain and

8
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:54,760
maintain balance of mind we can see life has its ups and

9
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:02,000
downs and swings between extremes sometimes pleasure and and pain success

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,720
and failure loss and gain praise and

11
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,920
blame we are naturally affected

12
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,479
emotionally we respond with happiness and sorrow Delight despair

13
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:28,960
disappointment satisfaction hope fear we find ourselves experiencing

14
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,320
waves of emotion taking us on the these ups

15
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,880
and downs and no sooner do we think we've come to more

16
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:48,399
stability then you know we're going along just fine and then we find ourselves caught again so equinity is

17
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,040
the wholesome state of mind that will help to stabilize Us in the face of all

18
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:00,920
of these experiences this this balance of mind

19
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:07,520
can help us be with any difficulty that comes our way and give us the resolve to

20
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,160
keep coming back to mindfulness again and again rather than being pushed

21
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:20,640
around and pulled around by The Human Condition Equanimity can nourish an

22
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:30,480
inner strength that offers strength to others in the face of all of the events that

23
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,120
give rise to each of our dissatisfaction stress and suffering both in our lives

24
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:45,519
individually and also as a planet and equinity can help us live

25
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:52,599
valiantly despite the inevitability of loss

26
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:58,760
sickness aging and death so this

27
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:05,680
morning I'll offer an Equanimity

28
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,840
practice uh if that fits for you today if it doesn't fit for you feel free to

29
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,959
let my voice Fade Into the background and continue with whatever practice is

30
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:23,360
most helpful to you for those who'd like to practice

31
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,040
Equanimity you can offer it to yourself if you're going through times that have

32
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,840
you up and down or you're experiencing some

33
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:41,959
difficulty or you can offer it to another person you know that you know is having a hard time

34
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:48,760
coping with difficulties um and this doesn't have to be the most difficult person in your

35
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,840
life it's better if it's not you can pick someone whose

36
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,040
difficulties um aren't affecting you in such a way that it would create

37
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:08,599
emotional reactivity in you so as we begin the

38
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:19,479
meditation receiving and recognizing how you are in this

39
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:36,520
moment perhaps scanning the body head to toe and allowing the in

40
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:43,159
breath to bring calm energy to each area of the

41
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:50,840
body and the out breath to release any stress or

42
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,800
tension taking deeper breaths if that that's

43
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
helpful gently aware of any area that cannot be

44
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,479
softened being present with it just as it is

45
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:16,840
and then when you're ready bringing to mind your own difficulty that has you

46
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:23,039
off balance or someone else in your life

47
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,400
whose difficulties are leaving them in a

48
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
struggle

49
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:46,680
it could be that the person you're offering the meditation to is challenging for you because you're

50
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:54,479
close sometimes we know someone's struggle very well but if we offer help they may seem

51
00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:01,400
to rebuff that help

52
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:14,199
or this could be someone a family member friend you see during the holidays whose

53
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:21,479
political opinions vary greatly from yours and with whom a calm

54
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:25,000
discussion seems

55
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,400
impossible perhaps this is someone whose response

56
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,319
to challenges in their life is so very different from

57
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:46,759
yours that you have a hard time understanding

58
00:07:50,840 --> 00:08:00,639
them whether it's you or someone else allowing yourself time to

59
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:07,199
remember this person's fundamental good

60
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:14,599
intentions seeing that they are doing their best to make their life work

61
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:22,280
well and Al also witnessing the ways that they are

62
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
struggling

63
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:54,360
and I'll offer some phrases that you might simply take in

64
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:00,399
allow yourself to hear them and see which ones fit for you

65
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:06,959
and if you find some that do fit for you you can silently whisper them in your

66
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:15,320
mind feel them in your heart whatever works best for

67
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:28,120
you I care for you but I cannot control your happiness or

68
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
unhappiness

69
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,000
things are just as they are right

70
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
now

71
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:10,880
whether I understand it or not things are

72
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:17,120
unfolding according to the way they naturally

73
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,279
unfold or according to the laws of

74
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
nature

75
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:52,519
remembering that inclining the mind in this way is not a demand for the other

76
00:10:52,519 --> 00:11:01,040
person to change nor an expectation nor an agenda

77
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,760
and with equinity phrases you can be inclining the phrases

78
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:16,680
towards the person or towards your difficulty with

79
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:23,279
their being off balance or to

80
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:34,200
both joy and sorrow arise and pass

81
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:40,240
away this is a natural part of life's

82
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:57,959
journey no matter how I might wish things to be otherwise things are as they

83
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
are

84
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:25,160
I wish you happiness but cannot make your choices for

85
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
you

86
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:38,120
it is what it is right

87
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:56,760
now repeating these phrases or others that work well for

88
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
you

89
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:10,620
I care for you but I cannot control your happiness or [Music]

90
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,199
unhappiness things are just as they are right

91
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:34,120
now whether I understand it or not things

92
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,600
are unfolding according to the laws of

93
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:57,759
nature no matter how I might wish things to be otherwise things are as they

94
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
are

95
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
e

96
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
that

97
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:05,479
[Music]

98
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:31,159
so as Goodwill and en counters strong emotions in ourselves and

99
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:39,919
others it may become compassion when it sees suffering sympathetic Joy when it sees

100
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:49,159
happiness and equinity helps balance any suffering by including warmth and

101
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:54,840
care really important to know that Equanimity is not

102
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:01,159
indifferent or apathetic in the face of emotions or in the face of

103
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:06,200
suffering when we meet all experience with

104
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:11,880
mindfulness uh we can develop a perspective or an overview that knows

105
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:17,080
the strong emotions without being caught up in the in the stories around them and

106
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:25,559
in the things that get us caught we can cultivate this Jewel of

107
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:33,279
equinity which is an even- minded caring for anyone who is struggling an even-

108
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:38,639
minded happiness for anyone who's experiencing Good

109
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:46,440
Fortune it it doesn't look down on emotions or struggles as if

110
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:53,679
unaffected same way as I mentioned with compassion practice the proper practice of the

111
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:59,840
Brahma viharas includes this knowledge that if we had exactly the same set of

112
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:05,840
conditions as the person to whom we're sending our wishes we too would be

113
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:14,399
having the same experience as they um so we radiate or offer wishes of

114
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:19,600
goodwi compassion sympathetic Joy or

115
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:25,360
equinity uh from that standpoint of knowing that this too could be something

116
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,720
we could be going through when equinity is

117
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:36,960
available we can see events with understanding and we can

118
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,919
investigate the kinds of emotional events that lead to reactivity we can see

119
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:50,000
it of course this takes time and plenty of practice seeing mindfully seeing

120
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,600
clearly again and again to begin to understand the way that

121
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:01,559
clinging resists istance and delusion distort the mind in the presence of

122
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:07,279
anger fear sorrow and the whole gamut of human

123
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:15,120
emotions so to see the way we get caught in emotions it takes time to see

124
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:24,000
UNH wholesome behavior and wholesome Behavior as a separate matter from the

125
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:32,440
person or yourself equinity balances Goodwill that wishes

126
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:39,480
for everyone uh to come to the end of suffering it balances that with the

127
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:45,840
realization that we don't have control over how others behave over the

128
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:53,279
timetable for coming to the end of suffering the eonity balances that and

129
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:59,120
hand inand with compassion it can help us decide when to take

130
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,720
action so we can cultivate an ability to be open and present with anything that's

131
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:11,599
happening and discern when something is harmful and it's time to step in and

132
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:17,679
take action to stop it sometimes when people hear the word

133
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:23,878
equinity they believe they have to be devoid of emotion but those of us living the

134
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:30,760
householder so-called householder life can feel emotion and without dropping

135
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:37,000
down into being mired with them or stuck in them the heart and the mind can be

136
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:45,560
moved can care a great deal and still ret retain this level of objectivity and

137
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:52,839
balance that's offered with equinity with mindfulness and with uh

138
00:34:52,839 --> 00:35:00,640
plenty of practice of the Brahma viharas or with a lot of mindfulness practice The Head and the Heart come

139
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:08,359
together and the wishes that we send or inclin towards well-being towards safety

140
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:14,400
happiness freedom freedom from suffering and the continued happiness of

141
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:22,119
others these These Things become heartfelt instead of just words and we're better able to access

142
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:29,760
equinity as well as the heartfelt quality of all of this so as we see the benefit of these

143
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:37,040
wholesome inclinations of mind the heart gradually opens it takes time for the heart to

144
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:43,640
know it in the process it grows the capacity to be with suffering in a

145
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:51,319
caring way instead of avoiding it or pitying it or keeping it at arms

146
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:57,520
length and this balance of mind this equinity makes a really important

147
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:03,520
contribution we learn not to suffer about suffering when there's

148
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:09,800
Equanimity the presence of it does not mean by the way that we agree with or

149
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:16,640
are passive about harm that's happening in the world it means we see that harm

150
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:22,960
is happening we know that causes and conditions have led to suffering and we

151
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,720
have enough confidence in the practice of mindfulness to face things as they

152
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:35,440
have come to be the poly word UPA is the word that's

153
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:43,200
translated as equinity and as one of the Brahma viharas it actually acts as a check or a

154
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,720
balance on the other three um you know it's functioning well when it stays

155
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:57,640
connected to meta or Goodwill to karuna or compassion and to mudita sympathetic

156
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:02,800
Joy instead of being indifferent um indifference is called

157
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,760
the near enemy of equinity because it could seem like it but it's not the same

158
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:16,040
at all um it prevents actually goodwi or meta from fear from veering into its

159
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:22,760
near enemy which is attachment and it prevents compassion

160
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,839
from lapsing into its near enemy which is

161
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:35,599
pity equinity prevents additional suffering from arising when we see suffering when we

162
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:43,040
feel it and see what's going on it balances happiness that Wells up in the

163
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,240
presence of other people's happiness and it prevents the near enemy of Joy which

164
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:54,880
is becoming overly excited which is kind of getting hooked

165
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,640
into other people's happiness or your own happiness to a degree that's not no

166
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:06,880
longer balanced equinity remains caring through

167
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,720
the development of the other Brahma viharas instead of hardening into

168
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,839
indifference the mind and the Heart know enough about how causes and conditions

169
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:25,480
result in painful experience and equinity can maintain a

170
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:33,520
neutrality an emotional balance with a gentle heart and a wise mind that

171
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:38,880
develop as we practice mindfulness and as we practice the

172
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:46,400
Brahma viharas no matter how much we cultivate

173
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:52,960
Limitless loving kindness and Goodwill there will be people there will be those

174
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:58,560
whose actions are harmful and those who cannot change will

175
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,920
not change as I mentioned in the meditation when we offer these

176
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:11,079
wishes these are not agendas for other people to change they're not magical thinking that because I wish it someone

177
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:16,760
else is going to change we can see clearly what the

178
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:22,599
options are what the um prospects are or the potential and we can even work

179
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:28,400
towards change but we are still balanced and even mind minded with

180
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:35,000
equinity it this is a quality that clearly sees comma and comma or

181
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:41,200
karma in this case means only that actions lead to

182
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:48,640
consequences that causes and conditions unfold in certain ways so no matter how

183
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:55,480
desperately we might wish for things not to be the way they are the mature heart

184
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:03,440
and mind that have matured by witnessing the way things come to be again and again witnessing consequences actions

185
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:10,880
and consequences the mature heart and mind come to some ability to see the

186
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:19,040
reality the truth of things in a balanced way by seeing with

187
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:25,359
awareness the arising and passing of myriad human

188
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:32,160
experiences we come to know that our conditioned life is marked by the three

189
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:41,200
characteristics of conditioned existence inconstancy um which is sometimes called

190
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:48,240
impermanence um the unsatisfactoriness of things that we cannot rely on them

191
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,640
partly because they change and they're impermanent and then that of what's

192
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:59,599
sometimes called no self which means that said neither we nor anyone else nor

193
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:05,119
anything has a fixed character that's always going to be the

194
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:12,119
same there are different facets of knowing that things change whether in the short term or the

195
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:18,800
long term so equinity allows us to be effective with what we cannot

196
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:26,920
change for example if someone close to you is dying of a terminal illness being

197
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:35,200
upset protesting none of that is going to help them or you but you can let equinity

198
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:43,280
this balance of Mind help you relinquish or give up your desire that it not be

199
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:49,920
true give up the fighting against it give up the wish this can't be happening

200
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:56,599
and instead focus on where you can be of support so this is the ultimate in in

201
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:03,520
responsiveness instead of reactivity I'd like to end with a

202
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:09,960
reading um by Khalil Jabron that's kind of interesting with

203
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:16,079
respect to this week then said a rich man speak to us of

204
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:21,920
giving and he answered you give but little when you give of your possessions

205
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:28,359
it is when you give of yourself that you truly give for what are your possessions but

206
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:34,760
things you keep and guard for fear you may need them tomorrow and tomorrow what

207
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:41,119
shall tomorrow bring to the over prudent dog burying bones in the trackless sand

208
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:48,160
as he follows the pilgrims to the holy city and what is fear of need but need

209
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:55,160
itself is not dread of thirst when your well is full thirst that is

210
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:01,040
unquenchable there are those who give little of the much which they have and

211
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:06,160
they give it for recognition and their hidden desire makes their gifts UNH

212
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:11,280
wholesome and there are those who have little and give it

213
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:17,280
all these are the Believers in life and the Bounty of life and their Coffer is

214
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:24,920
never empty there are those who give with joy and that Joy is their reward and there

215
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:32,079
are those who give with pain pain and that pain is their baptism and there are those who give and

216
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:40,480
know not pain in giving nor do they seek Joy nor give with mindfulness of virtue

217
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:46,920
they give as in Yonder Valley the Myrtle breathes its fragrance into

218
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:52,960
space through the hands of such as these God speaks and from behind their eyes he

219
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:59,440
smiles upon the Earth It is Well to give when asked but it is better to give when

220
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:06,520
unasked though understanding excuse me through understanding and to the open-handed the

221
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:13,480
search for one who shall receive is Joy greater than giving and is there ought

222
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:18,559
you would withhold all you have shall someday be

223
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:24,720
given therefore give now that the season of giving may be yours and not your

224
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:30,800
inheritors you often say I would give but only to the deserving The Orchards

225
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:37,559
in the trees in your Orchards say not so nor the flocks in your pasture they

226
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:44,440
give that they may live for to withhold is to perish surely he who is worthy to

227
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:50,599
receive his days and nights is worthy of all else from you and he who has

228
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:57,000
deserved to drink from the ocean of Life deserves to fill his cup from your little stream

229
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:03,280
and what desert greater shall there be than that which lies in the courage and

230
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:10,920
confidence nay the charity of receiving and who are you that

231
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:17,079
men should Rend their bosom and unveil their pride that you may see their worth

232
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:22,280
naked and their pride unabashed see first that you yourself

233
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:27,839
deserve to be a giver the instrument of giving for in truth it is life that

234
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:34,800
gives unto life while you who deem yourself a giver are but a witness and

235
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:41,000
you receivers and you are all receivers assume no weight of gratitude lest you

236
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:48,079
lay a yoke upon yourself and upon whom who gives rather rise together with the

237
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:55,200
giver on his gifts as on wings for to be over mindful of your debt is to doubt

238
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:01,520
his generosity who has the freeheart Earth for mother and God for

239
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:08,240
father so I love this encouragement to give which is at the basis of our

240
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:14,720
sending wishes to others for Good Will and to ourselves for Good Will

241
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:21,400
compassion sympathetic joy and equinity wishing you all uh the benefits

242
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:28,440
of the Brahma viharas hope to see any of you who would like to come to happy hour on week Nights from 6:00 to 7: to

243
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:34,599

244
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:44,119
