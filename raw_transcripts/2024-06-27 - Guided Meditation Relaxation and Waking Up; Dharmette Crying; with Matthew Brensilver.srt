1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:12,920
hi folks welcome um yeah good to uh good to be with you

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,760
uh um I guess we we meditate so

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:31,920
um yeah let's uh find find a a posture that um balances relaxation alert

4
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:41,600
if you're tired a on the alert side if you're ramped up air on the relaxed

5
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:50,360
side and uh yeah just gently find your way into

6
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:56,000
uh Dharma posture your body but also

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,960
your Dharma heart e

8
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:04,920
so just uh see see if there's something especially uh entangling leftover

9
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,080
from the day or the the

10
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,120
week year

11
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,640
just appreciate what that is maybe you even give it a moment to think

12
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,760
through so long as you don't get more deeply entangled

13
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,120
maybe it feels important

14
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:15,159
to just [Music] feel the presence of whatever is left

15
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:23,760
over as the fingerprint it leaves in your emotional body

16
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,720
just give your blessing to those that

17
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,439
affective arousal give your blessing to

18
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,760
it e

19
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:47,840
we give our blessing to everything so we can put it all

20
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,680
down e

21
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:49,960
and maybe you really notice the uh the end of few exhalations

22
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:30,639
maybe you listen out for the most faint distant sound

23
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,520
in your

24
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,759
soundscape maybe you don't even know if you're hearing a sound or

25
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,560
silence e

26
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:08,879
sweet we look to see what what's a skillful way of attending

27
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,560
to uh vitalize the

28
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:20,759
Mind tranquilize our

29
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
body

30
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
e

31
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
e

32
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
e

33
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,279
e for

34
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,519
greed is

35
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,079
tension hatred aversion is

36
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:25,240
tension self is tension Duality is tension

37
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,240
any holding on at all

38
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,560
tension and so we

39
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,200
relax for

40
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:00,800
you can't exactly relax through more

41
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,120
willfulness we relax the way we

42
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
exhale

43
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

44
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,000
e e

45
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,800
there a certain measure of uh Faith required

46
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:53,920
to relinquish uh control

47
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:17,600
to stop trying to engineer to stop trying

48
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,639
to Solve the Riddle of our life of this

49
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,639
moment

50
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:40,000
instead to [Music] be softened by the moment

51
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:12,199
don't look for any foothold in some sort

52
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
of

53
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

54
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

55
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

56
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

57
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

58
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,640
e e

59
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,519
just breathing into

60
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:39,159
the space called me mine

61
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
relaxing

62
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

63
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

64
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,480
e e

65
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:29,159
when we command ourselves to to relax it's just

66
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:33,000
a kind of reiteration of the

67
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,600
clinging the way we fall asleep is a kind

68
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,480
of relinquishment of the

69
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:59,600
willfulness maybe it's kind of the same for

70
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,120
falling

71
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
awake

72
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

73
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,278
e e

74
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:30,158
your ground is just openness

75
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
e

76
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,080

77
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,080

82

that okay so

83
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:06,039
um yeah a few few weeks ago I was um I

84
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:14,080
was leading a a sitting group out of town and a dear dear friend you know

85
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:22,480
colleague happened to be in the same place at the same time and uh she came to the the class

86
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:29,760
and um afterwards we were you know we were talking about you know just saying hi

87
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:36,760
and talking and you know and I said um I said something like uh yeah you know

88
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:45,919
during the meditation instructions I actually teared up a little bit and she was just like Matthew you

89
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:54,279
always cry and then and then on uh Sunday I was

90
00:31:54,279 --> 00:32:02,919
finishing an online Retreat you know teaching crying I was like oh my

91
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:08,760
God I'm a crier I cry cry when I teach

92
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:14,159
what what is the deal you know and

93
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:22,440
um so I thought to give a talk about uh crying the the kind of different

94
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:28,000
uh species of of Tears Dharma tears and

95
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,480
and uh I I've interrogated it myself I've wondered you know like what what

96
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:41,880
are these I didn't cry today not yet stay strong I you know what what are these

97
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:47,799
tear about like is it's are they appropriate you know like are and I've

98
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:52,919
asked the question like okay are they are they a kind of over

99
00:32:52,919 --> 00:33:01,080
disclosure are my tears are kind of Burden in in any way for others or the

100
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:08,960
kind of messiness that others must contend with uh are my tears somehow

101
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:15,919
manipulative you know a kind of unconscious attempt to manipulate your

102
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:21,720
emotions to do something to your

103
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:28,440
emotional world am I displacing you know something

104
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:35,000
from my own private suffering and somehow the emotion in the teacher seat

105
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:42,840
is kind of a kind of placeholder for other feelings that are kind of alien to

106
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:49,960
me in some way and obviously I can't I can't uh I

107
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:58,000
can't be sure you know but I I don't think it's any of that actually

108
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,880
uh Becket said um my my words are my

109
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:11,118
tears and I I've read some some research on uh on crying the kind of the

110
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:20,118
functions and the the triggers of of tears that varies a lot varies a lot and

111
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:26,200
um and they're generally like crying generally associated with

112
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:33,720
unpleasant cataly but joy triggers tears too as we know and tears have int

113
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:41,240
psychic and also interpersonal effects right many um so on the intas

114
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:47,398
psychic side many people report like some kind of

115
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:54,878
cathartic relief from crying the tears are somehow like um a kind of resolution

116
00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:02,960
of emotional dis equilibrium and we we there's some

117
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:09,599
buildup of something some activation arousal State we we're tense then we the

118
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:18,240
the process of crying is deescalate that arousal I um I almost

119
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:25,839
never you know cried as a you know one you obviously as a child but

120
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:34,320
like once I got a little bit older I didn't didn't um cry as an adolescent or young adult

121
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:40,320
or anything and I still never cry anything about anything kind of like

122
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:48,520
narrowly in my life generally um infants Cry of course like the the

123
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:55,680
interpersonal needs are so obvious there kind of signal and the tears announce a

124
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:01,640
need and as adult s there may be interpersonal functions

125
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:09,920
of Tears too right um we we people cry for many reasons but

126
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,079
but apparently one of the main reasons that that people cry as a sense of

127
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:20,720
helplessness the the researcher said like the inability to act

128
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:27,839
behaviorally may be a common element of a whole range of different tiers

129
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:37,839
and we can see that sometimes sometimes our tears are a kind of a kind of plea you know like I can't

130
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:45,200
do this I need you and maybe sometimes our tears are

131
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:51,359
just soothing some they are kind of like soothing our sense

132
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:58,200
of uh soothing Us in the kind of face of powerlessness

133
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:04,720
I barely cried you know but then I started practicing

134
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,920
Dharma you know and uh especially when I

135
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:16,520
would do heart practice meta compassion you know it was like a lot of

136
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:22,000
Tears a lot of tears I heard some teacher say I don't

137
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,599
know who I don't remember but um practice doesn't truly begin until you cry deep playe you

138
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:38,200
know and there were um there were a lot of a lot of threads kind of bound up in

139
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:43,520
those those early tears early tears of of some years

140
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:49,400
really and uh in looking back I feel like oh yeah it was some way in which I

141
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:56,720
was I was sort of like grieving the suffering of my past you know feeling

142
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:02,400
the suffering of anger of the aversion that had really defined my life just

143
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:08,319
feeling that I I was grieving the first Noble Truth in a way it's like the the

144
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:15,440
enormity of suffering the ungovernable quality of it and it's like oh yeah how

145
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:21,760
long might it take to truly comprehend dukka you

146
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,200
know long time a lot of grieving

147
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:35,920
I was I was also crying in um in joy you know it's like it was the the tears of

148
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:43,599
relief like I kind of like cannot believe how beautiful the path is and

149
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:49,440
just overwhelmed overwhelmed a certain kind of

150
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:56,319
gratitude aen aino one one time at a retreat

151
00:38:56,319 --> 00:39:04,800
off-handed they just kind of said like as our path unfolds there's more laughter and more

152
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:12,640
tearfulness kind of weepiness teaching of course is not a um

153
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:19,000
is not a performance you know not a

154
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,079
performance we enter the Dharma together as

155
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:33,520
um we enter together as Children of the Buddha you know and

156
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:38,920
um yeah I've become in teaching practicing

157
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:45,599
too uh but I become like very sensitive to when my words feel like they're sort

158
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:52,800
of bubbling up from my body and when they don't when they feel very near very

159
00:39:52,800 --> 00:40:00,040
near every word I speak is like my body is right with

160
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:06,640
it and even though I prepare a lot and have a kind of careful

161
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,880
skeletal structure of a of of uh most

162
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:21,839
talks I I try never to abandon my body I try never to to leave space between my

163
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:29,440
words and my body and in a sense to stay way to stay

164
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,560
with my body that feels like uh a way of

165
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:42,200
not leaving you either the tears um they sort of come at

166
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:48,760
un unpredictable time sometimes they they're

167
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:54,920
um you know kind some kind of grief you know how how does one understand

168
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:00,960
anicha the the UNG graspability the changing of all

169
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:07,520
things how do you understand that and not cry how how can you know anything about

170
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:15,200
the world about war or oppression or wealth inequality or climate or you know

171
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:21,680
how do you know any of that not cry sometimes and sometimes the tears are

172
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:27,440
kind of like um public you know public grieving and I I

173
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:34,800
sort of feel like sometimes for a person of my social location privilege sometimes

174
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:41,200
tears are just more powerful than than uh words and

175
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:49,880
expressing sense of solidarity and um but most often most

176
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:57,720
often the tears come when this I sense a distinction this very Stark distinction

177
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:06,319
the Buddhist fundamental distinction between uh suffering and

178
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:14,680
peace the the kind of it's It's almost like um one cloth being held up against

179
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:22,040
another different shades and the poignancy of that

180
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:29,040
difference between suffering and goodness suffering and

181
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:35,839
peace and there's um a phenomena in in Psychology known as moral elevation

182
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:40,880
where it's like you witness uh an act of moral beauty or something and it

183
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,160
inspires it elevates our own Hearts you know you see somebody do

184
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:53,599
something really beautiful it's like how can we not be sort of lifted up by

185
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:59,760
that and the sense I have have is almost like

186
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:05,280
um I don't even need to see a hero just the actual

187
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:11,880
perception of goodness even in a vague way just the perception of goodness in

188
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:19,599
any moment is the experience of moral elevation it want and sort of like I

189
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:27,680
just want to be better you know and um

190
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:35,119
and maybe we can say that um the the kind of the whole of the Dharma

191
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:43,839
is is about becoming sensitive to to goodness you know uh attuning attuning

192
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:52,520
to it in any moment taking our cues from it sensing that in our body being lifted up

193
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:57,839
by it the goodness of letting go of on hate

194
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:03,920
of not trespassing on the heart of

195
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:10,318
others the clear wide

196
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:17,359
openness meta loving kindness is is being moved by your own goodness you

197
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:24,680
know the love the love for others just follows effortlessly from

198
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:35,960
that and so tear yeah a lot of Tears a lot of reasons to uh to be moved right

199
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:45,000
and uh tears are not the last word I 1977 interview with James Baldwin

200
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,960
in the New York Times and um said um said uh

201
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:58,839
people uh people can cry much easier than they can change a rule of

202
00:44:58,839 --> 00:45:04,440
psychology people like me picked up as kids on the street you

203
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:12,160
know okay I take that to heart too and

204
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:19,640
uh yeah so we we cry and our tears direct us back to our body embodied

205
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:27,520
sense of feeling sense of the Dharma here and then we take our cues

206
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:34,359
from that live well so I offer that for your

207
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:40,559
consideration and uh I wish you a good week we'll

208
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:45,440
