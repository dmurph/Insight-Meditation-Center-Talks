1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,560
so welcome and uh I am

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,000
uh sitting here up in the hills above Lake Tahoe in California

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,039
where I've been on a vacation for

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,039
um almost a week going back hiking in the hills here in the mountains at

5
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:29,599
fairly high elevation and um this is our last morning here and

6
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:37,920
uh driving back to the to home in Redwood City and we'll be um

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:46,399
we'll be broadcasting from IMC tomorrow again so um

8
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:53,920
welcome so this is different than how it usually is

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,719
that and so it kind of speaks to the theme I'm still focusing on which is change

10
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:08,479
and in constancy impermanence and so surprisingly there's a new place

11
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:15,360
new situation and um and

12
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,439
the central focus that Buddhism has on ana the poly word that's usually

13
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:28,000
translated as impermanence that more literally means inconstancy

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,960
and uh is in the family of words like change buddha has this these three

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,640
expressions he uses together in constancy

16
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,399
change becoming different and um

17
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:56,000
and change has uh three important characteristics

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,960
and as we become wiser about impermanence change things becoming different in

19
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,840
constancy it's useful to keep in mind these three aspects

20
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,800
uh one is that um uh change means that something that was

21
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:25,040
will no longer be another thing it means is uh things that

22
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:35,519
uh were not happening are now happening so change can be welcome and unwelcome

23
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:41,200
something that is uh unfortunate can come to an end and we celebrate perhaps

24
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:50,400
or it's a relief things that are fortunate and wonderful come to an end and we're sad

25
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:58,080
the ending of one thing means the beginning of something else and the beginning can be unfortunate the

26
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,239
beginning of something that's fortunate and wonderful can happen and

27
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:11,519
and sometimes there's what's in between that things don't change fast enough or

28
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:18,480
they change uh too slow but they stay constant for a while

29
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,360
they are that way for a while and so all these ways impermanence is not just a

30
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,840
depressing word it's also makes possible the all the important changes that uh

31
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,959
happen in your life that are useful and important and wonderful

32
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:44,480
and um not having change sometimes is the unfortunate thing that we need

33
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,920
change in order to grow a child grows with change we grow with

34
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:57,200
change and so it makes it makes a world of difference in Buddhist practice

35
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:05,360
whether we situate ourselves in the middle of the change in middle of the

36
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:12,640
changing world and even though our thoughts and ideas can emphasize that

37
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,958
things aren't changing or some aspects don't change

38
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:26,320
um there's always change here in the present moment and it's possible in being attuned to

39
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,840
change to find a degree of freedom

40
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,919
a freedom where we don't hold on to anything we don't resist anything

41
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,120
a freedom where we surf or float

42
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,440
with the changes not but not randomly

43
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,280
uh it's not chaos there's a gentle way

44
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:02,560
appropriate way that we steer the boat the the raft that goes down the river

45
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,479
the river carries a down river but we keep it in the current

46
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,800
we can influence the change that happens we create the conditions for it to be

47
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,720
different so we meditate

48
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,919
and in meditation we learn to situate ourselves in the

49
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:33,759
change and to understand where the rudder is

50
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,919
that keeps us going in a good direction keeps us flowing

51
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:47,840
keeps us in the current rather than leaving the river

52
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:55,639
to be in the land of thoughts and ideas memories and futures

53
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,600
to stay in the river and not get caught in the eddies or the sandbanks

54
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:11,680
here now and one of those places to find the current is in the breathing

55
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,199
to breathe to breathe

56
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,800
that we be with changing flowing sensations of breathing

57
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,080
so to assume a meditation posture

58
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,440
and to gently close your eyes

59
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:48,560
and with your physical body as an antenna

60
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:55,680
as a sense apparatus sense and feel

61
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,280
the body's experience of breathing

62
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,080
and as you breathe

63
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:28,919
feel the sensations of change in your torso the movements of your rib cage

64
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,039
the movements of the belly

65
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
the movements of the diaphragm

66
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:15,039
and then in a gentle way that's just right for you

67
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:21,240
taking some fuller inhales

68
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:30,360
just a little fuller and a more extended exhale

69
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:38,320
so that you begin entering into the full physical experience of

70
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:47,880
breathing as if your whole body is participating

71
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,320
breathing in and breathing out

72
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:07,120
remember the extended exhale

73
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,640
to relax in your body

74
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,000
to soften

75
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,440
and letting your breathing return to normal

76
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:28,680
not so much following the breath or watching the breath

77
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:36,199
but allowing your awareness your sensing your

78
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,240
sensations

79
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,519
to participate participate

80
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,880
in the changing shifting

81
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:03,160
rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

82
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:44,519
as you exhale relaxing the thinking mind

83
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,720
softening the thinking mind

84
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:35,360
quieting your thinking and if you like in the quiet thinking

85
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,519
think the kind of thoughts that keeps you

86
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:48,079
participating in the changing shifting rhythm of

87
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,440
breathing in and breathing out

88
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,680
very quiet soft thoughts about breathing

89
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,920
that supports a quieting a stilling

90
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,120
entering into

91
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:39,120
The everchanging sensations of breathing

92
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,160
one breath at a time

93
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,720
and your contribution

94
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,639
is to notice how thinking takes you out of

95
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,079
the flow of breathing

96
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:52,759
the flow of attention participating with breathing

97
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,360
place yourself in the rhythm of breathing

98
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:19,678
so that the mind doesn't get fixated on any idea thought judgment

99
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:26,720
feeling everything's allowed to

100
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,839
move and pass through

101
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,679
with awareness attention

102
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,960
staying in the river of change

103
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,320
as if mindfulness awareness

104
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,000
as a rudder

105
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,360
that you gently move in the river of change

106
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:44,360
to stay in the flow the flow of breathing in and out

107
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,159
so awareness itself doesn't get fixated anywhere

108
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:05,200
it flows along like a boat flowing on the surface of a

109
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,200
river

110
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:22,320
there is an art for you to have awareness awareness

111
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:30,159
mindfulness participate with breathing

112
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:38,200
gently flowing along with the breathing

113
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:46,799
awareness massage by the breathing so awareness stays soft and gentle

114
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:55,120
relaxed and so the awareness of breathing

115
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,679
allows the breathing to settle and quiet

116
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:11,400
there can be a very satisfying and healthy way of breathing

117
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:19,760
that comes with this careful caring attention

118
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,159
to breathing

119
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,360
what keeps us alive

120
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:39,840
allows us allows us to live with caring attention for what keeps us

121
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,840
alive

122
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,840
as we come to the end of this meditation

123
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,039
just as caring for our breathing

124
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,519
can allow breathing to care for us

125
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:12,360
so we care for the wider world so it cares for us

126
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:21,840
and is sitting here in the forests of

127
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,320
Northern California

128
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,600
in the midst of this natural world

129
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,559
for which our human lives depend without which there would be know human

130
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:45,799
life and may it be that

131
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,840
we use our awareness our attention

132
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:57,960
our compassion and kindness to care

133
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,679
for what cares for us

134
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:11,799
as we end this meditation may it be

135
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:19,360
that our ability to be have a heightened attention to the present

136
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:27,679
supports us to care for the natural world

137
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:35,480
that we live in and the natural world that we are within us

138
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:42,200
may all of life be supported

139
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:50,360
to move through its natural cycles freely

140
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:58,600
and caringly may all beings

141
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:06,840
be happy may all beings be safe

142
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,799
may all beings be peaceful

143
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:19,120
may all beings be free

144
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:26,000
and I don't have a bell today to ring so I I end this meditation now with bowing

145
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,640
to all of you thank you

146
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:17,520
so hello everyone and welcome to this continuing series on

147
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,960
insight And uh today is uh the end of my

148
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:29,679
vacation up in like on the hills of Lake Tahoe

149
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:35,919
and uh I'm glad to have you along

150
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:43,279
uh so in this series on insight

151
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:49,200
uh I've been doing a while now and many talks on the first insight usually in

152
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,320
English called impermanence more literally meaning inconstancy

153
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:03,360
and um this emphasis on insight can sometimes lead people to believe that

154
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:12,000
mindfulness or insight meditation is meant to be a form of um uh thinking

155
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:19,519
thinking about things but in fact the deeper insight that uh is being

156
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:26,559
developed in insight meditation certainly has a cognitive side to it but

157
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:32,000
it involves a deep um samadei

158
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,720
a deep subtleness and peacefulness and quiet and focus of the mind

159
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:44,240
we have um in um and so I'd like to talk a little bit

160
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:49,679
more about this insight into uh impermanence

161
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:55,919
before we move into the second insight which is the insight into duka

162
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:04,799
so um uh the deeper insight into change into

163
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:12,640
impermanence uh arises when the insight practice

164
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:18,480
um uh becomes uh co-joined

165
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:25,760
with samadei so the first part of the year the emphasis the series was on samadei

166
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:33,120
and I hope those of you who came along with it that you had some feeling for the possibility of a deep quiet focused

167
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:40,000
silent mind that's a state a state of being of being collected unified in a

168
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:47,039
quiet peaceful way and they and um this kind of that sense

169
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:52,559
of samadei this state of unification of settlement of peace

170
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:59,440
um uh usually get uh gets unified around something like around the breathing

171
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:05,919
around loving kindness around something that allows everything to settle

172
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:14,158
and um one of the things that can we can get unified around is unified around the

173
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:20,878
experience of change especially if that experience of change uh initially is a

174
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:28,158
very simple one and that is the function of breathing um and to enter into the

175
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:34,480
current of changing flowing moving sensations the with time the minute

176
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:40,320
sensations that come into play with one inhale one exhale is a ripple of

177
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:46,320
sensations that are coming and going and of course we don't have to look for the ripple i want to look for the subtle

178
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:55,599
sensations but as we are staying more mindful of the changing nature of breathing uh

179
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:00,880
staying in the present moment with that this allows the mind to get unified

180
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:08,240
around breathing for deep jic work the in the samadei

181
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:14,720
gets organized or or around something that's more stable the the the changing

182
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,079
nature of what's happening is less important than the stilling of the mind

183
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:26,960
for insight practice the stilling of the mind together with the changing nature

184
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:34,400
of the object of attention in this case the breathing um uh come together in harmony they come

185
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,680
together and work together and so insight begins to the deep

186
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:47,200
insight uh of insight meditation begins to be come into the forefront when the

187
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:55,040
mind gets very uh still quiet absorbed unified around

188
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:02,640
the experience of breathing at least that that's the way I was taught when I was in Burma uh at some

189
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:09,200
point as we get absorbed into this world of change as we get unified around it it

190
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,560
no longer is limited to the experience of breathing it could open up into the

191
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:20,880
whole field of changing sensations in our experience and sometimes that opens

192
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:27,359
up to something that's called choiceless awareness uh where we're not we're not choosing

193
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:32,480
something like the breathing as the focal point for seeing change but rather

194
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:39,520
we're just allowing change to show itself to us uh in whatever way that it it shows itself there might be a sound

195
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,720
then a sensation in the body and then a feeling then a thought arises and all

196
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:53,599
this stuff happens in a way but but not that we're chasing it not what we're following it but rather that we're in

197
00:36:53,599 --> 00:37:01,520
the midst of it uh settling quieting becoming unified

198
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,520
just this what is possible is to um sometimes with

199
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:15,920
the choices awareness of opening up too quickly to include everything uh some sometimes it's too easy to um limit the

200
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:22,079
quieting and settling unifying of the mind it's uh sometimes too easy to

201
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:27,839
mistake kind of a kind of cognitive awareness of everything from the deep

202
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:36,160
non non uh thinking mode of being and um and so

203
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:43,280
the idea sometimes people find it very helpful just to stay with the breathing and all the insight that we need to have

204
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:51,200
for insight meditation can be uh found or can arise from being with a changing

205
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:58,720
shifting sensation of breathing um and uh so as a as a mindfulness

206
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:05,359
teacher inside teacher my preference is to encourage people to stay with the

207
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:12,880
breathing as as long as that's compelling as long as that's an easy place to be and just to flow so because

208
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,000
it works as a great place to develop this unification of samadei so that

209
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,079
samadei and insight are working together hand in hand

210
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:32,320
some people like to um um well so that's that's my emphasis and

211
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:38,560
then uh however uh if anything becomes more compelling than the breathing like

212
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:43,839
say there's a strong sensation in your body elsewhere or a strong feeling or a

213
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:49,520
strong uh emotion or a strong s a sound outside

214
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:58,400
then uh in a whether it's a relaxed mind as possible uh fold that into the the

215
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,760
mindfulness the awareness let that become the uh focal point or the

216
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:12,240
organizing center for this unification so it isn't so much to go out and really

217
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:18,800
um understand the sound if it's a loud sound it is to take it in that also as a

218
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:24,079
changing flowing part of the present moment

219
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:29,440
and then there's a knee pain and you do the same thing with the knee pain uh you

220
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,720
don't you don't start thinking about the knee pain but rather uh that becomes the

221
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:40,960
place where to stay with the changing flowing sensations getting so the

222
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:48,240
samadei is arising uh in relationship to change the

223
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:54,640
relationship to things constantly shifting and moving and becoming different than it is

224
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:02,880
the um and in the process of doing that uh a meditator might go through similar

225
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:10,000
uh stages of samadei as we do in pure samadei practice there might be

226
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,920
comparable to going through u the um um

227
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:22,000
the approach concentration approach somebody and the approaching johnic like

228
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,040
states there's kind of johnic deep absorptive states that go through the

229
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:33,440
quantum leaps of deep joy deep happiness deep peace contentment to deep

230
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:40,640
equinimity as it as it works in samati practice it can also happen in insight practice

231
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:49,280
because the the it's the change the the the flow of inconstancy of impermanence

232
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:56,720
comeings and goings of things that becomes the the uh resting place for

233
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,760
samadei the home base the grounding place for our experience of being

234
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:08,319
attentive and um so in this way it isn't that

235
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:13,359
We're looking for change trying to understand it and with cognitively

236
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:19,680
evaluate it or cognitively believe in it or focus on it but rather

237
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:28,160
uh awareness is flowing in it uh unified in it almost as like we're be awareness

238
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:36,000
is becoming the change uh the changing shifting flow of the present moment so in this regard I like

239
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:45,119
to sometimes think of um um now as a river the river of now we're always in

240
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:50,240
that river of now but it's a river because whatever it's in the now is

241
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:56,400
always shifting and changing and the more we can rest in the river of now the

242
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,599
more we'll see it as a river we'll see it as a constant shifting moving of

243
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:07,680
sensations thoughts experiences arising and passing

244
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:13,440
coming and going flowing along uh sometimes only through very minute

245
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:19,280
little shifts and changes in the texture the quality the tensity of what's going

246
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:25,359
on but to stay with it in such a soft

247
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:32,480
settled restful a awareness that the whole psychophysical system that we have

248
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:38,400
can get settled peaceful quiet settled

249
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:46,240
into this flow of change until in at some point with deeper insight oh all

250
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:52,000
there is is change and at some point even it doesn't really matter in deep

251
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:59,760
inside practice what's changing it just simply that feels so nice for the mind

252
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:07,280
to be just kind of absorbed um in a samadei state of how much just

253
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:13,680
the change the flow the current of the river becomes the delight not

254
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:20,720
necessarily the kind of water we're in or the details of the experience it's just that

255
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:26,720
things are flowing becomes deeply satisfying partly because it's deeply

256
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:35,839
freeing it's deeply freeing to uh to uh not have the mind latch on

257
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:41,839
to anything not to have the mind caught by anything reacting to anything wanting

258
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:48,400
something judging something but rather having the mind at ease resting flowing

259
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:54,160
along in this current of the present moment

260
00:43:54,160 --> 00:44:02,000
so thank you very much and um very happy to be able to be here and very grateful

261
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,520

262
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:14,079
vacation and uh and I'll be back at IMC tomorrow
