1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:08,480
so hello everyone greetings from the dark from uh

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:17,080
still I guess it's Dawn here it's um came down here to IMC in the dark

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:23,000
and delighted and kind of cozy to be here with you all this

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,960
way it's one of my favorite things to do is take it up in the morning and go to a meditation

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:36,719
Hall and um did it many times in monasteries and temples where it involved going

6
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:43,559
outdoors and uh dark and following a path to the meditation Hall and such a

7
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:53,199
wonderful way to begin the day so um one of

8
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,400
the approaches is one of the supports for meditation

9
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:10,360
practice that is usually not emphasized and that is uh having a

10
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:16,200
vision and the reason it's not emphasized is that a vision seems to be

11
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:22,880
something in the future something elsewhere and not about what's here and now and mindfulness is so much about

12
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:29,960
being present here and now but the more we're present here and now the more we really settle here and

13
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:36,880
let go of our distractions let go of our attachments that uh more at peace

14
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:43,520
here at some point almost like built into that experience of here and now is

15
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:51,040
a strong sense of it possible to expand that peace further it's possible to let

16
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:58,039
go more fully it's possible to be more

17
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:04,840
fully Here and Now not just here and now but somehow fully inhabiting Here and

18
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:11,239
Now Fully Alive in this fullness of the here and now in the fullness or

19
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:16,959
wholeness of ourselves and um it's kind of like if

20
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,840
you hold your hand in a fist for a long time and then something happens that you

21
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:29,000
get distracted from the important task of being all clenched up and you notice

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,400
that the hand relaxes a bit and then you might clench up again but you now you

23
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,640
know something and you now you have a vision oh there's a possibility here it's right here and now as well the

24
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:49,440
possibility of further releasing that that hand so the hand can be relaxed

25
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,480
finally so in in Buddhism at some point

26
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,640
there comes a time when uh a meditator

27
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,159
acquires knowledge and vision it's a technical word and there's knowledge and

28
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,640
visions of different things but the knowledge is something that comes from our direct experience here something we

29
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:19,360
now know something about the quality the potential of this practice something about the

30
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,480
um Freedom or the peace and then there's a vision that

31
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:32,200
comes from that knowledge that yes more is possible more is

32
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:38,239
available um and uh in a wonderful way in which this vision is

33
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,080
experienced is that um it isn't so much that more for me to acquire me to

34
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:51,120
experience me to do but rather there's an invitation a vision of an invitation

35
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,280
an vision of a request a vision of a door that says

36
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,239
here here the door is open open here freedom

37
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:09,680
is so meditation as Vision so

38
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,000
to assume a meditation

39
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:24,080
posture and spend some time refamiliarizing yourself with your body in this

40
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:31,000
posture some of you have been meditating for a long time

41
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,440
and the posture becomes your Meditation Center your temple meditation

42
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:47,479
Hall your posture your body becomes kind of the homecoming or

43
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,120
the the meditation Hall

44
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:04,520
coming so to re familiarize yourself with how your posture feels in your

45
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:14,400
body as the place you're going to meditate as a support as the home for

46
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,720
meditation and gently closing your

47
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:35,720
eyes and becoming more sensitive to the experience of your body

48
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:44,080
how your body feels to feel the request or the call to

49
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:52,520
relax the body maybe you can feel the vision the

50
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,479
possibility of softening in the

51
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:07,199
body and if you have a vision or see the

52
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:15,800
possibility as you exhale may let it be so

53
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,919
relax maybe less that you are relaxing

54
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,599
as you're allowing the body to relax on the

55
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:58,400
exhale the knowledge of where your tense can translate into a

56
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:05,039
vision of the possibility of

57
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:16,000
relaxing and that in the middle of that tension you might sense a request

58
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,360
invitation to

59
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
soften

60
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
e

61
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
for

62
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,720
centering yourself on the body exper the body's experience of

63
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:05,680
breathing and gently in the middle of the body

64
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:12,959
breathing maybe at the center of it a

65
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:24,120
vision of the breathing being easeful soft

66
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:31,120
light it might not be that way

67
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:37,040
but when it's not that way right there in the middle of it there can be a sense

68
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:45,440
of a possibility invitation don't expect it don't try to

69
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,519
make it be that way if just

70
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,279
appreciate that such a vision is

71
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:06,240
possible it's a vision that makes makes it

72
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,160
possible in its own time in its own

73
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
way

74
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
e

75
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
e

76
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
for

77
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
e

78
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
for

79
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
for

80
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
for

81
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
e

82
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
e

83
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
for

84
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,079
if you find yourself thinking a lot with pressure in the mind

85
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:16,120
or contraction in the mind or if you find yourself emotionally

86

fully feel it in your body

88
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:37,920
and in The Knowing deep inside of it maybe there's a

89
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,720
vision of letting go of relaxing opening

90
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,959
up without expectation without making anything

91
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:00,279
happen maybe just know having that vision is a possib

92
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:05,120
abbility opens the Mind opens the

93
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:12,400
heart expands the context for how you can be with any

94
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,880
difficulty you have a vision of

95
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:26,360
Freedom release an

96
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:35,760
invitation to be become [Music] more than anything that limits

97
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
you

98
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
for

99
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
for

100
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
for

101
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
e

102
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
e

103
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
e

104
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
e

105
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
e

106
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:31,158
letting go of your thoughts quieting the

107
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:39,480
inside to feel deep inside or to

108
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:45,320
feel where there can be a vision a

109
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,960
sense of Freedom here and

110
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:59,960
now a sensing a knowing a vision

111
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:10,600
it's almost like an invitation here this is where you can let

112
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:17,960
go this is where you can release the grip in the

113
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:23,120
mind the contraction of the

114
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,880
heart the knot in the belly

115
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:39,360
here is where you can let go of the bracing that spreads through the whole

116
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,799
body a bracing against

117
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,880
life and being happy to have such a

118
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:03,120
vision just having it is

119
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,960
enough it opens the

120
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
door

121
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
e

122
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
e

123
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:33,360
and then as we come to the end of the

124
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:45,840
sitting to open the heart the mind to the challenges of this

125
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,600
world which are

126
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:59,320
immense and to know that the world has its challenges and to have a vision of

127
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:07,080
Peace a vision of the letting go of hostility and

128
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:14,880
greed to have a vision of the world at

129
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:22,919
peace not in a naive way not expecting it'll happen overnight

130
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:30,799
or maybe ever but without that

131
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:38,720
Vision Without that invitation for another way it certainly won't be possible to

132
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:46,559
change this world take refuge in that

133
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:52,000
Vision that comes from knowing suffering

134
00:27:52,200 --> 00:28:00,320
well suffering doesn't have to be a burden in the middle of it there's an

135
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:07,039
invitation of vision for a better

136
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:18,320
world and may we remember that vision and may it Inspire

137
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:24,519
us to contribute to that

138
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:33,320
possibility each of us is important each of us counts however small contribution we

139
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:40,760
make May through our speech our body and our

140
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:47,720
mind may we promote good will compassion generosity and peace in

141
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,760
this world may all

142
00:28:53,039 --> 00:29:01,080
beings be happy may all all beings be

143
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:07,480

you

149
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,799
so hello and continue with this story of my life

150
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:46,399
now as a coming into becoming a teacher and I guess I am enjoying

151
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:52,600
talking about this uh sometimes I've become bored telling my story few the

152
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:58,559
times I have and um it's kind of May maybe gives

153
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:04,000
me a chance for reconsider it and look at it in new ways from this perspective

154
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:12,799
for today this age so in 1990 I came to graduate school

155
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:19,559
at Stanford University I moved back into San Zen Center I started teacher training with

156
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:26,240
Jack cornfield and within a year or so I started kind of training to be a zen

157
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:32,840
teacher and get Dharma transmission by 1992 I was

158
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:42,440
married and um it was kind of a wonderful time looking back at it and um and uh my scholarship my was a

159
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:47,919
three-year scholarship at at Stanford they gave me living

160
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:53,519
expenses um I was able to spread it out over four years so I went to school two

161
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:59,159
quarters a year rather than three and uh and that allowed me to go

162
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:06,519
and do the teacher training to go on Retreats and to start teaching Retreats and I very quickly understood

163
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:13,480
that um the kind of uh courses graduate courses that I took um uh the primary

164
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:20,919
way in which we were graded was by turning in a final paper and because I was doing other

165
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:27,559
things as well uh the Dharma things and Retreat things um uh at least one uh

166
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:34,240
summer I wrote my final paper before the class began I kind of understood how the

167
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,840
topics were what the subject was I knew the subject I signed up for for the course and I kind of knew how this went

168
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:48,760
so I knew I would be busy and one of the things that I was busy with or engaged in was at every fall I for pretty much

169
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:53,919
the whole 1990s um beyond the time I was at um in

170
00:32:53,919 --> 00:33:00,880
graduate school I um taught a 10day uh experienced student

171
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:07,320
Retreat uh in just North of San Francisco and uh so that was right near the end of the quarter you know just

172
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:13,039
before everything was due and so you know so I had to really plan ahead to be

173
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:20,240
ahead of the game in order to be able to get the cours work done but that seemed to always work out and in fact uh when

174
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,360
it was time for me to defend my dissertation uh I

175
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:33,360
um uh it happened to be in the middle of that 10 uh day Retreat and um and

176
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:40,760
looking back now I kind of Marvel that that it worked out this way but I was kind of matter of fact about things back

177
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:46,559
then and just kind of like okay I just did it so it was in the middle of that Retreat so I was at the retreat teaching

178
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:51,960
it and one morning I got up and put on a jacket nice nice jacket to someone had

179
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:58,320
given me and uh drove down to Stanford and did the defense and then drove back

180
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,360
to the retreat and just continued uh the teaching there uh so this integration

181
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:09,480
this going back and forth worked very well I felt very fortunate the way it worked for me at graduate school that

182
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:15,200
way and um and then I also I was teaching and uh the sitting group in

183
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:21,800
paloalto that I joined started teaching for in August of

184
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:28,040
1990 and uh that group began to grow and I very quickly had some sense that there

185
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:33,358
was a vision I had a vision or knowledge of what was possible for people when

186
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:39,599
they enter into the world the Buddhist practice and I knew that there was much more to be done in practice than just

187
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:45,320
coming to A A Monday evening sitting group and I knew that volunteering uh

188
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:52,200
you know caring for the place you practice in is really valuable for one's own practice so there wasn't much to be

189
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:57,920
done there was just a key to get into the room in the church and there was um

190
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:05,280
uh uh taking home every day every Monday the flyers from Spirit Rock um for

191
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:12,320
programs up there and then putting them out the next day when we next Monday when we came back and so I immediately

192
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:18,520
early on and asked for volunteers for that and uh and uh the person who I I

193
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:23,640
gave the key to I kind of said you're now the president of uh of our sitting

194
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:30,359
group and kind of wanted to really promote people to have some sense of ownership involvement and responsibility

195
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:37,280
for what was going on and um and uh I taught happily for

196
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:44,960
about six months without any thought and concerns about any compensation for teaching it was having kind of grown up

197
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:52,040
for these 10 years in the Buddhist world where I practiced at Zen Center and in Asia um um being paid and getting money

198
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:57,200
and being compensated was completely out out of the picture the idea was just to

199
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:03,160
engage in the practice and if you were invited to teach then you would teach and now I would been invited to teach

200
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:09,520
for this group and I had no thoughts about any any compensation at all and

201
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:16,000
then after 6 months uh they had a little basket to collect money to pay rent for the church

202
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,960
and after six months there was a $100 an extra and uh what do we do with this and

203
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:28,319
someone said let's give it to Gil and uh and then maybe another 6 months there was another $100 and so that was the

204
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:35,359
beginning of uh kind of living um you know being supported to live and teach

205
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:42,480
the Dharma and uh as that group began to grow I started to have uh vision and I I

206
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,599
realized later it was a vision and I began realizing later that part of the

207
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:55,079
responsibility of caring for a meditation group was to have a vision of what was possible for them that people

208
00:36:55,079 --> 00:37:01,480
were doing practice and uh and uh it was wonderful and now

209
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:08,160
there was a vision they could do more it would be helpful so I remember we um this I said you know we this group can

210
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:14,160
probably now ready to do a halfday retreat and uh so someone uh had access

211
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:20,720
to a small conference room I guess it's kind of small uh at the uh third floor

212
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:27,520
fourth floor of the aerodynamics department at Stanford and we went there on a Saturday or so Sunday when it the

213
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:33,680
building was closed and and and there was a deck and there was some hallways there and that's where we did our first

214
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:39,319
half day sitting and uh and so then we did more of those and had Vision now these people

215
00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:44,880
are ready for a whole day retreat at some point I said I said uh there are

216
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:51,200
people who come here don't know about meditation so I think we it's time for us to offer an intro class so I'd

217
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:57,040
offered an inter class before and um and I write in the next IMC newsletter I write about the

218
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:03,839
beginnings of this intro class and um and then um and so I

219
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:10,400
started having you know my job my responsibility I felt or my my caretaking was to have this vision of

220
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,800
what was possible and then at some point someone suggested we move to the Quaker

221
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:22,720
Meeting House which had a bigger room and uh that turned out to be really wonderful and I love the Quakers I love

222
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,960
the kind of the ethos the atmosphere the I felt like there was something we I

223
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,520
took in deeply from being among not so much among the Quakers but sharing their space with

224
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:40,520
them and um and there we I decided the we're ready now to take a deep dive into the

225
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:47,920
Buddhist precepts and we did a class on the precepts and and um and then I did now he's ready

226
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:55,400
for loving kindness and we did a class on loving kindness and now we're kind of full on Monday nights and so let's start

227
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:01,520
Thursday nights and so we Quaker place was available for us and so then we started Thursday nights and I a little

228
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:08,040
different vision for what Thursday nights was about there I Monday nights was more about Buddhism Buddhist

229
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:15,200
practice and and Thursday night evenings was most about coping how to cope in this difficult life of ours and and uh

230
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:22,200
in fact the people who came Thursday night were in fact people who are much more on the edge of just managing and cope and wanting some kind of basic

231
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:31,280
support and and I loved having both those possibilities and then at some point we um uh we used

232
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:37,640
to we kept kind of wondering what to do and at some point um well I had a vision

233
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:43,599
of of uh my involvement with the group at some point uh and the vision

234
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:50,079
was not about staying with the group The Vision for myself was that I was so inspired by the people who are coming

235
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:57,800
and how serious they were about practice and and I felt the responsibility to caretake and support these people and so

236
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:04,720
I had this idea that well what we're going to do is to grow this group to be big enough that we can invite an other

237
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,839
teacher to come to take over so I can leave and the idea is I wanted to live

238
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:15,760
in the country I had this Vision this idea of living um near Point Rays on up

239
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:23,079
the coast North of San Francisco in a place that's kind of halfway between the Green Gul Z Center where I practiced and

240
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:28,960
Spirit Rock where ID also practiced I had a strong connection to both and I thought my vision I would live up

241
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:35,800
there halfway and and be involved in both worlds so um but at some point I think

242
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:41,960
by 19 uh 1996 I was so inspired and impressed by

243
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:47,400
this growing Community I I decided you know I'm I guess I'm committed now I'm

244
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:53,440
going to commit myself to stay here and support this group stay here in the peninsula it was a kind of a big deal

245
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:59,520
for my wife who she had I she didn't want to meet to live in an urban

246
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:06,240
area but uh so that's what we did made that I made that commitment but I didn't

247
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,760
require or want anything from the community with that commitment but except I wanted them to know that that

248
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:19,560
was the case and um and so I uh asked for a meeting among

249
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:25,720
I don't know I forget who was invited to it but I think there was maybe a dozen or 15 people who are by this time were

250
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:32,319
kind of more Central than everyone else maybe or I don't remember but we met at someone's

251
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:40,079
home and I explained to them that I just you know what was happening and I was just felt like I needed to tell people

252
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:47,480
about this commitment and you know there was no expectation of anything as a result but that stimulated a

253
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:53,680
conversation and in that conversation then there was a a a vision that was

254
00:41:53,680 --> 00:42:00,599
evoked and I might have had certainly part of that vision and I forget who who initiated it that uh we should have our

255
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:06,400
own home we should have our own place to practice and and um and I had a full

256
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:13,359
vision of that I had a really clear sense that uh there so much more was possible if we weren't uh if we could

257
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:19,559
really have our own place and um and uh where we didn't have

258
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:25,880
to move zafus and mooving things in and out where people felt like this was where our you know they come here now

259
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:32,480
this is our place and it was open it could be available 24/7 it could be be kind of people's spiritual home in a way

260
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:38,240
it couldn't be in a church room and um and that as the as the community grew

261
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:45,160
and the depth of practice grew maturity grew that we were able to do more more different kinds of programs and support

262
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:50,520
people and um and uh so then we decided to get

263
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:58,480
Incorporated and uh as a nonprofit a religious nonprofit and that took a little while and back then coming out of

264
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:05,640
the kind of maybe alternative culture that I'd grown up in in United States theya have consensus and equality and

265
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:11,119
everyone in it together was kind of Paramount and so I the idea that we

266
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:16,559
would have a all consensus-based model for governance for this new center uh

267
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:23,960
was kind of in the Forefront of our minds and and um and so there was a

268
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:30,079
group of people that came up with bylaws but when they presented it to me and we had this meeting where we were going to

269
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:35,920
ratify them I was kind of shocked at what was presented because it was very

270
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,640
open everyone had a vote uh and there was no membership exactly so I guess anybody who came to a meeting or

271
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:47,800
something everyone had a vote except one person and that was me

272
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,839
the teacher and you know in this consensus model where we're all supposed

273
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:58,480
to have a vote and decide together um and to you know to not grant me just

274
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:04,920
that one vote I mean that's just one that didn't seem right to me and it was so complicated what was set up I said

275
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:10,720
this is not going to work and so I said to the committee that um well I'm not

276
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:17,480
ready to R there for us to ratify this um uh I'd like us to put on hold while I

277
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:24,599
have some time to think about this and um and so some people were angry with me but that was the decision

278
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:31,280
and then about nine months later I felt ready and then I re reassembled some of the people from that committee uh to

279
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:38,720
come up with new bylaws which is ones we have today and um and

280
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:47,960
uh and so then we we're ready to start thinking about a center and uh and then

281
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:54,240
um and keep growing and developing and and uh and following the maturity of

282
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:59,400
this community and as I come to the end of this little talk that at some point

283
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:05,720
around that time it was clear to me that I was also maturing that there was something about

284
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:12,280
the inter relationship the the back and forth connection to a community that was

285
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:17,920
growing and developing and maturing and my teaching the community and and them

286
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:24,119
asking questions and growing and that affected me and in this role of being a

287
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:29,760
teacher um that was a very important time to

288
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:35,480
really understand myself much better and um you know being a teacher is not free

289
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:41,200
of attachments not free of certain shortcomings and

290
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:49,640
Oddities so I had lots of opportunity to see parts of myself that I hadn't seen in years of meditation practice and U

291
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:56,680
because it was elicited in that Community Dynamic and so it was wonderful to watch the mutual mature ing

292
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:04,000
of the community and myself the growing that was going on there and um that um

293
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:10,400
so it was a a very important choice I made uh the community made at that point

294
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:17,280
and that incorporation then open the door for uh much more to happen here at

295
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:24,800
IMC so thank you very much and I'll continue with this

296
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,800
tomorrow
