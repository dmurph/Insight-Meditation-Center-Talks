mind and heart

65
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,000
stability breath in the body is the ground we can

66
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:40,480
also open up to noticing a rising and passing away

67
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:48,000
impermanence the breath comes and goes

68
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,480
thoughts come and go maybe in terms

69
00:17:53,480 --> 00:18:00,600
of images they come or maybe they come with words they come in they

70
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:06,730
go perhaps emotions come and go states of Mind sounds

71
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:12,600
[Music] Sensations stay staying with the breath

72
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,720
but being tuned also to notice in come and goes when it

73
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:24,919
coming and going in permanence when it reveals itself but the primary

74
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,760
object is the breath

75
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

76
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

77
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,679
e e

78
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:02,280
if opening to seeing impermanence it comes too wide too much just stay with

79
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,480
the

80
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:16,360
breath having dropped this reflection impermanence will reveal itself but don't look for it just simply staying

81
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:21,840
with the in breath and the out breath being known from

82
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,840
within

83
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
intimately

84
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

85
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

86
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

87
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

88
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

89
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

90
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

91
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

92
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

93
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

94
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,240
e e

95
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:59,279
and as we turn to bring this meditation together to a close

96
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:08,278
notice if there is just a tiny bit more calm and Clarity in your mind heart your

97
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:15,760
body more settledness or

98
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:23,760
spaciousness it might show up in different ways but notice it it's important to notice the

99
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,440
shifts through our practice it helps us build trust trust and confidence in the

100
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,000
practice in

101
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,799
ourselves and also notice that you might have had many

102
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:48,200
thoughts we all do that came and went impermanent where are they

103
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:54,519
now during this practice they came and went impermanent they didn't stick they

104
00:28:54,519 --> 00:29:00,600
didn't stay they Frozen

105
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,559
past and reflecting on that

106
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:14,240
also increases trust confidence in the teachings of the

107
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:20,240
Buddha things come and go they're impermanent

108
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,360
and appreciating yourself for having showed up for having practiced trus in

109
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:40,278
yourself for showing up without attachment to

110
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:48,360
outcome our practice [Music] unfolds on its own we just show up we do

111
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:56,120
our part for ourselves for each other for the world may all beings

greetings greetings everyone so today is day three of our

119
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:32,720
exploration of uh uh this topic Sada Sada in

120
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:39,279
poly the word Sada in poly translated as

121
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:45,559
um I'll put it in chat again s here we

122
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:52,039
go translated as trust or confidence and

123
00:31:52,039 --> 00:32:01,200
a quick recap of the past couple days uh we talked about we explored how trust

124
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,840
confidence in the practice in the path uh this well

125
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:13,639
let's just say trust sad is necessary for beginning the practice for starting

126
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:21,559
it and also for continuing for not stopping and then yesterday we um the

127
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:29,360
second day uh we explored how uh trust in the triple Jewel which is the

128
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,519
classical language the triple Jewel the Buddha Dharma and S is important for

129
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:41,159
this path and uh is uh and I unpack that and very briefly the Buddha trus in the

130
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:46,480
Buddha can show up as oh somebody woke up somebody did uh practice and and

131
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:54,600
really develop these beautiful qualities a human being just like me so so can I so can I uh trust in the teachings that

132
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:00,600
the recipes there there's ways to do this um and uh trust in the s in the

133
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:07,080
community support of the community we're not doing this alone and many many people have done this um and I can too

134
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:13,480
and I brought in a um a u musical simile learning to play a

135
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:19,320
musical instruments such as the cello and and the trust that it that we need to see that others have done this and

136
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:24,600
and that their uh music books and music classes and music you know scales and

137
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,639
practicing available and um and all that so um

138
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:37,000
today I'd like to turn to exploring um what what gives rise how how can we grow

139
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:44,600
in confidence uh how can we cultivate sadada um and the three main points that

140
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:52,600
I want to make today is um growing sadag growing our confidence cultivating our

141
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:58,279
confidence through practice through meditation practice through

142
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:04,519
sea ethical conduct and through reflective practice uh with support from

143
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:11,560
the S so these are the three points I want to touch into today and also connect them with the

144
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:20,200
themes that I brought into the meditation today so how can we grow how can we grow and cultivate our trust our

145
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:28,599
trust our confidence um the first one is um really

146
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:35,200
our meditation our our practice itself um our formal practice I say informal

147
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:44,720
practice is very important as well for example the practice of say stealth meta when we're um walking around having a uh

148
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:50,440
kind heart and beaming meta to others th those practices those informal practices

149
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:56,760
in between times when we're washing the dishes sensing our bodies those are important as well but for a moment I'm

150
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:03,359
I'm going to concentrate for a moment on on formal practice and I'll come to informal practice

151
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:09,240
so with formal practice of meditation uh when we sit and

152
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:16,000
practice um to to notice um for example today I

153
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,640
invited you to to um connect with the breath simple anapanasati and I and I

154
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:29,960
said little to have a lot of space silent space for you to explore so that the mind would settle the heart would

155
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:35,359
settle and when we practice for example anapanasati as an example of many many

156
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:41,520
many practices in this uh vast Dharma offerings but anapanasati is is is a

157
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:47,760
go-to for many of us it's a primary practice that the Buddha taught uh Manti

158
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,160
mindfulness of the breath knowing the breath in breath out breath in the

159
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:59,800
body knowing the breath can calm and settle the mind it

160
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:05,680
does actually not can it does it does when we really do it it calms settles

161
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:13,319
the mind it brings more clarity so that the Mind instead of being lost in thought

162
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:19,760
here and there it settles and it can see more clearly can see more clearly the

163
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:26,240
thoughts that arise in past the mind can see the patterns the patterns of thoughts that we have maybe we have a

164
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:33,359
pattern of being planning of being a planner we keep planning planning planning oh when the Mind settles with

165
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:39,040
with anapanasati with mindfulness of the breath we can see our patterns we can

166
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:45,960
see how maybe we're still resentful we're still reactive of something that happened days ago or months ago or years

167
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:53,880
ago like wow sweetheart you're still picking that up we get to see it instead of being lost in it lost in it lost in

168
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:59,400
it and and not even noticing what's happening

169
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:08,599
so the anapanasati mindfulness of the breath among other practices can really

170
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:14,319
help us help the Mind settle to see the

171
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:19,800
patterns of the mind so when we do a practice when we do a meditation

172
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:25,640
practice like Ana panasa mindfulness of the breath and we reflect at the end as

173
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:31,680
I invited you to reflect at the end the end to pay attention oh is my mind any

174
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:37,359
calmer than it was when I began the practice is it any

175
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:47,400
calmer and you realize oh yeah there's still thoughts of course there are but there's a little more space I'm a little

176
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:53,440
calmer that reflection alone that added reflection at the

177
00:37:53,440 --> 00:38:01,119
end helps you see that oh yeah this practice works yeah this practice works I can do it

178
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:07,319
it's working yeah it brings confidence it brings trust and that trust is

179
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:13,560
important to bring you back to support you on the path so building trust build

180
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:20,160
trust please build trust as you practice do bring awareness

181
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:26,240
to how the mind is getting calmer how you're having insights so that's on the

182
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:31,720
short and during a practice maybe half hour practice an hour practice a day but

183
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:38,440
also do that in the long um in the longer time span maybe reflect that oh

184
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:45,240
I've been practicing now say for six months or a year I'm kinder to myself or

185
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:50,800
I'm less uh reactive in this particular situation maybe there are situations

186
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:57,480
that you still get reactive but when this particular person says something oh I used to get

187
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:05,000
really reactive and but now I don't oh okay wow something has shifted or maybe

188
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:11,640
your friends and family tell you that um something has shifted so reflect reflect

189
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:18,640
on these shifts on these changes either shortterm during your practice or

190
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,839
longterm over days weeks months years to

191
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:29,520
build to cultivate trust to cultivate trust trust is so important it's

192
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,960
important to reflect so reflection can help you build

193
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:43,880
trust and of course not just the reflection but also the doing the

194
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:51,960
practice itself if you don't do the practice itself there's nothing to build trust upon right so you need to do the

195
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:57,079
practice um the for the formal practice of sitting meditation sitting and

196
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:04,680
walking in meditation practice reflect and informal practice in between

197
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:10,440
times um for example maybe stealth meta you're doing or if you're going for a

198
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:18,680
walk just general walk being more mindful being more kind um if you're driving again beaming

199
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:24,599
kindness loving kindness to other drivers stressed on the road these in between practices that are not sitting

200
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:29,640
with your eyes closed but practice that you bring to your daily life they also

201
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:36,440
change you one last thing I wanted to point out this morning uh this morning my time

202
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:41,839
earlier in our PR in our guided meditation I also invited you to notice

203
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:49,079
a rising and passing impermanence and we can notice that simply uh the breath arises I've had a 100 thoughts during

204
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:55,319
this 30 minute meditation arising and passing coming and going when you really

205
00:40:55,319 --> 00:41:03,200
see that the nature of the impermanent nature of everything it gives you trust in the

206
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,480
teachings of the Buddha because that opens up to many many more insights that

207
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:16,400
I won't get into but just so know that that is um that's uh that's a primary doorway

208
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,240
for insights and and growing in trust in the Dharma seeing

209
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:27,280
impermanence in the time that is left I want to talk about the importance of eth

210
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:33,640
ethical conduct Sila or Sheila Sila in in

211
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:39,839
poly ethical conduct the importance of ethical conduct and the five precepts

212
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:45,680
the five lay precepts abstaining from killing from stealing taking what has

213
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:53,800
not been offered sexual misconduct false speech and um taking

214
00:41:53,800 --> 00:42:00,760
intoxicants so abstaining from these five the ethical

215
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:08,440
conduct it helps grow trust in the practice and let's just pause for a

216
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:17,160
moment and consider so for let's take the fifth one for example intoxicants if if you keep drinking for

217
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:22,800
example intoxicating the mind and and um

218
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:28,800
make poor decisions then your trust in yourself erod it's oh even if you're

219
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:35,839
meditating you're trying to do it but then you kind of uh you're getting intoxicated and kind of falling off it

220
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:40,880
just it erodes your trust it erodes your trust in yourself it erodes the Trust In

221
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,640
The Practice it just doesn't quite it doesn't support it erodes it it it chips away at

222
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:53,880
it similarly if you um say tell lies uh

223
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:59,160
unwise Speech tell lies lying there's re Arch about how it becomes a slippery

224
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:06,200
slope and lying actually erodes other um actions it leads to other unethical

225
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:12,800
actions the unethical actions uh if you're stealing it erodes your confidence in yourself it erodes your

226
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:21,359
confidence in the practice so I want to leave you with

227
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:28,839
these two Reflections for today so today as you're practicing um please notice please

228
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:34,839
notice these shifts have Reflections both on how when you practice formally

229
00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:40,040
and informally in short time there is a shift and also in the long term maybe

230
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:47,359
reflect back to who you were before you start to practice even if it was a week ago notice the shifts that can build

231
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:55,720
confidence that builds confidence not can it builds confidence it builds trust s number two notice for yourself in your

232
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:03,000
own life the relationship between your own ethical conduct um and trust and

233
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,200
trust in yourself trust in your practice trust in your growing in your
