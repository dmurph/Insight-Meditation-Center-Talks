1
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:08,880
so hello and welcome to this monday morning meditation

2
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,960
where we begin the third foundation for mindfulness for the cultivation the

3
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,159
growth of awareness and this third foundation is usually

4
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,680
called is in palis called cheetah c-i-t-t-a

5
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,560
and in english it's sometimes known as mind state in this context sometimes the word cheetah simply refers

6
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:40,079
to mind and sometimes we can appreciate what it is maybe sometimes by

7
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,479
the attitude of mind that's present the general mood of the mind the kind of gestalt

8
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:52,880
uh feeling sense awareness of our inner mentality

9
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,399
the kind of whole of all the inner mental life may be

10
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,240
in in the west we often point to the head as being the

11
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,479
the locus the place of the mind a long asian tradition in buddhism is to

12
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,440
point to the heart as a center for the mind

13
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,959
i like to think of it as as related it's related to the quality

14
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,000
of our inner life that part of our inner life that

15
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,360
may or may not be influenced by events around us the circumstances of our life and things

16
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,200
and that in the deeper deeper places of the mind deeper capacities of the

17
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,560
mind is kind of how we feel and sense and

18
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:51,519
experience ourselves independent of kind of when we're on our own in our

19
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,040
in our more private private sense of our experience

20
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:05,200
so uh we'll just do a general uh meditation on the mind

21
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,239
and and then tomorrow we'll go on to

22
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:17,760
other aspects of it so to begin to take an alert

23
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,840
relaxed meditation posture

24
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,840
and lower your eyes to maybe 45 degrees to the floor

25
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,360
and if it's comfortable gently close your eyes

26
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,879
and before doing anything else notice

27
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,799
what's the general state of your mind right now

28
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,519
it's a general state of your inner life

29
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:01,840
that may or may not be independent from what's the circumstances that's happening right now

30
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,599
are you more on the agitated end of the spectrum or

31
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,920
more calm

32
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,840
are you more settled or more activated

33
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,120
are you uneasy in any way or is the inner state at ease

34
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:44,240
are you comfortable with your inner life inner state of mind state of heart

35
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,160
or is there a discomfort about it

36
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:58,479
whatever way it is let it be that way

37
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,840
but with breathing right in the middle of it perhaps or imagining that you can

38
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,160
breathe accompanying how your

39
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,240
state of mind is state of heart

40
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,080
gently take a few long slow deep breaths

41
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,960
breathing in deeply

42
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,680
breathing out

43
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,680
as you exhale relaxing your body

44
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,840
as you exhale relaxing

45
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:15,560
around the state of your mind your heart

46
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,039
and letting your breathing return to normal

47
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:41,440
then maybe if you continue relaxing on the exhale

48
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,000
begin by relaxing the mind

49
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,039
whatever it is for you the mind is

50
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,560
maybe it's the place where you from which you think

51
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,478
where there might be some tension or pressure or agitation

52
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,800
on the exhale let that relax and soften

53
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,720
or maybe there's a pervasive mood

54
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:38,639
that somehow is related to the functioning of your mind your mental

55
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,639
activity

56
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,520
as you exhale relax the body

57
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,680
as if relaxing the body

58
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,840
so settling around your mood your attitude

59
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,840
relaxing the face

60
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,758
the shoulders

61
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,399
the belly

62
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,720
and then a gentle awareness of your body breathing

63
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,680
in being aware of breathing there's kind of a meeting a meeting

64
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:30,080
place of the mind and the body the body has its sensations

65
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,399
and the mind somehow knows it

66
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,880
experiences it

67
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,360
and what would it be like to have a balanced awareness

68
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,519
knowing the body's experience

69
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,839
and aware of the mind knowing

70
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:43,839
with irregularity the constancy of breathing in and breathing out

71
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:55,720
as a massage or as a gentle

72
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,800
connection

73
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:07,680
to your state of mind the state of mind

74
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:14,160
through which you're attending aware of breathing

75
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,839
with the focus being on the rhythm of breathing

76
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:38,880
breathing with however your mind is however your inner

77
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:46,320
state is just breathing with it so that you're not reacting to it or

78
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,160
caught in it for or against it

79
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,639
a regular breathing heat coming and going

80
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:59,519
is a general quality or state of your mind

81
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:05,680
predominantly [Music] colored by desires

82
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,959
what you want or the wanting mind

83
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,439
or is it predominantly colored by aversion

84
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,639
wanting something different something to go away

85
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:41,079
or is it colored by confusion uncertainty

86
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:52,160
whatever way it might be breathe with it with

87
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,800
a gentle way of brushing against it

88
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:07,600
not needing to fix anything or concerned with anything but awareness brushing fast brushing

89
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,880
through how your mind is

90
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,480
one breath at a time

91
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,919
whether your mind is happy or sad

92
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:42,880
elated or in the blues eager or reluctant

93
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,720
whatever state way it is

94
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:54,039
breathe with it breathe through it

95
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:05,120
a kind of refuge and breathing so you're less reactive to how you are

96
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:13,559
on the inside just accompanying it with the breathing

97
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:15,000
knowing the state of your mind whatever it might be

98
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:23,520
and see if the knowing of it or the feeling of it whichever it is

99
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:31,278
you can know it with space as if there is a lots of space surrounding it

100
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:37,600
so rather than being caught in the web of how we feel

101
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,799
the knowing is wider more spacious

102
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,639
and however we are is within

103
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:55,158
that field of open field of experience

104
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:23,559
and as we come to the end of this sitting

105
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,360
familiar again with the state of your mind

106
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:41,200
the mood of the mind the attitude

107
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,600
how has it changed from the beginning of the meditation

108
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:11,760
and perhaps now at the end of the inhale or as you inhale as you begin to exhale

109
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,360
can the mind relax more deeply

110
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,398
or can you relax deep into the mind

111
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,278
to where the mind maybe is quiet

112
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,840
still

113
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,720
maybe where the mind is calm

114
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:52,960
like the ocean a few feet under the waves the ocean is quiet and calm

115
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:02,840
whatever the turbulence of your surface is dropping down into

116
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,799
your quiet place

117
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:21,279
and then turning your gaze out across the world

118
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,278
and see if your gaze your way of considering

119
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:35,600
the world that you live in to look upon it kindly

120
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:44,518
let yourself be still and gaze upon the world kindly

121
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,760
wish having good will well wishing for this world

122
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:07,880
wishing well wishing happiness for those who suffer and those who don't

123
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,679
wishing for the peace for those who are

124
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:26,278
not in peace and those who are

125
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,600
may all beings be happy

126
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:21,440
may all beings be safe

127
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:28,799
may all beings be peaceful

128
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:35,240
and may all beings everywhere be free

129
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:44,349
[Music]

130
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:04,160
so with this talk i'm going to introduce the third foundation for awareness

131
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:11,359
third foundation upon which to cultivate and grow our capacity to be aware and mindful

132
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:19,440
and with the this third foundation there's a real turning point

133
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,960
in the satipatana that's begun in this end of the second foundation

134
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,079
and that is from to turn from the being aware mostly of the body in some way or

135
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:35,359
other to the mind and on the way there the second

136
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:41,040
foundation we're aware of kind of the feelings the things that are pleasant and unpleasant that have to do

137
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:47,839
with the sense contact that reacts and responds to whatever

138
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:54,320
contact there is and uh and that pleasure

139
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:00,560
and delight pleasure well-being and also sometimes what's unpleasant

140
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:08,320
that doesn't belong to any world of sense contact but it's more like a welling up inside a

141
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:13,359
sense the inner life responds to some kind of deeper

142
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:18,640
wellspring that doesn't have to do with the thoughts we think

143
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:24,480
um the memories we have the what's happening around us circumstances

144
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:31,200
in the world and um and it kind of is pointing to the spiritual this nod of the flesh just

145
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,880
kind of like the spiritual side the dharma the dharma pleasure that can come with practice

146
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,960
and this sets the stage for this third foundation where now we're looking not at the body and not that weatherings are

147
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:49,040
pleasant or unpleasant but we're looking at the state of the mind

148
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:55,680
and the word mind is cheetah c-i-t-t-a and this word is used a lot referred to

149
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,359
this concept referred to a lot by the buddha but it's never defined exactly what it

150
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:06,839
is and it comes from the word

151
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:12,240
um uh that for the probably a word for thinking

152
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:17,520
and so it's related to the world of thinking the world of mentality

153
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:24,079
um but exactly we know what that the inner life of the mind is or what it is

154
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:31,119
is not defined because it's not meant to be reified it's not meant to be made into something

155
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:36,480
the mind is some general broad sense we have that's very very

156
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,880
personal that you can't exactly pinpoint this is exactly what the mind is

157
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,920
but maybe it's the kind of gestalt of the mental functionings we have

158
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:54,400
and the impression or the feeling or the sense we have of how that gestalt how that whole

159
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:01,839
is and um and the definition of that whole or what it is varies from day to day

160
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:07,520
from person to person perhaps and it's not so important to know exactly what it is

161
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:13,520
as to know what it is for you and so maybe for you it changes from

162
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:18,800
over time what you associate with the mind but it is an inner reference point of

163
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,920
something to be mindful of to be aware of and what's the quality what's the

164
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:30,800
characteristics of what you call what you say is your mind or your state of

165
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:36,560
mind and um so um

166
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:43,280
the state of mind is maybe a little bit more enduring sometimes than sensations of the body

167
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:49,280
sometimes sensation of the body maybe more enduring than some of the flickerings of the mind

168
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:56,480
but the general state or general mood of the mind the inner mental life what is it like

169
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:04,160
for you whatever the mind is it's it's uh colored or shaped

170
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:11,440
by the activities of the mind so it gets colored one way if there's a lot of desire intense

171
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:18,079
desire greed and it kind of the mind gets shaped by it or it gets

172
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:24,000
colored by it so he's looking at the world through this filter of desire and there's a kind of maybe a searching for

173
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,760
something wanting something it can be colored by aversion

174
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:36,560
and so not wanting pushing away resistance it can be colored by confusion

175
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,680
it can be colored by generosity by a sense of openness and

176
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:47,680
can be colored by love by compassion it can be colored by wisdom

177
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:54,240
the mind the mind itself is not a thing but it's kind of like something that is

178
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:59,839
influenced very much by what we're doing so one of the ways it's uh the shape of

179
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:06,480
it or the feeling or the sense of it changes is uh if we're really preoccupied in

180
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:14,000
some kind of thought some problem and really focused on it the mind might seem very small and contracted

181
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,000
but if we're really relaxed and at ease the mind might feel very spacious and open

182
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,280
and so the size of the mind the feeling the mind being open or closed

183
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:31,440
might vary depending on how preoccupied and unpreoccupied we are

184
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,040
so um and so in this third foundation we're starting to

185
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:42,720
become aware of how the the quality the characteristics

186
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:50,400
of this mind that we have and and this is becoming familiar with um

187
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:57,280
with the allow gives a foundation for big uh for really a sense to become aware of

188
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:04,400
um for the fourth foundation of mindfulness how the operations of the mind

189
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,440
the colors and shapes the mind you can return to get a sense

190
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:14,640
and feeling for something that i would like to i refer to or think of associate with

191
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:21,280
the quality of our inner life as we get to know that quality of our inner life the quality of our mind

192
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:26,880
then we can have some role in shaping it or seeing how it changes

193
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,240
and simply knowing it this power of knowing of mindfulness of

194
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:37,680
being present for something is not a a

195
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:43,040
non-influential act it's an act that kind of

196
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:49,839
without trying to change anything or it's a kind of things shift a little bit when we're fully present for it

197
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:54,960
if we're fully present for a mind that's kind of agitated with desires and

198
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,800
wanting and then the knowing is clear enough there's kind of space for that holding it

199
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:07,520
we see that the mind is not only desirous there's also the mindfulness which is

200
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:13,359
independent it's kind of wider or separate or distinct that knows

201
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:19,040
the quality of desire in the mind same thing with aversion same thing with delusion

202
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:25,040
the the mind can know itself and in the in the knowing

203
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:31,280
if the knowing is clear enough then the mind is more than whatever

204
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:37,839
uh desire or aversion or confusion it might have

205
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:44,800
and and so the knowing of it creates space in a sense or openness or

206
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,920
or some kind of um breathing room

207
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:56,880
for how the mind is and then we find we're not so contracted by it or caught in it and there's we can

208
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:02,319
see oh it's a quality of the mind but we don't that we don't have to identify

209
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:07,920
or say this is who i am some people have a

210
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:15,280
some kind of vague probably idea or feeling of i am the i am-ness how i who

211
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:23,040
i am or the fact that i am i exist and that for some people is closely connected to the mind as well

212
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:29,280
and um and the buddhism doesn't emphasize there's a self or this sense of i am

213
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:37,040
but whatever that is for you if you have that this fits a little bit under this category of mindfulness of the mind

214
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:43,280
where it's possible to bring attention and awareness and hold the quality or be aware of the

215
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,319
texture or the feeling tone or the experience of

216
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:54,480
the sense of eminence the sense of just beingness that resides someplace within

217
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:00,318
and i think for me this this fits into the category of mindfulness of the mind

218
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,599
and and we start getting familiar with um how the mind changes and morphs and

219
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:12,800
it's different at different times and over time especially for meditators we learn that the mind is flexible this

220
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:20,720
fluid it's changeable we learn that stopping and being present and knowing

221
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:27,119
not just barreling ahead with our concerns and preoccupation but pausing and taking a good look to recognize

222
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:34,240
what's there begins to uh have a wonderful influence on the contracted mind or the agitated

223
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:40,800
mind something begins to shift and change in that regard we start becoming familiar with what

224
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:46,000
it's like when the mind is not preoccupied when it's not desirous or

225
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:52,240
angry or afraid the mind is more open and generous and

226
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:57,520
loving and to start feeling some of the wonderful ways the mind can be

227
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:04,400
and in the buddhist tradition the wonderfulness of the mind is sometimes referred to as the beauty of

228
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:11,040
the mind that the mind can be can be experienced with something amazingly beautiful

229
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:17,359
i would say that for me i've been to many beautiful places in the world seen beautiful arts all kinds

230
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:23,599
of wonderful things and i i would say the most beautiful thing that i've ever seen

231
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:29,599
is the purified mind the bright clear mind

232
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:35,760
and and so we can start getting a glimpse of the beauty of the mind that's not

233
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:41,280
beautiful necessarily because we've done wonderful things in the world or that

234
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,960
everyone loves us or something but it's a beautiful mind in and of itself

235
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:52,160
independent of uh what's happening in the world around us

236
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:59,040
and we're cultivating this beautiful mind by discovering how not to get caught

237
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:04,960
by the unwholesome mind the mind that is challenged by desire

238
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:10,800
and greed and fear and agitation and restlessness and dismay and

239
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:17,359
sadness grief all kinds of things that catches the mind of course those things are there

240
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:23,760
and we're not denying them the practice of this third foundation

241
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:30,079
is to know this is how the mind is this is what's going on in the mind just know it

242
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:36,800
and it can be hard with the mind but this is the radical and i would say revolutionary kind of

243
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:42,960
movement of the mind which is to whatever state that's in to

244
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:48,079
discover how to simply know it this is how it is

245
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:54,079
and in that simple knowing this is how it is to not be

246
00:46:54,079 --> 00:47:00,960
wedded to it not be caught in it not be reactive to it it's almost like you step back

247
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:07,839
a couple of steps and turn around and look and see what the mind has been up to we've been enmeshed in the mind and

248
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:16,240
we pause we breathe we take those backward steps and then we look back and we see it in a whole new way

249
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:22,880
and we have some spaciousness around it some openness and that spaciousness

250
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:28,400
becomes part of the quality of the mind's beauty or

251
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:33,440
and now the spaciousness uh some of the beauty of the mind has to do with the

252
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:39,599
clarity of the mind and that cleared the mind sometimes becomes a feeling really feeling of

253
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:46,960
brightness in the mind the mind becomes bright luminous and the mind is no longer being defined

254
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:54,480
by the particular thoughts concerns and attitudes we have but it becomes

255
00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:00,720
and and as a result it becomes like the fog has cleared and there's this brightness and clarity

256
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:06,519
in the mind that can be beautiful

257
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:13,119
so um that's that's the topic for this week the third

258
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:18,640
foundation for awareness and cultivating awareness developing this

259
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:23,359
aware mind and what's kind of

260
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:29,599
poignant about this is that as the awareness of the mind develops

261
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:34,640
the mind the awareness and the mind at some point don't become so separate

262
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:40,000
and an awareness kind of becomes the mind or the mind becomes just mostly a field of

263
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,680
awareness it's not all of what it is but at first we might feel like we're aware

264
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:52,160
of the mind and then the mind becomes the awareness almost and shifts and we'll see how that goes

265
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:58,559
by the end of the week so thank you and

266
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,838
i look forward to this time and then

267
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:09,960
continue tomorrow thank you

268
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,559
you
