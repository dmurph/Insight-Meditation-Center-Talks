1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,759
he good morning folks my name is May Elliot and today we'll be studying the

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:13,120
third of the three characteristics uh known as anata or not

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:20,279
self and I want to begin uh by saying that not self- teachings can often be

4
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:26,199
perplexing for people um uh so please don't feel like you need to have a deep

5
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:31,439
understanding after today's session a 15minute daret doesn't really do it

6
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,440
justice um so it's okay if it doesn't quite land yet just you know allow not

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:44,520
self teachings to seep in over time so uh so one way uh to begin

8
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,760
exploring not self teachings uh is by noticing when selfing

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,960
is present and by that I mean uh noticing when we're feeling strongly

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,440
identified uh with some aspect of our experience and when we're not uh and we

11
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:09,080
even might think of selfing as on a spectrum um maybe on one end of the spectrum it can feel like there's a

12
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:16,280
really strong sense of self at times maybe there's a lot of identification a lot of defensiveness um

13
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:23,520
a really strong sense of I me or mine um or on the other end of the

14
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,920
spectrum um we can notice uh when it really feels like the sense of self is

15
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,040
um absent or or very thin maybe there's a lack of reactivity uh an absence of

16
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,159
defensiveness or possessiveness so typically uh When there's less selfing there's less

17
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:47,719
suffering so this can be an an interesting and very fruitful area of

18
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:54,280
Investigation so in our meditation today uh we'll be exploring two different aspects of our experience that we

19
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:00,640
typically identify with quite strongly um our body and our mind um and

20
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,920
specifically uh we'll be investigating our sense of identification with the body is there is there selfing occurring

21
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,879
in relationship to uh the body the physical Sensations um and then we'll when we

22
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:19,319
switch to looking at our thoughts um this is also an area where there's often a lot of identification thoughts can

23
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:25,599
really run the show so um so we'll we'll do a practice where we're we're noticing

24
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:33,040
seeing if we can notice when thoughts emerge uh sometimes being being able to see the arising of thoughts uh can help

25
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,640
us see that uh that they're less personal than we often think they are that you know we didn't put them there

26
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:46,720
or ask them to visit they're just kind of arising on their own based on conditions just um we could say selfless

27
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,440
phenomena coming and going um you know like a a thought can be like a bird

28
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,720
traveling through an empty sky so during the meditation today I'll

29
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,400
be offering some questions questions for investigation and uh you can allow these

30
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,720
questions to drop into your experience kind of like dropping a pebble in a pond

31
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,159
um you know just just dropping the pebble in dropping the question in and checking for

32
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:23,239
ripples um so that's one way to receive the the prompts um uh another is um that

33
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:30,680
I ask I might ask you some questions that invite you to investigate your own experience um and as you investigate

34
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:39,120
um you don't need to think about it to cognitively come up with an answer uh instead uh you're exploring your direct

35
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,319
experience uh and during any of this um if you discover there's identification

36
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,799
present there's a sense of you know selfing present there's sense of self um that's fine um that's great you're

37
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,040
seeing it um so remember that we're not trying to get rid of the sense of self

38
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:04,079
uh we're not trying to get rid of that sense of identification we're just wanting to bring our mindful attention to it just attending to it and sensing

39
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:09,920
what we find uh so remember um there are many

40
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,280
ways for insight uh into anata to be revealed uh this is just one way to

41
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:22,919
explore it one way to uh to deliberately investigate uh this Insight theme um but

42
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:28,440
there are many others uh so with all that said uh let's let's begin our

43
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,520
meditation so please uh find your meditation

44
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,240
posture connecting with uh what's happening for you

45
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:55,919
presently just feeling the body inviting relaxation

46
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:16,160
and connecting with some sense of okayness with the way things

47
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,199
are you have the capacity to allow things to

48
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:30,400
be and there might be some sense of contentment some sense of goodness in

49
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:37,080
realizing that we don't need to tamper with our experience that in our

50
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,800
meditation we can just allow

51
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:12,599
when you feel ready connecting with the breath or your other primary

52
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:21,039
anchor and allowing yourself to settle on the home base

53
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:35,800
to connect with the felt sense of

54
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:42,840
breathing we'll take some time now to collect and gather the

55
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,800
Mind allow ourselves to

56
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
settle

57
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
e

58
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
e

59
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
e

60
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
e

61
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
e

62
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
e

63
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

64
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

65
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,279
e e

66
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,120
we'll let go of the focus on the breath [Music]

67
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:40,440
now and widen the aperture of our awareness and of widening the spotlight

68
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:47,839
uh so we can see the whole body can take in the whole body at a

69
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:01,040
glance so we have a general sense of the body

70
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:10,279
and within it we might feel Sensations sparkling coming and

71
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,560
going tingling movement

72
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:35,279
and as you feel these different Sensations in different areas of the

73
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:43,279
body you might ask can I control these

74
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:58,680
Sensations just dropping the question in and letting it Ripple through

75
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,000
can I control these

76
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:25,440
Sensations and I control when this body sickens or ages

77
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:44,320
can I control when this body sickens or ages

78
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,519
the sensations that are presently arising and

79
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:13,120
changing did I create these

80
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,440
Sensations did I create these Sensations

81
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,680
there's a strong relationship between our sense of control and our sense of

82
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:12,040
identification can we see whether we're in charge of what happens in this body

83
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:46,000
is there any specific place in the body that the sense of self

84
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,880
resides and you might

85
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:04,439
investigate look for yourself is there a specific specific place in the body that the sense of self

86
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:14,558
resides where the sense of me I me and mine sense of

87
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:20,558
I a sense of me where does it reside

88
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:59,559
often people report that the strongest sense of self seems to reside behind the eyes

89
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:04,720
the top of the head in the

90
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:13,039
brain and yet if we investigate that area of the body the space behind the

91
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,720
eyes can we find a self there

92
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,880
being with whatever we find in a soft open

93
00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:03,159
way not judging or

94
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:06,480
interpreting just

95
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:27,600
noticing when you're ready returning to the Breath Again settling and

96
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
stabilizing

97
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,679
e e

98
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:39,559
shift the attention now to the emergence of thoughts letting go of the

99
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:46,159
breath and instead imagining something like a blank

100
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:51,240
screen in the mind like a movie theater

101
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:58,039
screen and we're sitting on the edge of the mind watching this screen to see if

102
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:07,159
we can see see a thought emerge so see if you can notice the

103
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:15,639
first thought that arises on the screen after I finish this sentence

104
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:55,200
then letting go of any thinking connecting with a few breaths

105
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:14,760
again imagining this blank screen sitting on the edge of the mind

106
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:21,760
uh seeing if you can watch a thought arise see if you can notice the first

107
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:27,520
thought that appears on the screen after I finish this

108
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,520
sentence e

109
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:07,320
you might watch out for sneaky thoughts like wow there aren't any thoughts

110
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:13,919
coming or thoughts like uh I'm not very good at

111
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,000
this or this is

112
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:26,480
fascinating there's no need to stop these thoughts uh instead just know them as

113
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,919
thoughts not getting lost in the

114
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:46,000
content on your own time uh continuing this practice of bringing up the blank

115
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,799
screen and waiting for a thought arise maybe waiting to watch a few thoughts

116
00:23:52,799 --> 00:24:01,120
arise before returning to the breath to stabilize and doing it

117
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,600
again it's often not easy to see thoughts so if this doesn't feel

118
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:13,320
available to you it's fine just to stay with a

119
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:24,480
breath if you're continuing to observe thoughts you might notice that some are

120
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:32,480
loud and clear While others might be faint barely

121
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,480
noticeable try to catch the very moment a thought

122
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:49,000
arises you might notice is the thought made of words or

123
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,880
pictures is it spoken and if so does it have a tone of

124
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:03,720
voice can you get to know uh what a thought is made

125
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
of

126
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

127
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

128
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,240
e e

129
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:37,240
when we see thoughts clearly as

130
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:45,360
thoughts over time we begin to devest them of their power over

131
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:55,600
us we have more agency to choose which thoughts we want to act on and which we

132
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,600
don't

133
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:10,480
rather than so strongly identifying with thoughts we can skillfully employ

134
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,440
them and let go of the

135
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,120
rest e

136
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,519
welcome welcome back again my name is May

137
00:29:53,519 --> 00:30:00,000
Elliot and here we are continuing on our theme of the three

138
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,559
characteristics uh with today's focus on anata or not

139
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:14,519
self and while it can be relatively easy to see impermanence to see change um and

140
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:19,799
we can certainly sense what suffering is like uh so the first two

141
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:24,880
characteristics little more available teachings on not

142
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:32,360
self um maybe a little less except ible my hope is just to provide an

143
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:38,000
introduction if uh if this teaching doesn't make sense or doesn't quite land

144
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,600
um just let it wash over you and give it

145
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:49,840
time and I should also note that my my intention in sharing these teachings um

146
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:55,519
isn't to get you to believe there's no self um this isn't about you needing to

147
00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:01,519
believe anything and I'm actually not even to here to tell you that there's no

148
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:08,919
self um in the sutas uh the Buddha was asked Point uh point blank is there a

149
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:17,200
self or no self and he actually refused to answer um he he wasn't interested in

150
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:24,519
getting hung up on philosophical views um in perpetuating beliefs um

151
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:30,279
instead not to teachings they point us to towards investigating what we

152
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:36,240
identify with as a means of reducing suffering so this term not self this

153
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,080
translation of a Nat not self um it can be used to investigate our

154
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:48,320
experience uh so for example um is this emotion who I really

155
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:57,159
am well uh okay this um this emotion it comes and goes so that's not self uh is

156
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:03,880
my career Who I Really Am is my my job title or my role well that

157
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:11,279
changes you know when I come home from work so that's not self uh is my physical appearance who I

158
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:17,600
am well that changes too I'm not in control of that uh so that's not self

159
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,159
either so all of these things change um so what we find is that we can't quite

160
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:28,200
put a finger on uh any fixed unchanging

161
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:36,360
core within us that we can call I me or mine so we can use anata teachings as a

162
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:42,480
means to explore uh what we identify with to see what we take as a self and

163
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:51,279
to invite us to to to look a little closer so our our standard view of

164
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:56,720
ourselves is that I am a specific individual that is in control of

165
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:05,039
experience and and this self persists through time in other words um uh the standard

166
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:10,240
view of of ourselves is that there's a continuous me moving through time and

167
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:17,519
space that's kind of like the given um however uh when we in when we

168
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:23,559
investigate the nature of self when we look a little closer uh we see there

169
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:30,559
isn't a solid permanent fixed thing that we can call me or M uh what we call our

170
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:36,200
s is much more amorphous than we typically when than we typically think

171
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:42,320
uh and much more difficult to pin down and when we see this uh when we see

172
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,000
this really clearly we can feel a lot more

173
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,760
free so when I talked uh when I talked about anicha a few days ago and I talked about

174
00:33:53,760 --> 00:34:00,639
impermanence uh I shared that impermanence insight into impermanence is one of the inroads to the other two

175
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:06,399
insights it's one of the inroads uh in that it opens the door to seeing

176
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:12,560
unsatisfactoriness suffering and to seeing not self so I'd like to

177
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:21,480
extrapolate a bit on how on how impermanence uh helps us see not self um

178
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:27,000
namely uh this is because uh when we see in constancy when we see impermanence it

179
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,320
begins to erode our sense that there's a fixed self um it erodes that sense that

180
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,079
there's that you know continuous permanent me that moves through time and

181
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:44,320
space so instead um we humans were a little bit more like Rivers than a fixed

182
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:50,200
entity in other words uh we change and this change undermines that sense of of

183
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:56,240
permanent meanness um so so here's a a classic

184
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:01,560
analogy of a river um to help demonstrate what I

185
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:07,640
need so just like uh just like uh say the Mississippi River uh we humans we

186
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:12,920
have names and certain qualities right each River has its own unique nature um

187
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:18,480
you know some Rivers they're fast and clear other rivers are slow and murky uh

188
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,880
each River has a specific geographic location the banks of the river they

189
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:32,520
have some semblance of continuity uh but if we look a little closer um if

190
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:39,680
we kind of zoom in on the Mississippi River what we see is that it's just a constant flow there's actually nothing

191
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:48,040
fixed there that we can point to there's new water flowing through every millisecond so we humans uh are the same

192
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:53,520
we're like Rivers you know there's the the May Elliott River and the Gil fronal

193
00:35:53,520 --> 00:36:00,440
River and the Taylor Swift River and the doly Lama River and conventionally uh

194
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:06,079
these names are useful and important designations right and not to

195
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:12,319
teachings I want to be clear that they're not uh they're not denying that there is something here there is

196
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:18,760
something here called May Elliot uh with memories and plans and fears and stories

197
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:26,480
and preferences and not to teachings aren't discounting this yes conventionally

198
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:32,359
speaking there's a me and a you uh and it's useful and necessary to distinguish

199
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:38,520
this um it's it's useful and necessary to be able to tell the difference between this being ourselves and other

200
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:45,880
beings you know we need to still be able to care for ourselves and our responsibilities you know if I if I go

201
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:51,960
to the ER with a broken leg and you're a doctor um please don't just stand there

202
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:57,760
thinking well there's no self so I guess I can't help like that's that's wrong

203
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:04,200
you um so um so on one hand we have these important skills and designations

204
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:10,400
and qualities and personalities and we're all unique um just how a river has its own

205
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,760
unique attributes but like a river there's nothing we can point to that's

206
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:23,920
fixed um the water in the river keeps flowing and flowing and flowing um as the philosopher um

207
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:31,280
heraclitus said I we can't step in the same river twice similarly for us we're just a flow of

208
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:37,800
changing experience um we could think of um uh the water flowing pastes being

209
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:43,920
like the mindstream the waterfall of thoughts emotions physical Sensations

210
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:50,240
always changing we're just a flow and we really begin to see this in meditation

211
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,800
we begin to see this constant flow we see there isn't a fixed core you know

212
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:01,440
there's no there's no little little person sitting in the control tower pressing buttons and pulling

213
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,119
levers um we're conditioned um we begin to see that uh

214
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:14,760
we're more of a process uh than a fixed entity uh so uh so what's the impact of

215
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:21,720
this why is it useful uh so as we begin to see that

216
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:27,760
there's no solid continuous me that persists Through Time

217
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:34,280
uh we become less concerned with promoting the self or defending the self

218
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:42,560
uh less concerned with praise and blame uh with reputation or criticism so

219
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:48,400
much energy goes into trying to be seen as competent and good and

220
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,720
likable um you we can still be good we can still show up in the world in a way

221
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:59,680
that we end up being likable um but not so much energy goes into trying to

222
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:07,680
perpetuate this self story for others um so as um as craving subsides selfing

223
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:17,280
subsides and that means that suffering Falls away so as we as we consider Nat

224
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,640
teachings um please remember we're not trying to

225
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:28,160
get rid of the self that would be that would be kind of like trying to extinguish a

226
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:35,560
right there's no need to try to get rid of something uh when there's nothing fixed there to begin with um you we we

227
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:41,319
don't have insight into not self through aversion to

228
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:48,560
self so uh so please don't weaponize anata teachings um and use them kind of

229
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:53,839
as a new reason to hate your humanness that's actually um not effective we

230
00:39:53,839 --> 00:40:01,359
don't we don't get to not self through denying ourself or neglecting our needs or boundaries um we're not destroying

231
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:07,520
the self but instead we could say we're we are ennobling the self we're studying

232
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:12,599
the self and it's through that study of the self that we see through

233
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:21,960
it uh so we could say instead this is a practice about love about careful loving

234
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:28,200
attention so on one hand uh I care for this being called May

235
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:33,920
uh May Elliot and on the other hand when I look closer I see that this being is

236
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,480
ever changing and it's not fixed it's it flows like a river and this Insight

237
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,319
provides a lot of

238
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:54,240
freedom so uh having uh very lightly touched on insight into

239
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:00,240
anata I'd like to zoom back out uh to look at this week um this week's

240
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:05,280
teachings as a whole we talked about um we talked about

241
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,319
samadi concentration and how how samadi

242
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:18,680
uh stabilizes the mind how it helps to quiet the Blizzard of the mind so we can see clearly enough to see the three

243
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:24,480
characteristics um uh but I want to be clear that insight into the three

244
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:31,680
characteristics um it's not an end in itself but rather it facilitates letting

245
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:38,920
go um uh when we talk about letting go what we're letting go of is our greed

246
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:48,240
hatred and delusion the cesas the three poisons uh we're letting go of our craving our aversion our confusion um so

247
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:55,480
this form of Letting Go it doesn't mean we can't respond to suffering in ourselves or suffering in the world um

248
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:00,520
on the contrary when when greed aversion and delusion

249
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:07,720
subside qualities like love kindness compassion generosity uh they can emerge

250
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:12,880
in powerful transformative ways so the form of Letting Go that

251
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:20,760
we're practicing is one that relieves suffering and it actually makes more room for skillful compassionate response

252
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:27,480
it makes us more available to respond to harm and Injustice in the world

253
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:33,119
and and sometimes it's said that the most powerful way to be in service is

254
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:39,200
when we can get out of our own way so this is one way that uh seeing

255
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,440
through the self can provide so much more freedom uh not just for ourselves

256
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:53,160
but for others as well this is a a a short piece of a poem

257
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:59,880
by Mary Oliver uh to live in this world you must be able to do three

258
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:06,119
things to love what is Mortal to hold it against your bones

259
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:12,280
knowing your own life depends on it and when the time comes to Let It

260
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,920
Go to Let It

261
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:27,319
Go so uh if this possibility is inspiring for you the possibility of uh

262
00:43:27,319 --> 00:43:33,480
deepening uh insight into the three characteristics of uh freedom from

263
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:40,359
suffering uh I have a practical suggestion for you uh and you may have already employed this suggestion in your

264
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:45,800
life um but I'd like to suggest that you consider silent Retreat

265
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:52,359
practice um so uh Insight can certainly occur in daily life and if you're

266
00:43:52,359 --> 00:43:58,520
available to sit a a silent Meditation Retreat um it can be really fruitful for

267
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:04,480
depth of insight um so if you'd like to deepen in this way um if you want to

268
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:10,119
provide these the supportive conditions for insight um you might try a retreat

269
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:15,640
