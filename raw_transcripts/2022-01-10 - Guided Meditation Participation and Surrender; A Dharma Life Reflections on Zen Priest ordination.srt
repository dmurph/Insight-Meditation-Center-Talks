1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:08,080
so good morning my friends

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,799
and uh things are a little bit different today than usual i'm not at imc i'm at our retreat center

3
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:20,400
in irc insight retreat center and also it is my

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,840
today is the 40th anniversary of when i was ordained as a zen priest

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:32,320
so i thought i would like to mark this day and um so

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,640
we'll do a meditation as usual and then instead of continuing with the satipatana series i

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,920
thought i'd pause with that and kind of mark this uh occasion that's it's

8
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,160
important for me um in uh been talking a little bit about that for me they or

9
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,640
my my dharma life so that's the kind of the difference for today

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,239
and so

11
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,640
one of the things that

12
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,360
one of the ways in which my zen training unfolded

13
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,960
was that at certain point the practice was one of learning how to participate in

14
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,560
life how to really put myself into my whatever i was doing and

15
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,240
in zen training a lot of it was um practice was also in work and activities

16
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:41,280
and so sweeping to really participate in the sweeping be really there for it

17
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,759
i i did my first uh three-month training period in zen sanding um

18
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,520
those platforms in which all the monks were meditating meditating on in so i

19
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,240
have kind of my initial training in zen and participating practicing with sanding

20
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,159
wholeheartedly standing so participating and then

21
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,720
um and then at some point it switched to rather than participation it became

22
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:20,879
a non-resistance just get out of the way um maybe some people would say to um

23
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,800
to open up but um maybe that's a little bit too

24
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:35,400
neutral the idea was uh it was still participating but now rather than me

25
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,720
applying myself engaging myself it was more like engaging was happening and the life was

26
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,680
happening and now it was getting out of the way uh having no resistance to it

27
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,160
and so this participating fully in life but just not resisting life

28
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:04,239
i trained to do in the monastery in outside of meditation and then in meditation

29
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:11,440
and so as we sit uh today in the sati patana series it's

30
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,040
experiencing the whole body and what a great thing to mark this

31
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,480
practice of participation and we participate with our whole body

32
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,799
when we participate fully in life what else what else that's the medium that's the

33
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,400
the the the matter with which we can

34
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:41,599
participate in life is with our whole body very different than with our whole mind only

35
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:48,480
and then participating and feeling and getting out of the way and allowing ourselves to experience life

36
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,080
all of life in the way that is three-dimensional multi-dimensional from

37
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:01,120
uh all the different senses all the different capacities for attention uh that we have

38
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,439
so to assume a posture

39
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:13,599
of participation with meditation

40
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,799
so if you're going to bring all of your body all of your posture

41
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,199
with you to participate in meditation

42
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,120
so it's not not no part of your body is passive

43
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,759
but is alert is present

44
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,759
like if some important person for you walked into the room and you would sit up straight and really be

45
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,639
present like now you're going to now you're going to be attentive

46
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,840
and then to lower your gaze maybe 45 degrees to the floor

47
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,199
letting your eyes rest the gaze of your eyes rest

48
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,360
not trying to look at anything in particular

49
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,680
and then to gently close your eyes

50
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:37,039
in the practice that we often do here of breathing in deeply isip is a practice of participation

51
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,560
to breathe in deeply into your body the whole torso expands stretches shoulders

52
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,960
lift as you did breathe in deeply

53
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,639
and then a certain kind of surrender into the body into life

54
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,840
through your body in the exhale

55
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,960
breathing in deeply connecting to this life

56
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,400
exhaling surrendering to this life

57
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:24,720
the lived life of the moment not the life that you can think about

58
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,400
anticipate remember

59
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,759
but the lived life

60
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:50,639
and then to let your breathing return to normal

61
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,639
and every sensation you have in your body

62
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,319
is there because you're alive when you're dead your body has no

63
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:19,120
sensations it's kind of like proof that you're alive that you have sensations

64
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,960
even if they're uncomfortable

65
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:35,840
as you breathe in feel the life of your belly

66
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,080
and as you exhale relax

67
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,840
surrender to the belly

68
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:10,599
on the inhale feel your chest your upper torso

69
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:20,240
and as you exhale relax your upper chest your torso

70
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,840
perhaps surrendering to the lift life

71
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,440
that expresses itself through your chest

72
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:53,080
on the inhale feeling your sensations of your face

73
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,640
generously openly allowingly feel your face

74
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,080
and as you exhale relax

75
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:14,160
surrender your face giving up your

76
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,240
public face how you feel like you need to

77
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:27,600
present yourself to the world let your face have a break

78
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,279
deep relaxation as you exhale

79
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,959
and then the same with the mind maybe in the area of your brain your

80
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:56,560
forehead anywhere you tend to feel the mind

81
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,920
feel it as you inhale

82
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,680
and as you exhale relax your mind soften

83
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,920
see if you can soften any ways in which you're driving your mind

84
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,160
pushing it along with your desires and wants and fears

85
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:43,200
surrender your fears your desires

86
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,720
so you can better participate

87
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:56,519
through your body in this moment-to-moment lived life

88
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,800
and then settling down into the body breathing

89
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,319
either participating in this experience or breathing

90
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,160
or surrendering to your breathing

91
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:05,120
the live life of the body breathing

92
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,240
one breath at a time

93
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,079
just the inhale when you're inhaling

94
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,079
just the exhale as you exhale

95
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,720
so then as we come to the end of this sitting

96
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:47,200
may the intention of this practice that we've done

97
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,600
may the dedication the effort

98
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:00,480
be for the welfare be dedicated to the welfare and happiness of

99
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:06,159
others may it be that we practice in such a way

100
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:12,080
that we help reduce suffering in this world for ourselves

101
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:20,159
for those that we know in the whole world we live in a world where there is

102
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:26,880
incalculable suffering and we live in a heart

103
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:33,360
that has an incalculable capacity to love for compassion

104
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,480
and may it be that our care compassion our love

105
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:47,120
grows through this practice day by day week by week year by year

106
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:53,279
may our compassion grow so that our care

107
00:28:53,279 --> 00:29:01,679
our participation in life is for the welfare and happiness of all

108
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:10,159
may all beings be happy may all beings be safe

109
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,159
may all beings be peaceful

110
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,880
and may all beings be free

111
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:30,000
and may we live a life that contributes to that or at the very least

112
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,398
doesn't contribute to more suffering

113
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,880
so warm greetings to everyone and

114
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:32,320
today i'm going to mark the 40th anniversary of having having

115
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:39,440
been ordained as a zen priest so it's a little pause in our series on sati patana

116
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,720
and um and uh

117
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:52,080
it's a i feel very kind of fortunate to certainly to

118
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:58,480
reach this 40th anniversary and spent these 40 years in the dharma

119
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:05,760
practicing and teaching but also the fact that i'm here at insight

120
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:11,760
retreat center is also very special that this also is a

121
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,960
part of the wonderful dharma life that i've been able to

122
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:22,960
be graced by or blessed by that to have this wonderful retreat center that uh

123
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,480
to practice in and be on retreat in and to teach in

124
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:34,559
to to be able to open the doors of the center to so many people to come and practice

125
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:40,080
here and then coincidentally

126
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:48,559
this the reason i'm here is that we have a two-day retreat for

127
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:56,399
our teacher training imc started its very own teacher training back in april

128
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:01,519
and in the past people who got trained in our tradition kind of got trained

129
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:07,279
through spirit rock or inside meditation center and and so here they were started their own

130
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:13,960
training for 15 people and

131
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,840
and um and it's kind of special to kind of a culmination of 40 years of

132
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:25,600
dharma practice more than more than 40 years 45 years or more

133
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:32,960
that come to the wonderful circumstance of training others to be full teachers

134
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:39,120
and uh so all this comes together being at irc my anniversary of my order nation and

135
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:46,000
and teacher training that i feel so fortunate to be able to do so i wanted to market

136
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,279
so 40 years ago i was ordained with two other zen

137
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:57,519
students victoria austin and gary mcnabb and i felt very

138
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:03,120
fortunate to know them both and um both of them dedicated their life to

139
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,640
um the practice for them in their case zen practice and

140
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:14,399
and the life of a what became a priest and i say became because

141
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:20,559
uh at the san francisco zen center where it was ordained at uh at the time of my ordination it was

142
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:27,279
called the monk ordination and the word monk being used both for male and female

143
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:32,640
and um to a monastic ordination and that's what i uh

144
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,960
what was thought i was doing was ordaining as a monk and i knew that it was you know there

145
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:44,480
was a track to become a teacher someday but uh there were so many other

146
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,399
monks priests ordained people at zen center when i was there that i calculated that um

147
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:57,600
it'd be something like 25 years before my turn to move up into even just the very beginning uh teaching roles or to

148
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,960
be trained as a teacher but i wasn't i wasn't being ordained to be a teacher i was

149
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:10,000
ordained to be a monk and to my surprise a few months after i was ordained the abbott

150
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:17,358
decided that to stop calling the ordination a monk ordination monastic ordination but rather a priest

151
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:22,560
or the nation and maybe partly because in um

152
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:29,839
traditionally in buddhism monastics are celibate and in japanese soto zen there's no rule of celibacy so there can

153
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:35,118
be marriage and sexual relationships

154
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:42,638
and uh maybe that's one of the reasons but also um there's a way in which the zen priest

155
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:49,599
is a life it's a little bit of life that's in the world in all kinds of ways and uh

156
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:55,839
participating in uh all the different aspects of life and in a way that sometimes uh traditional because

157
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:02,240
monastics hold themselves a little bit apart from the world and um participating in like a small

158
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:07,599
example would be that monastics are not allowed to marry people and zen priests

159
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:14,160
are so just it kind of represents a little bit that's that distinction

160
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:21,680
and um but what it represents for me this uh ordination and is that um one of the things is that

161
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:28,240
every time that i uh in my life and my adult life where i

162
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:34,320
chose the dharma the chose the dharma practice over any other possibilities

163
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:41,839
that it always worked out fantastically wonderfully i could never have imagined how well it was going to work out

164
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:50,560
and and um there were even times where i had almost no money and living a poor life

165
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:57,520
and um as a practitioner and um where i thought the reasonable thing to do was to go find work

166
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:03,040
and uh and but i was saying no i you know i even had a job lined up

167
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:09,760
once and then i said nope that's not what i'm dedicated to my life is dedicated to the practice and

168
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:15,119
and come with me that's what i'm gonna do and

169
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:21,839
so and then periodically you know it just became clear that this dharma path was opening up in

170
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:28,560
front of me the decision to become a monastic to be ordained

171
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:34,000
wasn't exactly a conscious decision or reasoned decision

172
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,720
i was sitting at the monastery monastery looking at the creek that runs through it and

173
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:46,079
reflecting about my life and what i should do with it and what direction to go

174
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:52,240
and and there was like lightning went through my body and

175
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:57,599
suddenly i just knew that i was going to be ordained and generally i'm a person who does

176
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:03,680
things for reasons and uh kind of a rational person perhaps

177
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:09,760
tried to be or something and and so then um afterwards i thought of

178
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:16,160
reasons uh for that and the reasons were sincere but the the

179
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:22,800
the decision was not reasoned it was just a deep knowing like suddenly i just knew

180
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,839
that this is what i was doing and one of the reasons i i gave myself

181
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:33,839
was ahead was that i wanted to live a life that responded

182
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:39,440
responded to the suffering of the world at the deepest place of suffering

183
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:45,520
and the only thing that i knew in life up until that point that somehow was able to touch the deepest places of

184
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,800
suffering in myself and in other people was buddhist practice

185
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,400
i didn't necessarily think that that was the only way to do it but that's the only thing that i knew

186
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:02,000
and i wanted to dedicate my life to responding to suffering at its deepest

187
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,440
level i i was gonna i was going to go

188
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,880
back to go to graduate school to study soil conservation

189
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,560
and i wanted to go support and help the world by you know

190
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:24,800
doing erosion control different places in the world where there was a real serious problem

191
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:31,200
and but i felt that somehow there was something inside of me that as important

192
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,560
as that work would have been it wouldn't have reached into the depth

193
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:42,800
of the human heart where suffering really lies at the core and i didn't know if i'd be effective as

194
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,240
a someone who somehow touch that people or supported people to but i wanted to

195
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:55,359
be in an environment that that's what the environment is for and to support it and my image of my long-term image of

196
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:03,040
myself with uh as a zen priest was uh to have a little neighborhood

197
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:10,800
storefront meditation center uh just a little maybe a one room storefront kind of thing and my job was

198
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:17,040
to open at the key keep the place clean and open up and allow people come and meditate

199
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,240
and that was you know that was kind of well i wasn't much more

200
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:29,680
thoughtful about what i was going to do in the long term than doing that but then i had this wonderful life of um

201
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:35,359
things just kept unfolding after i was ordained and even things that were

202
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:41,440
tragic for many people somehow kept opening up to

203
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:49,359
you know going further and further in the practice and that's one of the tragic thing was that the abbott of the zen center

204
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:55,359
had an abbott's uh ethical scandal and he left and it was devastating to

205
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:01,040
many people but uh i was invited by someone to go to japan

206
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:07,280
and and um my father actually he was working in japan

207
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:13,440
he said when you want to come to japan and and just coincidental it was coincidental with this uh

208
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,720
dabbit leaving and i said oh sure i'd like to continue my zen training in

209
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:24,400
japan and and so then i went to japan for a while but in order to stay in japan i had to

210
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:31,680
go to thailand to get a new visa and in thailand i discovered this practice we do here vipassana practice

211
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:37,119
and that opened up wonderfully for me and that then it continued for a while this dual track of

212
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:42,319
both zen and vipassanan and that's still a dual track

213
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:49,440
and the zen is very important for me still it's a kind of orientation or provides

214
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,960
kind of a fundamental i don't know religious orientation for

215
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:00,800
myself and and it's an orientation of participation in the world

216
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:07,040
of being fully present in this world practicing in the world

217
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:12,160
and as a place to be free and then

218
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:17,680
the vipassana practice is equally deep and valuable for me and um

219
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,838
and that is a practice of

220
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:29,850
deconstructing the world in a very deep way to discover the deeper

221
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:35,119
[Music] potential capacities we have for freedom

222
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:41,200
and this wonderful synergy of these two of uh vipassana allowing for really a depth

223
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:46,960
of deconstruction of seeing through the the condition

224
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:54,000
the world the conditioned world that we live in and the constructed world and really open up to greater and greater

225
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:01,280
capacities for freedom and then and then learning participation learning to give yourself to the world

226
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,960
enter the world and and uh participate with that freedom

227
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:13,440
one of the teachings or ideas in zen that was very

228
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:19,680
um influential in me was the idea that

229
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:26,880
we express our practice that practice our understanding the depth of our practice within us how we

230
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:32,720
mature in the practice is something not just to kind of be in enlightened retirement but it's

231
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:39,760
something that is expressed or enacted or um in the uh there was this uh

232
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:46,400
person many years ago who heard all these buddhists kept talking about practice practice practice

233
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:52,800
practice what kind of practice do you do i'm going to retreat to practice i'm practicing the word practice is

234
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,160
used very very quickly and a lot in our scene and the person heard all this and he

235
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:03,280
said um you guys all all you ever talk about is practicing

236
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,800
when's the performance and um so is then the idea that it's

237
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:14,079
you're you're you live the life of the performance so it's how you enact how you express

238
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:20,160
your understanding that um is the fulfillment of it

239
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:25,599
and um and uh and for me the

240
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:31,280
to the combination that the vipassana teaching freedom and zen teaching

241
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:37,760
living that in our life that's a duel and that for me those are these dual tracks

242
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:43,920
that were so important and it's not inherent that one is just one way and one is the other way it's

243
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:50,319
just that's the way that these two lessons came through to me and i'm very grateful for it

244
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:56,640
and i feel so fortunate to be able to live this dharma life and

245
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:02,079
and find my practice in everything i do

246
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:08,160
and you know so i have this fortune of being able to teach like teach here to all of you on

247
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:13,599
youtube and which is a kind of little bit of a manifestation of my practice but it

248
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:19,040
comes around is that it's also the place that i want when i'm teaching it's also the place

249
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:25,599
where i practice it isn't that this is only an expression of whatever practice

250
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:31,599
i have but also i see it as this is the location

251
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:37,359
for practice when i'm teaching so i'm tracking myself and noticing what's happening inside of me

252
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:43,200
and my thoughts my feelings my body kind of being present for the whole show

253
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:48,319
so that um so that it is a practice them tracking myself and

254
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:55,839
mindful of what's happening so that um i keep discovering um more freedom or more

255
00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:02,839
depth or more fullness more participation more getting out of the way of this

256
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:08,800
life so um and someone i saw in the chat earlier

257
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,720
asked me for my what my zen name is my ordination name it um

258
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:21,440
in japanese it's a you know japanese name ryuke kojon

259
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,880
spelled r y u g e and that's one word in the second word

260
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:33,359
is kojon k o j u n and the way that the

261
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:37,920
the abbatu gave me the name he

262
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:44,880
translated as a dragon tusk

263
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:52,000
sunlight revere and so one of those names is supposed to

264
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,480
represents how you are when you're ordained and the other is supposed to represent your potential what you can become

265
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:05,359
so i don't know which is which um but uh it's kind of a little bit of a

266
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:12,880
nice i hopefully nice uh pairing these two words ideas dragon tusk it sounds a little bit

267
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:20,960
ferocious and so maybe i'm a little bit dangerous and uh but then the sunlight revere

268
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:27,119
and so that was the name i was given and

269
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:32,160
my pali name i call i you know you get lots of names in buddhism sometimes

270
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:39,040
and my pali name for this in the theravan vipassana world where i teach is uh dhamma dasa

271
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:45,440
and that means a servant of the dharma so both the zen ordination being a zen

272
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:51,520
priest and being a vipassana teacher and practitioner i feel very much that i'm a servant for

273
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:56,560
the dharma and i love serving it and supporting it and

274
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:03,359
letting it grow in our hearts and and spreading across the lands so

275
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:10,680
thank you so then tomorrow i'll be back at imc and we'll continue with the sati patana
