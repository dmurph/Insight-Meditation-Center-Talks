1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:15,139
so good morning Welcome to our meditation

2
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:23,820
and one of the areas we're navigating we meditate

3
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:30,000
is our interests both intentional interests but also

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,559
unintentional and I think a big part of

5
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:45,000
the terrain of mindfulness meditation is navigating the mind's interests when

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,020
they're different than our own so if you're distracted

7
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:58,260
about something that happened long ago your mind is interested in long ago if

8
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,440
it's planning the future your mind is interested in playing the future

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,479
and if it's in the present maybe if something troubles you

10
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:16,580
and so the mind is even if you want to excuse me for a moment

11
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,040
even if you want to uh

12
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,780
be interested in your breathing or in the meditation your mind keeps going into your troubles

13
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:45,840
and part of meditation is to start becoming disinterested in some things

14
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,720
and to Value the process of this interesting this interestation becoming

15
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,299
disinterested and um I do appreciate this is part of it's

16
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,880
almost like a natural process so for example as we get more centered

17
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,119
focused comfortable delighted with being meditating

18
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:15,480
then um then naturally the interest will go towards is good the goodness of

19
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,540
meditation and will become less interested in other things

20
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:27,000
if the meditation is difficult then it's a little bit more difficult to become disinterested for things have more

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,580
interest for meditation as we become wiser in meditation wiser

22
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:40,200
in practice the wisdom guides are interest and the wisdom has some sense of the

23
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,480
significant the value of becoming a disinterested in some things

24
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,720
and so this natural process of becoming more and more disinterested in things which don't serve us don't help us

25
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,660
become stronger and we become more the wisdom teaches us oh even though

26
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:03,599
it's difficult meditation even though there's challenges it's really Wise It's really good to be

27
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,480
interested to be present but these experiences so this whole idea of it's a one way of

28
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,700
understanding all this is navigating interest so for this meditation I'd like to

29
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:20,900
suggest that another distinction

30
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:28,620
we can have troubles in our lives or troubles with ourselves within ourselves

31
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:34,800
and then we can be troubled by it so I can be troubled

32
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,799
by a car one of my troubles might be a I have a car for example that it's not the

33
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,739
case but a car that needs to be repaired and that's just a trouble that the issue

34
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:52,080
a topic that has to be addressed I can be troubled by it I can feel

35
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,540
stressed by it I can feel afraid I can feel preoccupied I could feel angry all

36
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:03,420
kinds of ways in which I I feel troubled by it

37
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:11,459
one of the things to become disinterested in is how we feel troubled

38
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:16,979
we might be troubled by what goes on inside of ourselves our thoughts our feelings our emotions our judgments

39
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:23,040
about ourselves but the thoughts are one thing

40
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,340
being troubled by it is something else and to sit and meditate and lose

41
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:35,400
interest in how we feel troubled we still can be aware of it mindful of

42
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:40,500
it but don't not to invest energy belief

43
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:49,699
Authority um importance in this feeling of feeling troubled

44
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:55,139
because if we invest in it it gets stronger it persists

45
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:02,280
and learning to become less and less interested in the

46
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:08,940
feeling of being troubled and more interested in our experience as

47
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:14,580
it is in the Simplicity of what it is is one of the ways in which this

48
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:21,600
meditation can deepen so

49
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,520
assuming a meditation posture

50
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:37,940
and gently close your eyes and maybe you're troubled by what I said

51
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:47,479
so there's a lot of thoughts and feelings reactions so you're welcome to those

52
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:55,880
I certainly don't want to take those away from you you know

53
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,400
without you choosing to do so for yourself

54
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:08,720
but if you recognize that whatever troubles you at this moment

55
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,660
the subjective experience of feeling troubled

56
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:20,960
maybe you can switch your interests with your orientation

57
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:28,080
so that feeling doesn't influence how you bring attention now

58
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,520
to your body breathing

59
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,520
so your interest now goes into

60
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,380
how your body is experiencing breathing at this moment

61
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,360
every day we breathe slightly differently

62
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,400
relaxing being interested in how you can relax

63
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,020
your body your mind

64
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
softening

65
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:43,440
letting go of any thinking that takes you away from the present

66
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:50,180
moment takes you away from mindfully mindfully breathing

67
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:56,580
and if there's any gentle quiet thinking

68
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:03,139
that guides you to staying with your breathing staying in the present

69
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:13,680
let those thoughts encourage a greater quieting settling

70
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,040
you don't have to let go of those thoughts

71
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,260
foreign

72
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,600
foreign

73
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:50,639
might it be all right to lose interest

74
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,560
in your distracting thoughts

75
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,100
thank you

76
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:30,020
what is your mind interested in

77
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,940
what desires might be behind those interests

78
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:56,240
is there a way of letting go of interest in your desires

79
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,980
so you're more fully present here

80
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:13,580
and as we come to the end of the sitting

81
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:20,940
to turn your interest outwards to the world around you

82
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:26,340
to the people who are nearest to you and wherever you're

83
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:31,980
meditating maybe someone else meditating with you or someone else in the house or

84
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,700
neighbor

85
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:44,400
an outward Beyond to the cave the county The Province and

86
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:50,520
which you're in colleagues

87
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:57,440
co-workers out across the lens

88
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:06,480
to be interested but in a particular way to be interested in their welfare and

89
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:14,240
their well-being to be interested in with kindness

90
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,960
and respect

91
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:27,840
and is there something about having meditated for half an hour

92
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:35,340
being maybe a little more calm or settled that allows you your respect for others

93
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:41,779
your kindness to others be more embodied

94
00:28:41,779 --> 00:28:45,679
emotionally Fuller

95
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:58,100
not a casual impulse of the moment but something that's maybe

96
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,360
embodied Within

97
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:13,440
and this interest in kindness and care and Welfare

98
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:21,559
perhaps in your own mind silently you can repeat these words as a way of

99
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,639
giving voice to what's Within

100
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,799
giving voice so it spreads out across the lands

101
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,898
may all beings be happy

102
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:46,039
may all beings be safe

103
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:54,140
may all beings be peaceful

104
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,940
may all beings be free

105
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:11,120
and may my care and kindness for others

106
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,159
stay with me as I go through the day

107
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:35,740
[Music]

108
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:51,299
so here we are the second day of this

109
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:56,399
series on the insight pentad

110
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:01,799
and um these pentads of yesterday last week and

111
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:10,679
this week the gladness pentaton the insight pentaton are descriptions of a natural unfolding

112
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:17,159
in Buddhist practice and meditation practice so first there's the idea that we don't

113
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:22,820
have to be the and always in the driver's seat of our meditation always controlling it making it happen

114
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:28,860
measuring it doing it to kind of you know writing writing close and tight

115
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:35,340
and there's a time and place where we want to kind of allow a natural process to

116
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:40,679
unfold that unfolds better if we start giving up control

117
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:48,000
and allow something to happen but that giving up control and allowing happens what best happens when there's

118
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,279
already some centeredness in the present moment so momentum of being focused here

119
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:58,740
at present that them that there's very little tendency to get distracted

120
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:04,200
and a lot of tendency a lot of interest in being really connected to our

121
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:12,659
experience connected to the breathing and um so uh because if this if there's a kind

122
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:17,820
of a um if this momentum exists within us of

123
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:25,980
being present then letting go and giving up control we're letting go into that momentum and

124
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:33,539
something can begin happening but without some opening and allowing something to happen there's no room for

125
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:39,779
it to happen sometimes if we're you know trying to trying to always trying to operate from our control and desires and

126
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:45,380
all that so uh with time

127
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:52,320
as we said settle in there's Insight we see something really

128
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:58,679
clearly and exactly what we see varies from person to person and classically one of

129
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:05,039
the key things to see is how changing our experiences Moment by moment

130
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:10,980
and we can't hold on to it we just kind of allow allow for the changing nature of it

131
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:17,039
uh some people don't understand why this is so significant and some people have other insights so

132
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:23,940
their understandings that are key as we kind of kind of keep unfolding so what's interesting to see

133
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:28,980
is uh what these insights lead to if we would the kind of insights we're looking

134
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:34,799
for lead us in a certain direction and open to something

135
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:41,039
and if we understand what they're opening to then we can look back and see personal understanding of all the

136
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:47,039
different things that might support all the kind of insights that might support that opening

137
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:52,279
and um and what it opens to in the is

138
00:33:52,279 --> 00:34:02,640
English is usually translated as disenchantment and um it's a kind of uh uh strong

139
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:08,878
disinterest in continuing with some of the business as usual some of the usual things that

140
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:15,800
are mind heart does and um so a disenchantment a disinterest

141
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:21,599
a kind of a healthy uh you know enough already and I've done this and this and

142
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,700
I've done this enough kind of a certain healthy kind of wariness or tiredness or

143
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:33,599
uh yeah God this is you know enough already uh and it can happen for example if in

144
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:40,158
meditation say for you meditate every every morning for half an hour and after

145
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:48,179
252 days you realize that every morning um you are obsessing about lottery

146
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:53,940
numbers and that's all you think about so you get to the 253 days and you

147
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:59,940
realize wait a minute a good part of this last year I've been thinking about lottery numbers

148
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:06,839
to no avail it doesn't help me win any lottery I haven't been had a single accurate number in any Lottery anywhere

149
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:12,960
in the planet and I'm spending an inordinate amount of my time in meditation thinking about lotteries let

150
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,900
alone outside of it you know maybe uh it's enough already I

151
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:24,839
feel tired from all this thinking and figuring and calculating I do with meditation and I'm you know I'm really

152
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:31,560
getting tired of this now and so there's a disenchantment a disinterest maybe a person hasn't won any lotteries and so

153
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:37,260
there's a real there was they were so enchanted and so entranced for the possibility that of what would happen if

154
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:42,619
they won the lottery and so after after 253 days of this that finally the person

155
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:48,900
starts becoming disinterested disenchanted with um maybe they start

156
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:55,560
falling out of the trance of instant wealth that maybe the lottery provides

157
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:02,160
so um so and we call it disenchantment I like the word disenchantment because uh

158
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:09,420
it implies that you've been Enchanted you're under the spell of something and we can be under the spell of our

159
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:17,040
desires under the spell of our fantasies under the spell of certain beliefs that if

160
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:23,040
only my partner behaves better then I'll be but then I'll have a good life if

161
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:29,579
only the if only spell there's the spell of conceit and this is

162
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:37,440
all kinds of ways in which we are overly interested or caught in ideas about how

163
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:44,839
terrible I am how wonderful I am how mediocre I am all these ways of being

164
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:50,960
entranced with that and um and so as we sit and meditate

165
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:57,119
sometimes the repetition of the same kind of thoughts and behaviors and interests we start seeing it more and

166
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:04,740
more and more clearly and we start seeing this as a high cost you know I've been resentful for 252

167
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:10,079
days you know maybe I didn't realize I was doing it every day

168
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:16,619
now that I meditate I see it and only because of their of the familiarity and seeing the regularity do

169
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:22,619
we understand the cost of daily resentment resentment meditation

170
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:29,880
and so then there starts to be a disenchantment starts to be a disinterest and um and so

171
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:36,599
the our attention or Life Energy doesn't go into those thoughts around that thing

172
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:42,359
and um and rather now it's more available for this momentum that we're talking

173
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:49,140
about in practice this momentum kind of making it getting out of the way even more for the momentum of concentration

174
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:55,619
the momentum of mindfulness attention the momentum of being more settled has a

175
00:37:55,619 --> 00:38:01,619
chance to kind of operate because we're not activating ourselves with it all

176
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:09,020
so to become disenchanted with craving disincented with ill will

177
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:17,119
disenchanted with a all kinds of fantasies we have disenchanted with conceits

178
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:23,280
self-preoccupation boy I'm always self-preoccupied some of that might be okay it's not

179
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:30,480
necessarily wrong but to see the regularity and how little it does for us how it not only doesn't benefit us it

180
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:36,960
actually sometimes deleterious for us to have this and the opportunity of meditation to sit

181
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:43,440
there quietly dignified uh valued respecting ourselves and

182
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:49,320
seeing in this kind of embodied respect and presence wow

183
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:56,480
there's a lot of nonsense in that mind I had no idea and we start maybe becoming

184
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:03,060
disenchanted disinterested and so this movement towards disinterest

185
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:08,640
and some of that comes from starting to see more clearly

186
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:15,480
the difference between events in the world and our relationship to them so as I

187
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:23,099
said earlier in the meditation we might have troubles in the world you know the car has a flat

188
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:32,040
tire that's troubling maybe or it might be a much bigger one's troubles we have maybe we have family members who are ill

189
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:37,980
and we have to care for them and it's troubling it's a trouble you know it's a trouble it's a trouble it's

190
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:46,079
a challenge it's a problem to figure out how to do it well and um so there's a the troubles and

191
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:53,460
then there's being troubled by it and just that distinction separating those twos two out

192
00:39:53,460 --> 00:40:00,119
then we can start seeing the the feeling of being troubled as being Something That We're contributing to it something

193
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:06,240
that was as subjective and arising from within us and we might not feel like we have much

194
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:13,260
choice or ability to do anything about it but when we sit and meditate regularly

195
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:19,020
I know really bring a lot of mindfulness to our experience and see how often we're troubled and

196
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:25,740
start kind of stealing getting some handle on it seeing it clearly and being able to kind of observe it not being in

197
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:32,520
it not being absorbed in it the relationship to feeling troubled

198
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:37,920
might change and we might become disinterested disenchanted with the value of feeling

199
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:43,200
troubled and some of the energy that goes into it the tension that we hold around it

200
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:48,960
begins to soften and relax and then we might discover we can take

201
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:57,119
care of the issues we have to take care of much better if we don't feel attention or the burden the weight that

202
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:03,119
comes with feeling troubled so there's all himself kind of becoming

203
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:09,180
disenchanted with some of the reactivity and responses within us to events in the

204
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:14,880
world disenchanted with the second arrows we we shoot that ourselves

205
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:21,480
so um um so

206
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,579
the idea of becoming disenchanted it's considered to be a form of wisdom

207
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:31,859
that will support the momentum and the

208
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:37,560
deepening of freedom in our lives so it has a tremendous value

209
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:44,280
and it arises out of insight into seeing something clearly and so whatever you see clearly enough

210
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:49,740
that allows for this deeper movement of disenchantment maybe that's insight for

211
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:57,180
you so the question the homework for today would be what wisdom what understanding

212
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:03,480
what Insight do you have about what's happening for you and how you react how you respond how you think how you feel

213
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:11,359
how you desire um that uh might

214
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:19,140
awaken or support a healthy disinterest disenchantment

215
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:25,578
with some of your desires some of the things you've been caught up in

216
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:32,900
give yourself some time today maybe having tea going for a walk and considering this topic of disenchantment

217
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:39,260
healthy disinterest and where how might that kind of be

218
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:47,000
evoked more more strongly so that it supports you in your life

219
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:53,180
so thank you very much and so we'll take this another step tomorrow

220
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:59,400
and to see where as this disinterest because healthy disinterest

221
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:06,839
disenchantment begins to take hold what that allows for or what we can

222
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:14,480
allow to happen next on this journey to Freedom thank you very much
