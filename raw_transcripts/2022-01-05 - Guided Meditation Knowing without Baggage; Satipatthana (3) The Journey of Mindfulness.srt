1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:08,400
well it's uh it's quite wonderful to see all the

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,440
greetings i know the chat today and all the different ways it said in

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,720
different languages and even different ways of saying it in english

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:25,359
different areas so thank you it's so wonderful to feel the richness and

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:31,760
the variety and i think every every language every

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,040
ethnicity every person is a gift and it's nice to kind of feel

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,280
the giftness of it all in one place so um

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,520
i didn't see it in my native language which is norwegian so good morning

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:57,120
and other languages that i've spoken through my life so far is italian which is a

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,559
bona matina for good morning and and french

11
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,640
bon mater and japanese ohio gozaimasu and i don't speak

12
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,960
sign language but good morning in sign language as you say the the the gesture for the sign for good

13
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,240
like that and then the sign for um morning

14
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,159
so it's uh so

15
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,719
here we are

16
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:39,280
so um we continue here on this adventure on

17
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,880
with attention i think one the whole area of buddhist practice buddhist meditation

18
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,240
is i think of it as an adventure a wonderful journey to discover

19
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,960
ever ever discover keep discovering aspects of our ability to

20
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:04,320
be conscious ability to be attentive and it's such a rich multifaceted domain

21
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,840
and and it gets richer when we start appreciating

22
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,520
the potential for awareness for attention to bring us

23
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,520
freedom to bring us peace and how to

24
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:32,560
unhook attention from our reactivity unhook our awareness

25
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,160
from our judgments and our preferences and to free

26
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:46,640
mindfulness from a certain kind of self-referencing a certain kind of self-preoccupation

27
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:53,840
and so these are some of the things we're discovering in this process and um one of the ways that this text we're

28
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,879
looking at this talks about it is in the end is uh to um

29
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:06,400
to abide not clinging to anything but to abide consciously aware

30
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,920
so for now i'd like to emphasize that um that it's a discovery process to

31
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,159
discover how knowing the simple capacity to recognize something

32
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:24,319
can be done radically in a radically simple way and that's one of the

33
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,519
stepping stones for this satipatanas mindfulness path

34
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:37,120
is to begin discovering how knowing can become simpler and simpler

35
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,440
and uh just know without the baggage that comes along without the entanglement with being for

36
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,360
or against the experience so um

37
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,000
it can at first begin to feel kind of plain and boring and dull just to know something

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,200
but as that sense of knowing gets stronger and gets developed it begins filling out and becoming

39
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,319
broader or more expansive more freeing more peaceful

40
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:15,840
more happiness producing so um

41
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,800
to um so to begin with a little exercise

42
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,440
and that is to close your eyes and bring your attention to some part of

43
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:36,639
your body that feels neutral someplace in your body where you have sensations but the sensations are not

44
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,960
particularly pleasant or unpleasant comfortable or uncomfortable

45
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,320
if they're a little bit that's fine and it could be where your

46
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:56,120
something your hands are touching could be the contact of your lips against each other

47
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:02,320
it to just find a sensation in your body that's relatively neutral

48
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:11,000
and then in the simplest way be aware of it

49
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:19,759
if you're observing it imagine that you are looking at it from above from below from the sides

50
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,840
it's kind of scanning it to feel it more fully

51
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:36,960
and then have a few moments of recognition

52
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,560
maybe it's pressure maybe it's warmth coolness

53
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,479
tingling vibration whatever it might be and if you're not sure what it is just

54
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,320
maybe recognize it as sensation

55
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,840
and then continue with this little act of recognition of what it is

56
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:12,400
and see if you can experiment with having that recognition be very simple

57
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:20,440
almost as if it creates space around the experience

58
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,120
so you're recognizing whatever the sensation is in and of itself

59
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:44,360
in terms of itself without a past or a future

60
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:55,039
without meaning and purpose and to the sensation

61
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,759
maybe even without self-reference just a sensation

62
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:24,800
and then you can also continue to know it gently simply

63
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,400
and if you use a little kind of act moment of recognition for naming it for

64
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:36,800
what it is let that recognition be like dropping a pebble in

65
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,560
a still pond and then

66
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:50,240
be there to feel the ripples to feel more fully it's like you're opening a door

67
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,840
window recognize and then feel and experience

68
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,840
the sensation more fully

69
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,160
in a peaceful mind an open mind

70
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,720
open awareness to the sensation

71
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,440
and now with the same attention

72
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:32,800
have your awareness become aware of breathing

73
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,680
wherever in your body you usually experience your breathing

74
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,959
see if you can have the same simple awareness of the sensations of breathing

75
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,040
being aware of breathing on its own terms the sensations

76
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,880
as they are not taught not how you want them to be

77
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,720
not what you're trying to accomplish

78
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:27,200
as if the sensations of breathing have permission to be there just as they

79
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,800
are they can be themselves

80
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:39,640
and you know it know the sensations of breathing

81
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,920
knowing and inhale as an inhale

82
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,560
knowing the sensations of exhale as exhale

83
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:59,120
and then also becoming becoming aware of the quality or the characteristics of

84
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:06,399
the knowing in knowing your breathing

85
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:13,240
are you in a hurry is there strain

86
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,040
are you trying to make something happen

87
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:41,480
is there some concern that something special is supposed to happen

88
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:53,760
how simple can you let your knowing be of the knowing of breathing

89
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:03,040
and can you appreciate that knowing simple open

90
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:15,440
peaceful where there's a joining of knowing

91
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:23,040
and breathing one inhalation at a time

92
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,480
one exhalation at a time

93
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,760
instead of thinking about things know what's happening with your

94
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,520
breathing is your breathing

95
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,880
loose or tight

96
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,158
are they long or short

97
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,720
shallow or deep

98
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:03,360
without any judgment or need for it to be any way any particular way let your breathing be

99
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,960
itself and you simply know it

100
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,880
as if you're going along accompanying the breathing

101
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:22,000
listening deeply as you would with a friend who you're listening to

102
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:29,799
accompanying your breathing with your capacity to know it

103
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,679
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

104
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:27,520
considering how attention

105
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:33,080
is a gift that we can give to others

106
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,760
when we listen to them carefully it's a gift

107
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:47,520
when we see them clearly in the world where people often often

108
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,240
are not seen it's a gift

109
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:02,559
if we are present for others it's a gift in a world where people are

110
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:08,240
often not don't take the time to be present for each other

111
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,679
and may we at the end of this meditation

112
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:25,519
dedicate the cultivation of attention that we do here

113
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,480
to bringing a richer more valuable attention

114
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,320
to the world around us to the people in our lives

115
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:48,480
and with that attention may it promote the welfare and happiness of others

116
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:54,080
may all beings be happy

117
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,760
may all beings be safe

118
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:06,720
may all beings be peaceful and may all beings everywhere

119
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,960
be free

120
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:25,109
[Music]

121
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,880
so probably this will be the last more introductory talk for the sati patana

122
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,919
suta the discourse on the four foundations for

123
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:54,559
awareness the foundations upon which we can grow a particular valuable particularly

124
00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:00,960
valuable form of awareness awareness and

125
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,000
the text begins with this

126
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,399
confident statement that there is a direct path a direct way

127
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:18,799
a direct journey to um and the word the word is maybe more like

128
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:24,399
a going a direct going to um

129
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,480
to freedom through liberation and what is this direct way the text

130
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,399
asks and then it then the buddha then describes it and in shorthand

131
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:43,360
he first says [Music] to observe

132
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:50,320
the body in its own terms the body in terms of a body

133
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,000
to know feelings in terms of feelings to know

134
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,279
mental states in terms of mental states and to know mental processes in terms of

135
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:08,159
mental processes and this word in terms of uh in the literal

136
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:14,960
language it says it's if you really did a literal translation it would say the body in the body the feelings in the

137
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:22,559
feelings mind states in mind states and mental processes in mental processes

138
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:28,399
but this uh this word in or this the grammatical form that gives us in can

139
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:35,679
also mean in in terms of in regards to in respect to and the usual interpretation for this is

140
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:41,039
that the observation is meant to be very simple

141
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:46,320
and the word observe here such an important one our ability to kind of settle back in a

142
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,840
nice comfortable easy chair and just see what's happening without

143
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:57,919
judging it or fixing it or doing anything with it this kind of very

144
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:03,360
spacious and peaceful way of just to watch just to see and

145
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:10,000
and to do so the body in terms of the body meaning not in terms of our judgments in terms

146
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,600
of our memories in terms of the other mind states

147
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:22,080
in terms of mental processes just the same radical simplicity being with the body

148
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:28,480
so to observe it that's the way to do it but i use the example of sitting in an easy

149
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,080
arm chair and just kind of watching it as a kind of as a reference point for it

150
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,120
but the text actually says to do it ardently

151
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:46,399
and i love the word ardent to do it with certain kind of engagement like really there

152
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:53,200
and then and do it with awareness and do it with a clear

153
00:33:53,200 --> 00:34:00,399
comprehension clear recognition of what's happening having

154
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:08,158
put aside covetousness covetousness and distress for the world

155
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:14,480
now suddenly it becomes kind of a tall order of this whole thing it's not easy to be able to observe

156
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,079
without judging to fearing thinking about things reacting

157
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,280
let alone being in the present moment it's not easy to apply a certain kind of

158
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:32,398
healthy peacemaking urgency and it's not not easy to maintain a

159
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:39,839
continuity of awareness a continuity of clear comprehension and it's not easy to put aside

160
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:46,560
the greeds we have the covetousness the wantings we have or the distress we have

161
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:52,800
and um but that's the uh so what this text is doing saying there is a path to freedom

162
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:59,520
away go this is the way to go to freedom but uh maybe recognizing it's not easy

163
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:05,839
to do that then the text goes on and offers 13 exercises

164
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:10,960
for how to get there and the first one is this

165
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,960
first tetrad of anapanasati is being attentive to breathing in a certain way which we'll go through over the next few

166
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:23,440
days and after that as as a person learns this exercise

167
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:29,040
then that exercise is onward leading things move and there's you're part of

168
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:35,119
this journey this ongoing this going this movement and the buddha's teachings is full of

169
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:40,160
movement and it's not about

170
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:47,280
only about going nowhere being no one doing nothing

171
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:53,599
which is a wonderful teaching in a limited way of understanding it but it's not the full teaching

172
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:59,680
the buddha's teachings are this kind of ongoing quality of it now if you uh

173
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:04,960
went to the playground and there's a child on a slide in the top of the slide and you

174
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,960
said to the child oh let me give you some profound spiritual teaching there's nowhere to go nothing to do and

175
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,160
no one to be just sit and just sit and do nothing um

176
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:22,240
the um the child would just be like perplexed or like a child might be a wiser that knows what

177
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:28,880
they're there if the child is there for the fun of the process of going down the slide

178
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:35,119
and um and they're up there to do that and there's a kind of a kind of it's as they're not greedy for it they're not

179
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,560
maybe or they're not it's not it's not like trying to prove themselves to anyone they're not trying to accomplish

180
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:47,599
any great thing like they'd be the best slide maker in the world they're just going to go down the slide for the fun of the slide

181
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,880
so i use that as a as a reference point for

182
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:59,119
there is a kind of leaning into or into the slide into this onto the slope

183
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:05,440
of mindfulness of this practice it's not only about staying exactly

184
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:12,320
where you are and nothing ever changes the language of change though that the

185
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,359
buddha uses that is bhavana which as i understand it means something

186
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:24,880
like to cultivate or to develop as you would a farmer would or gardener would cultivate a plant

187
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,240
or you a parent would help a child develop by feeding them and treating them well

188
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,359
so that in a healthy way they can physically and psychologically develop

189
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:41,760
that the parent is not stretching the child so they grow faster we're allowing a natural process to

190
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:48,560
unfold so the same way with this mindfulness practice there's a radical simplicity

191
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,680
being aware of the body in and of itself being being aware of breathing just a

192
00:37:53,680 --> 00:38:00,560
simplicity of breathing knowing it and being allowing for the possibility that you're

193
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:07,200
on a slide or there's a growth or development that goes on here so the text begins

194
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,720
with a promise or you know kind of some people call it promise that there is a direct way to

195
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,839
freedom the way you do it is observing is this

196
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:24,800
very strong this kind of mature place of mindfulness to observe the body

197
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,839
in and of itself feelings mental states and mental

198
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:36,560
processes but the heart of the of the text is then the exercises that it gives and we'll go

199
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:42,079
through the 13 exercises after each exercise

200
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:47,359
there's a refrain it's usually called a refrain and that's the part that goes

201
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:52,560
gets repeated over and over again for those of you here monday when i read the

202
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:59,200
my synopsis of of this whole process the refrain was represented by

203
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:05,280
the expression observing change in the body abiding not clinging to anything in the

204
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:11,440
world and the refrain itself continues a journey it actually is a four part

205
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:18,400
journey a three or four part journey that is describing and unfolding that goes through

206
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:24,240
observing change in such a way that

207
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:31,520
the awareness gets more and more clarified purified simplified

208
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,280
until awareness becomes

209
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:43,839
kind of lucid and it's so lucid that then we then we

210
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:50,720
can relax into it then it's kind of like relaxing into a long wonderful comfortable slide down a

211
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:56,560
hill we then the process takes over and

212
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:03,280
the process of deepening meditation takes over that leads to non-clinging to freedom

213
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:09,200
and and so it's important not to be in a hurry to

214
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:15,839
go through all this it's important not to hopefully to get discouraged but actually i find it phenomenally

215
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:22,000
inspiring this idea that the buddha describes a process of growth the process process of

216
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,319
unfolding we're not expected to be free just quickly like okay like instant

217
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:34,240
enlightenment as some people would like to have it but rather there's something very mature

218
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:39,839
and maturing about settling down for the long term

219
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:46,079
and beginning to putting the steady pieces in place of

220
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:51,200
of developing cultivating growing awareness our ability to have

221
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,880
be more and more present in the present moment with awareness with attention

222
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:03,760
to learn the art of resting in there and opening to it so that it's peaceful so that it's inspiring so that it's

223
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:11,920
happiness producing so that it's it has there's a goodness to it that we open up to as we uh cultivate

224
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:18,839
and develop this simple capacity to be aware as we go through the text uh

225
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:24,000
different um faculties of attention

226
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,680
are called into play at different times and i think of attention is kind of like

227
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:36,560
the the swiss army knife of the mind it has all these different tools that can be used

228
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:42,240
and so at different times we learn these different tools and apply them each of them useful at

229
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:49,920
different times different circumstances to help us be present with our experience and not only be present but

230
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:56,000
to have the kind of awareness that is onward leading that has space in it

231
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,560
peacefulness in it that's not complicated by our expectations and our

232
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:07,599
pushing and our wanting uh it's just kind of like making space

233
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:13,119
for the organic cultivation organic development maturation

234
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:18,800
that leads to freedom and so

235
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:24,800
today the emphasis was discovering more and more about this

236
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:30,640
quality of knowing recognition and how knowing and wrecking recognizing

237
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:36,160
things has a power to it and a beauty to it and a and a kind of

238
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:42,800
a peacefulness to it um sometimes to name something

239
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:50,480
is a uh gives some kind of space in the heart the mind oh it's been named oh it's like that yes that's how it is

240
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:57,760
someone might say that you know there's a lot of tension here and um in the group and then oh you someone named it finally

241
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,880
oh yes that's what's happening and then everyone kind of relaxes a little bit

242
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:08,640
so so to do that with the breathing

243
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:14,880
to establish attention establish awareness with breathing and then to know the breathing

244
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,560
and as we know it to begin discovering some of the qualities of knowing or

245
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:26,880
discover how to know so that knowing is unburdened

246
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:33,520
with all the baggage we carry with us it's so simple and to feel the delight or the peace or

247
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:40,480
the freedom from the disentanglement from that

248
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:48,079
simple knowing at first it might seem like it's nothing it's like it's okay what's the big deal

249
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:55,119
but uh to um it's a big deal to develop this capacity

250
00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:01,280
to know beautiful thing to do so um

251
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,960
thank you we're norwegian mangan tuck and
