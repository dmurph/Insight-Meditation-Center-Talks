1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:06,480
so we've come to the end of this week the

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:14,000
series on patience and um patience

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,439
is often a a wonderful

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,279
gift that we give to ourselves and to the world

5
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:33,040
because the alternative when the alternative to patients is not so healthy or beneficial for us or for

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,718
others and

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,199
so for this morning meditation i want to

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:54,320
mention that in this ancient teachings of the buddha he puts a emphasis on

9
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:01,280
knowledge and vision and i'll translate this as knowing and

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,200
seeing and i'll explain this for this meditation as

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,880
the simple patient knowing of what's obvious in the experience what's obvious with the breathing

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:20,159
as we so focus on the breathing just knowing and then taking patient time

13
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,920
to perceive that to sense it to let it register the experience that

14
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,360
you've known so in a sense you're you you you recognize it you know what

15
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,479
it's there there's a simple very simple recognition it just doesn't have to be with words

16
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,079
uh it could just be kind of a silent knowing but when something is known

17
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:48,000
then take a brief time to let it register more fully really experience what that is

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,960
more deeply and for something that's passing quickly like the inhale it's just a fleeting moment maybe that

19
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,880
to really register something if it lingers a little bit longer you know it doesn't have to be more than a

20
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,399
second or two it's easy going relaxed and the patience

21
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,720
is there with the that seeing with the registering allowing it to be there

22
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,520
and it's not literally what i'm about to say but it's the spirit of it and that is as if you have all the time

23
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,280
in the world not literally because you don't linger so long you start thinking about it

24
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,920
but as long as there's kind of a deeper silent recognition silent registering

25
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,519
seeing perceiving sensing stay there let let it sink in

26
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:44,560
if it's still there and then know the next thing so know the inhale and let that be

27
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,400
registered and feel it then know the exhale

28
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,720
you know the beginning of it and then let's feel and register that more fully that experience of exhaling

29
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,480
if there's a pause after the exhale know it and allow yourself to let that register

30
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:09,280
or take it in or or you know feel that experience in some

31
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,560
way so there's knowing and then there's

32
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,120
buddhist language seeing but seeing replies to all the inner ways of perception of feeling sensing that goes

33
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,080
on so

34
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:38,000
assuming a meditation posture one that allows you to have a certain

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,560
alertness but also one which you're going to be patient

36
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,440
you're settling in for the long term just to be with what's here whatever it might be

37
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,120
not fighting it or resisting it or fixing anything

38
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:04,560
but a posture that allows you to be present

39
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,200
with some alertness or clarity

40
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,359
and then gently close your eyes

41
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,959
or gently lower your gaze

42
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:39,520
and taking a breath or two just to relax into your body soften in the body

43
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,040
relaxing into the body might give you access to more of your

44
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,560
body to feel and sense as you now take a few long slow deep

45
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,560
breaths

46
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:08,479
almost as if you're getting a massage from the inside out feel the rib cages expand

47
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:17,440
maybe the shoulders rise maybe the belly balloons out

48
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:28,320
maybe as you breathe in there's an increased pressure on the sitting bones

49
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,560
or if you're laying down increase pressure in the back

50
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,960
ribcage or if you're sitting in a chair you might feel the back rib cage too

51
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,880
and then letting the breathing return to normal

52
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,319
and take take three or four breaths to

53
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:05,720
relax in your body on the exhale

54
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,479
and then to

55
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,800
settle into your breathing

56
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,680
feeling the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

57
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:18,000
sensing or feeling the body's experience of breathing the sensations in the body as you

58
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,319
breathe the movements

59
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,960
and as you inhale know the inhale

60
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:14,400
let's allow the inhale to be known and then

61
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:23,039
let that experience register more deeply like almost like a physical or registering

62
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,560
as you sense or feel what you now know

63
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,640
and then as you exhale know the exhale

64
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:23,200
and in the receptive mode like as if the body is receiving the sensations

65
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,600
let the experience of exhale be felt sensed

66
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,680
the exhale is known and felt

67
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,680
seeing if you can be infinitely patient

68
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:05,440
with this process of knowing and then silently

69
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:12,040
feeling and sensing what is known

70
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,600
and so there's a rhythm of knowing and sensing

71
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:36,440
and the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

72
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,800
a rhythm that you feel and sense

73
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:02,079
participate in with lots of patience knowing and feeling

74
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:09,040
knowing and registering quietly calmly

75
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:19,519
and if there's a lot of thinking know that is happening

76
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:25,600
and silently register how that feels in your body your mind to

77
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:32,079
be thinking the sensations

78
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,440
not what you're thinking about but what the process of thinking feels

79
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:46,800
senses know it and sense it

80
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,839
and then begin again with your breathing

81
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,720
um

82
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,280
it's quite valuable to learn the art

83
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:28,240
of staying close to knowing and feeling

84
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,440
knowing and sensing

85
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:41,160
knowing and letting things register more deeply

86
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:24,200
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

87
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:31,679
this practice of knowing and sensing knowing and seeing

88
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,480
knowing and letting things be registered more fully

89
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:44,799
can be done outward into the world that we live in

90
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:53,799
to know the joys and the sorrows of this world

91
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,440
and to really know it and then take patient time

92
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,200
to let it register to let ourselves feel it

93
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,679
to be a witness to what's happening in the world

94
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:20,799
so that we're touched by it and to be touched by the world be a

95
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:27,520
witness to what's happening in the world to witness it with our hearts

96
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,840
is an expression of this practice

97
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,840
it's supported by our patients

98
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:51,919
and it becomes a gift if we can then care for the world

99
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:59,520
each in our own individual way to live a life of knowing and

100
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,640
seeing knowing and feeling

101
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:11,039
and then caring knowing feeling caring

102
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:22,158
and this doesn't have to be dramatic it could be an expression of our own

103
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:29,640
unique agency and abilities and situations

104
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,158
it might be with the people around us

105
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:46,000
may this practice that we do support us

106
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:53,520
to live for the welfare and happiness of the whole world including ourselves

107
00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:00,320
may all beings be happy

108
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:09,679
may all beings be safe may all beings be peaceful

109
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:16,559
and may all beings be free of suffering

110
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,919
challenges oppression

111
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,240
and may we contribute to that possibility

112
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:47,150
[Music]

113
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,840
so patience uh today i want to talk a little bit about patience

114
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,639
with the practice that um

115
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:15,279
when we really settle down to doing meditation practice buddhist practice

116
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:21,360
it i think it's done best most efficiently

117
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,799
if we don't try to be efficient we try to be sincere

118
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:32,399
and dedicated to it but to be in a hurry to be impatient

119
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:38,399
goes in the wrong direction from the freedom from uh compulsion that we're

120
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:44,640
looking for that we're trying to develop and so

121
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:51,440
to be caught in impatience is to be caught in a world of clinging

122
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:58,000
and in moving towards non-clinging we want to kind of learn how to be patient

123
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,640
with the ongoingness of the path of practice and um

124
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,840
there's a very touching for me story that i heard secondhand from someone who was

125
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:15,679
there a few people who were there dalai lama many years ago in

126
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:21,360
in a big amphitheater in arizona apparently was giving teachings

127
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:27,840
weekend teachings and it's he took questions sometimes and a person stood up in the middle of the

128
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:33,840
auditorium and and and asked for uh the quickest way to

129
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:40,559
enlightenment and as a story he was told the dalai lama paused for a long time

130
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:46,240
just stood there without responding and then at some point a tear started going down his

131
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,679
cheek and then uh he said something like

132
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:58,480
how sad he felt about this drive to be quick in the practice to try to get something

133
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:05,279
to be you know to um and i don't know what was going on for the person who asked the question

134
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:11,360
but um i wonder if the dalai lama felt that there was some kind of greed or

135
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,640
selfishness or some kind of acquisitive relationship with the dharma for someone

136
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,679
to ask that kind of question and and to settle in

137
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:27,919
do the practice patiently in a sense inefficiently is often the

138
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:35,279
most efficient there's a story also that i've told of kind of a fairytale story of

139
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:41,440
a person a very capable person comes to the monastery to practices is

140
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:48,720
dedicated to practice is quite accomplished in the world has a high degree he's very very smart

141
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,000
clever skilled lots of lots of native ability to

142
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:01,200
manage with things and the person comes to the monastery and says i'm here to practice and if i

143
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:08,640
practice well how long will it take for me to become enlightened and the abyss says

144
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:14,399
oh it'll take you about 10 years and then the person says wait a minute

145
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:20,080
you know i'm quite capable and i can really know how to apply myself i'll really be diligent and

146
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:25,360
and and really kind of work hard and how long will it take then

147
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:31,919
and the ab has said oh then it'll take 20 years

148
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:40,000
so there's something about the patience of just accepting the situation accepting how things are

149
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,000
including the challenges in practice and then a steady ongoingness the

150
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,039
patience that allows us to go step after step to to

151
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:57,760
sprint in the practice to go really hard and push and then have to kind of recover and stop practicing

152
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:05,279
um you know or you go off and do something else you think might be efficient is very different than just

153
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:11,200
the mundane ordinary step by step this breath

154
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,638
this my act of mindfulness just we this is what we do step after

155
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:23,599
step after step and um and to practice that sincerely and patience for me

156
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,960
allows for sincerity it allows for uh offering ourselves to the practice

157
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:35,760
more fully without it being in exchange without being a transactional thing if i do this the

158
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:42,878
practice will give me this back we're just in here willingly to allow it to unfold as it

159
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:48,638
wants to i very much like the idea that um

160
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:54,960
that the dharma knows better than i do what i need to experience what need to

161
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:01,359
practice with now today anytime and and i've seen that over and over again that i might have one idea of what

162
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:07,760
i'm supposed to be doing or what's supposed to happen in practice but something else comes along and i practice with that

163
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:13,040
and and that seems in the long term and you know eventually i say oh that was really great

164
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,640
and immediately i don't quite understand how it's beneficial but i've learned to trust

165
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:24,480
how things unfold as i practice and just practice with it practice with a practice with this with this

166
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,720
patient lane patiently and there's a story that i'm very fond of and i'm sure

167
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:38,240
some of you heard me say it and that is um a friend of mine was a student of

168
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:45,760
shinrio suzuki suzuki roshi the founder of the san francisco zen center a zen master and

169
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,920
and my friend asked suzuki roshi once

170
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:58,079
if i practice zayn will i become enlightened and suzuki roshi answered him if your

171
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,680
practice is sincere it's almost as good

172
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,760
it's if your practice here is almost as good so rather than

173
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,960
rushing and forcefully and demanding or expecting this you know

174
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,800
enlightenment to just practice patiently sincerely and it's pretty good

175
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,640
and maybe you'll become enlightened but if not it's almost as good so this is

176
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,920
part of the benefits of patients to settle in for the long term willing to practice with what is

177
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:38,400
not being ahead of yourself not being protesting by what the dharma offers you what your

178
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:45,200
what's what arises for you in the practices the challenges that come the joys that come just steadily

179
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:51,680
very steady ongoingness practice practice practice

180
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:59,440
and then at some point when when the impatience disappears when

181
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:07,760
compulsions quiet down when greed and clinging and and anxiety settle and abate

182
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,680
then there's a wonderful kind of higher

183
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:19,920
special kind of patience and and that's the patience

184
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:26,960
which is not it which is non-patience and i mean it in this way

185
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,720
that if two people are coming into the same very trying

186
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:38,720
difficult situation that's a very stressful and

187
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:45,200
and one person kind of sits down and puts on the seat belt or something and really kind of bears down into doesn't

188
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,560
react and stay still but it's a lot of work to um

189
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:57,200
to you know stay patient they have to really work at it and hold and check their their obsessive compulsive kind of

190
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:04,160
reactivities and people say oh that person managed to be patient with a difficult situation

191
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:11,359
the other person is in the same situation but none of their buttons are pushed

192
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:17,760
they're stressful it's difficult but they're not reacting to it there's no inner compulsions no obsessions no

193
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:24,480
reactivity to the situation and so the person has no reactivity it just sits there calmly

194
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,640
and from the outside someone might say this both people look like they're both equally patient

195
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,680
but on the inside one person is doing patience

196
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,720
and the other one is you could say maybe being patient

197
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:45,920
but you could say that it's it's um the other person has no need for

198
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:51,599
patients it's a non-patience that allows them to be kind

199
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:58,160
of present for the situation without being reactive so as practice deepens

200
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,839
as we follow this path patiently the time will come when you start recognizing

201
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:09,760
that oh i'm patient without being patient i'm

202
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:15,680
patient without needing to do anything that i can be here and i'm not reacting

203
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:21,359
i'm present i can know what's happening clearly i can let it register and see what's happening

204
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:28,240
clearly and but i'm not reacting and when that happens then there's more

205
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:33,920
lots more room and space for us to care

206
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:41,599
to be aware in a caring way sympathetic way

207
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:50,400
and to maybe if it's appropriate to act in caring ways to care for the world

208
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:58,079
so um patience to be patient it's a i think one of the great

209
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:03,359
gifts that we can give ourselves and we do this practice and it's also a gift we can give the

210
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:09,680
world because to be impatient is not a gift for anyone

211
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:15,680
so thank you for this time and this chance to talk about

212
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,640
patience and i look forward to

213
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:26,880
monday when we'll start a different topic i don't know what it is yet but we'll do

214
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,720
something so thank you
