1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,319
so um but i want to say some words for people who might be listening today in audio dharma

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:12,480
because maybe some of you are on audio dharma today wondering what happened because it's not

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,800
not being broadcast on youtube today because somehow we're having a trouble with uh streaming from the from the

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,840
computer and um so then we'll work on it and i'm sure

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,400
we'll fix it

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,760
and then kind of an announcement is that um

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,680
it just felt right to me at least that uh for the next two two weeks after tomorrow we'll take a break uh meeting

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,079
in person here at imc and just to kind of get our bearings a little bit with this new

9
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:55,840
covet situation and and so uh

10
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,520
and then probably we'll start again again in two weeks on the monday the 17th in person it's my guess but we'll

11
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,960
see how things develop and go and i don't feel so myself i don't feel so

12
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,840
worried but maybe it's not maybe it's from stupidity

13
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,720
but uh the um i mean i think a little influence that i don't all of you run out of here at

14
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,479
once but about two weeks ago my son came home from college with omicron

15
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:33,040
and so going through that whole kind of monitoring that and learning about it and what it's all about and

16
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,720
that was partly the motivation to close for two weeks but also part of the reason why i'm not so worried about it

17
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,000
also if we had the precautions we have here are pretty good

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,399
and i think that it makes it pretty safe for everyone and

19
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:57,680
so but when we open again we might uh certainly request but maybe require

20
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,119
that everyone also be boosted the boosters make big difference and

21
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,800
my son went through he almost wouldn't have known he had it

22
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:16,160
except he was told and then he got tested and he had very minor symptoms

23
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,920
and and then all of us quarantined and all of us got you know tested at the

24
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,360
right time and so it's all good apparently

25
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:35,440
so um so that's kind of the announcement

26
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,280
so then for the talk

27
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,800
this is the last sunday talk for this year let me get ready to welcome in a new

28
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,000
year and i remember that in 20

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,360
when we we brought in 29 2020 that because of the you know this 2020

30
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,000
vision thing that some of us talked about you know there's the year of clear seeing

31
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,599
well maybe it was in some ways

32
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:20,239
but but now i'm thinking about this 2022

33
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,560
and i would love it if it was a year of care a year in which we cared

34
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,920
and it seems that it's particularly important that this juncture of human

35
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,120
history that more of us care and it really makes a difference if we

36
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,560
really come together all of us to care about so many things we've learned this over

37
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,239
the last year over the last decades to care about that are worth caring about

38
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,400
and then i woke up this morning to learn that desmond tutu had died

39
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,959
and you know he was a very inspiring person both because of his fight against

40
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,319
apartheid but also because of a phenomenal work with this

41
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,760
truth and reconciliation process in south africa i mean that was so inspiring it's one

42
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,799
thing to set a person's people free from oppression like he did which is so

43
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:22,079
important it's another thing to come out of that and try to heal the society that was so

44
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,360
divided and probably south africa wouldn't have managed so well if it hadn't been for

45
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,600
the truth and reconciliation process and that inspired so many people in south africa even people who didn't go through

46
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,120
it formally and you know the proceedings they had they just appointed a different way of

47
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,960
being together and uh

48
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,160
and then thinking about what i was going to talk about today i read about his a little bit about his

49
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,320
biography and i just wanted to mention that um

50
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,360
that apparently he had polio as a kid and he was his right hand was atrophy

51
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,639
because he couldn't use it and also when he was 18 he spent a year

52
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,320
and a half in the hospital with tuberculosis but there was a episcopal priest who

53
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:19,759
came to visit him and became his friend and that's what set him in motion to become a

54
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,039
priest himself and then become the archbishop and then

55
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:31,199
become such a big you know big influence on south africa and so

56
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,320
you know he was a great person inspiring person but also we remember that there was

57
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,880
people who cared for the inspiring people the people who believed in them enough so that they

58
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:50,320
could move forward and into and become someone wonderful

59
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,680
and perhaps you know they say this idea of care

60
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,400
emphasizing care there's a story

61
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,720
traditional story from somewhere i have his ideas from the middle east

62
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,199
sometime in the time of old there was a family that

63
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,240
gave birth to a baby girl

64
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,319
and as it was there was a old wise

65
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:34,960
woman who lived not the edge of town and she came to see this new girl that was

66
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,639
born and she said oh she's a wonderful girl for sure

67
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,638
and she will die on her wedding night

68
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,160
well so she grew up and she was a wonderful person and she got engaged she got married there

69
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,560
was the wedding and then there was a wedding feast that evening and the parents got they didn't tell

70
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,599
anybody about this prediction but they were kind of like little bit on the edge you know

71
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,840
she's going to die tonight and now so it was a big feast everyone

72
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:19,280
was partying and feasting and dancing and things and there came a poor beggar

73
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:26,240
to the door of the party knocked and asked to have some food and everyone shooed the person away no no no

74
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,680
no but the bride

75
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,360
somehow saw what's going on and of all the people in the party was the one who went out there

76
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,840
to give food to the beggar the party went on there was a wedding

77
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:50,319
night and everyone woke up the next morning and they were alive so the parents went to find the old

78
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:56,560
woman and said what happened we've been living with this idea that she was going to die

79
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,639
oh but there was one thing that was going to save her and that was if she

80
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,479
did an act of kindness on her wedding night but i couldn't have told you that

81
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:16,240
because then it wouldn't have worked it wouldn't have been kind it would have been done it you know for that purpose

82
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,720
so the act of kindness that saves someone the act of kindness that will save us

83
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,479
the act of care that will save us

84
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,000
what will we save through our care

85
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,919
and there's lots to care about now we know as i said and now they say that in terms of the

86
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,959
whole climate change that's happening it's not a matter of stopping it but now

87
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:51,519
our care can go into reducing the damage and in some ways that makes it easier

88
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,800
because the idea of all or nothing is kind of hard but the idea that we can reduce it

89
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,439
each of us can reduce it in an important way

90
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:10,000
maybe by saving one life one animal life anything anything we can

91
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
do to make it better to care but one of the things that

92
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,959
we save if we care is in fact our care

93
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:29,680
maybe caring compassion kindness is one of the most important resources and

94
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:37,839
that we have and it can be lost it can be forgotten it can be

95
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,160
submerged in despair it can be lost in anger it can be lost in all kinds of

96
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:51,279
things and distractions in netflix

97
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:58,320
but to care to let that beautiful maybe what's saved is our care and that counts

98
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,560
who knows what our cares need will be needed for there's another uh maybe middle eastern

99
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:11,839
near eastern story of a sufi who uh

100
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:20,959
some genie comes along and offers this sofia uh one wish

101
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:28,240
or two wishes i don't know how you because you'll decide whether it's one or two so the sufi wishes

102
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,760
um may i help everyone i come across

103
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,040
wherever i go may i be helpful to people but may it be that i don't know that i'm

104
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,399
doing it and so he's given this big bag this

105
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:50,880
burlap bag to carry that's filled with seeds of

106
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,800
fruit trees maybe date date palms or something

107
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:03,279
and it has a little hole in the back of it and so as he's carrying it

108
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:10,160
and on his back for his shoulder it slowly loses these seeds out the back but he doesn't see

109
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,760
them falling and he keeps walking as he wanders around his part of the world

110
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:22,640
and he doesn't see that over the weeks and months and years after him it grows his fruit trees that benefits

111
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:29,760
the people around him so who knows does your care need to have

112
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:36,800
proof that you've succeeded is it enough to care can you care

113
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,959
but sometimes we do get the wonderful fruit sees the fruits of our care and

114
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:49,200
sometimes it comes back to ourselves maybe this is a very trite example but

115
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,880
it was a little bit inspiring maybe because it happened during retreat at the retreat center and so it kind of

116
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:01,519
everything kind of magnified a little bit there so those of you haven't been there we have a little coffee tea area

117
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:07,279
and then under the counter there's a small little refrigerator where they have dairy milk

118
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,399
different kinds of milk things and

119
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,760
and so one day i noticed that there was no milk there

120
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,360
so i went out of my way to go get milk bread unopened

121
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,680
container and i put it in the fridge for someone who was going to come so i didn't think about it anymore

122
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,360
a couple of hours later i decided to have some tea and to put some milk in it and i opened

123
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:42,160
the refrigerator and there was a full unopened bottle of of milk there

124
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,759
the person who had benefited was me

125
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,639
you know i'd care you know so it's a silly example right but it comes around but i'll tell you

126
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,880
i'll tell you another way it comes around that happened this week or so

127
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:07,519
so my mother is now in a memory care home

128
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:13,680
is now in hospice and so it was a week or two ago and uh

129
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,040
and so as all this kind of hospice care comes into play

130
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:26,480
so i received a call i get all these phone calls now from the hospice but you know all kinds of issues and stuff

131
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,160
and this wonderful wonderful place mission hospice here in san mateo

132
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,440
and so i got one of these phone calls and this woman says you know i'm i'm the

133
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,639
mission hospice chaplain and i'm getting ready to visit your mom

134
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,600
so it's nice but turns out the woman who's my mom's chaplain

135
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:56,160
was introduced to becoming a chaplain to chaplaincy by doing the buddhist chaplaincy

136
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,360
training that i offer here at imc some 10 years ago 11 years ago she went

137
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,560
through the training and learned about all this and so i you know i was supporting her i

138
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,880
wanted to you know it's a wonderful thing to train chaplains some of you in the room have been in the chaplaincy program i can see at least three or four

139
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,920
of you here and um

140
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:24,320
and uh and so you know i just love doing it i feel like it's a kind of pyramid scheme

141
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:32,399
for joy because people go out and benefit others and then guess who benefited it

142
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:38,560
comes around so so that's that's nice you know so

143
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:46,639
who knows what our characters in the world maybe we don't need to know but who knows the good we can do

144
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:54,160
so there's another story of a christian monastery

145
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:01,279
someplace that the few monks that were left in the monastery were getting quite old

146
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,399
and no one came to visit the monastery anymore and there was no one joining the monastery

147
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:12,880
it seemed like the monastery was just dying away and they could see that in a few years none of the monks would be left and what

148
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:19,120
would happen to the monastery they'd be just you know it was kind of there'd been a thriving monastery

149
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,600
in their youth but now it was kind of fading away so the advent was a little concerned

150
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,639
about this of course and so it was quite perplexed and said i'm going to go visit this there's supposed

151
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,800
to be this very wise rabbi in the next valley over or something

152
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,399
and so the abbott went to the rabbi and said you know we have this

153
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:48,959
issue in our monastery and it's dying away no one's coming it's it seems like it's you know

154
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:55,040
it's coming to its end but you can you have any ideas of what we can do and what might revive it

155
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:01,680
and they had tea and talked about things and the rabbi said no not really

156
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:09,920
i don't know about monasteries and but then the as the as the abbot was

157
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:17,360
leaving to go back home the rabbi said oh by the way oh one of your monks back at your

158
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,839
monastery is that is going to be the messiah the next messiah or something

159
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:31,600
and so the abbot went back to the monastery and the monks that were there were kind of eager to find out what they learned they all wanted to know the

160
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,519
device they would what advice they were going to give in the abbot said well he had no advice for us he didn't have

161
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:43,519
anything to say but he did say the strange things as i was leaving as i was leaving he said

162
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:49,600
one of us is going to be the messiah and they said wow that's strange

163
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,040
but then in the next days and weeks the monks was like well you know who

164
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,320
could it be well it can't be father lawrence

165
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,520
he's always so grumpy however

166
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:11,520
he's always helping he's always at the right place when someone needs help he's all right there to help

167
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,839
could he be no no maybe well maybe but what about father

168
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:23,520
joseph brother joseph he's just so lazy

169
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:31,120
he's just like you know no one does less than him in the monastery but whenever he does something

170
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,799
he's always so kind and then he went through everyone that

171
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:43,520
like you know could it be that person could it be that person and as they had these thoughts and

172
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,960
recognize that each of them had something a little good going for them

173
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:55,520
they started treating each other with respect and care and reference in a way that they hadn't maybe hadn't done for

174
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,760
for a long time so that was nice but then one day

175
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,880
some young people from town came to have a picnic on the monastery grounds

176
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,400
and they felt something and they had little conversations with some of the monks and they felt

177
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:18,480
something special so they came back and they came back and more of them came

178
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,240
and then some of them joined the monastery became monks and after a few couple of years the place

179
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,400
was thriving again with young dedicated monastics

180
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,960
so um care what happens when we care for each other

181
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:43,440
we respect each other we revere each other what are the conditions we put in place

182
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,039
and it doesn't take a lot of thinking that there are very different those are very

183
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:56,759
different conditions than being mean being indifferent

184
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:05,520
but to be to care to love to be kind as if your care is important

185
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:12,320
as if you matter that what you do and maybe it doesn't have to be big

186
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:18,160
you don't become a desmond tutu but maybe it's that uh you cared about a

187
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:25,600
neighbor you cared about someone who has a flat tire and you pull over to help them

188
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,280
you're saying that i remember once in palo alto uh someone's car was stalled in either

189
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:37,360
intersection the woman's car was stalled and standing there wondering what to do and it seemed like dangerous so i got out of

190
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:44,480
my car i parked my car the side and i pushed it to the side seemed like a nice thing to do right now

191
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,960
or the right thing to do and i haven't thought about it in 30 years but

192
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:58,000
there's now so to care

193
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,720
who knows who we're meeting do you know the people you meet do you know who they are and what their

194
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,559
destiny is and do you know anybody really

195
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:19,640
who knows maybe they're like father lawrence maybe they're the messiah maybe something special there

196
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:28,159
in 2013 some people cared for a 13 year old girl

197
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,559
who was shot

198
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,080
two years later that thirteen-year-old girl received the nobel prize of peace the

199
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,399
peace prize

200
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,440
pakistan

201
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:05,440
who would have known that the care of caring for her would have such a big impact

202
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,559
in 2018 a 13 year old teenager started skipping school

203
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:19,600
a year later the forbes magazine listed her as one of the most

204
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,679
100 most powerful women in the world

205
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,400
and she ended up on the times

206
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,400
magazine person of the year and that was greta thornberg

207
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,280
who would have known

208
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:50,799
in 2020 a 17 year old teenager working at the mall the local mall

209
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:59,200
changed america by taking the video of george floyd

210
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,799
dying daniela fraser

211
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,799
and then before that there was a teenager or a girl who lived and went to

212
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,440
13 different schools before she graduated high school

213
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,760
and then went on to be a single parent cared for by friends and living on food

214
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:30,320
stamps what would happen to her

215
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:37,720
she is now currently the u.s secretary of interior

216
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:47,120
deb holland a laguna pueblo from the laguna pueblo

217
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,120
tribe

218
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,960
who knows who's out there who knows who we meet who knows who you are

219
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:08,760
some of these people are ordinary people but who knows what comes their way

220
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,080
so all these things are you know maybe inspiring also a little daunting when you mention

221
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,520
such great people who do such you know monumental things

222
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:35,039
but maybe care each of them each of them needed people who cared for them

223
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:43,440
and the people who care i think don't have to know what the impact of their care is

224
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,679
maybe care what's important about care is the caring

225
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:58,159
without much thought about long-term impacts just kids take care

226
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,200
to live a life of care

227
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:14,400
so how would you live if you lived as if your life mattered

228
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:21,480
well how would you live if you really thought that you could make a difference

229
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,440
and i think our lives do matter

230
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,480
probably many of you know it's kind of just stereotypic idea now that

231
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,799
you know in the holidays some people watch it's a wonderful life wonderful world is what it is

232
00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:01,200
maybe we can all be george bailey the man who didn't think that

233
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:07,520
he'd done anything good in life and was going to jump off a bridge and commit suicide and

234
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,760
then the angel comes right and shows him what his life what life the town would have been like if he hadn't

235
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:20,480
lived at all and it was awful so here we are

236
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:27,559
we do matter each of us more important

237
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:35,919
so we ended up with kuan yin on the altar just kind of didn't have actually been up there that i know of

238
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:44,799
it's kind of nice to have her there especially for this talk and care compassion and kindness

239
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:50,159
there's a story about kuan yin that uh sometimes uh

240
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:56,640
there's there's kuan yin is said to have 11 heads sometimes a thousand arms

241
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:03,919
and the story is that um how she got those eleven heads and living arms

242
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:09,279
apparently she worked tirelessly to save people

243
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:14,559
you know to just apparently one day she had everything all tidied up

244
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,559
imagine that everyone was good

245
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:26,240
and then she woke up the next morning and sure enough people are suffering again it didn't take long for the suffering to

246
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:33,039
come back and uh she did it again but then the suffering

247
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:38,960
came and she saw the immense suffering of this world that seemingly she couldn't

248
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:45,520
keep up with and so i guess in english she would say she was

249
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:51,600
heartbroken but her head burst head broken

250
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:57,679
and at the 11 heads and the house and arms so because she can be even more

251
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:03,360
effective and more helpful than help the world and the thousand arms are there because

252
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,720
each arm has each hand as a different tool implement to help the world

253
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:15,840
so and she and she has all these heads to look everywhere and i like this story a little bit because

254
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:22,080
some of us are afraid of having our heart broken the issue if it's difficult to have your

255
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,240
heart broken maybe you haven't had it broken enough

256
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:35,840
maybe maybe there's the art of letting it break really break

257
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:43,279
maybe then you'll be kuan yin your heart will break into 11 hearts

258
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:50,960
or some people say that if your heart breaks into many pieces it just has more surface area

259
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:57,440
in order to feel and sense and be caring for this world

260
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:03,440
i don't think we should be so afraid of having our hearts broken i think that

261
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:11,279
if we can learn maybe through the practice we do the mindfulness practice to not resist it not be oppressed by it

262
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:16,559
not be afraid of it not be submerged by it and not give up because

263
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:23,679
of it there's something something about caring in spite of the broken heart

264
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,840
something about a sense of dignity and value and

265
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,720
presence that allows us the heart to break and something kind of

266
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:43,200
to emerge from that caring for the world caring for others sensitivity love kindness

267
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:51,520
maybe if your heart is broken enough what else is there but to be kind what's left if you do it thoroughly

268
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:03,840
so these thousand arms and somalia i think of them also as hands that reach

269
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,880
out and touch the whole world and it's remarkable that we live in a

270
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,480
world now that is you know it's kind of also a stereotype or a little cliche

271
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,520
that the world has gotten so small but i can't help but to keep thinking

272
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:26,399
that it's getting smaller and smaller and the way that what happens elsewhere in the world affects us and what a video affects the

273
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:31,520
world i mean there was someone apparently

274
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:38,840
less than two months ago two months ago who got sick with covet in south

275
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:45,679
africa was discovered to have if one person discovered to have this new variant

276
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:53,120
when did i care so much about what happened in a sick person in the other side of the world

277
00:29:53,360 --> 00:30:00,240
but that one person from there maybe where were represented where somewhere it began

278
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,120
and spread out across the whole world and now the whole world is

279
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:12,000
pausing in a certain way from omicron we have this invisible force we don't

280
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,640
see it in our normal eyes the virus and it's the fact that it

281
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:25,039
spreads and connects all of us all over the world and what happens in south africa what happens elsewhere

282
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:30,480
has a huge impact on us can we just close our borders and just

283
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:36,640
care for ourselves as if we can that's enough

284
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,640
if we want to care for ourselves i think we should care for others

285
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,399
it isn't just mothers going to nursing homes having chaplains come that we can

286
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:54,559
experience the how it comes back to us but it's also

287
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:02,080
if we don't care for the world don't care for others

288
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:08,720
then what virus will come find us

289
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:16,000
i kind of love seeing people with masks on and i'm troubled by it of course

290
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,440
but my assumption is that when people wear masks

291
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:27,919
that they're caring for me and certainly when i'm wearing a mask

292
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:33,279
i'm caring full of you and the fact that there's liv in a room

293
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:39,039
full of people where there's the care is visible i think it's such a beautiful thing a

294
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:45,640
wonderful thing love made visible these masks

295
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:54,159
and as we care for the wonderful thing about cove it is wonderful can we say the wonderful around it

296
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,559
the wonderful thing about covet is that this simultaneous thing where

297
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:06,320
if we care for others we're simultaneously caring for ourselves it's kind of represented by the masks the

298
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:11,519
mask also we care for it's a way of caring for ourselves you're protecting yourself with the mask

299
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:17,279
and you're protecting others through the mask and so it kind of like this situation

300
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:23,519
where you get to have the benefits of both you both get to benefit yourself and

301
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:30,640
better better care for yourself care for others and so you might as well get credit for both

302
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:37,919
so don't just do it for your own sake and don't just do it for other people say do it for both you get a lot more

303
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:43,840
credit wherever with credit is stored i don't know where it is

304
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:53,120
in your heart i think i think that's where the credit is so you know it's a beautiful thing to

305
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:59,440
to develop to grow this heart to expand this heart sometimes by breaking it and

306
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,480
letting it grow it makes a difference

307
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:11,840
your care makes a difference makes a difference for you it makes different for the world

308
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:23,398
so perhaps just like the monastery if everyone

309
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,919
if we treat everyone as worthy of care worthy of respect or their reverence

310
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,919
everyone

311
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:43,519
it is a care that i think will return and benefit us as well

312
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,559
not least because it's good for our hearts it's good for our inner lives

313
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:56,559
to treat people that way to see people that way i think of it as a

314
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:03,120
myself i think of that as the natural way of being anything short of that

315
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:09,520
requires resistance requires contraction closing down pushing away

316
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,398
being selfish

317
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,838
so the year of care

318
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,398
i was thinking about this i was thinking that

319
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:39,520
some people have calculated that unless we do change something a million species of plants and animals

320
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:46,960
will be extinct within the next hundred years so what will die if we

321
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,878
don't care certainly care will die

322
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:57,599
and do you want to live in a world where there's no care

323
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,839
i'd rather live in a world that cares than anything else

324
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,920
and with our care some things will die and one of the things that will die is

325
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,838
our selfishness would that be so bad

326
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:24,839
i think it'll be liberating to do that

327
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:38,480
so 2022 may it be the year of care

328
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:47,599
and then by the end of next year you'll know whether it was a year of care

329
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:54,000
if you cared that you'll be the proof of it

330
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:01,359
may you benefit this world and in doing so yourself

331
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,599
thank you
