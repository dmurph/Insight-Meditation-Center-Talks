hi welcome so nice to be here with you all and out there on

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:13,440
YouTube i'm Tanya Weiser see some of you i've seen some of you but um not not

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,359
maybe not all of you so nice to meet you i am um a teacher trained under Gil and

4
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:27,119
Andrea Fella i teach here on Thursday nights and in the eight-fold path program so come on by Thursday night if

5
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,558
you're ever in the mood for um coming doing dharma and then meeting

6
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:38,760
in small groups and talking about the dharma topic that's sort of the the unique feature of Thursday

7
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:46,239
nights it's a nice place to connect with SA so I'm

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:53,360
um my what's on my heart or in my mind for talking about tonight is kind of

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,280
actually uh this exploring and discussing this idea of the middle way

10
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:07,880
the teaching of the Buddha on the middle way and um for me maybe one of the

11
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,080
key ways of describing

12
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:20,960
being on this middle path is being available being available to experience

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,920
and respond to life in a particular kind of

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,640
way and um it's a there's a receptivity

15
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,680
that we we cultivate in our practice and an

16
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:45,799
embodiment you know the Buddha directed us to pay attention to our direct felt

17
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:52,119
experience and then to have these you know co-guiding wings of wisdom and

18
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:58,479
compassion there and available all helping us sort of find this this middle

19
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,320
way and I would also venture to describe it in a incomplete way but in in my way

20
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,920
of also this middle way between doing and

21
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:16,280
non-doing you know something that's not exactly doing and certainly not exactly

22
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:22,640
non-doing so this word available maybe will come up frequently as I explore my

23
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,040
reflections with you and I I you know th this

24
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,400
understanding or this um coming to the this connection with this idea of a

25
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,879
middle way was the pivotal insight that the Buddha had that actually led to his

26
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:48,319
liberation you know to his complete freedom and you know as many of you

27
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:54,480
probably know the story goes that you know he started his life in you know

28
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,120
with a lot of luxury a lot of indulgence sensual pleasures and you know sort of a

29
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:08,959
protected lifestyle and then um he left his home

30
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,159
and his family to pursue freedom he wanted to have a different kind of

31
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:20,959
experience of life and his first teachers were teachers who taught um

32
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,239
concentration practices these u very refined states

33
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:32,080
mind states can be quite pleasant and beautiful abidings but what the Buddha

34
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,360
found over time was he could master these quite easily

35
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,840
um and was soon asked to be a teacher of of the the practice that he was being

36
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,239
taught but that they didn't bring him any true freedom there was no lasting

37
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:55,959
impact of the experience so then he turned toward complete renunciation and

38
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:02,400
aseticism and ex and pursued extreme restriction in his life and you know

39
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:10,799
there's this story that he got down to eating one grain of rice a day so and sleeping on you know nails

40
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,920
and all kinds of things that they practice to try and learn how to endure

41
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:23,880
pain and um to not indulge oneself and any sensual pleasures

42
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,840
so this this um insight into this middle way

43
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:36,720
um actually occurred as he was nearly dying on the side of this you know river

44
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:44,400
bank I think he was on and some um person discovered him there and uh

45
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:51,600
offered him some food and so the Buddha was reflecting on

46
00:04:51,600 --> 00:05:00,000
you know all the striving he'd done in both directions of his life and he thought you know this is the

47
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:08,160
quote from Majima 36 the suta where he's reflecting on this experience and this

48
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,720
understanding of a middle way and it says you know the Buddha I thought whatever recluses or brahinss in the

49
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,639
past have experienced painful racking piercing feelings due to exertion this

50
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,240
is the utmost you know what he was he was going through but with this racking

51
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,320
practice of austerities I have not attained any distinction with higher

52
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,720
knowledge and vision i have not attained any distinction with higher

53
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,400
vision and and and knowing and so you know this was a

54
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,919
pretty major reflection for him to have and it said that his companions who had

55
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:56,080
been practicing austerities with him saw him eat and and thought "Oh he's given

56
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,639
up what a waste we're not going to follow or practice with him anymore." And they sort of

57
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:09,440
left and so here he was you know on his own um and choosing essentially to live

58
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,039
again right choosing to eat so that he could survive and he remembered he had a

59
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,800
memory of his of a childhood experience and this

60
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:28,319
memory was what sort of cracked open this idea of another way forward

61
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:36,280
and it was um a memory that I'll embellish with my own associations you know with with the

62
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:42,560
experience in the simple way in the suta it's described as him sitting on the

63
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,680
side of a field where his father was either involved with plowing or a ritual

64
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:56,800
of plowing and he was set under a rose apple tree so he was off on the side and

65
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:04,039
watching and and young right and so here's where I'll embellish

66
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:10,400
because let's imagine for a minute the scene being a young child with you're

67
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,759
you know been brought to this place by your parent and you've been sat down in

68
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:21,560
this spot i imagine with a blanket i imagine you know with water or whatever he

69
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:28,800
needed as you might as a parent imagine setting your child down and setting them up and saying "Okay you know just

70
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,319
relax." And he's under the shade of a tree and it's a rose apple tree so you

71
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:42,319
know maybe it was blooming and it smelt nice or there were apples who knows but he's I'm I'm imagining he's

72
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,520
quite comfortable quite content and his f he can see his dad so he's like "Okay

73
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,919
I'm I'm okay." And his dad is busy and doing this plowing thing or ritual we

74
00:07:53,919 --> 00:08:02,479
don't know exactly what way he was involved in this and he recalls the experience of

75
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:10,240
being there and um he describes it in terms

76
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:18,680
that are of it being radiant of um sort of this pleasant

77
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,879
abiding he actually describes it as a very pleasurable

78
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:29,280
experience but it wasn't an experience where he was actively generating or

79
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:36,120
creating pleasure right he was simply

80
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,760
available a a a present relaxed open

81
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:48,959
content and able to sort of establish essentially what we would

82
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:55,600
probably call the first Janna of of concentration it's this mind that is

83
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,519
connected and clear about what's happening we experience pleasure in our

84
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:09,680
body some sense of joy or um this this pleasant feeling of aliveness I might

85
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:15,240
describe it as feeling the vitality the energy of life in your

86
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,399
body and he was just abiding in this pleasant way so just taking a minute to

87
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:27,600
imagine this sort of simple setting and this feeling of contentment

88
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:34,160
that maybe the sun is warm you know this just I don't you don't need to go anywhere he doesn't

89
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,560
need to do anything and he can just sort of attend you know how when you're you

90
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:47,760
have something like your breath you're watching or your father that's plowing that has some sort of maybe routine or

91
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,839
repetition to it right as I imagine plowing would have and just relaxes into

92
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,080
this pleasant abiding and

93
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:07,120
so he he actually thought to himself he realized let me get a

94
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:13,240
drink ah this actually could be the path to

95
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:19,839
awakening a whole different idea not pursuing this intense experience and not

96
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:26,160
pursuing intense pain and and denial and in that moment he stopped all

97
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,519
the striving he bathed he ate he let go of

98
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:38,079
the extreme renunciation he was engaged in and he began down this path of the

99
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:44,680
middle way and so the Buddha you know in the

100
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:51,839
teachings you know sometimes we feel like we're not supposed to have pleasure or enjoy things but in fact it's it's

101
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,959
actually important for us to open to this kind of well-being that happens

102
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:04,320
that has its own natural arising it's not this hedonistic thing that we're chasing and creating and trying to kind

103
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,240
of amplify but rather this open receptive experience of allowing

104
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,600
ourselves to connect with life in the

105
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:24,959
moment and how it feels in the body letting ourselves rest in these

106
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:32,640
ways so there's this is maybe again this idea of this not doing and not non-doing

107
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:39,839
but rather this receptivity this availability maybe even taking a moment

108
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,680
right now to turn your awareness

109
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:54,279
inward and just see what happens to open up to be a available to

110
00:11:54,279 --> 00:12:03,040
experience whatever sensations of uplift or life or energy or the breath you can

111
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:10,600
receive right here can you touch into an experience that

112
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:17,040
feels receptive

113
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:27,360
available contented is it enough can it be enough to open up in

114
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,600
this way

115
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:45,240
so just noting what you're able to be aware of and whatever it is being contented enough with

116
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,720
it but could you touch into the experience of being here could you open

117
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:57,680
yourself up to being available to feeling your breath feeling the life moving through

118
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,680
you

119
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:12,959
so this idea of being available for life being available to

120
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:19,079
ourselves to our needs to kind of responding to what's going

121
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:24,760
on to me is a pretty profound thing

122
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:35,839
not grabbing at things and not pushing away not spacing out but rather being present and available so this middle way

123
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,360
right

124
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:50,480
and maybe another word I could use is this kind of intimacy a willingness to be touched by

125
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,680
what's happening in the moment touched by the sensations touched by the impact

126
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:03,480
of a thought or an experience available you know here

127
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:12,079
so another thing that I explore when I'm thinking about how do I hold this because it's not in the in the teachings

128
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:17,240
that we're we're supposed to become flaccid and non-engaged in our lives

129
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:24,160
right and yet there's also teachings that say just let things be the way they are so I think one thing that is helpful

130
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:30,079
for me when I think about you know this way of be be something between doing and

131
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:38,560
non-doing is I think about wise intention wise intention includes the renunciation

132
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:44,079
of clinging the renunciation of wanting you

133
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:49,240
know to kind of get this and that and get rid of this and

134
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,839
that and non-ill will is the second part of

135
00:14:54,839 --> 00:15:02,959
wise intention which has to do with cultivating or kind of being in a mind

136
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,760
state that has this wish for well-being for everyone what's called loving

137
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:14,880
kindness and a sense of caring about the suffering and a mind that is free from

138
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,480
hatred and anger so maybe this non-doing doing of

139
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,600
non-illwill is a real simple noting and not feeding hatred and

140
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:33,800
anger and instead being available with a heart that is compassionate and with

141
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:39,320
well-wishes and then this third component of wise intention is

142
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:45,199
non-harming so this is you know not wanting to harm ourselves others or both

143
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:51,399
and maybe this is the non-doing or the doing the non-doing doing of

144
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:58,480
non-harming is just essentially not doing actions that cause harm so there's

145
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,800
a doing in that and it's a non-doing in that

146
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:14,040
so this Buddha's moment of the under the rose apple tree

147
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:19,320
moment this kind of natural state that arises also let's put that in

148
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:26,079
perspective this is something that naturally arose right when when and and

149
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:31,360
states of concentration will naturally arise when we are present for our

150
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,440
experience in a particular doing non-doing way

151
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:43,120
And you know this is what helped him in his practice and you know at some point

152
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,240
in my own practice I recognized I had experiences in my

153
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,720
childhood too that helped me when I was having difficulty on a on the

154
00:16:53,720 --> 00:17:03,279
cushion when I was struggling on a retreat and I remembered in my childhood

155
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:09,038
it was an experiences of going on a boat with my father when

156
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:14,720
he was fishing now I didn't fish you know but I would go on the boat

157
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:21,839
with him and I would just lay on the seat and I would just be listening to

158
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:30,039
the sounds and feeling the rocking of the boat and the sun and I would do it for

159
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:36,480
hours just hours and I didn't wasn't a you know anxious to get back or to do

160
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,400
anything i was just in this state that reminds me of the Buddha you know what he was doing

161
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,080
sitting you know under the rose apple tree and that that was so helpful for me

162
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,440
to connect with my own memory and so I wonder you know I just

163
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,960
would invite you to think about what maybe you too have had some moments that

164
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:05,600
naturally arose in your life that were like this where you were just resting down

165
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:13,240
resting back and available that you naturally accessed this sort of quality of

166
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,880
being quality of presence

167
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:30,480
yeah so you know we maybe you could nod your heads can

168
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:38,160
you think of experiences maybe even on a yoga mat in shasana at the end of a practice you know right have you

169
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:46,720
experienced just a taste maybe or Yeah and so these these reme memberings these

170
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,799
moments these experiences can be very supportive when we're sitting in

171
00:18:51,799 --> 00:19:01,240
meditation to recall and and they kind of just remind the mind we know how the mind knows

172
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:08,160
how can remind us of that feeling and that can help us also access that state

173
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:16,640
potentially at various times or at least know what's possible so another part that's um

174
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:23,679
important when we think about this is obviously well what gets in the way why doesn't this happen for

175
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,960
us more often it's certainly possible we're all nodding our heads you know to

176
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,960
some extent or another and so you know actually one of the things that the Buddha really talked

177
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:43,440
about were the five hindrances that obstruct this kind of experience so the five hindrances are

178
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:51,280
sensual desire so this really wanting more pleasure ill will hatred right um

179
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:58,000
sloth and torper so being so sleepy or so low in energy one isn't really

180
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,240
mentally available you could say that when we have a lot of strong sensual desire we

181
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,440
aren't really available either you know how that feeling is when I got to have

182
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:16,799
this and we're consumed with trying to get or create or manifest something so

183
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:23,280
we it's hard to be available if somebody walks up and wants to talk to us we're sort of like you got to wait

184
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:30,559
and the same with ill will right when we're feeling a lot of hostility it's pretty hard to stop and

185
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:37,520
listen pretty hard to be receptive to feedback or to even you know even

186
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:45,519
pausing to pick up something if you drop it you know just something even so simple we can be so

187
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:52,559
consumed and then the fourth is restlessness and remorse so this energy

188
00:20:52,559 --> 00:21:00,159
of kind of a churning kind of energy an inability to settle in the body and in

189
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:05,200
the mind again how available can we be

190
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,919
to life when we're really consumed by these very common you know hindrances

191
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:18,720
that arise for all of us and the last is doubt when we're questioning the

192
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:26,720
teaching when we're questioning our practice or capacity it's pretty hard to show up for

193
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,440
you know the breath when we're consumed with doubt

194
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:38,400
and so one of the the simileies that the Buddha uses to describe these hindrances

195
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:47,280
and the impact that they have is he talks about a river and the flow of water and so for

196
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:54,080
me I I like this simile this flow of water which actually feels very similar

197
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:00,960
to the state of being really open and relaxed and available to life to me it

198
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,559
feels like I am there's not this caughtness stuckness and there's this

199
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:14,960
flow with the experience and the sensations and the things that are going on and so that when this there can be

200
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,480
this momentum that starts to you know go with this flow and maybe simply thinking

201
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:28,159
about you know riding a raft in a a a river and how you can be carried and and

202
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:35,520
it can flow nicely or you can find yourself drifting off

203
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:42,480
getting lost in the swirls and the eddies and you know sort of find the current slacks too much and you're not

204
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,880
really moving or you start to hit the bottom of the river and and then this

205
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:54,960
flow is interrupted and in a similar way the Buddha is describing the flow of our

206
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,080
practice um as a flow of the river that when

207
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:06,400
there's these outlets you know like when they open dams for example or there's

208
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:13,360
all these tributaries that are pulling water off of the river that they disrupt

209
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,799
that energetic flow is going with this

210
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:24,760
con you know kind of capacity of the mind to consolidate and

211
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:31,400
concentrate and so this is what he compared the hindrances to is these

212
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:39,039
outflows that they start to siphon off what really awareness right our capacity

213
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:46,559
to be available with awareness they siphon off our minds that can imagine

214
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:54,360
and storytell and that um you know gets caught in thinking and that

215
00:23:54,360 --> 00:24:01,400
energy affects the flow and so just even in my meditation tonight at one

216
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,880
point you know I was sort of thinking a little bit about the talk you know and

217
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,880
oh this or that and then I sort of oh recognized I was kind of in this

218
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:19,200
thinking space and not just available and present and as my awareness returned

219
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,159
to just being with my you know flow of

220
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:30,559
sensations there was actually a corresponding increase in energy in my

221
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:37,120
body felt there was an uplift of energy for me this is like oh this is getting

222
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:43,200
back into the flow the present moment experience you know the mind is

223
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,840
reconnected with being here being here being

224
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:56,960
here and in um one of the other sutras the Buddha describes and um the mind

225
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,960
when the mind is free from the five hindrances it becomes pliable malleable

226
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,240
and luminous and this becomes the ground for the arising of true knowledge and

227
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,559
insight so it's sort of like yeah you know like

228
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:19,720
this feeling of flow this feeling of collectedness this feeling of of

229
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:25,840
availability there is this malleability there is this ability to to adapt and

230
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:31,840
sort of shift with things and maybe there's this sense of

231
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:37,679
luminosity or this clarity or maybe some people use the word sparkle or the light

232
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,880
right this sort of You know how if you're just sitting outside and you are

233
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:50,880
really there things can seem so clear the seeing is so defined the

234
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,159
colors are so vibrant you know this what is as we

235
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:02,159
allow more of our awareness to just be here our senses open up they can take in

236
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:09,679
more sound more sight more smell more sensations and this adds to this feeling

237
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:17,840
of aliveness in my experience and Ajan Amo he's one of the

238
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:24,960
poly you know he's a a monk and a teacher and a writer and a translator

239
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,679
and and he wrote the way beyond the hindrances is not through

240
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:36,960
suppression but through befriending through befriending well

241
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:43,039
what do friends do what do friends do a a good spiritual

242
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:47,360
friend how do they support you when you're

243
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:56,120
suffering anybody want to They listen they listen they They companion

244
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:02,919
us right they They're there so wow here

245
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:08,480
again something between doing and non-doing something about being

246
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:15,720
available befriending being available so we it is a a way of responding to the

247
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:21,240
hindrances but it's it's not what you know this idea of I got to go get rid of

248
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:27,159
them but it's also not this idea of I just have to sit back and do

249
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:34,360
nothing because it it they deserve and require some presence some

250
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:41,840
response and so how do we befriend them how do we start to be present in a way

251
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:47,600
with them so that they stop siphoning off our attention and

252
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,559
energy so another really important part of this is this idea of

253
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:03,679
embodiment right to to be in our bodies here's a quote or a thought we're not

254
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:11,360
heads on sticks you know we are sensing feeling bodies and this practice is not just

255
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,640
about working with our thoughts it is actually about how we live and how we

256
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:23,279
are and connected to our body and our mindfulness and mindfulness of the body is the one thing the Buddha said you

257
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:28,440
have to practice it is foundational for

258
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:35,120
us and Terra Brock writes "Embodied presence is the ground of loving the

259
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,720
very essence of wisdom and

260
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:47,559
compassion so when we're in the body and we're con connected to the body we're connected to what's

261
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:52,960
real we're connected to nowness

262
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:59,520
and it could be nowness of fear and it could be nowness of love and any of it

263
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,760
can all help us be present and awake and

264
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:15,200
available so in conclusion I just want to say this

265
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:21,440
middle way is you know not there's no set perfect

266
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:28,760
balance the river is always changing conditions are always

267
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:36,840
changing it's about staying with what's happening and skillfully being with

268
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:44,559
it not non-doing and not overdoing you know not leaning too far

269
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:51,200
one way or the other or when we do we recognize that we come back into a more balanced place and sometimes when the

270
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:58,399
current's really pushing this way maybe we have to lean hard the other way you know and then it'll change and if we

271
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:05,320
keep leaning hard the other way we're just going to fall in right so it's this adaptability this flow this staying

272
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:11,960
connected and available and embodied right

273
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:19,360
so um there's a person Winston Higgins who says the middle way is not a line

274
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:26,279
but a path not a point of perfect balance but a way of walking with care with

275
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:30,760
curiosity and with kindness

276
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:37,600
so may we walk this way together with some care with curiosity

277
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,840
with presence and connection to our experience remember to

278
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:50,158
befriend each other and our hindrances and ourselves along the

279
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,840
way so with that I'll pause and just see if there's any response any comments any

280
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:03,880
questions let's get you the microphone

281
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:12,559
like this it's okay um when you were talking about befriending Yeah i was

282
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:19,600
thinking of the roomie poem called the guest house where he talks about welcome all of your

283
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:25,279
feelings welcome them as bring them in as welcome guests and have tea with them

284
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:31,039
yeah so that's about welcoming yes that's a beautiful poem i use I

285
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:38,159
reference and think about that one quite a bit actually yes i had one more thought when you were talking uh in the

286
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:45,760
beginning about um being present i was thinking how how much that

287
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:51,519
requires a certain equinimity to be able to do that to to be present

288
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:57,360
in the way you were available was the word you used yeah so being available

289
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:03,120
means you have to be economous i think that goes together yeah and maybe

290
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:09,840
there's I have sometimes have this image of you know um outrigger canoes you know what an outrigger canoe

291
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,440
is so it's this big canoe but they have these two um arms and then these

292
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:22,399
supporting beams in the water and I like to think about this as compassion and wisdom and they they really help

293
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:29,279
stabilize us right and and that's equinimity which is the stabilizing you

294
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:34,559
know and is embodied wisdom and compassion so that we can kind of all

295
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:41,120
right we're in the ride thank you for sharing those yeah

296
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,120
great

297
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,279
thank you so much thank you so is Yeah

298
00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:00,799
maybe just turn the volume up okay thank you so much for uh sharing the middleway

299
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:07,519
path i love it they're in the middle of doing and non-doing um so recently I

300
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:14,240
went to I joined the one of the retreat in IRC the 20s and 30s one or several

301
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,679
beautiful beautiful yeah it was very nice experience it was my first retreat

302
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:26,480
ah great yeah so um I I had great I mean it was challenging but also had great

303
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:32,080
experience there i felt a lot um my question is like when I come back I felt

304
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:40,000
the integration process yeah i mean related to what also what you talk the integration process was super hard i

305
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,880
feel like my integration was super slow it took me literally two weeks to get back even though the retreat was only

306
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:54,159
one week yeah um yeah on my second day that I came back so there was a lake by

307
00:33:54,159 --> 00:34:00,240
my home usually I really love looking at water i love water like looking at water

308
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:06,320
make me feel peace all kinds of water lake river sea ocean

309
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:13,358
usually I go to the lake I see the see the water make me feel so peace and the second day when I came back to the lake

310
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:20,839
I was like oh my god I can't look at this lake it's it's it's it's too much information my mom's like "Where is the

311
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:27,240
information?" I'm like "It's too much information you can't look at the like." Anyway I took several

312
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:33,118
days off from the work before I go back to a work but still when I go back to

313
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:40,000
work um also take it easy but I still I found myself super sensitive to anything any

314
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:47,200
information the brain is literally shut down yeah well it gets it it you know that is

315
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,560
the point of retreat in part is we get increasingly sensitive

316
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:58,880
uhhuh increasingly sensitive and the let me you know I don't know if you've heard

317
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:05,000
about the simileies of water used for the hindrances but it's um

318
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,440
water to me is a metaphor that is used to describe the mind and the mind that

319
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,800
is clear and the mind that has hindrances in it and so the mind that is

320
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:23,520
calm and clear is like you know a bo bowl of water body of water that you

321
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:29,920
could look in and clearly see your reflection that there's enough you know

322
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:35,599
sort of the stability and capacity to see clearly what you know yourself or

323
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:41,720
what your mind or what's going on but a mind affected by the hindrance is like when you get off

324
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:48,400
retreat it can feel like it is there's just um this

325
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:55,359
overwhelm and so it could feel like restlessness and you know sort of remorse and this feeling of like the

326
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:00,640
water is completely stirred up you can't see your reflection it's like wind

327
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,240
blowing on the water and all the waves and so in a way looking at the water and

328
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:14,079
and having difficulty maybe it was just sort of reflecting back to you um how jumbled up

329
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:21,160
the mind felt the other water similes are for desire it's like the water is

330
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:27,640
rosecoled and so you can't see clearly hint the um ill will is like boiling hot

331
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:34,960
water sloth and torper is like water filled with um slime and and moss and

332
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,880
doubt is like the water that is muddy and so it's like you know this beautiful

333
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,920
connection you have with the dharma here I think and and noticing in a way you're

334
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:53,520
seeing your own mind you're seeing the water and you're noticing your own mind's reaction to sort of life and all

335
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,000
the stuff that's happening around you that's just my offering but it takes

336
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,320
time does take time to learn how to practice re-entry

337
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:12,000
yeah um so I was well so when I reentered to my own life

338
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,520
um because I get so sensitive when I work

339
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:23,200
and like I notice my body tense up when I'm thinking right when I'm con I

340
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:29,520
noticed it immediately tense up like the body get heat when I think yes um which

341
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:35,440
is good because I could notice this yes but on the other side I do need to think

342
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:41,119
you know so I I felt there is a conflict between

343
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:48,640
this practice and the using it in my normal life and I believe it should be

344
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,160
able to help me with my normal life but I'm so confused by this conflict and I

345
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:59,520
was because of this confusion I feel like really need some teachers guidance on this

346
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:06,680
yeah yeah absolutely it's hard to find this kind of balance and you

347
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:12,960
know and it's hard to and to notice maybe even like your h the hindered

348
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,560
reaction to the mind and the body's um

349
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:24,800
response to being back in busy life where you're thinking you know you you're having what

350
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:31,920
you might call a double hindrance attack perhaps you know where your mind is getting all stirred up your body is

351
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:38,560
impacted you're feeling the heat and then you don't like it my guess is you don't have like it so you have you know

352
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:46,240
restlessness and worry and then you have the hindrance added of ill will on top of it not liking

353
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:53,280
and so you know what we start to learn how to do over time is okay this is the

354
00:38:53,280 --> 00:39:00,800
impact of course I got so settled and so attuned and now I'm noticing all these things I don't normally notice can I

355
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:07,839
just befriend my experience and not add to the difficulty by wishing it were

356
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:15,440
different or wanting to get through it or you know sort of struggling with it or doubting your practice you know um

357
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:21,920
afterwards and trust that over time you will find your way to be with

358
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:28,359
it all and you know we can't you're right we're we're h

359
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:34,320
householders you we have the choice we could go become monks or nuns and

360
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:40,320
renounce our daily lives but we don't have to we can live in this world and

361
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,440
find find our way yeah i think my hope I

362
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,960
always think and believe mindfulness should be helping with our life in every

363
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:57,960
single aspect and yeah that's the whole I mean it

364
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:05,119
is designed in that way it it works in that way it does yeah yeah yeah it does

365
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:10,039
yeah thank you thank you

366
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:18,079
any other uh reflections additions maybe things people want feel like we're left

367
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:25,839
out or you know you not sure exactly about you know what I was suggesting or

368
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,839
yeah great right

369
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:39,760
over thank you for your talk um I haven't heard previously about the

370
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:45,920
I think interplay between compassion and wisdom uhhuh and um I spend a fair

371
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:55,680
amount of time uh attending to compassion and I'm just um trying to integrate the

372
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:02,480
addition of wisdom and one wondering if you have more words to say about that imagine it's a huge topic but yeah so

373
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:08,000
I'll try and be super simple about it first that it's often called the wings

374
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:16,160
the two wings of awakening that to fly to sail we need both the wisdom and

375
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:22,720
the [Music] compassion and the the thing about

376
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:29,280
wisdom in the dharma is that it's not it's the wisdom

377
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,560
that we earn through direct experience

378
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:40,720
it's the wisdom that took you to the practice of compassion it's the wisdom that in you

379
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,400
that knew this was harming i'm harming myself i'm harming others i don't want

380
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:53,280
to do that anymore it's that kind of wisdom and that kind of wisdom that you

381
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,400
know requires direct engagement with the teachings of the

382
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:04,400
Buddha and then noticing what is revealed

383
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,440
it's that kind of wisdom

384
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:17,160
yeah I think I I hear you thank you yeah so it it's good to

385
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:24,760
um Yeah it's good to sort of start to maybe recognize the wisdom that is operating with you in the compassion

386
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:30,920
world and and it is good to to be attuning to the

387
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:37,920
balance because it is you know as in all things it is easy to go too far one way

388
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:44,960
or the other too much wisdom and it's too too harsh and cold and you know

389
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:52,240
brittle too much compassion and it's soft and mushy and we get lost

390
00:42:52,240 --> 00:43:00,319
so kind of needing this Goldilocks porridge Goldilocks bed this

391
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:07,800
sort of something in the middle thank you for your

392
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:15,599
question so it's 8:28 i think it's time to end right yeah

393
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:23,599
so thank you all and um may you you know may you walk out feeling available

394
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:29,440
to the night air to whatever next happens whoever

395
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:36,599
next you encounter whatever next emotion or thought arises may you find yourself

396
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:42,400
available present and you know in this flow in

397
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:49,880
