and can we meet it with kindness can we meet it with compassion

40
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,340
not wanting or forcing it to be any other way but

41
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,839
softening around it breathing around it

42
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,639

43
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:23,899
similarly breathing with it with kindness with compassion

44
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:33,439
letting go of the stories but staying with the feeling the sensations

45

151
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:40,380
it becomes compassion that's what compassion is meeting suffering with kindness not meeting suffering with

152
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:46,440
ignoring it or oh I wish it was otherwise or pushing it away or or anger

165
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:11,700
um or or this category sometimes are put together as we did putting together in traditional teachings they're separate

166
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:17,820
benefactor and dear friend are separate but here we have five days and we usually bring them

167
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:24,060
um together so so this category actually a lot of

168
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:31,500
times for people of practicing with the deer being with these categories

169
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:36,720
um we can fall into what's called empathetic distress and compassion can

170
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:44,220
become it what's called its near enemy in the teachings so

171
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:51,960
um in the classical language there is a near enemy and there is a far enemy of all these practices the near enemy is

172
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:59,400
something that feels like compassion it masquerades it as compassion but is not

173
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:05,220
compassion it's actually it's enemy but it's such a near enemy it's like uh

174
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:13,338
so in one near enemy of compassion or one masquerader if you want to use

175
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:20,700
um the not the classical language but the masquerader is is empathic distress

176
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:26,460
empathetic distress and empathic distress is um

177
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:34,020
is when you meet when you when you acknowledge the suffering of of someone

178
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:40,260
who's dear to you and this could happen for yourself as well of course it's not just for others but um but for example

179
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:48,180
I'm going to use the example of others you you you meet their suffering but but you become

180
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:55,200
so engaged so engaged with the suffering and the kindness the Goodwill is not

181
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:02,280
strong enough to hold it so it falls into just suffering so you're just suffering you're you're not holding it

182
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:09,060
with enough Good Will it's out of balance compassion when the good will when the kindness

183
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:15,900
is out of balance with meeting suffering it's hip tips tips into to empathic

184
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:20,940
distress and empathic distress could feel like grief can feel like oh this is

185
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:29,400
so hard I can't do this I come um I just oh the compassioned burnout

186
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:36,599
um in fact there is no compassion burnout because compassion is always balanced with with kindness this

187
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:42,960
empathic burnout when we're just empathizing when we're just feeling someone's pain and if you keep feeling

188
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:51,060
someone's pain without the kindness to that Salve to support the feeling

189
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:58,560
um then of course it's just too painful so empathic distress empathic distress

190
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,900
also it feels like if somebody is in the waves and they're suffering you jump

191
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:11,099
into the waves with them and now you're both drowning that and it's not helpful to anyone empathic distress or as

192
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:18,060
compassion there's a sense of stability and you're inviting them you're extending a loving hand and

193
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:25,380
you're holding their hand you're extending a branch to to in in your heart to wish them well you're feeling

194
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:32,339
you're observing your you are with their suffering but there's so much kindness and Goodwill that and stability of

195
00:40:32,339 --> 00:40:38,040
equanimity that you're not falling into the suffering with them this is a very

196
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:45,599
important distinction I'm trying to make because many people think that uh say oh

197
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:51,839
I can't do compassion it's too hard it's too painful actually it's empathic distress that's

198
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:56,940
painful so you might they might be you might have been I we might have been

199
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:03,300
practicing empathic distress not compassion practicing compassion actually feels

200
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:10,320
good it feels lovely it's uplifting it it uplifts your heart to your body your

201
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:17,400
mind it's it has a nurse it feels good the the excuse me

202
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:25,040
ringing bringing in some um some practice some

203
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:31,440
research results so so when people are practicing

204
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:38,760
empathic distress when they're just feeling the suffering not full compassion but just empathizing

205
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:44,700
areas of the brain networks of the brain light up in fmri and this has been

206
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:51,619
studied by Tanya singer and others uh clemeki and others or lots of papers

207
00:41:51,619 --> 00:41:59,220
where the area of the brain the networks that light up are just the networks of pain and and

208
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:04,619
um if you watch someone be for example uh if you watch a video of of someone

209
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:12,000
being poked the same area of your brain that has to do with with these uh with pain for this hand it will light up so

210
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,599
similarly um that only the empathy part if you're feeling someone else's pain if you're

211
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:24,180
just empathizing areas of your brain that only have to do with pain they light up so of course they'll just be

212
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:32,220
painful pain pain you don't want to do that however studies if someone in the fmri actually

213
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:38,640
is instructed and they know and this has been actually studied with Matthew Rickard the the

214
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:44,280
um uh long-term Monk and really person who

215
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:50,820
knows compassion practice of compassion and others too with the practice of compassion both

216
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:57,560
there is the feeling of the the excuse me the areas of the brain

217
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:02,640
that that light up when you feel someone else's pain light up but also another

218
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:09,119
all these other networks light up that have to do with with kindness with with

219
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:15,180
filial attachment with warmth with love with with all of those so these two

220
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:20,880
together make up compassion it's not just feeling someone else's Pain ooh that's just

221
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:27,180
pain and it's not sustainable but it compassion holds this so both of these

222
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:35,579
networks when they all light up oh yeah it's actually a beautiful practice we're cultivating our heart to meet pain with

223
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:41,220
love with kindness and it feels good it feels good there's bitter sweetness

224
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:46,980
there's a tenderness so explore that for yourself please um

225
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:53,940
and the last quick thing I want to bring up is non-attachment to outcomes and

226
00:43:53,940 --> 00:44:00,000
we do this practice we do this cultivation both not attached

227
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,200
to outcome you know we're not going to call the person okay so I've been doing compassion for you is all your pain gone now it's okay attachment to outcome

228
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,300
externally and also attachment to outcome internally and this could be a

229
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:19,079
little a little confusing because yes we are doing this practice to cultivate compassion but not attachment to results

230
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:24,720
right now okay I didn't feel anything in this practice you know I didn't feel this Universal compassion that I've

231
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:31,500
heard about I didn't feel it right now what what why not why not you're planting seeds trust that they

232
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:37,140
will they will actually um they will flower these seeds will

233
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:44,339
flower in their own time so have patience you are doing your part you are doing your own cultivation you're doing

234
00:44:44,339 --> 00:44:51,440
your peace and let go of the rest do your best let go of the rest

235
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:58,140
so much more to say about the practice of compassion there are more near enemies maybe I'll I'll discuss them

236
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:06,420
tomorrow PT being one of them I'll discuss that and um May you practice compassion today

237
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:12,720
and NP and two to both feeling the the suffering but but holding it with with

238
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:20,040
love with care both for yourself and for others and tune into how differently that feels than just feeling the pain

239
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:27,900
and you can explore that for yourself and see that yeah it's very different one is nourishing the other is not the

240
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:36,060
other one is just pain wishing you well the rest of the day

241
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:42,180
with your practice opportunities for practice there are plenty of them life on Earth is

242
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:48,420
challenging for all of us being being human is hard work and actually being on

243
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:51,859
Earth is difficult so thank you
