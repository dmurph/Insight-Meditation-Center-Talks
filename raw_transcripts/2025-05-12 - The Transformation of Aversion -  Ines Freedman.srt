1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,759
as Martha said um I was just asked to uh give this talk uh yesterday uh because

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,440
Anushka was feeling ill and um so um so

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:21,000
I just want to send my good wishes all her good wishes to Anushka that she feel better soon

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,279
um so um so the Buddhist said I teach one

5
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:34,000
thing and one thing only suffering and the end of suffering

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,640
and um and in the practice um he points out to the um these three roots of suffering

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:50,000
that we all have uh greed hatred and delusion and all our afflictive mental

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,559
states arise from those three qualities uh from u greed you know that

9
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:04,720
includes all the hatred and all the um all the minor irritations we have um I I

10
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,119
mean uh aver did I say hatred okay I think I said the wrong word so greed

11
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,159
includes all the desires we have obviously and hatred all the you know

12
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:23,680
huge variety of ill will that we have in the world you know and uh delusion is

13
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,720
kind of our obliviousness to what's really happening at any given moment um

14
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,640
which anybody who's looked at their own minds um has found a lot of that right

15
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,000
um and so um you know these deeply

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,560
influences in everything we do how we respond to each other how we react in

17
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,880
the world um but but the one thing is that within each one of these

18
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:59,920
forces is the seed for transforming into wisdom it's like the desire that we have

19
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:08,080
that the greed we have is that same force that says God I want to be free of the suffering so within each one there's

20
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,239
that seed um the the thing that pushes away everything you know I hate that i I

21
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:21,200
don't want that that's irritating that's the same seed that allows us to see how

22
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:29,200
to how to train the mind in being wholesome um and within delusion is the

23
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,120
the quality of you know you walk in you know nothing matters you know everything

24
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:42,560
you know you know step on the puddle you don't even notice your feet are wet um and you know that that leads to has the

25
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:49,120
seed for equinimity for a very um sweet state that it notices the puddle but

26
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,360
doesn't get upset about it if we made a mistake so in each one of those roots is

27
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,360
also the healing of that root and today I'll focus on um the root

28
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,680
of uh hatred and the transformation of hatred into

29
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,760
wisdom um so I'll start with you know um a

30
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:18,560
metaphor that many of you have heard I know uh but I but it's um it's so um

31
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,680
makes a point that I really like to use it uh in Buddhist psychology you know we

32
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:31,560
often call the um these three personality types um uh greed hatred and

33
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:39,760
delusion uh as the desire type the um aversion type and the delusion type and

34
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:48,519
it just means that in our personalities those forces are a little bit more prominent and the metaphor we use

35
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:55,599
um is um you know um imagine that we're going to a party of um you know some

36
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:03,680
wealthy people and uh the desired type walks in and there's this awesome view i

37
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,720
mean really beautiful beautiful view and they're just like wow this is amazing

38
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:15,280
but within moments the mind says um I want that and you know I want to buy a

39
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:22,400
house just like this where I can have that kind of view and maybe I should change my my job and get a better job

40
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,759
and make more money and and and you know that view is no longer appreciated or

41
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:35,600
seen right um the aversion type walks in and they see the stain in the corner on

42
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,759
the carpet um they you know they look over at the food food trays you know and

43
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,800
God it's just full of junk food you know and and the music is just oh you know

44
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,160
how could they pick that kind of music and don't get me started on the guests you

45
00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:00,639
know and um the the delusion type walks in kind

46
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:07,560
of oblivious to everything and including the fact that there was a huge sign at the door that said "Please take off your

47
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:14,720
shoes." And um and everybody else took off their shoes and they're all in their stockings feet and and they just walk

48
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:22,280
right in with their shoes you know so these are like these stereotypes or these personality types it's way

49
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,759
oversimplified but we all have all of them in some way or the other just

50
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:35,639
sometimes some personalities predominate one over the other um

51
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,120
um so you know these um these uh roots

52
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,360
are referred to as the torments of the mind you know and um they're ready to

53
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,240
torment us incredibly quickly and um and I'll give you an

54
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,560
example you know um early in my practice um my husband and I had been discussing

55
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,479
you know we went to dharmat talk and we're discussing the topic of letting go of attachments

56
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:13,360
um you know and we've been kind of discussing different aspects of letting go of attachments over a couple of days

57
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,680
and um and you know I woke up the next morning and I was in a really good mood you know and I was really looking

58
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,919
forward to my fresh cup of coffee and um I had in my hand and I was just about to

59
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,080
take a sip uh when my husband just grabs it out of my

60
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:39,080
hand and like that you know I went from a great mood to really pissed

61
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:47,039
off and and um you know and it's like all three defilements showed up you

62
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:53,440
right I wanted that coffee desperately i was really angry and I was really

63
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,720
completely delusional and not seeing the huge grin on his face right he didn't

64
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,039
mean it you know it was he was just teasing but he sure that was his way of continuing the

65
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:13,000
conversation about clinging um so um so you know the

66
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,639
the first step for for really uh

67
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,400
creating this transformation is recognizing aversion

68
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,520
hatred ill will all those different forms when it shows up

69
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,720
and it's amazing how often we don't see it i mean if we're really angry we kind

70
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,520
of know it um but uh it can take so many forms like just

71
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:47,360
resistance you know just a simple resistance you know walking into somewhere we don't want to be resistance

72
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,840
resistance we're not happy right um uh we can have uh very strong emotions you

73
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:00,400
know like like getting pissed off over the coffee or you know something's just not warm enough the coffee just isn't

74
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,800
warm enough we have all these little things that aversion shows up and those

75
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:14,000
of you who just sat for the last 35 minutes probably had a little bit of version show up at some point you know

76
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,280
where you know maybe the breath wasn't quite to our liking and instead of just noticing oh that's a rough breath you

77
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:27,440
know we're like you know okay let me make it better let me fix it there's something to fix you know so these these

78
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:35,640
habits of mind of resisting what's unpleasant are very very strong in us

79
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,880
um and you know half of our lives uh I

80
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,080
don't know if it's half but a really large months of our life uh includes

81
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,680
unpleasant experience right how much of the time do you go outside and the

82
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:59,040
weather is perfect you know you're dressed just right there's no chill it's not it's just just the right temperature

83
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,720
you get more of that in California but um but but still You know it's like uh

84
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,320
oh I I should put something warmer on you know just these little very let me turn on the air conditioner you know how

85
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,800
many of us just turn on the air conditioner for the minor minor unpleasantness sometimes uh or turn on

86
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:23,880
the heat when it's just just minorly unpleasant you know we're so in the habit of trying to always find the most

87
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:31,880
comfortable um and um Oops excuse me

88
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:39,360
getting trapped here um you know so if we look at our at our

89
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,279
life you know one of the things that I I learned um on retreat um you know in

90
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,760
retreat when we go on on the inside retreats we usually have like a work

91
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:57,040
meditation and um you know my first several retreats my work meditation was chopping vegetables which is really I

92
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,800
really enjoyed that uh but the next retreat was cleaning toilets you know

93
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,000
and it's a oh what a bummer you know I just wasn't happy about it but it was

94
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,480
one of the most wonderful practices because you know you're committed to being mindful to doing the job

95
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:22,000
mindfully and it's very very different if we clean a toilet resentfully we

96
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,959
clean it like okay let me do it and try to get it over with as quickly as possible um or you clean it mindfully

97
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:36,120
and to the point where wow this is really fun i'm enjoying cleaning the toilet you know I didn't think that was

98
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:42,000
possible um and it completely changed my relationship to the things we do at work

99
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,440
you know it's not that there wasn't sometimes an unpleasant smell you know or um or it was awkward or there was

100
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,800
something I didn't like about it but there was a way that we can show up for

101
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,000
that that doesn't darken our hearts that doesn't contract us you know we can be

102
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,800
doing the same activity and do it happily or do it miserably

103
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:11,720
so um so ill will can be described as an

104
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,680
unfriendly or hostile disposition it can be towards anything

105
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:25,920
anything at all you know we often think of it as towards people you know hatred towards people but um since we hate

106
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,040
ideas right there's lots of ideas these days we hear on the news that that

107
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,320
hatred can arise um we hate um uh

108
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,920
emotions that we don't like we hate uh physical sensations we

109
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:50,279
don't like and we can hate objects um you know an example um

110
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:59,279
um you know this is like decades ago um someone gave me this um uh uh a potter a

111
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:06,240
potter gave me um a a head you know and it was like kind of ugly and devilish

112
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:13,680
looking but it was kind of interesting you know and so you know I put on the mantle you know and um another friend

113
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:21,680
came over and picked it up and go and they dropped it and broke it

114
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,800
they were so repelled by it you know they had so much aversion that they

115
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:34,200
dropped it but we respond to objects that way too it's a m you know we can you know hate anything

116
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:39,800
right um you know another way that

117
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:48,079
um you know the verse of mind tends to um uh focus on what we don't like right

118
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:54,480
on what we don't like what what we disapprove of um but also it tends to

119
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,639
give that too much meaning so we can notice the stain on

120
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:07,360
the carpet but but we add we make it really important you know we can notice a chunk

121
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:14,959
food i mean you know no matter how how quantumous we are we still notice the chunk food yeah but we don't have to

122
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:20,720
contract our hearts around it and one way of of uh an example that that for me

123
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,959
is very uh poignant of how we do that you know when uh we're teenagers you

124
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:32,320
know and and um uh you get a pimple a little pimple on the face you know just

125
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:41,279
this one little pimple and you look in the mirror but what you actually see is 95% pimple right you know and I know

126
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,760
that from experience and um you know so we

127
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:53,880
overemphasize the the what's wrong with things the unpleasant

128
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:01,399
um you know for some of us aversion arises most easily with physical pain

129
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:08,279
um but I've seen minor discomforts be just

130
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:16,720
as irritating as as pushing against them um you know an itch you know uh have

131
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:23,040
have you I hope you've all had the the privilege of experiencing a really

132
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:29,199
strong itch and living through it you know but also living through it

133
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:34,720
mindfully mindfully you know with like oh that's unbearable well let's see if

134
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,560
it is unbearable you know and really not scratching it just hanging with it and

135
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:46,320
watching that strong strong sensation that feels unbearable

136
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:52,399
uh move through us and that's really the heart of the practice you can do all of the practice

137
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:58,160
of working with hatred in this in that way with that we can do with an itch and

138
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:04,560
so we can't do with an niche we're going to have a really hard time doing it with anything else anything really big so can

139
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:10,079
we do it with an itch before we try to do it with um maybe some political

140
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:17,920
figure we have less and friendly feelings towards um

141
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:26,720
um the other thing about anger is and um maybe some of you have experienced this

142
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:33,199
is that anger can sometimes be a motivator and um it brings up a lot of

143
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:40,880
energy right and so sometimes people get you know not only anger but aversion and

144
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,079
you know the the whole when I say anger I mean the whole realm of of u kind of

145
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:53,600
hostile energy that we might have and um it can motivate us to do things uh but

146
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,759
it's not a healthy source of energy and it actually ends up exhausting us it's

147
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,839
hard on our bodies and it's also not a sustainable

148
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:09,959
energy uh but we might be in the habit of using that to get our

149
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:16,320
energy you using stress to get our energy uh it's a little bit like um you

150
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,240
know when I was in school I'd wait till the last minute to study you know because I'd be so stressed you know my

151
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,600
my all the hormones were going through my body i had lots of energy to study uh

152
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,360
not the healthiest energy to study but but that's so that's what I got used to

153
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,519
but we can get even better energy much better energy from

154
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:45,519
inspiration from um enthusiasm inspiration really wonderful feelings

155
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:52,959
uh but so so there is another source for that strength in us uh besides that I

156
00:16:52,959 --> 00:17:00,160
mean anger makes us feel strong when we feel weak you know which can be really helpful when you're um you know fighting

157
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:06,079
the tiger right you know you want that extra physical strength but when we're

158
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:12,558
um just living a life you know living in a city like this living uh you know with

159
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:18,640
family and friends and work and and you know we uh we don't need that level of

160
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,558
um anger to get our energy

161
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:35,200
um so the way we practice with this in meditation is when those feelings arise

162
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:43,200
any feelings of aversion of irritation um there's usually a story

163
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,720
there's something that irritated us or something that we're angry about and we

164
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,559
turn our attention away from the story not rejecting it pushing away but just

165
00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:01,840
shifting the attention to how we feel in the body that's also happening in the moment what's happening in the moment

166
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,840
what is it like to be angry you know what at this moment it's not always the

167
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,919
same at this moment it's not an intellectual thing okay I know what happens when you get angry but it's in

168
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:20,880
this moment what does it feel like in my gut what does it feel like in my body you know um some people you know their

169
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,760
hands just tighten they grasp their knees some people their bellies get really tight uh some people a lot of

170
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,360
things get tight um so what is the experience like in our bodies you know

171
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:41,120
what's the experience of sadness in our bodies what's the experience of any strong emotions we have in our bodies um

172
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:47,039
so the story you know we don't if we don't need to feed that story we feed

173
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:53,880
the body that's being present with what's happening

174
00:18:53,880 --> 00:19:02,360
um you know the stories are a fuel to the unh wholesome

175
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:10,960
emotion um Joseph Goldstein said um aversion is transformed by interest you

176
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:17,760
can't push away what's happening and take an interest in it at the same time

177
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:24,160
right um it's another example

178
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:30,240
um you know some you know um many years ago um a friend was supposed to pick me

179
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,440
up from work and they forgot about me you know and I'm standing out there you

180
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,559
know it's getting to be dusk you know and and uh they're not showing up and of

181
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:48,559
course it was the days before cell phones and you know so I couldn't text them or reach them you know and I was

182
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:54,240
really angry you know I got really really angry and um you know and After

183
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:01,679
my anger subsided a bit then I started um you know uh thinking about okay you

184
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:08,240
know arranging to get a ride home you know and I found a a place to make a phone call and I took care of it and by

185
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:14,720
the time I got home I was pretty mellow you know I forgot all about it i started you know putting around the house doing

186
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:21,520
stuff um but when my husband got home much later uh I told him what happened

187
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:29,039
and and I got just as angry as when it had happened just retelling the story

188
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:36,320
retelling the story and you know and then really consider how often we retell

189
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:43,120
stories about our childhood or regrets or um you know or or things that just

190
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:49,919
happened um you know how often do we do that in our minds we tell the stories so

191
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:56,640
when we see that we're telling ourselves a story that's triggering these unh wholesome feelings

192
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:03,760
um you know it's it's just a habitual story you know this is just as real this

193
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,880
is just as authentic the story is not any more real than than what's happening

194
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:16,000
in our bodies right now um so the instructions are simple drop

195
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,120
the story go to the body

196
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:29,559
um you know and uh even though I know I mentioned the three three personality types humans tend to have a negativity

197
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:36,400
bias you know where uh we have the tendency to notice what's wrong with things and that's part it's what helps

198
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,480
us survive you know if we're out for a walk you know and to see a beautiful

199
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:47,360
sunset and we're uh really enjoy you know enjoying it and there's a tiger you

200
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:53,919
know we want to focus on the tiger not on the sunset right that's dangerous you

201
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,600
know so we're we tend to have that that little bit of a negativity bias uh but

202
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:06,000
it often kind of bleeds into the rest of our lives where uh we keep noticing we

203
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,799
meditate and we know you know my focus on what's wrong with our meditation what's wrong with us instead of how am I

204
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:22,480
right this moment what's happening right now you know but um um how the kind of attention

205
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:31,880
um we give this uh negative experiences we have is what is what transforms the

206
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:38,480
practice you know so we can give very kind attention I like the term affection

207
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:45,600
of curiosity you know so when anger rises it's not pretty right it's not pretty to

208
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:51,960
see anger to see hatred in ourselves but what happens when we give it affection or

209
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:59,760
curiosity ah this is what anger is like oh it hurts it hurts

210
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:08,440
Um and and this is actually a tool for developing

211
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:14,280
wisdom and um the ability to see what's

212
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:20,880
wrong it's also can also be used it's it's a it's an important aspect of the

213
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,799
mind that sees what's wrong it sees the tiger it sees the sunset it sees the

214
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:32,880
difference it's not oblivious um so in in pi we called

215
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,600
wisdom pa

216
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:44,000
um it refers to the deep understanding of reality a very deep deep

217
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,880
understanding of reality that's not an intellectual understanding but it's an understanding and insight that comes

218
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,000
from from practicing deeply and it's an understanding that

219
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:02,000
frees our hearts that actually allows us to be really at peace with our lives and

220
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:11,760
be at peace with the world um one aspect of wisdom is the ability

221
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:17,919
to see in any situation what's what decisions we make

222
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:23,520
that are going to be helpful and move us towards happiness and what decisions we

223
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:30,159
make that are not helpful and move us towards further suffering that seems intellectual it seems pretty obvious

224
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:35,200
right but it's actually it's amazing how often we make the the choice of moving

225
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,320
towards more suffering the habits of mind that makes continuous suffering

226
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:47,360
that feed our suffering uh like doom scrolling right it's not a habit that makes us happy and

227
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:55,440
yet a lot of us are stuck on those little devices um supporting and and strengthening or

228
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,559
ability to be to suffer ability to be unhappy

229
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:09,200
um subversion tends to divide things um what I want what I don't want what I

230
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:15,440
like what I don't like them and us um you know when we give too much

231
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:25,360
attention uh to what's wrong than to other aspects of them um uh it's a very that that

232
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:31,120
dividing of things creates more tightness and contraction in our hearts

233
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,440
but the same ability to see the differences between things can also

234
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:42,559
mature into what we call discerning wisdom so instead of saying that's what

235
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:47,600
I like that's what I don't like that's what I want that's what I don't want we

236
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:54,720
change the quality of that to oh this is helpful and this is unhelpful and that's

237
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,559
huge that that little bit of difference is is huge it's a heart that's at peace

238
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:07,520
you know it's like yeah we're in a difficult situation challenging situation how can I help what can I do

239
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:13,039
to help right now and uh you know we're in a uh you know

240
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:19,360
and we drop what's unhelpful um you know we may not like

241
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:25,919
the pain in our back i don't know they say one out of four people have chronic pain in any given moment so I know that

242
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:31,919
some of you have experienced some pain this last sitting uh but we can see that

243
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:39,039
when we pay attention we can see that our resistance to it or aversion to it the bad mood

244
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:46,320
um it doesn't help at all so the pain can be there and we can

245
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:54,000
have give it kind attention and it actually improves the sensations of pain they found that when

246
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:01,240
the mind is at peace uh the the sensations of pain are decreased

247
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:11,200
um and a different aspect of aversion um again this is a personal story in my

248
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,880
very early days of practice and I was at a board meeting you know and board

249
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:23,520
meetings you know um well I won't say anything I I'll I won't go

250
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:30,159
there my favorite thing to do um you know but I always was really good at

251
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:37,120
noticing what was wrong with a plan you know people bring up plans that always notice all the faults in it you know and

252
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:44,000
um And I wasn't shy about expressing my opinion and um but it seemed to me that

253
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,679
my role often was um to burst someone's bubble you know people come up with

254
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:55,919
these enthusiastic ideas great ideas that were really full of holes right and

255
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:01,760
and of course you know I would I would say give those holes and you know and

256
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:07,080
you know didn't make me very likable um and you know I felt resentful about it

257
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:12,600
contracted righteous you know and I rarely left those meetings feeling

258
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:18,000
good um but as I got to become more familiar with the inner workings of my

259
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,520
mind I began to see that you know it's really good to be able to see the holes

260
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,960
in things it's really able to see what's wrong with things i mean this is it may

261
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,960
not be a tiger but uh but that's going to fail if we do it that way right uh

262
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,559
but I didn't have to do that with a contracted heart i could do that with uh

263
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:47,760
with a lot of kindness and equinimity and um and and with time you know I

264
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:55,399
learned uh to express myself it it was useful uh but it also made collaboration

265
00:28:55,399 --> 00:29:00,559
fun you know which I'd never gone to a meeting or been involved in something

266
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:07,200
like that that was actually fun you know and I love collaborating with others now it's it's really great you know

267
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,240
different ideas pushing back and forth no not that way this way but it but done

268
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,200
in in with a really friendly open heart

269
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,200
um okay

270
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:35,440
you know in inside practice we call that tool that we use to to u noticing what's

271
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,720
helpful and not helpful investigation and you know we often talk

272
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:48,640
about investigation in med in inside practice you know investigating the moment investigating the breath um and

273
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,760
for instance um you know the really obvious practical thing is you know it

274
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,880
shows it the the difference uh between when the muscles are relaxed and when

275
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,000
they're tense right you know it's the investigation of the moment that lets us

276
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,600
see um I remember when I first start meditating I you know I first time I

277
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,440
realized I'd been sitting for like 15 minutes with my shoulders like this you know maybe some of you have had that

278
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:22,880
that insight right the insight into how we hold our bodies um you know and you

279
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:30,399
know sometimes the tension in the face you know the frowning and the all these habits you know and so we slowly use

280
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:36,960
that tool of investigation oh what's really happening here oh that's not helpful i can drop that oh that's

281
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:43,760
helpful i I can do more of that um you know in particular you know how

282
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:49,440
many of you have gone distracted right um you know in meditation right and so

283
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,279
sometimes you know I've gotten really lost and then I kind of see what I'm getting lost in you know it's like a

284
00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:01,520
fantasy I'm really enjoying you know I go I want to keep going so I I caught it

285
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:07,200
but I keep going right I'm so seduced by it you know and you know and the

286
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:13,840
investigation said you know says well you know here I am meditating what am I doing let's go back to meditation you

287
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:21,360
can fantasize anytime you know and it's like oh okay you know that attachment but that's

288
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:28,960
the practice it's like that's what we address the root of all our suffering is that clinging that clinging I just got

289
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:34,520
to keep going in that fantasy just got to do it you know that's what we're addressing in practice and that

290
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:40,240
flexibility of dropping the story and going and going back and doing it in a

291
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:46,480
kind manner it's like not putting down on ourselves that we just got distracted uh that we just spent the last 20

292
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:53,600
minutes of the meditation you know um you know planning a vacation you know and so yeah so we're

293
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:59,600
back home great wonderful kind attention that's what the clinging does you know

294
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:07,120
it's it's uh what we see how our minds work um and it's really easy easy to

295
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,880
investigate the quality of our minds at any given moment you know are we having

296
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:19,120
a kind attitude or an attitude of ill will for a really long time longer than

297
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:25,600
I want to than I want to say um I every time I came back to my breath

298
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:32,080
when I was distracted I would feel like I had just failed and so my attitude was like I

299
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:38,240
blew it i blew it back to the breath i blew it and it didn't never occur to me

300
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,279
that that that journey between waking up

301
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:49,440
and getting back to my breath was really essential it was reinforcing

302
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:58,399
uh something really unh wholesome in me and I started taking that journey waking up oh great i'm awake and I'd come back

303
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:05,200
to the breath with just a lot of kindness and in a warm field of course that's what the mind does that's why I'm

304
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:12,640
that's why I practice because the mind wants to you know play or or you know u

305
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:22,120
delve in the mud you know of the mud for of the things we don't like or or whatever things you know take us away

306
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:33,600
um so there are two aspects um um two ways that we primarily develop

307
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,799
wisdom you know there sometimes we call them two wings you know one of them is

308
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:44,080
the idea of letting go when something unh wholesome is happening and the other

309
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:52,480
is the idea of um cultivating whatever's wholesome and just by meditating daily

310
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:59,440
the the practice uh we learn to develop some calm and some tranquility

311
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:05,440
and calm and tranquility allows us to see um you know we have so much more

312
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,280
room to see when aversion and when these uh any of the defilements show up any of

313
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,878
these torments of mind show up and so we're able to see them and and it takes

314
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:24,480
the nourishment out of them in a moment of calm any moments of calm and peacefulness are moments where we're not

315
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,638
feeding those roots where those roots start um you know

316
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:36,240
shrinking and the other the other u side is the side of letting go and you know

317
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:43,679
the the standard metaphor is if you're holding on to hot coal you're just going to drop it because you recognize it

318
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:49,040
right you know you don't have to think about maybe I should drop the hot coal what do you think is that wise or not

319
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:55,800
you know we're just going to drop it and and the same thing with in our minds what happens often we just don't

320
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:01,760
recognize that we're holding on we don't recognize that we're how tight we're

321
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,839
holding on um and so we can lean in the direction

322
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:13,200
of letting go and um but we can't force ourselves

323
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:19,440
to be calm and we can't force ourselves to let go

324
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:25,359
we can you know maybe with a muscle we can go okay I can drop it but um maybe

325
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:31,520
you've had this experience of in meditation where um uh you know the

326
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:38,640
teacher says let go and nothing happens you know uh you know we're just

327
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:45,680
still all tied up in knots you know and um I remember uh you know uh early in

328
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,720
practice one of my sittings you know I just had an argument with a friend you

329
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:58,400
know right before coming to a group like this you know it was just like I was like really agitated you know and um and

330
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:05,200
I spent the first part of the sid you know I'm just thinking about all the justifications and and all the things I

331
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:11,839
should have said and that I can still say and and and then the teacher is doing a guided meditation and they're

332
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:18,640
going relax the body relax the you know and and it's like you know how do you

333
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:27,440
relax i can't let go how do you relax when you can't let go how do you let go when you can't let go you know and um

334
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,960
you know and I I practice with this you know many many times but but as I

335
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:39,160
continued to practice with it I saw that I could incline my mind towards letting

336
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:46,560
go it wasn't going to let go instantly but I could incline in that direction

337
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:53,359
and what it meant was that um when sometime you know when I had a

338
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:58,640
choice of uh spending the next five minutes rehearsing my arguments I could

339
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:05,200
choose not to do that right you know and still there'd be this tightness in my heart this you know but I'm just

340
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:12,160
inclining the mind and I saw that the part of the nature of the mind is that

341
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:19,200
um a lot of the work of the mind happens underneath And uh the experience for instance if

342
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,240
you've seen um maybe you've had the experience of um having to get up really

343
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:30,480
early in the morning and um much earlier than usual and setting an alarm clock

344
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:36,640
and then waking up right before the alarm clock you know you know it's have happened to me many times i stopped

345
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:41,839
setting alarm clocks um and um and the

346
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:47,760
subconscious is is doing the work the subconscious so when we incline the mind

347
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:55,200
you know I we can begin to trust that that's enough sometimes that's what we can do right now that's what's happening

348
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:02,960
right now and um you know we c as I said we can't force ourselves to let go you

349
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:09,440
know we can do some things you know but you know the the metaphor a flower

350
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:16,560
blooms in its own time you can't pull the petals open but they'll open if we nourish them if

351
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:23,760
we water it we nourish it and we nourish it with our intentions you know we nourish our

352
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:29,200
hearts with our intentions my intentions to let go of suffering my intentions is

353
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,640
to let go of the anger of the story you know so I can see it clearly so I can

354
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:40,520
respond with an open heart with an easeful heart

355
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:01,480
um so wisdom arose arises naturally when we pay

356
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:06,640
attention you know everything there is to know that's important in our lives is

357
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:12,320
right here it's right in these bodies and these minds and these hearts and by

358
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:18,520
paying really close attention and developing our attention um we can

359
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:25,839
release um you know uh release the these roots these things you know and allow

360
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:33,640
them in their own time to free themselves um you know as we settle the minds in

361
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:38,800
meditation we start seeing things much more clearly instead of being filtered

362
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:45,200
by preconceptions by our ideas by our judgments you know we start really

363
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:53,440
seeing the process of how our minds and bodies work um but what's really the

364
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:59,520
deeper aspects of this practice is that as mindfulness becomes more penetrating

365
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:05,680
as we train the mind and where we're really able to see the nature of reality

366
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:12,880
um you know we can see intimately how experience comes and goes we all know

367
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:22,079
that everything in life is impermanent right we've known that for a long time nothing lasts right um but this is a

368
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:28,079
experiential level we can get to where we it's like deep in our bones when you

369
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:34,240
really see that nothing nothing nothing lasts uh there's nothing you can hold on

370
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:40,880
to right you know and um you know in the intellectual area we still try to hold

371
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:47,920
on to everything right you know we're going to keep that relationship we're going to keep that you know keep the

372
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:53,040
food the fridge full all the time you know the whatever it is that that we we

373
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:59,920
grab on to um and it becomes clear that no

374
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:06,440
experience we ever ever have is going to give us lasting

375
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:12,800
happiness you know it's going to give us any kind of sense of lasting satisfaction

376
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,920
so our experiences in our life no matter how wonderful the trip is no no matter

377
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:25,280
how how wonderful the relationship is no matter how wonderful uh the the vista is

378
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:31,760
you know it's never going to last give us lasting happiness so to

379
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,880
look for happiness in the conditions that change all the time that won't

380
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:43,880
fulfill us to keep looking there is the recipe for suffering for continued

381
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:49,880
suffering and um you know and then we can still see or might see our

382
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:57,280
limitations or imperfections but we don't have to believe that they define who we are

383
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:04,800
they're just part of the changing landscape of our lives and we can begin to know a

384
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,880
happiness that doesn't insist on things being just

385
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:17,040
right that doesn't insist that things be the way we want them you know and that's the fruits of

386
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:23,880
this practice you know the the being really at home in this world in our

387
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:31,200
lives um and the last thing you know this this kind of wisdom comes from here from

388
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,880
within from ourselves even though a teacher might say some wise words you

389
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:44,480
know the dharma the books talks everywhere we get you know there's tremendous amount of wisdom but still it

390
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,400
all comes from here from developing our own hearts and minds with the practice

391
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:58,359
from freeing the heart and mind so thank you very much for listening
