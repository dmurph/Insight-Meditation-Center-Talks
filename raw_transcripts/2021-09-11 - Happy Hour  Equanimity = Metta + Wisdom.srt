35
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,240
so formally hello and welcome to happy hour dear sangha

36
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:13,039
so [Music] so for today's theme of practice um i'd like to invite

37
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:21,680
us to engage with the fourth brahmavihara today the brahmaviharas the

38
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,800
um about the four practices of the heart meta being the first one where we spend

39
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,000
a lot of time and happy hour working with metta and all the three the three

40
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,639
other ones also are different expressions of meta they're not separate the second being

41
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:47,680
compassion another expression of meta when meta kindness meets suffering

42
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:55,440
the third one being mudita or vicarious joy when metta meets someone who's has really good

43
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,440
fortune either ourselves or someone else gladness arises vicarious happiness

44
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,360
no and the fourth one is equanimity equanimity also thought of as the crown

45
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,919
jewel of buddhist practice and it shows up in so many different ways so many lists and so

46
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,880
many different flavors the way it shows up on this list on the

47
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:26,639
brahmavirus is practicing for ourselves practicing for other beings

48
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:33,600
it shows up another list such as the seven factors of awakening etc etc but

49
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:40,400
here it shows in this way in the way of practicing with respect to ourselves with respect

50
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:47,919
to other living beings so and remember that equanimity is related

51
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:56,160
to matters in the same family so there is care in equanimity it's not aloof it's not oh okay whatever

52
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:03,840
it there's care there is love in the sense of equanimity in the sense of equipoise

53
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:11,440
holding what is and the way i like to invite us to explore of course we've explored all the

54
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,560
brahmaviharas in so many different ways creative ways over the past year and a

55
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,880
half now on on our online global saga but the way

56
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,440
i like to invite us for today's practice is the following way

57
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:35,680
to consider um perhaps times maybe right now

58
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:42,800
where there might be a friend there might be a relative there might be a loved one

59
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:49,919
who's having perhaps a challenging time and part of your instinct perhaps caring for

60
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,280
them is to jump in and swoop in and just

61
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:04,720
make it all better or maybe there's a sense of frustration like oh why are you doing this to yourself and can't you see

62
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,560
so so there's so many different unwise

63
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,800
responses that can come up here when there is lack of equanimity whereas

64
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,319
what would equanimity look like perhaps in in this particular case in this

65
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,879
particular instance scenario so

66
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:33,680
appreciating appreciating understanding the person's autonomy really granting

67
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,680
them autonomy respecting their choices caring

68
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,040
offering support whatever support you can

69
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,519
but without both trying to step in and and make it

70
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:58,480
you know fix it all in your way not respecting their journey not respecting their

71
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,240
choices not respecting um that this is their life

72
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,839
and in the traditional phrasing of the equanimity phrases

73
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,959
um it is said that you know all beings have their own journey they

74
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:20,720
have um and and their happiness and unhappiness does not depend on my wishes

75
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:27,120
for them it's respecting their journey and yet it's not aloof it's not cold it's not

76
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:34,160
turning your heart away at all there's care there is love

77
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,200
there is holding witness and supporting helping in any ways that are both

78
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,920
helpful well filled with love both for the person for the friend relative and also

79
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:53,440
for yourself remember metta equanimity is 360.

80
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,480
so if you're swooping is swooping in and

81
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,600
just taking over and and giving up your own responsibilities in

82
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,360
life it's not really filled with meta for yourself care for yourself

83
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,880
so the wise question why is consideration is how can i

84
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:23,839
how can i support how can i be present how can i have mettas show care love compassion

85
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,120
both for this being in this situation as well as for myself

86
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:35,760
as well as respecting their autonomy respecting their journey

87
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:42,399
the choices they have made that have brought them to this place

88
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,440
and the choices they need to make the lessons they need to make

89
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,399
and similarly for you the choices you have made and the lessons you need to make so how can you be present

90
00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,399
loving and also have a sense of 360 degree view

91
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,680
of life its ups its downs

92
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,720
trials tribulations all of our choices all the lessons that

93
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:19,519
we have to learn as beings in in our interrelationship so

94
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:25,680
so that's plenty for setting the context today so i'd like to invite you to let

95
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:32,880
go now of all the words there were too many words too many concepts let it go

96
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:40,200
let's let's land together let's practice together

97
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:54,399
let's land in our bodies letting go of all the words we're going

98
00:11:54,399 --> 00:12:00,000
to try on for size this practice just try it on

99
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,199
even if there are but but but complains and

100
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,560
and concerns try it on for size and see what arises

101
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,639
as you practice in your body in your heart

102
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,160
so landing landing in the body

103
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,200
landing

104
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:47,480
feeling sensing [Music] your feet these feet rooted

105
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:59,839
touching the earth the contact points

106
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:07,720
between the feet and the earth

107
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,720
just tilling the soil just tilling the soil

108
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,639
of mindfulness awareness one breath at a time

109
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,440
arriving settling

110
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,839
receiving each breath in the abdomen

111
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:26,880
the fallen breath received the full out breath

112
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,880
received

113
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,959
taking refuge

114
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:06,400
in this moment the simplicity of this body

115
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:14,400
this breath this expansive moment just here

116
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:21,839
putting down thoughts just gently saying not now thank you not

117
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,079
now

118
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,799
i'm connecting with awareness

119
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:56,440
i like to invite you to imagine you're sitting on top of a mountain

120
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:03,600
where you have 360 degree view all around

121
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,320
just imagine you're sitting comfortably

122
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,279
feel your bottom feel your feet feel embodied

123
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,799
feel embodied in the body

124
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,559
notice a sense of spaciousness all around you

125
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,120
your space all around you

126
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:47,520
as if you could see far into the horizon from all directions

127
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:53,200
clearly just imagine top of the mountain let's

128
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,399
take another few minutes to breathe

129
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:07,799
to settle with a sense of embodiment and spaciousness embodiment and spaciousness

130
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,840
now like to invite you to imagine

131
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:24,400
sitting sitting in this high place top of this mountain seeing all around

132
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,240
as if you could see as if you're looking into

133
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,880
so many interrelated causes and conditions

134
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,480
past and present

135
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,919
so many things have come to be

136
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,679
because of so many causes and conditions

137
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,158
now if as if you would invite

138
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:21,440
this friend relative or someone in your orbit

139
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,720
choosing this being the practice of equanimity

140
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:33,280
the practice for them and if you're having a hard time

141
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:39,200
choosing someone or there is this sense of entanglement

142
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:46,320
but wanting to keep equanimity you can't come up with anyone

143
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,840
it's okay to choose yourself

144
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:05,720
i'll do the guidance for this other being though whatever being you've chosen

145
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:12,010
so seeing the circumstances this being [Music]

146
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,278
life circumstances

147
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,159
seeing them holding them

148
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,640
with a sense of care with metta goodwill

149
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:38,000
you wish well for them you want them to be safe

150
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:46,278
and happy and healthy and have ease

151
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:55,840
and from this view 360 view far and wide

152
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:01,640
you can see that there are so many causes and conditions

153
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:08,520
so many beyond their control beyond your control

154
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,679
there are some choices they have made but

155
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,440
perhaps you also get to see so many

156
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,440
cultural

157
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:38,080
environmental educational family genetics

158
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:44,919
systemic zeitgeist historical

159
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,759
and breathing breathing spaciousness

160
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:16,760
so many interconnections so many interconnections

161
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,760
past and present

162
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:33,760
and the interconnection you have the connection you have with this being is one of them

163
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,159
is one of the very many

164
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,080
infinite causes and conditions

165
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:52,760
it's not all up to you just as it's not all up to them

166
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,360
they are doing the best they can

167
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,559
and can you accept that you're doing the best you can

168
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:22,240
as much as you can with menta both for them and for yourself

169
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,640
don't start thinking but but just feel into it

170
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:40,880
for a moment and see what might open up often our thinking mind

171
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:49,399
cannot see beyond a particular way of being

172
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,960
holding this being with care and spaciousness

173
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,720
acknowledging all the causes and conditions

174
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,720
equanimity is not aloof it neither pushes away

175
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,158
nor falls into

176
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,559
with grief

177
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:43,039
has wisdom connemity is the marriage of matter and

178
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,840
wisdom

179
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,840
i'll offer a few phrases of equanimity maybe no phrases

180
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:54,399
are needed just holding the space spacious space

181
00:30:54,399 --> 00:31:00,320
with metta acknowledging

182
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:06,000
that we the two of us are players and this

183
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:14,000
big scheme called life this mystery doing our best

184
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,360
holding presents with menta

185
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:33,000
here is one phrase if you wish

186
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:37,600
all beings have their own journey

187
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:46,440
all beings all beings have their own journey

188
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,640
may i accept

189
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:13,000
the arising and passing of all things with equanimity and balance

190
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,919
or i care for you

191
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:48,080
i care i care about you but cannot keep you from suffering

192
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:54,200
i care for you about you but i cannot

193
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,960
keep you from suffering

194
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:43,279
or i care about you and i am not in control

195
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,440
of the unfolding of events

196
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:53,640
i can't make it all better for you

197
00:33:54,159 --> 00:34:00,000
i care about you and i'm not in control

198
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:09,118
of the unfolding of events i can

199
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,279
i can't make it all better for you

200
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:42,960
i can't make it all better and i care about you

201
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:49,800
i'm not in control of the unfoldings

202
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:51,760
if the mind wanders bringing the image of this being as clearly as possible into your mind's

203
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,960
eye connecting with them connecting with the practice

204
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,599
and your meta your care for them

205
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:08,599
and that not everything is within your control

206
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:14,000
i care i care about you

207
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,160
i care about you

208
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:29,799
and i'm not in control of the unfolding of all things

209
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,838
and for the last moments of this practice period

210
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:01,359
can we have equanimity hold with spaciousness this period of practice whether it was

211
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:06,720
sleepy or distracted or whatever happened acknowledging that

212
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:13,440
there were so many causes and conditions maybe we didn't sleep enough last night

213
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,640
maybe we were really upset earlier today maybe we're tired we're sick so many

214
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:25,119
causes and conditions that go into the moment's experience

215
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:30,960
having meta for ourselves we met for ourselves that we showed up

216
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,960
letting go of any judgment acknowledging this period of practice

217
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:44,000
was born of many causes and conditions our intention was just one of them

218
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:50,800
appreciating our intention our intention for wholesome cultivation

219
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:58,319
and dedicating sharing and merit the goodness generated

220
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:07,040
with all beings everywhere may all beings everywhere be happy

221
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:14,520
may all beings be free including ourselves

222
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:33,680
thank you thank you all for your practice

223
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,560
so the practice of equanimity

224
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:48,079
it can be a little more nuanced or challenging or subtle

225
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:55,839
compared to the other practices hence it being the fourth of the brahmavihara

226
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:00,960
so if your experience was a little

227
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:09,280
nuanced or [Music] not quite sure it's okay it's all okay

228
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:15,520
you're practicing you're practicing so i'd love to

229
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:23,119
open this space up now for any reflections for any questions that have come up any

230
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:28,960
insights in your practice that out of generosity you're willing to

231
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:35,280
share with the sangha to support others practice

232
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,319
from a place of a gift oh this is what i discovered this is what was interesting

233
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:47,359
this was what was challenging so and if you type in chat in the zoom

234
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:53,040
chat if you type just to me privately i will

235
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:59,599
read the reflection not your name so i'll be private if you send it to everyone i'll read

236
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:04,640
both reflection and your name and you're welcome

um considering someone who's suffering and you want to jump in to fix it

243
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:01,599
so often comes up with parents and children adult children

244
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:06,800
where you still want to fix it you still want so

245

this is something to really meditate on and how do you

246
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:18,640
communicate the love and the boundary

247
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:25,440

256
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:22,640
you know you are not in control of and you realize the other is not in control

257
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:30,880
either and that you just have to con yeah be be kind to yourself and be kind

that she has six to 12 months to live with cancer oh

268
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:38,960
it has helped to see that each being is on their own journey and that does not

269
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:45,599
mean that you do not deeply care yes yeah

270
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:52,960
thank you jerry thank you for that yeah

271
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:58,160

272
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:05,318
to hear from you sangha would love to hear from you

273
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:16,640
and also if it was challenging or problematic something difficult came up that's okay too we'd love to

274
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:21,838
let's let's bring it up let's be real

275
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:45,359
just to say in a meditation [Music] community there's no such a thing as

276
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:52,000
awkward silence it's just silence it's delicious silence

277
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,520
dawn please

278
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:02,240
yeah when you said use this as an opportunity to take

279
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:07,280
refuge um i i really appreciated that it resonated

280
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:12,640
with me you said that at least once maybe more and

281
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:18,880
it was uh it was challenging equanimity and for me it was sort of meh

282
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:24,880
and uh i and i think part of it was like choosing

283
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:32,640
the right person and didn't make sense to choose me and i wasn't sure like who to choose

284
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:38,880
and and so then i just sort of devolved to the sort of like just practicing loving kindness and sort of listening

285
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:45,599
and and you know i'll try it next time and uh and it's practice and um

286
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:51,280
and so i very much appreciate that yeah

287
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:58,000
great great thank you don yeah beautiful i appreciate the ease with

288
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:04,160
which you practice and you're sharing your report like okay

289
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:10,400
couldn't quite land on someone you didn't choosing yourself didn't seem appropriate and just okay then i'll

290
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:16,079
listen and i'll engage with metta and i'll engage later

291
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:23,520
i love that that's ea for that practice report which is beautiful it's it's not

292
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:28,559
you know the alternative so many unwise alternatives could be like oh i can't

293
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:33,839
choose the right person i'm a failure i can't do this practice this is terrible

294
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:40,000
i've been practicing for months and months and months and i can't do right

295

298
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:06,000
haven't said this actually in a long time but i used to repeat every time during happy hour that no matter what

299
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:14,079
comes up during happy hour as long as you engage with it with meta yeah you're doing the practice

300
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:19,760
perfectly right so don you're doing the practice perfectly right you're engaging with mitta with

305
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:55,040
as always we'll start with 15 seconds of meta for ourselves for each other

306
00:51:55,040 --> 00:52:01,839
the community and then sharing as much or as little as you like about your practice

307
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:07,359
what came up for you what was interesting or was challenging

308
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:13,200
and sharing it with equanimity it's like this so many causes and conditions for this practice

309
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:18,480
so the rooms are created take care of yourselves and

310

01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:39,119
yes and that ties also in with what uh don was saying earlier taking refuge

320
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:45,119
taking refuge diana you're

321
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:50,480
i am told you're raising your physical hand which i can't see

322
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:57,799
let's see diana okay there

323
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:06,559
asking you to unmute deny your camera is off also

324
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:12,400
technical difficulties okay um

325
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:17,680
my question is i can know these phrases and i've been

326
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:22,960
getting some success with it internally but i

327
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:28,160
ponder what to say to a person socially after been sitting listening to all this

328
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:33,280
and caring these tortured lives it just

329
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:38,640
somehow seems odd to say i care for you or maybe i can say give

330
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:45,760
me a hug or i can uh or i can just yes got it and for yeah for sake of time i

331
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:52,960
think i'll uh i think i got the gist of the question um since it's seven o'clock uh i'll

332
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:58,720
so yes this is not something that you're going to say externally like you know you're not going to stay with someone

333
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:04,000
may you be safe maybe be happy like it sounds so stilted right so so all you

334
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:09,520
all you need to do is to hold space is to hold space you need to hold this

335
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:17,039
space internally for yourself you don't have to say it out loud um hold the space of care with a whole

336
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:22,559
space of spaciousness for yourself and for the other person and they will feel it

337
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:28,880
there's so much that we communicate without words but with just the space that we hold thank you for that question

338
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:35,760
diana that was a really good one yeah thank you so dear ones we have come to the end of

340
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:50,880

341
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:56,880
