00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,920
hello everyone and welcome to our

2
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,400
meditation together and um

3
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:32,160
the general theme this week is um loving kindness

4
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,879
in that we're looking at the meta suta at 7 30. and

5
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,039
so to

6
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,160
one of the interesting things to consider very important things to consider when

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,239
doing meditation is when we have an unwholesome state of

8
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:07,119
mind or unwholesome thoughts that arise how do we react to that what's our

9
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:13,840
response to that and ideally what is unwholesome

10
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:22,320
what is unwholesome is met by what is wholesome so an unwholesome

11
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:29,680
state of mind and wholesome train of thinking we bring to it

12
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,200
some wholesome state of mind some wholesome way of approaching it

13
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:43,840
and one of the simplest ways of doing that is to practice mindfulness

14
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,479
mindfulness is considered always to be wholesome

15
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,439
maybe some people would see it more something neutral because it's non-reactive it's non-judgmental it has a kind of

16
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:02,799
neutrality and just allowing things to be not being for against it but it turns out that kind of uh state

17
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:10,959
of mind is uh beneficial and it was onward leading to greater benefits into happiness so just

18
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,480
to simply be aware of it is to bring wholesomeness so we don't have to dredge up

19
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,280
some kind of love or kindness or compassion if we don't feel it

20
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,560
but we can bring forth our capacity to be mindful

21
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,760
recognizing it in its simplicity mindfulness is wholesome

22
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:41,120
and the word simplicity is important because sometimes we can be mindful but we're also kind of not just mindful

23
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:48,239
also thoughtful about what we're doing so that the mindfulness is maybe mixed

24
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:56,560
up with some unwholesome thoughts and attitudes but to meet what's unwholesome with the

25
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,800
wholesome without condemnation without shame without

26
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:10,879
defining oneself by the unwholesome without being upset just

27
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,800
to see it clearly and if it's possible to be have kindness to it or good will towards

28
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,560
oneself in this state that helps as well but this art of bringing forth a

29
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,680
wholesome to meet whatever is unwholesome so we don't let the unwholesome fester

30
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:36,959
and uh and get the upper hand so taking a meditation posture

31
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,000
and this word wholesome is wonderfully connected to the word

32
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,799
skillful and so to take a posture that is skillful for you

33
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:58,840
it's a skillful posture that supports you to settle into the present moment to be

34
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:06,159
here closing your eyes

35
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,319
and taking a few long slow deep breaths

36
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:21,919
maybe three quarters full full enough so that you really feel your

37
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:30,000
rib cage expand and stretch you feel your torso a little more fully

38
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,360
maybe even allowing your belly to expand

39
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,360
and as you exhale maybe a little bit longer than usual a

40
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,719
leisurely exhale

41
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:11,840
letting the exhale with the exhale is settling in your body

42
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,680
then letting your breathing return to normal

43
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,720
and taking a few moments to familiarize yourself with how it is to be breathing in an

44
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,840
ordinary way

45
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,520
and as you breathe relax your body some more

46
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:31,039
relaxing muscles of your face

47
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:48,000
letting the muscles of your face fall away from the bones skull

48
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,879
the exhale relaxing the shoulders

49
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,840
the shoulders can fall away from the spine

50
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,520
and as you exhale to relax the belly

51
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:44,000
maybe softening the belly so the weight of your torso settles more deeply

52
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,400
and then settling in with your breathing

53
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,120
and if there's any unwholesome state of mind or train of thinking

54
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:08,240
can you let go of that maybe reminding yourself it's not needed

55
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,840
right now

56
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:23,440
and if you can't let go of it it's okay can you be aware of it simply

57
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,879
a wholesome state of awareness that simply recognize it knows it

58
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:44,320
so in a sense you are the response you are not the unwholesome state

59
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:52,320
and the simplest wholesome state with which to respond

60
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,360
is to be mindful to see it for what it

61
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:17,519
is and then if possible with a wholesome attitude wholesome mindfulness

62
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:37,680
settle down into your breathing just to breathe in and breathe out

63
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,480
and if any unwholesome states of mind arise

64
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:52,560
return to what's wholesome the whole also mindfulness of breathing

65
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:05,839
or a wholesome recognition of the unwholesome state

66
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:49,840
and as we come to the end of this sitting

67
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:55,760
one of the ways of considering the end of meditation

68
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:01,600
it is that it has prepared us to enter the world in a new way

69
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:09,200
different way and one of the ways to do this is to

70
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,880
turn the attention now towards the world around you

71
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:22,080
the people in your lives communities people in the world

72
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:31,840
and see if you can bring up a wholesome attitude towards them

73
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:40,320
there's many wholesome attitudes but some attitude or way of thinking about

74
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:47,600
others that sees them in a good light positive light

75
00:28:54,080 --> 00:29:00,480
to be ready to maybe be involved in the world again of people

76
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:12,240
after this meditation with a attitude of goodwill

77
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:21,760
where they're seeing and considering people have the capacity for happiness and to wish it be so

78
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,960
and to maybe wish that whatever benefits that has come from this meditation

79
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:36,000
be used not at the expense of oneself

80
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:45,120
but as an enhancement of oneself to be used for the welfare and happiness of others

81
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,559
may all beings be happy

82
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,039
may all beings be safe

83
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,398
may all beings be peaceful

84
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:22,980
and may all beings everywhere be free

85
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:27,039
[Music]

86
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,840
so

87
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:48,320
so we continue i continue then with a

88
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:54,960
series of talks on the meta suita the discourse on loving kindness

89
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,559
and i say as i'm doing it this week is by dividing

90
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:05,600
the text into parts kind of kind of four parts and this

91
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:15,279
coming next part is the shortest part of the text and kind of paradoxically or ironically

92
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:23,919
in the classic instructions for loving kindness practice which is uh founded a fifth century

93
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:30,799
meditation manual by a teacher named buddha gosha it's a big book called the

94
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:36,320
path of purification and that's where the modern practice of

95
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,360
damikane is the most common way to practice comes from this

96
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:47,200
particular book and it's a big manual on meditation and the

97
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:55,200
ninth chapter of the book is about brahmavihara meditation the meditations of loving kindness

98
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:03,440
compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity and um and the biggest discussion about

99
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:09,679
the is about the first one loving kindness but in the in the section about loving

100
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:15,039
kindness most of that section many many pages has to do

101
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:21,600
about um overcoming resentment and anger

102
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:28,240
because uh i guess the one of the biggest obstacles for loving kindness is if we have resentment towards someone

103
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,760
and it's hard to have kindness or good will towards them or anger towards them and so it's really

104
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:39,840
a treatise or instructions on overcoming anger more than it is teachings on

105
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:45,600
loving-kindness so in the metasuta this next part

106
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:51,760
is about that but it's only four lines and at this time i think i've succeeded

107
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,960
in posting uh this part of the meta suit or actually what we've done so far

108
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,640
in the youtube page where it says little description of what we're doing underneath the video

109
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:10,398
and if you click on show more i think it will show it to you and the bottom of that is

110
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:15,679
let no one deceive another

111
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:23,679
or despise anyone anywhere let no one through anger or aversion

112
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:33,118
wish for others to suffer so here we have

113
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,158
a call to put aside anything that gets in the way of the good will

114
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,760
but this text is not only about loving kindness it's really about the path to liberation

115
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,118
uh through loving-kindness and the path of liberation cannot be found [Music]

116
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:56,800
in being angry or despising or having aversion towards anyone especially if that is a wish for them to

117
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:03,440
suffer certain certain kind of hostility and this that kind of feeling that attitude is

118
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:10,160
really goes against the grain of um of liberation

119
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:15,200
because it involves getting unliberated it involves getting

120
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:21,440
entangled or in bondage or caught not free if we're caught in resentment

121
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,839
or anger and now it's not necessarily all anger

122
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:34,800
but the anger any anger that involves hostility any anger that involves ill will towards

123
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,599
someone wishing others to suffer

124
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:46,800
and so in this classic text on loving loving-kindness then a big section is about overcoming anger and

125
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:55,200
resentment and it's kind of fun to read because he gives instructions about what

126
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:01,760
you can do and then he says well if that doesn't work then try this and then he says if that

127
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,760
doesn't work try this if that doesn't work try this and um and it goes a whole through a

128
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,599
whole series of you know options and then finally as the last one

129
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:19,838
if nothing else works then he says

130
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:28,000
get involved in the practice of gift giving so either give the person that you're

131
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:35,599
angry with or hostel with give them a gift or allow them to give a gift to you

132
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:42,079
so either direction whatever is happening or easy um

133
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:48,320
that that's the final the most you know the last resort for uh for overcoming anger and

134
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,359
resentment and uh i don't know why it has to be last why not just first

135
00:36:53,359 --> 00:37:00,160
but anyway it's the last one and in between there are things like just

136
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,599
drumming up loving kindness for them or thinking about the good qualities the

137
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:11,359
person has or thinking about how when there's anger and resentment

138
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:18,960
the person who has the anger the resentment is harming themselves and and they're causing it literally

139
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,560
says is causing damage to oneself that the enemy cannot create

140
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:30,240
so others can kind of cause us harm in a variety of ways but that to

141
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:36,480
really we get into the deepest parts of the heart and mind in this ancient text the it's only you

142
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,599
can do that by having anger or resentment or something like that

143
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:47,119
so there's all these things to do and maybe each of you has your own

144
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:53,040
effective way of um and an effective and skillful

145
00:37:53,040 --> 00:38:00,240
and respectful way of working with anger and resentments and aversion hostility

146
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:05,680
i like to think of these states of mind as something that deserves i don't know deserves the right

147
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:11,119
word but something that's well worth respecting um so not to have an

148
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:16,960
automatic hostility towards our hostility not to have an automatic aversion to a

149
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:23,920
aversion or or ill will but to understand to have respect for it sometimes we

150
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:30,079
respect things which are dangerous and so we respect these things but these states are dangerous

151
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:38,240
but we respect them partly because of their danger and we want to be very careful with them and so they don't cause uh harm they don't

152
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:43,440
succumb to the danger that they bring but also

153
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:49,520
they are kind of like messengers and you don't want to kill the messenger

154
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:56,000
and the messenger sometimes is that we are hurting in some ways or the

155
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,040
messenger is that there's something about ourselves that feels scared

156
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:07,520
or the message is that there's something unwholesome going on inside of us and that

157
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:14,160
unwholesomeness needs attention if we want to find our way to the wholesome and so in

158
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:21,520
fact what is unwholesome inside of us uh might be the thing that most needs

159
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:26,880
our good will needs our compassion needs our generosity of spirit

160
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,079
um if we keep pushing away what's unwholesome inside of us or pushing it down

161
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:37,760
um it just festers and uh it just gets worse and and uh and we live kind of a divided

162
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,960
life between what we're willing to face and what we're ignoring

163
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,400
and um and the um and so anger sometimes is a if you see it as a

164
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:55,119
messenger and uh and what is the message what's underneath the anger what's behind it

165
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:01,680
and not a few times part of what anger is is something in ourselves that needs

166
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:08,480
uh good will that needs to be reassured that needs maybe to be let go of but not

167
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:16,880
let go with hostility but put down with respect and care um that it comes you know that's there

168
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:22,880
so this idea of living a wholesome life means to bring a wholesomeness to those parts of

169
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:29,040
ourselves which are unwholesome so in a sense be our own friend that way

170
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:34,880
and so when the smeta sutra says let no one deceive another

171
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:41,680
or despise anyone anywhere let no one through anger aversion wish for others to suffer

172
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:49,359
that i see this first and foremost it's directed towards ourselves that uh we we don't want to be this kind

173
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:55,200
of way we don't want to deceive anyone else or despise anyone and

174
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:01,599
nor be angry or aversive towards anyone and so to really cultivate putting those

175
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:07,200
down to cultivate the absence of this deception the absence of tricking people or

176
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:16,000
or presenting ourselves different who we are or getting people to do what we want a kind of little bit through manipulation

177
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,040
or just don't despise anyone respect everyone

178
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:26,480
don't despise yourself so to to enter this world of our unwholesome

179
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:36,000
and begin looking how to put it down relax it heal it bring forth what is wholesome

180
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,800
um and um and and put down any hostility

181
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:49,839
so let no one through anger and aversion wish for others to suffer now

182
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:55,839
logically maybe or you know it doesn't seem like anyone or any of you want that but to be mean towards someone

183
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:03,760
to say something slightly mean or even sarcastic critical uh kind of underneath it is a

184
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:11,040
little bit like poking people maybe or getting back at people or or um you know someone says something

185
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:17,760
not so nice to ourselves and we kind of respond and kind because we want to get back at them

186
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:23,359
there's all kinds of small ways in which we are not we kind of kind of trying to irritate

187
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:28,560
people or get back at them get revenge or something and uh

188
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:34,800
even complaining sometimes is more than just complaining it's kind of a critique a criticism that's kind of

189
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,400
poking at people and and so the idea is if you really

190
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:48,240
want to cultivate loving-kindness really want to cultivate the path of liberation there's a profound thing to be done

191
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:54,720
a health very healthy thing to be done a i would say for a very inspiring thing

192
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:00,880
to do and that is to um to

193
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:07,599
overcome any tendency towards hostility to learn to recognize it when it comes

194
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:15,520
up and not give into it to learn to recognize it when it comes up and meet it with what's wholesome

195
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:22,640
and and so that our intention the way that we are motivated to live

196
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:29,359
our life is uh has even though there might be some feelings that are difficult

197
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:36,240
angry feelings and all that the important thing is the intention them what drives how we speak and act in the

198
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:44,720
world and in there um have no wish for others to suffer

199
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:50,960
rather this is the wish this is the intention to come from and that's the section just before that

200
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:59,200
in the poem may all be happy and secure may all beings be happy at heart

201
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:06,880
all living beings whether weak or strong tall large medium or short

202
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:13,680
tiny or big seen or unseen born or to be born may they all

203
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:19,119
be happy so that's the art of loving kindness is to

204
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:25,440
discover how to have this be the motivating force inside of us this kind of good will

205
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:34,720
having put aside the ill will that's there or not acting on it and healing it in some deep way and

206
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:40,880
so it's a this is a worthwhile very worthwhile way of living and practicing

207
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:47,760
and and imagine that if you've memorized the metasuta and recited these words

208
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:54,560
every day this is a classic practice in in buddhism is to memorize a text like

209
00:44:54,560 --> 00:45:01,599
this and say it yourself over and over again and see the effect it has on us

210
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:08,960
of saying these kinds of words so thank you and

211
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:19,838
i'll continue tomorrow

212
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,480
