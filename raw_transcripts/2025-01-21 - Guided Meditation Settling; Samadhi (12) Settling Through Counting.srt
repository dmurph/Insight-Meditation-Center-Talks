21
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:42,720
hello from Redwood City

22
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,519
clearly getting lighter earlier now starting to get light outside the

23
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:57,519
windows here and um and in Buddhism it said that the

24
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,560
dawn is the um

25
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,920
Harbinger harbinger of

26
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,680
wisdom because with light we can see clearly

27
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:21,440
so yesterday I said samadi is Simplicity today I'd like to offer a

28
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,279
different aspect of samadi that samadi is

29
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:35,760
subtleness to uh um becomes settled and um the kind of

30
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:42,760
subtleness that creates a foundation to hold all

31
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:48,320
things that uh tripod for example uh when

32
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:55,279
it's well placed with the three legs then it can hold whatever telescope that

33
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,600
is going to be on it that you can't really do if you the

34
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,440
legs are not spread apart but they're all bunched together so it's basically one leg then it's going to wobble and

35
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:12,279
it's not going to uh stay up by itself and maybe you have to hold it but even your hand is

36
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:17,959
not so steady to hold it still so a steadiness to create a steady

37
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:23,800
Foundation that can hold all of who you are that allows us to see turn on the

38
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:29,240
light to include everything because as I keep saying some

39
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:37,240
body is a unification of all things in a certain way so so a

40
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:44,360
subtleness and so to uh

41
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:50,240
use are the different elements of meditation for the purposes of feeling

42
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,040
settled becoming settled it's closely related to being

43
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:03,079
relaxed to settle and be relaxed it's related to

44
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:11,199
um um being fully invested fully engaged fully

45
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:17,120
interested in here and now this process

46
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:25,079
here and to engage in that process of being here in a settled way in a relaxed

47
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:33,040
way in a in an enjoyable way and of course the mind will wander off consider

48
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:39,279
that to be part of the process it wanders off and then the task is to

49
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:47,160
begin again it's almost like a massage the mind has to be massage enough to settle

50
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,480
and wondering off and then coming back is a gentle kind of relaxing massaging

51
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,680
of the mind so it eventually settles to be here

52
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:08,320
so to assume a meditation posture that allows you to feel somewhat

53
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,880
grounded into the surface that holds your

54
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:21,160
weight whatever surface it is if you're standing the soles of your

55
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:29,160
feet if you're sitting on a cushion or chair or couch it's the

56
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:36,480
the seat of the chair the seat of your cushion is against your bottom if you're lying

57
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,519
down it maybe in a bed or on the floor it's a

58
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:47,959
full extent of the B your back

59
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:56,920
perhaps in contact with the floor the bed and allow that to be kind of a

60
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,040
grounding for your weight

61
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:12,279
as if this surface receives your

62
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,079
weight to provide a grounding a

63
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:26,639
settling closing your eyes taking some long slow deep

64
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:35,120
breaths with the exhale relaxing the body softening the

65
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:44,000
body and as you do so settle into this grounding

66
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,240
settling into this place where you're

67
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:19,279
meditating and then letting your breathing return to

68
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:30,040
normal and for now can you find a settling point a grounding point

69
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:38,839
maybe deep in your body might be the lowest point in your

70
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:45,959
body or the most grounding place in your

71
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:52,880
body for the end of the out breath if you follow your exhale the

72
00:16:52,880 --> 00:17:00,319
physical experience of the body releasing Contracting settling

73
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:04,480
the diaphragm lifting as you

74
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:14,319
exhale maybe the belly expanding as you

75
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:28,880
exhale or the bellet gently pulling in as you exhale

76
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,799
at the end of the exhale the last place of clear

77
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:45,360
Sensations in the body from

78
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:52,440
where the movements of inhale begin maybe spreading

79
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,799
outwards as the Torso expands

80
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:28,919
for some people there might be the image of a balloon

81
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:36,720
that as expands as it fills with air so the Torso expands as we breathe

82
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:44,440
in expanding in all directions and as the balloon deflates

83
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:50,799
as the air leaves and contracts pulls

84
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:56,240
in so the exhale the

85
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,720
body settles back in

86
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,600
back to the settling

87
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:15,399
point and maybe even the image for people who

88
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,600
visualize a balloon expanding and

89
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:30,720
Contracting will keep you simply with experience or breathing

90
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,000
and as you breathe

91
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,679
in you might gently

92
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:06,679
say the word one but see if you can say it in a

93
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:12,799
way that doesn't activate the mind or agitate the

94
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:20,158
mind but is part of quieting and settling the Mind into the

95
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:31,360
breathing especially when you say to as you

96
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:39,120
exhale long pronunciation of

97
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:48,640
two the two as an invitation to now settle the

98
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,600
Mind down towards the settling point

99
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,760
maybe imagining or feeling or

100
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:14,000
allowing these numbers one

101
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,760
two do not arise in the mind so

102
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:26,919
much in the brain but in the wider

103
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:32,000
mind as if it's a rising in belly itself

104
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:40,760
to rising from the settling Point without any tension or

105
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:48,080
pressure the numbers just float up as an

106
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:56,080
invitation to feel the breath to be with

107
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
it

108
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,520
for e

109
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:33,320
usually there's a little stronger feeling experience of the body as we breathe

110
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:41,159
in allow that strength to

111
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:44,640
support being

112
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:55,720
attentive and letting there be a settling as you

113
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:04,960
exhale the body can subtle and sometimes the number two

114
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,159
saying two with the

115
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:15,799
exhale can be a way of staying

116
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:21,039
connected and settling the mind as

117
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
well

118
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

119
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,320
e e

120
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,240
e for

121
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:54,640
seeing as you exhale if you can

122
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,480
ride the whole exhale

123
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:06,240
stay in touch from beginning and

124
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:13,440
end in a way that the whole

125
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:22,600
exhale settles quiets the

126
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:30,120
mind the awareness into the body

127
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,039
for

128
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,039
for

129
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,039
e

130
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,960
for

131
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,960
e e

132
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,960
staying close

133
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:07,600
to the entire length of breathing [Music] in the entire length of breathing

134
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:14,240
out may be supported by

135
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,200
counting inhales and

136
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:29,000
exhales the counting keeps you settled here

137
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,919
with the body's experience of

138
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,840
breathing

139
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,760
for

140
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,720
e

141
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,720
e

142
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,640
for

143
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,680
for for

144
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,079
and as we come to the end of this

145
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:31,078
sitting maybe if it's possible to settle the

146
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:39,839
heart maybe as you exhale to allow the Heart

147
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:45,570
Center to [Music]

148
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,318
soften to

149
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:57,599
relax and to settle almost as if it's gently being

150
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:04,440
invited by gravity to come to rest in

151
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:19,440
itself with every exhale settling the heart

152
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:35,160
settling the heart so that it can be supported by the deeper

153
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,359
settling place

154
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:47,160
within the place where breathing comes to a settled

155
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:54,400
point or the place where the body feels most

156
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:03,560
settled let that hold receive the settling

157
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:22,440
heart and what if if it is this settled

158
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,440
heart that can

159
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:37,560
that can love most

160
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:47,279
easefully a settled heart can have good will

161
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:56,800
kindness can have care and respect for others

162
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:14,838
a settled heart doesn't sacrifice

163
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:20,720
itself for anger or resentments

164
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,560
frustrations fears

165
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:36,920
settling the heart so we can gaze Upon This World

166
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,720
this suffering

167
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,520
world with an attitude of care of

168
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:54,480
kindness an attitude that we would like to

169
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,480
spread kindness

170
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:07,560
support so everyone's heart can settle everyone's heart can

171
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:13,720
settle so the best quality of heart can grow in all

172
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:20,480
people may all beings be happy may all

173
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,640
beings be safe may all

174
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:31,400
beings be peaceful may all

175
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,680
beings be

176
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:42,480
free and may we stay close to this aspiration these

177
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:48,200
aspirations by staying close to a settled heart a settled

178
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,920
body a settled mind

[Music]

180
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,520
thank

181
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,280
you e

182
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,640
so hello and welcome to this series on

183
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,240
samadi and

184
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:27,359
um slow samama slowly moving into it and today I want to mention that

185
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:35,359
sometimes I think of samadi as settling as a subtleness samadi is

186
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:41,800
subtleness and when we sit down to meditate it's often good to start with

187
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:49,280
the idea of Discovery to discover how we are how are we right now and one of the

188
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,760
questions you can ask is given how I am

189
00:42:54,760 --> 00:43:03,680
what needs what is unsettled that maybe would be good to

190
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:10,319
settle now if it what's unsettled is something ideas about things in the

191
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:18,119
world something outside of ourselves we maybe won't settle those things the problems we have but we could

192
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:24,720
settle what needs to can be settled is the mind's agitation the heart's

193
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:31,920
activation around things that are feel unsettled and this is where meditation

194
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:39,359
comes into into into highlight for us is how it when we come back to notice where

195
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:45,559
we're unsettled inside then we can ask now let how do we

196
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:52,880
settle this and there's many answers at different for different things one of

197
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:59,960
them for when it's hard to stay focused on meditation the Mind wonders awful

198
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:05,000
lot one thing to become settled about is

199
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:11,040
that that's happening and that we can fold the distracted mind into the

200
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:17,359
meditation in this way to think of it that what we can do is offer a massage

201
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:23,040
to the mind that there's a natural process a

202
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:31,240
cycle of um wondering off and returning wandering off and

203
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:39,040
beginning again and that cycle provides a massage that we don't know what's being softened

204
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:46,400
and needed and relaxed but to appreciate that there's a cycle that our job is the

205
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:53,000
coming back our job is to wake up again is to be connected here again and we

206
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,800
know we're going to wander off but it the but be relax and settled this is a

207
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:05,040
process so that as soon as we notice we' wandered off we're relaxed and at ease

208
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:12,960
and know oh good come back be here uh show up here

209
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:18,000
again and um and that we're kind of going along going

210
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:24,800
along and if we're counting the breath the INB breath and the out breath uh

211
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:30,400
you're less likely to wander off so much because you have a reference point or

212
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:38,440
you're more likely to notice if your Wonder off and so one of the values is counting is to

213
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:43,880
notice when this massage is operating so you can be part of it more intimately

214
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:50,480
more closely so count one for the inhale and if you're counting two for the

215
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:56,640
exhale and you don't say to you might be really drifting off if you're able to

216
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:03,599
say to for the exhale um you might then see that you're not really there it's

217
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:10,280
become mechanical it's become automatic because you now you're drifting off in thought and that gives you the clue that

218
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:16,839
I'm drifting sooner than you would normally or if you don't catch it at all

219
00:46:16,839 --> 00:46:25,400
during the exhale you might catch it on the inhale oh I'm I I've drifted off in

220
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:30,520
thought and then the one saying one is

221
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:38,960
the settling word one or two is a settling word and what I

222
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:47,200
mean by that is you want to be able to if you do the counting of the breath to do it with

223
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:54,720
a tone of voice loudness energy in the mind of saying the word or imagining

224
00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:00,440
you're saying the word in such a way way that it just feels settling to say it

225
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:06,400
like if a if someone comes to you who's really upset maybe hurt maybe angry

226
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:12,880
maybe something that you would maybe change your voice uh to be available

227
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:20,480
clearly and you're the settling it's okay I'm here with you it's okay now and

228
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:28,319
so something can kind of begin to relax and settle and then um different times as we

229
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:36,440
discover what's going on for us and in some ways meditation is continual process of discovery we discover what

230
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:42,680
can be relaxed what can be settled and now sometimes what's being settled is the

231
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:51,359
body and um and uh sometimes what's being settled is the muscle musculatures and activity

232
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:57,079
of breathing itself maybe in the exhale we're really settling and relaxing those

233
00:47:57,079 --> 00:48:03,440
muscles that get engaged when we breathe in and um so that when we breathe in U

234
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:08,760
there's maybe less extra muscles engaged in that process there's an easeful

235
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:15,359
process of breathing in and breathing out maybe what could be settled would be

236
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:20,520
the mind and um sometimes uh saying counting

237
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:26,079
the breath um we're there with the breathing but since the words are a

238
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:31,400
little bit mental uh activity is to say the words so that

239
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:38,200
there's an um there's a settling and expanding of the mind just um that the

240
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:44,559
Mind opens up to be wider bigger um the shape of the mind is

241
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:51,319
arbitrary but if we're caught up in thoughts caught up in preoccupations the mind gets tight and sometimes shriveled

242
00:48:51,319 --> 00:48:57,480
sometimes constricted and um but to say these words why

243
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:04,000
one so the Mind expands two so the Mind

244
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:10,319
expands and then after a while go back to just the breathing but to stay close to that

245
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:16,520
rhythm of breathing through it all the rhythm of breathing is the is the

246
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:23,240
ultimate massage the ultimate reference point for this process of settling

247
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:33,440
connecting receiving the experience of the moment receiving the inhale relaxing the exhale

248
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:38,920
settling and um one of the interesting things about counting the breath if

249
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:44,400
you're doing it and I recommend that you try it for a while for this

250
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:51,359
week is that um the uh the amount of energy or or

251
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:57,280
effort or uh strength of that inner voice that does the counting

252
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:04,599
uh you have to pay attention that as you get more settled and relaxed in meditation uh you have to uh turn a dial

253
00:50:04,599 --> 00:50:10,160
in the mind so the you're saying one two

254
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:15,599
the count a quieter um if you say it too quiet

255
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:23,200
before you're ready the mind can drift off too too quickly so you have to kind of adjust the volume in such a way that

256
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:28,799
it you keeps you present but it helps you to settle without agitating you but

257
00:50:28,799 --> 00:50:35,200
as you subtle you might have to turn the dial down to quiet even

258
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:40,839
more so um I want to repeat a little bit some of the choices you have for how to

259
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:46,640
count and I apologize if offering you too many options um makes it

260
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:52,000
um you know makes it confusing but different people find different things are

261
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,280
useful uh and I find at different times different ways of counting are good

262
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:06,440
um sometimes uh just counting one with either the exhale or the inhale

263
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:15,480
all it's enough I find it very nice sometimes to just count one for the inhale and two for the

264
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:20,599
exhale sometimes it's nice because it engages me bit a little bit more is to

265
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:27,079
count one for the inhale two for the exhale three for the next inhale and

266
00:51:27,079 --> 00:51:32,720
then be quiet for the the next exhale would

267
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:39,319
normally get to count four and sometimes I can't help myself but to somehow in the back of the mind is say the number

268
00:51:39,319 --> 00:51:47,680
four but the idea is to kind of little bit not do it so there's space for some

269
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:54,079
real deeper connection some space to allow some deeper relaxation and opening

270
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:59,319
and uh and I find it kind of delightful if my mind back of my mind I still want

271
00:51:59,319 --> 00:52:05,720
to do the number four and um it's I kind of appreciate how effortless it just

272
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:13,960
arises by itself and uh and kind of the kind of not counting the on the four uh is a

273
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:20,799
protection from the counting getting automatic it's kind of a refreshing to start again at one so that's very very

274
00:52:20,799 --> 00:52:26,599
simple another way of doing it is to count to 10 so five inhales and five

275
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:33,799
exhales you get to 10 and then you start over uh another way is to only count the

276
00:52:33,799 --> 00:52:39,520
exhales um or to count the same count for the inhale and the exhale one one

277
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:45,599
two two so probably I shouldn't be giving you so many options um but if one

278
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:51,119
of them you know Sparks your interest keeps you

279
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:58,720
engaged you'll learn a lot about yourself by counting you'll learn a lot about the forces of distraction you

280
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:04,079
learn a lot about how you're practicing because sometimes we uh the the inner

281
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:12,040
voice of does the counting um is provides the evidence that we're straining or we're hesitating or we're

282
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:19,160
seeing it as a work the whole meditation is a work and we're kind of like you know it's kind of like a burden

283
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:25,720
kind of and so we can see a little bit through that voice unnecessary attitudes

284
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:33,200
and then see if through the voice you can change the attitude change so it's simpler easier cleaner how you're being

285
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:39,440
here with the experience so

286
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:48,160
um so to um uh count the breath and uh and then

287
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:53,839
uh tomorrow I'll give you a little bit more U discussion about how this

288
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:59,599
counting really supports this process of samama body in a deeper deeper

289
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:06,880
way so um may you continue with this for a while and again as I said yesterday I

290
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:13,839
really encourage you to um if you have the time the inclination to add a second

291
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:20,720
meditation in the day so that uh you can practice this more on your own so you

292
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:27,680
bring that with you for the next day to a little bit more of a foundation or a little bit more of momentum to go along

293
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:35,720
with what we're going to do here over time um so thank

294
00:54:55,319 --> 00:54:58,319
you

295
00:55:25,319 --> 00:55:28,319
