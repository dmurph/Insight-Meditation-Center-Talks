1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:08,920
so hello and welcome to this fifth guided meditation related to the

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,639
hindrances the five obstacles to staying

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:23,439
awake aware in the present moment and the five are desire sensual desire and

4
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,599
greed ill will aversion

5
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:34,640
then uh sloth and toror I call it rigidity and

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,399
toror and then restlessness and remorse and then the last one today it's

7
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:48,559
usually translated as doubt but it has uh the ancient meaning

8
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:54,359
is closer to um not seeing not

9
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:01,170
understanding what needs to be done and so that

10
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,520
[Music] our choice of where to put our life

11
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:15,360
energy goes to something which does not serve us the ancient texts say that one knows

12
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,280
what serves and what doesn't serve and uh and

13
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,520
so uh what serves us the most and to answer that

14
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:36,520
question the text talk about uh someone who has this so-called doubt doesn't

15
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:43,920
understand doesn't uh doesn't reflect doesn't their their way of understanding

16
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,000
does not come from a profound Source within

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,920
them that it's more surface thinking where the Mind jumps around is

18
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,240
distracted so you would say that if someone who spends a lot of time fantas EMP izing

19
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:08,000
about pleasures and something in their mind thinks

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,480
that's important that that's something that uh we should serve the pursuit of Pleasures

21
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,599
we don't think that way consciously but apparently something within us says thinks thinks that otherwise why would

22
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,000
we do it someone who has is profoundly

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,160
connected to themselves will understand that the way to serve ourselves is to

24
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,959
wake up is to be really present and clear to really this is what's happening

25
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:46,800
a definitiveness a Clarity of here I am and here this is what's

26
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,560
happening so it's not choosing to do anything

27
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,000
more than being clear about here this is

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,360
a person this is a mind that's involved in

29
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:12,080
fantasy but just to check that off like just to know it doesn't count for much but to know it from some kind of place

30
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:19,799
we know this is important this waking up and this deeper place of knowing what

31
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:28,159
to serve and not to serve also know something about um yes it's valuable to

32
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:34,439
develop steadiness and stab ility it's valuable to be grounded here so I can

33
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:42,000
see clearly so I will give myself to breathing or some other object of

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,879
present moment attention that is our home base our anchor

35
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:55,120
yes yes here so knowing what to serve and what

36
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,239
not to serve and some times we it's not just

37
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:08,079
sometimes we certainly can have doubt about what that is but sometimes we're just off we're serving things that don't

38
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:14,680
serve us we're giving our life energy to what doesn't serve us

39
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,759
well so to begin our

40
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:27,439
meditation and maybe closing your

41
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:35,880
eyes and feeling your body here the weight of your

42
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,479
body the substance of your

43
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,039
body the three-dimensionality of your

44
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,440
body and then in a

45
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:15,080
moment taking a deep breath and as you exhale say to yourself in your mind

46
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:21,960
here here I am and have a definitiveness definitive

47
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:31,000
recognition of the simple fact that here is where you sit here is where you are

48
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,560
so with a deep breath on the exhale

49
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
here

50
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:17,759
and taking a deep breath and as you exhale relaxing into

51
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,919
here softening the shoulders the

52
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,160
belly relaxing the muscles of your

53
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:43,960
face here and then letting your breathing

54
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,360
return to

55
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,720
normal and continue relaxing a bit

56
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:06,440
softening but as you're relax relax relax into the depth within

57
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:15,800
you softening into some place of deep stability deep

58
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,520
steadiness deep at homeness

59
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:36,720
here as you exhale relaxing the thinking

60
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,720
mind

61
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,759
softening quieting the thinking

62
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,319
mind here

63
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:08,319
and you might during this meditation say gently this word

64
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:16,080
here maybe added by here this is what it's like

65
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,520
now here this is what it's like

66
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:35,640
now as a clear alternative to wondering off in

67
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:42,959
thought being distracted or being involved with your

68
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:49,440
experience in ways which don't serve you which

69
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:57,240
involve greed or craving

70
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,640
wanting which involve a ver I Hill

71
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,440
will which involves shutting down or allowing your allowing something to

72
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:18,040
run off with your worries and

73
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:28,120
regrets keeping it really simple that the way you serve

74
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:35,800
yourself is to just be here this is how it is

75
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,200
now and then giving yourself over to the

76
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:51,000
breathing to serve you serve yourself well by centering yourself on breathing

77
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,480
in and breathing out you serve yourself

78
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,120
well by staying

79
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:14,200
Mindful and to have no doubt about that to know that this what this serves

80
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:25,240
you so that you can give yourself over to being mindful here with whatever

81
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:33,680
is happening here with the ongoing flow of

82
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
breathing

83
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959

sitting to again gently just the right amount for you and how you are

00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:16,600
now take a deeper breath and on the

114
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:22,120
exhale relax and let go into

115
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:32,520
here into the here which is found found in and through your

116
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,720
body if there are any ways that you are bracing yourself against

117
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:53,799
life on the exhale soften that

118
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
tension

119
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,559
and where within where in

120
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:21,159
your realm of your personal subjective experience of body and

121
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:29,520
mind do you find a place of

122
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:46,840
calm a sense of depth or

123
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:59,159
intimacy where inside of you in your subjective experience

124
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:06,480
is the source for living a life of

125
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,919
Integrity on the exhale letting go into that Source or

126
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:30,080
letting go into where it feels intimate

127
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,600
and at homeness within

128
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:53,679
you and then with your eyes closed let your eyes rest in their

129
00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:03,720
sockets almost as if the eyes can settle back into a deeper place inside

130
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:10,760
of calm or peace or even

131
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,760
Integrity the source of

132
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:26,120
stability and from there let the eyes imagine the eyes are now gazing upon the suffering

133
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:32,880
world that we live in without losing their

134
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:41,120
ease their depth the Integrity just gazing upon the

135
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:51,240

happy thank

151
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,159
you

152
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:34,200
so well sometimes I have to wait here a few moments for the recorder that we have

153
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:40,240
to somehow upload or process or do something with the

154
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:47,880
recording before I can start the recorder again and while we're waiting I just want to mention that uh

155
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:53,679
tomorrow I'm uh teaching a online Retreat a dayong retreat uh on

156
00:32:53,679 --> 00:33:00,440
mindfulness of the body uh through are the Insight Retreat Center if you go on the Insight Retreat

157
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:06,480
Center website you'll find there under Retreats listing for dayong Retreats and

158
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:13,480
and um you're welcome to join and you can welcome to join for any part of it if it'll be on

159
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:19,320
Zoom so um let's see what we have

160
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:28,799
here so so today the topic is the fifth

161
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:35,320
hindrance which is usually referred to as doubt as far as I know all the English

162
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:44,559
translators and teachers uh refer to this as doubt the meaning of the ancient word is

163
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:52,639
somehow to it means to uh think in faulty ways think in unskillful ways and that's

164
00:33:52,639 --> 00:34:01,159
how the ancient commentary understands it it's a way of thinking it says quoting them that uh knows the

165
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:07,960
distinction between what is skillful and not skillful what serves us and what

166
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:14,679
doesn't serve us or what should be served and what should not be served with our life

167
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:21,560
energy and um it's very useful to understand this fifth hindrance is doubt

168
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:28,560
because it's a obstacle that many people are struggling with um especially I

169
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:34,720
think maybe more so uh for practitioners in the west who come to Buddhism to

170
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:41,240
meditate because it's all little strange uh we're doing something that is maybe different than what we grew up

171
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:47,118
with even the values we grew up with the religion we grew up with and um and

172
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:52,358
maybe it's also very different from the values of our society and so and what

173
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:59,200
we've been taught by Society about what's important and even uh what we t thought by our society about who we are

174
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,079
and what we should be about with our desires our aversions our wishes or way

175
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:13,040
we think about oursel and so when we start settling in practice it's natural to to have doubt

176
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,119
have uncertainty and not know how to go forward not know where to commit

177
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:23,440
ourselves what what activity to give ourselves to and uh should I be doing

178
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:31,320
this should I be doing that should I be um uh uh you know I can't let go of

179
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:37,520
my you know my the anger of resentment I've carried all my life and um but here

180
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:44,680
I'm practicing and they're telling me to you know let go or to be mindful of it or settle more deeply and I will don't

181
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:51,520
know who I am and what should I do um so there can be doubt about the practice doubt about the teachings doubt

182
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:58,800
about oneself and one's ability to practice and it said that this kind of doubt can de derail us from doing the

183
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,000
practice but the important thing I want to emphasize here doing the

184
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,960
practice that um uh the way that the Ancients under Buddhists understood this

185
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:17,200
fifth hindrance it was a kind of faulty thinking that sets us off in the wrong

186
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,920
direction it's thinking which is not very profound which doesn't arise out of our

187
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:29,760
wisdom or out of the Yono Manara out of the profound profound way of thinking from

188
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,440
somehow in our depths when I uh began meditating on my

189
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:41,480
own in college I started doing it twice a day and

190
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:47,480
um and I had good reasons to do it I was suffering and I wanted to

191
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:54,440
somehow deal with my suffering and then an unusual thing happened after practicing it for many

192
00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:01,000
months is when I when I was meditating the suffering that I was

193
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:07,319
trying to contend with just wasn't there anymore it wasn't I had solved it or figure it out and it didn't actually go

194
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:14,800
away so much in my daily life but in meditation was no longer there and since I'm kind of U like to

195
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:21,280
have reasons for things I wondered why am I still

196
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:27,680
meditating and uh and I felt compelled to meditate it just felt like the right thing to do and I had no doubts about

197
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:34,800
that I should do it but I didn't have a reasons and I thought that was really strange and U so I lived with this kind

198
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:42,720
of question for a while and then one day I felt oh what happening here is that uh

199
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,240
when I sit down to meditate this is the most profound expression of my

200
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:54,000
expression just that it's available to me that's no different than the way that

201
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,200
an artist expresses herself in with paints or an artist expresses themselves

202
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:07,040
with um uh dancing or someone plays a musical instrument that it's a kind of

203
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:13,119
expression that is fulfilled in the moment it isn't like for a purpose Beyond

204
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:20,200
itself and um and uh and it just felt like this beautiful expression of somehow The

205
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:27,560
Depths or uh somehow my wholeness or for me I used the word integrity at the time

206
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:33,560
and then the task for me uh became how do I bring that sense of wholeness

207
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:41,000
Integrity the sense that what was what wanted to be expressed from my depths into my whole life outside of

208
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:48,280
meditation and um so then the question is was how do I speak how do I present

209
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:55,280
myself to other people what are the things I do with my life what are the actions I do the question was when I sit

210
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,440
down to meditate uh what is it that connects me to this what is it that that

211
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:06,359
comes out of this feeling of of um depth that I have that feels wholesome that

212
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:12,680
feels healthy that feels this is a a meaningful way to live a life is to come

213
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:18,440
from this feeling of connectedness and presence and that came out of here and

214
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:23,640
it gave a direction to my life and it gave a a a clarity about what I was

215
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:31,359
doing in meditation there was uh I'm here to sit and wake up and be present to relax and

216
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:38,079
open to this depth that's within this place of freedom from contraction I'm

217
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:44,800
here to no longer live with tension no longer live with craving and desire no

218
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:51,440
longer live with conceit all these things I could feel were diminishing myself making myself less than I

219
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:58,359
actually am in some way and um and uh so it became very

220
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:06,119
clear that when my mind started drifting off in thought and those thoughts didn't serve myself I knew it oh they were kind

221
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:13,920
of an ouch they were kind of like a diminishment of the wholeness the fullness of who I was I am and so of

222
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,119
course I wanted to return here to this moment here and I found it was so

223
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:25,160
profound just to say the word here here I am this is how it is now we're sitting

224
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:32,920
in the heess of the moment that there was something very profound even if the heess of the moment

225
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:39,560
was my suffering or was thoughts that were unskillful in saying out here and just

226
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:45,400
being alive being present feeling the totality of it and somehow I was no

227
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:52,680
longer participating in it but I was also not condemning it I was not fighting it I was not just I'm here with

228
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:59,359
it not giving into it so I had Clarity so part of this

229
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:05,760
fifth hindrance and as I'm talking about the hindrances overall for this week uh

230
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:12,359
have a lot to do with action the Buddha was said to be a teacher of action how

231
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:19,839
do we act how do we engage what do we do with our life energy meditation can often be seen as

232
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:26,319
POS passivity like we're not supposed to do anything it's not right in Buddhist

233
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:31,599
meditation is an action it's an activity that we engage in it's when we engage in

234
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:38,240
in a peaceful way in a calm way it's when we engage in that Stills and quiets

235
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:44,640
the overactive mind the Mind might become quiet and peaceful but it our

236
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:52,680
action is still very peaceful and calm and settled soft but it's still showing

237
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:59,960
up in an activity it's still being here at some point uh this inner Express

238
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:05,160
expression of Life coming through us to be alive to be present is not something

239
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:10,319
we do self-consciously it's just here flowing through

240
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:16,480
us but it's still an activity that we're here showing up here being here in this

241
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:23,200
full way so this last uh hindrance often called doubt sometimes more

242
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:29,880
interestingly considered to be indecisiveness uh not knowing what to decide what to do

243
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:35,079
but at uh in the original text the original teachings it was more than

244
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:41,839
those it was faulty thinking the kind of thinking that doesn't understand what is

245
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:47,319
for our best and what's best for the world how to show up for ourselves any

246
00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:53,800
moment in a healthy way in a skillful way and uh not to know that and the

247
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:59,079
ancient text talks the way we know that is not from the surface mind not from

248
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:08,359
the mind that thinks in a shallow ways jumping around and and the mind that thinks from you know anxiety or worry or

249
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:16,040
or um you know uh kind of greed or hatred but the mind that's deep the mind

250
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:21,240
that that kind of a deep Source within that's settled that's

251
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:26,599
peaceful that's not easy to have but that's part of the function of medic

252
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:32,520
meditation is to wake up relax get

253
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:38,599
settled create a sense of of uh Unity or Harmony or

254
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:45,880
wholeness with being here where we're not divided against ourselves we don't

255
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:53,960
divide ourselves fragment ourselves by our desires and our versions by our fears and

256
00:43:53,960 --> 00:44:01,520
our shutting Downs by our restlessness and our Regrets We Do the opposite we show up

257
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:07,040
for all of it warts and all but from this profound

258
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:12,720
place of wholeness of Integrity of willingness to kind of open and

259
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:19,280
feel so to have V vetta I think it's

260
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:26,319
pronounced in poly to have this uh uh harmful way of

261
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:31,520
thinking faulty way of thinking that gets in the way of doing the practice

262
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:37,440
because it takes us in the wrong direction and so we're called upon not

263
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:43,599
to read Buddhist texts so we have no doubt about you know what the teachings

264
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:51,400
are about we're called upon to develop the inner sensitivity that we can

265
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:57,359
understand from our own inner experience this is healthy

266
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:06,079
not only is it healthy but if we're going to serve something profound serve this health serve this

267
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:12,760
wholesomeness it's the same health and wholesomeness that will support you to

268
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:21,440
serve and care for the suffering of this world the world needs us and needs us to

269
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:27,559
do this healthy work so that in small ways and big ways

270
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:34,319
we can make a difference in this world a difference in making it a better place for

271
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:40,839
everyone so thank you for this um week of exploring the hindrances I hope this

272
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:47,559
was useful for you and I'll be back here on Monday for uh continuing this what

273
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:52,920
I'm I'm what I'm calling part two of introduction to mindfulness

274
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:57,880
meditation and um thank you

275
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:02,040
