1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:10,200
so hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:28,640
i have there's a tendency for me when i approach my meditation

3
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:35,760
meditation time and sitting down to become quiet in my mind

4
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:44,200
so it's a little strange sit down to meditate every morning with you this way and start with words

5
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,600
and um this idea of quiet it's like there are

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,640
times like in this uh vacation i had last week where

7
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,719
we're in the mountains hiking and and there'd be these places we'd come to

8
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,920
the beautiful mountain lakes and groves of trees

9
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:15,360
and it seemed that the way to approach it was to be quiet not to talk so much

10
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,200
and also to kind of have silence in the mind a receptivity

11
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,880
as if the place that we're in is to be respected and

12
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,119
attended to and heard and seen and listened to on its own terms

13
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:39,119
not on what i think what i think should be happening or what

14
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,960
i think i want or what my thoughts are spinning stories about

15
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,640
and perhaps there are some times in you know ordinary life where that

16
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,680
happens that maybe we go

17
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,520
to a temple or a church and entering into it there's a kind of

18
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,040
irreverence and a silence like okay this is a place to open attention up and and

19
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:14,160
take in the ambiance take in the presence that they're quiet and not come barreling ahead with all

20
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:21,040
our thoughts and concerns going to a funeral can be like this

21
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,959
going to a a preschool class when all the children are napping

22
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:33,680
it's so peaceful and quiet and it's the time to become quiet oneself

23
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,200
and so meditation is a time like this where we're trying to

24
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,480
where the receptivity the availa that there's a presence not a presence

25
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,840
but there's a something we're attending to that

26
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,599
we're quieting the mind we're not living in the world of our thoughts and thinking and

27
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:01,200
what we how we're interpreting and things the stories we make about things the meaning

28
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,920
we have about what's happening and the expectations of what should be happening or what shouldn't be happening and

29
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,080
the mind can be spinning and sometimes it spins fast

30
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,440
there's fast food and now slow food there's fast thinking and there's slow

31
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,799
thinking and quiet thinking there's thinking that is more receptive

32
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,920
to the moment to be present and not asserting itself and its desires and

33
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,720
wants and wishes and fears on top of the moment

34
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:42,879
so we come to meditation and certainly to recognize how is it for us

35
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:50,080
are we bringing a truckload of thoughts ideas stories

36
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,720
memories plans concerns to churn and to think about

37
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,879
and if so then that's what should be listened to and attended to

38
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:08,080
in a quiet way as if something needs to be heard and

39
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:14,120
you're the hearer you're the one who will listen

40
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,359
and sometimes it's clear that coming into meditation we're allowing ourselves

41
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:25,520
to the thinking mind to take a backstage it's not that important what we think

42
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:32,479
what's important is what we're feeling or what's happening or the presence the attentiveness to the situation

43
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:38,240
allowing the situation to speak to us rather than us

44
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:45,759
being the speaker and the talker and so to sit in meditation with a

45
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,360
quietude a receptivity a listening

46
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,600
to whatever is there so to

47
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:06,000
assume a meditation posture a posture in which to be receptive

48
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,840
a posture in which to listen better

49
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,039
a posture which doesn't doesn't yes

50
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,560
which uses the body

51
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,479
to attend to be here with our experience

52
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,400
it means being many people sitting a little bit more upright or a little bit more intentional

53
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:55,759
and then gently sending uh gently closing your eyes

54
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,120
and noticing

55
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:13,360
how this moment is for you as if your body your heart your mind is

56
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:21,840
the temple that you step into maybe something become quieter

57
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,360
as you listen sense feel

58
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,840
what is here

59
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:50,960
and within with what's here gently gently and maybe slowly

60
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,919
taking a few long breaths

61
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,400
as if with each breath

62
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:11,280
you're gently touching your full experience

63
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,639
gently feeling attending

64
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,639
and as you exhale relax soften this body

65
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,879
letting your breathing return to normal

66
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:04,160
and as we you continue meditating today and you notice that you might be

67
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:12,440
thinking and lost in thought involved in thought

68
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:21,440
remind yourself there's a different way of being it does not depend on thinking

69
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:30,400
letting your thoughts get quiet softer

70
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:40,080
the thinking recede to the background so you're not living in your thoughts

71
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,600
so you're not seeing everything through the lens

72
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,759
of thinking and stories and meaning

73
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,839
let your experience of the moment

74
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,079
be known quietly without thinking

75
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,839
a reverence a respect for everything

76
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:23,320
which calls on invites a quieting of the mind

77
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,080
as you enter into a sacred place

78
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:36,040
of your direct immediate experience breathing here

79
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,200
so

80
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,040
so

81
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,160
okay

82
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,920
so

83
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,120
so

84
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,160
so

85
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:22,080
for this meditation don't center yourself on your thinking

86
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,760
let the thinking recede so you could center yourself on your

87
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:36,000
direct experience as if your thinking mind gets quiet

88
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,960
so you can feel better or hear better

89
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,039
there can be a receptivity

90
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,840
to the specialness of the moment

91
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:53,360
so as we come to the end of the sitting

92
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:03,039
perhaps it's possible to feel recognize the difference

93
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:08,880
between being with other people and asserting

94
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:15,640
our desires our needs our agendas

95
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:23,679
versus being present with others and

96
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:32,720
listening receiving the other being available for the other to be

97
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:43,360
to barrel ahead with your own wishes and needs and desires

98
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:51,760
or to relax and open up and to get to know the other person

99
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:01,679
to feel to sense to really know who you're with

100
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,679
and love in the family of love compassion

101
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,720
care good will kindness

102
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:28,640
arises most easily in the second mode it doesn't have much space

103
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:35,120
when we are asserting ourselves and asserting our needs and our wants and

104
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,880
our agendas but love has much more time and space

105
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,399
and availability when we take the time to be quiet and

106
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:54,200
reset receptive to know the person we're with

107
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,559
so perhaps you can imagine

108
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:08,720
meeting someone today stranger or someone you know

109
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:15,120
from the peacefulness or receptivity or calmness of meditation

110
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:24,799
or the way whatever way in meditation self-assertion has taken a backs

111
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,398
a back back step in the background

112
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:39,919
and you can just be with someone without a need or a want or an assertion of self

113
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:48,640
and from this place to let there be kindness good will

114
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:55,760
well well-wishing may others

115
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:01,919
be happy may others

116
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,320
be safe

117
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,799
may others be peaceful

118
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,639
may others be free

119
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:30,840
and may you tap into your kindness and love

120
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:40,159
with which to meet others

121
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,559
may we meet in friendliness and kindness today

122
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:56,559
as we learn not to fill the space with our stories our genders

123
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:04,159
our needs our wants so there's more space to know and to

124
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,240
feel and to love

125
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,799
me

126
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,200
so

127
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:43,130
[Music]

128
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:48,240
so hello and welcome to this second talk on

129
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,640
grief a

130
00:33:54,559 --> 00:34:01,360
topic and a state of being that can be very difficult

131
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,720
and also can be very deeply connected to our love

132
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:13,440
and the depths of who we are and what we think is important in this life

133
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:21,358
so it's a very important topic to be able to learn how to be present for and recognize and then get under the surface

134
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:27,839
of to see more clearly and grief is not an enemy or grief is

135
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:33,760
not a illness or a problem grief is a part and parcel of a human

136
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:40,240
life and becoming wise about it and knowing how to

137
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:46,839
be with grief is one of the great benefits of mindfulness

138
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:52,560
practice so i'm defining grief as the

139
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:58,240
pain is see

140
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:05,040
the pain arising in the emptiness born from loss

141
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,640
the pain that arises in the emptiness born from loss

142
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:17,440
and this definition i'm hoping will span all the different ways in which

143
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,920
griefs are experienced because there's an infinite number of ways that

144
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:32,640
grief is sometimes it's more emotional sometimes it's more physical sometimes it's more

145
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:39,839
relational in nature and there's all kinds of very different cultures grieve in different

146
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:47,280
ways different ways different different cultures experience the pain not lost in different ways

147
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:54,320
but because it involves a loss that loss means there's now an emptiness an absence of something

148
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:01,680
and that absence that emptiness can be huge and some people feel it's so huge that

149
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:07,839
it you know nothing will ever fill it again and we'll always be in this great vacuum or great

150
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:12,960
place of meaningless or loneliness or loss

151
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,320
but the bigger that emptiness is the bigger that

152
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:26,800
absence is it actually the more it gets filled and it gets filled with many many things

153
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:33,839
and part of mindfulness practice is to begin to enter into this world of this emptiness

154
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:39,760
to be able to see clearly what is it that fills the emptiness that we're in

155
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:46,640
what is it that characterizes this pain this discomfort that comes with loss

156
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:53,200
and and so rather than taking it as being a singular thing

157
00:36:53,200 --> 00:37:00,400
my grief now we can put a little question mark after it what is this

158
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,760
maybe we don't really know the grief so what is this grief

159
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,800
and to sit with it to be with it not so much to investigate and think about it

160
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:16,480
but rather to enter into grief as if it's a temple or sacred

161
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:24,320
spot or place where we enter into quietly peacefully non-assertively

162
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,680
without our needs without our demands and our wants but to really be

163
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:37,359
present in the middle of this emptiness to make space and room for what's there

164
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:43,440
and then to see all the different elements of it and one of the key things to think about

165
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,800
or that i think i find helpful is to not give a lot of

166
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:56,720
preferential treatment to the world of thinking to thoughts and stories and memories and

167
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,920
meanings that we assign to the situation but rather to be entering into this

168
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:08,960
emptiness and start seeing there is stories there are meanings there are

169
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:16,480
thoughts ideas associations there those are there a part of the big picture including the emotions and the feelings

170
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:23,599
and to begin seeing making space for all the component parts grief is a composite

171
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,720
of many different pieces and parts some of them come are very personal

172
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:34,880
some of them are cultural some of them are come from our life experience

173
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,160
some of them come from our hopes and aspirations that we have that have been

174
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,440
maybe been the rug has been pulled away from them and so to begin to see the different be

175
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,880
pre enter into this carefully and make space and quietude to really

176
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:58,000
recognize oh this is what's happening make space for it and to

177
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:05,040
become quiet the thinking mind can become quiet in the relationship to grief

178
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,320
and this is not easy but it's probably one of the most respectful things to do

179
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,680
to really make room for the natural or inner process that

180
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:23,440
our body has for being with grief and allowing grief its space and its time

181
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,920
so to be able to kind of begin understanding the component parts of grief

182
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:37,280
i want to talk a little bit about what these might be and one of them is to appreciate

183
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:43,280
the kind of grief it is or the source of the grief

184
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:49,440
so some grief is very relational in nature it has to do with the relationship that

185
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:57,280
has been severed and lost like there's been a death death of a parent or a child or a spouse

186
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:02,320
a sibling or a friend and that relationship was so important

187
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:08,240
and so there's a lot of a lot about that relationship that comes into play with the grief

188
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:14,079
there might be a divorce and a lot about that relationship comes into play with the grief

189
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:20,240
and uh and that relationship is what is the emptiness is the loss of the of um

190
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:27,440
the you know the laws that has created the absence and so to understand that the quality of

191
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:34,480
the relatedness that's no longer there or is lost or is it been

192
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,000
other kinds of grief are more functional that isn't so much a relationship with

193
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,720
another person but we're losing our abilities so there's a grief about aging when we

194
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:54,000
get older some of many of our abilities become less and less and there's a grief from an accident that

195
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,359
some abilities we have functions we have no longer work and we've lost uh

196
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:04,400
maybe been paralyzed by something and and we'll never be able to do things we

197
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,599
did before because our body doesn't function the same way and

198
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:14,560
so the loss of functioning of abilities that we've had

199
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:21,119
there's uh the loss of roles that sometimes people retire they've lost

200
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:26,960
their role that it was so important for who they were children leave home and the role of

201
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:34,400
being a parent is no longer there and it's that's the grief is not being able to care or take care of someone or have

202
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:41,760
breakfast ready for someone you know that and um there's a

203
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:47,520
someone dies and part of the grief is not the loss of the relationship or is it a loss of the relationship but

204
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:53,760
another part of it is um now we can't have that role of the caregiver or the lover or

205
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:59,599
or the friend of someone which was so valuable for us such an important part of our our identity who

206
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:04,640
we were and then there's more clearly the identity itself

207
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:10,160
that um being some person is you can't be that person anymore

208
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:18,720
when this kind of loss has gone away and not the way that you experienced it before the loss of identity loss of

209
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:23,839
who you thought you were and who you thought you were going to become

210
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:30,319
that you know spouse dies and you expected that you'd be in retirement together or traveling around the world

211
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:36,880
or playing bridge or something something with yours but now this spouse is gone and

212
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,920
the anticipated futures are not no longer there

213
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:47,359
some people are grieving lost futures lost anticipated ideas of what was going

214
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:52,640
to come but also lost identities of who we were going to be

215
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:58,880
we lost we lose material goods we might lose all our money in a stock market crash

216
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:04,240
and our identity as someone who is financially stable or secure or even

217
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,280
wealthy is gone or our identity as someone who can do certain things that requires money goes

218
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,880
away and and so it's a loss of grieving the identity grieving loss

219
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,480
and then there's a loss of material goods uh all kinds of you know losting of

220
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:27,760
wealth like i said money but losing um valuable piece of property that we have

221
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,880
or losing our financial security or losing our home

222
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:39,680
that we've had for many times of divorce and we lose something that was so important for us

223
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:47,040
so these are all different kinds of losses that come into play when people can experience grief around these things

224
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:54,319
and some of these griefs are very personal in nature and some of them are more social and interpersonal in nature

225
00:43:54,319 --> 00:44:01,119
there's a personal and interpersonal quality to it some of them so for example the personal

226
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:07,599
is an individualistic culture like maybe the united states

227
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:15,680
many people are not living in a rich dynamic social

228
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:22,720
sphere of family or clan or tribe or different things and so there's a loss maybe a couple has

229
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,920
been living together alone and they're old and and maybe

230
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:33,040
you know there's no one who's taking care of them particularly and so one person dies

231
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:38,319
and it isn't that now they're part of a rich network of family and a clan

232
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:45,440
tribe and so the grief is very individualistic very alone and so grief can be very lonely

233
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,960
other popular people who might be living in a extended family in a compound or a town

234
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:56,000
or village or a tribe and um the elder of the tribe dies

235
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:03,040
the grief is very social it's collective it's something that everyone shares and the social dynamic of the village has

236
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:08,160
changed with this death and and people that the whole so social

237
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:14,400
world begin shifting and changing and so grief takes a very different form

238
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:20,640
than when it's not it's not so lonely it's uh it's collective when it's collective it's more cultural

239
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:26,240
and there's cultural aspects that come into play with how we grieve

240
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:32,480
and so um there's so grief is a composite it's

241
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:39,200
made up of many different things grief is not a singular thing though each powerful grief that we experience

242
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:46,480
might seem like this is the end of the world this is it that you know this is the thing you know that is so huge and how could anything

243
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:51,119
ever be the same again

244
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:57,920
but to enter into the world of our grief maybe in meditation

245
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:04,560
and let the mind become quiet this is one of the gifts

246
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:10,720
or the approaches of the meditation world life and that is to enter into what's

247
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:17,119
difficult be present for it but don't let thinking get the upper hand

248
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:22,319
but to feel and sense and begin allowing the pieces of it to show itself and to

249
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:27,599
be recognized and be known some very different things can happen

250
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:32,800
in with grief when we're not churning and thinking and spinning

251
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:39,680
and living in the thoughts and the ideas and the histories and the memories and the and the ideas

252
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:46,560
but they become quiet quieting the stories

253
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:51,680
the stories are important but there's another way

254
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:57,440
so in these few words i have in this 15 minutes i hope that this has

255
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,560
given you something to consider that

256
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:09,760
in the emptiness of grief we fill it with many many things and to sit quietly in the middle of it

257
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:16,079
so all the different component parts can be recognized and that which is extra

258
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:21,280
those pieces of the component parts of grief which are not needed can quiet and

259
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:27,040
settle and some of that has to do with the stories we tell ourselves and the

260
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:33,680
meanings we assign to grief and that'll be the topic for tomorrow

261
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:39,400
so um thank you and

262
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:44,720
care for yourself well and think of mindfulness of however you are

263
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:50,079
as mindfulness as a powerful way of protecting yourself caring for

264
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:57,040
yourself loving yourself by not asserting your desires and needs on top of

265
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:03,599
yourself but rather to listen deeply to respect here

266
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:07,559
so thank you
