1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:08,080
so hello and warm greetings from the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:15,680
City and um here to give uh the fifth of

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:25,240
these guided meditations related to the theme of the road and The Road Less

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,200
taken and um one way I'm of

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:38,040
understanding the potential of Buddhist practice is that involves

6
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:45,039
uncovering a treasure which is inside that we have a amazingly valuable

7
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:53,000
jewel or treasure waiting for us and um mostly we're too distracted to

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,559
notice it to know it and with the business of life or the survival of life

9
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:07,159
and uh but in order to discover it it's a matter of being

10
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:14,320
quiet being able to be quiet enough to listen with a silent mind or to feel

11
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:21,479
with a silent space in the body that this treasure in a sense is

12
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:27,520
shy or it's uh it's soft and gentle and

13
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:35,280
so when there's a lot of force and AG agitation or distraction or activity um it covers it

14
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,680
over and so one of the reasons I think uh a contemplative life people who do

15
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:48,759
contemplative practice like quiet and silence is because it's only there that

16
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:55,280
uh we can really kind of maybe for the first time tap into this this

17
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,600
treasure and um that we have inside and so

18
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:07,360
uh to listen to this place of goodness that we have and what one of the reasons

19
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:15,000
it's so important is that that uh this treasure part of its manifestation or

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,800
part of its orientation is to avoid causing

21
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:28,000
harm because to cause harm intentionally is to live in a divided World a agitated

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:37,120
World a loud world where this inner sense of Integrity wholeness cannot be

23
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:47,040
known so to uh to avoid harm to avoid lying to avoid confusing

24
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,959
or clouding the mind or agitating the mind

25
00:02:52,760 --> 00:03:00,360
unduly uh it's a place where love and care arise from

26
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,480
of course there's all kinds of love but the love that uh that contemplatives

27
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,400
emphasize that has a source deep within that is available to

28
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:21,040
love impartially to love all beings to care for everyone including those people

29
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:29,159
that are our enemies or difficult for us so this treasure

30
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,640
that we have so as we sit this morning meditate

31
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:41,159
this today the orientation would be will be

32
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:47,599
to listen feel below the level of the discursive

33
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,400
mind that thinks a lot and maybe that mind doesn't quiet so

34
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,519
much but maybe not to orient or focus on it but rather let it kind of recede to

35
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,680
the background so that some deeper connection can

36
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,040
occur so to assume a meditation

37
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,359
posture and gently close your

38
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:27,199
eyes and with your eyes closed feeling your posture from the

39
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:34,120
inside and seeing your body itself your meditative body

40
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:41,680
your contemplative body wants any adjustments to your

41
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,520
posture that helps you feel more connected more

42
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:58,639
alive more attuned here in this body

43
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:27,560
and with that the idea that and in a manner that allows the body and mind to quiet to

44
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:35,680
settle to be known to be recognized so something can

45
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:43,520
relax take a long comfortable inhale feeling as much

46
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:50,720
as you can your body and an extended

47
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,120
exhale relaxing as you exhale

48
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:23,360
at the end of that extended exhale let there be a moment or even an

49
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:30,240
instant that you wait to breathe in

50
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:38,919
just long enough that it quiets the mind around the interest to breathe

51
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:44,280
in without agitating the mind

52
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:04,919
and then letting your breathing return to

53
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:18,039
normal and again for an instant or a moment or

54
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:24,759
two to pause at the end of the exhale and in that

55
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:32,080
pause see if you can let there be a quieting of the thinking

56
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,560
mind is settling into the bottom of the of

57
00:07:51,680 --> 00:08:01,439
breathing and as you in inhale relax with the inhale

58
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:11,360
as if you're making room for the inhale to be complete

59
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,360
and then letting your breathing be

60
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:45,200
normal and now in the inhale feel the thinking

61
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:52,200
mind allowing it to be as it is just know the agitation the

62
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,680
energy the manner with which you're thinking

63
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:12,040
and on the exhale to soften quiet the thinking mind

64
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:38,800
relaxing any physical tension that might be associated with

65
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
thinking

66
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,320
e e

67
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:26,639
and then centering yourself on your breathing feeling and

68
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,680
sensing the quiet quiet soft place

69
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:45,160
inside maybe the place where breathing

70
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,120
begins and

71
00:11:53,279 --> 00:12:01,200
ends or or maybe a place within that is itself self

72
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,120
quiet free of thoughts and

73
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:16,680
ideas but filled with a

74
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:26,040
goodness with a calm capacity for care and love

75
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,000
the the shy place within that can

76
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:48,639
feel the difference between something which feels wholesome and UNH

77
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:54,160
wholesome feels nourishing for us and not

78
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
nourishing

79
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120

e e

99
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,480
as we approach the end of the

100
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:45,960
sitting to now listen or feel

101
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:53,760
sense for that quiet place

102
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,720
within that is a treasure

103
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,840
that is the source of well-being

104
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:12,480
goodness the orientation towards

105
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:19,360
nonharming non greed nonh hatred

106
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,919
and maybe it's only an

107
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:42,000
intuition of this quiet Source

108
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:49,200
within a place of a quiet

109
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:59,240
attitude oriented towards what is wholesome

110
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:04,200
oriented to what is

111
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:10,200
free free of all

112
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:22,200
attachments to let the thinking mind become quiet in the way you would if you

113
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:31,480
listening to a faint sound far away so let the thinking mind become

114
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:39,559
quiet as you listen or feel to what's deep

115
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
inside

116
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,278
e for

117
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:24,120
and then bringing this meditation to an

118
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:36,440
end to find within an attitude of Good Will

119
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:43,640
kindness gentleness

120
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:53,919

128
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:52,559
[Music] free thank

129
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,080
you e

130
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:44,600
so welcome to this Fifth Fifth talk on taking The Road Less

131
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:50,320
Traveled and the emphasis this week has been that there are two different

132
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:56,440
operating systems within us there's the operating system that's UNH wholesome

133
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,760
and one that's wholesome and UNH wholesome doesn't uh mean that

134
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:08,840
it's bad or uh in and of itself but rather it

135
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:13,880
involves a way of activity of the mind that uh might even

136
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:19,799
have good things in mind it could be generous and loving parts of it but that

137
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:26,720
the way we engage in it has a kind of tension or has attachment or clinging or

138
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,559
aggressiveness or anxiety connected to it so that there's

139
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:38,360
a quality of it which is Den nourishing for us rather than being nourishing for

140
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:44,760
us that is stressful for us rather than um not the not just distressing but

141
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:51,600
better than that that is inspiring for us that uh brings us kind of enlivens us

142
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,919
in a wonderful and happy way so there are these two different

143
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:03,639
systems that we have and um and that uh Dharma practice has a

144
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:11,440
lot to do with becoming free enough becoming settled enough that this we can

145
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:19,600
start allowing this deeper system to inform us to move through us to carry us

146
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,720
and these are all kind of passive idea verbs in in the sense

147
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,639
that a lot of what we do is we get out of the way way we allow this organic

148
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:37,200
movement to uh go through us and guide us uh I love the metaphor the Buddha

149
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:45,360
uses for a particular state of samade that of an uh an uh a lake which

150
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,960
there's nothing coming in from outside the lake to Stir It Up or to replenish

151
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,360
it with muddy water when it rains and the ground is Muddy the mud gets poured

152
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:03,440
pours into the lake and stir it up and and um but there's no no inputs like

153
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:10,039
that rather the how the uh the lake gets refreshed is from a deep underground

154
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:16,639
Source uh spring under the lake bringing pure water CLE clean water in back into

155
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:25,440
the lake and filling it and so the same way we have we can have this inner kind of spring that uh

156
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:33,559
that flows and moves us that uh we don't have to do so much but we allow for when

157
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:40,240
I studied Zen part of the language there was that we don't do meditation uh we

158
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,080
are meditated we don't do the practice we are practi that somehow we put

159
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:52,840
ourselves in a good posture and Zen you sat in a very clear upright posture and

160
00:32:52,840 --> 00:33:00,039
then the idea was to do very very little but to allow some deeper mov M ment of

161
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:06,279
um uh to course through us to to be practiced by it and they had kind of

162
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:13,960
grand they have kind of wonderfully Grand language in Zen where the idea is you're not sitting to attain anything

163
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:20,039
but you're sitting to be a Buddha you're sitting to be Awakening and this idea

164
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:26,039
that there's something here that's operating which is uh quite significant

165
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:33,480
that uh is sacred that is wonderful that is not uh uh the normal way of Behaving

166
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:40,240
and doing and and and uh trying to make something happen is uh quite

167
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:47,240
inspiring and so as we um uh one of the core teachings of uh Buddhism is the

168
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:56,320
four noble truths and for people practicing mindfulness in a sense the path of mindfulness um is complete with

169
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:05,360
uh deep awareness Ness of the Four Noble Truths in the discourse in the four foundations of mindfulness it ends uh in

170
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:11,839
um in the four noble truths and what's significant about that is that the four

171
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:19,358
noble truths end themselves with the e-fold path and uh and that e-fold path

172
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:26,638
uh can be something that uh that's embodied within us the ancient language

173
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,960
is at the eful we we can be endowed with hateful path some translators use

174
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:38,520
instead of endowed use the word we possess the hateful path but that's a little bit too acquisitive but the idea

175
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:44,919
is that it's not something we do but something that's inherent in us that flows through

176
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:54,040
us and this is a little bit different than how traditional terad and Buddhism teachings are where the emphasis uh is

177
00:34:54,040 --> 00:35:00,440
on the third Noble truth the truth of the cessation of suffering and um so the

178
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:06,160
four noble truths are the truth of suffering the truth of the arising of

179
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:13,720
suffering the truth of the sensation of suffering and uh the Noble eful Path and

180
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:20,079
uh and usually it's translated as the um the pa the uh the the truth of the path

181
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:27,960
leading to the sensation of suffering but uh it's also can be the path of uh

182
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:33,359
uh the sensation of suffering what comes out of the end of suffering and the

183
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:42,000
teravan tradition uh kind of has the cessation as being the final ultimate goal and um and it is by doing so that

184
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,720
kind of Miss uh I think a very core part of the Buddhist teaching which is how we

185
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:55,200
live our lives and last week or two weeks ago I did this teaching on um from from my

186
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:00,280
translation of the book of eights where where what's the emphasis there is how

187
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:05,440
the sage lives their life there's no emphasis on some final attainment of

188
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:11,079
some ultimate state of of Mind Of Consciousness but rather living

189
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:17,440
peacefully living wisely living um um

190
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:24,319
happily that it's attaining these qualities that's important and so the Eightfold Path in the teachings of the

191
00:36:24,319 --> 00:36:31,520
Buddha um is understood in two ways it's understood as certainly as a practice as

192
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:37,000
eight practices that we choose to engage in and that's more for people who are

193
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,319
beginning the practice or for us anybody at times in our life when we're quite

194
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:51,599
agitated quite challenged and uh in all kinds of ways it's useful to have this practice to do but it's also a practice

195
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,960
it's also the eight-fold path is um when when we've settled enough and and we can

196
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:06,280
listen deeply and we don't have any agitation of suffering that gets in the way then it's it's being Buddha it's

197
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:14,200
being the eful path and um someone asked uh disciple of the

198
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:19,720
Buddha in the these ancient texts uh what is the stream what is the current

199
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:25,000
that we enter into when we become a stream mentor and uh the answer is it's

200
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,760
the Eightfold Path we don't we enter into this path a stream a current that's

201
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:37,720
flowing through us and the eight-fold path has a lot to do with um abstaining

202
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:43,880
from anything which is UNH wholesome and in and in instead of that what comes out

203
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:52,760
of us is what is wholesome from this deeper operating system and so um over and over again in

204
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:59,599
these uh ancient text uh kind of embedded in a way that many people haven't highlighted so clearly is uh

205
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:05,880
these two operating systems and um and this deeper connection to

206
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:14,599
something deep and some of the language of that depth is um uh uh uh distinction

207
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:20,720
between uh that which is worldly and that which is dhic or spiritual within

208
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:26,480
us uh the spiritual source and then the idea of source is actually mentioned

209
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:34,680
where the word Yon is used Yoni uh can be the source of Life uh uh and so for

210
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:41,640
humans it's understood to be the womb and but so there's a way of attending way of knowing way of being

211
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:48,319
present in this world uh even a way of contemplation of thinking which is not

212
00:38:48,319 --> 00:38:54,160
the discursive mind not this kind of Mind of attachment but rather comes from

213
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:59,880
this deeper Source the Yoni and and uh exactly how you want to translate Yoni

214
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:06,000
is uh you know is can be quite personal but uh from this deep Source

215
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:13,920
within and so the men the the the uh the just this gestational place within out

216
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:20,200
of which can arise understanding and and more importantly for people practicing

217
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:27,400
mindfulness can arise a way of attending a way of being of bringing our attention

218
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:33,480
to whatever is there and so it is so it's uh the very practice of awareness

219
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:40,119
of attention of mindfulness uh can come from these two sources and many times people who are

220
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:47,040
new are practicing from the you know the control tower source and uh slowly over

221
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,480
time we learn that the practice can well up from deep inside so it's not so much

222
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:58,440
something that we're doing but something that we are attuned to something we

223
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:03,680
allow for something that flows or lives within

224
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:12,119
us and ultimately it leads to what lives within us is the hateful path and so we

225
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:18,319
live in a kind of natural way uh because this distinction is between what is

226
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:26,960
natural and what is synthetic what is natural and what is constructed by the mind like um made up in a sense from our

227
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:34,760
attach Ms and clinging and so this natural movement of um of having a right

228
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:40,040
view or the complete view or the view from The

229
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:45,079
Source having uh uh right resolve or

230
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:51,200
intention having complete or or uh that

231
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:57,560
that view that comes from this source and so it's uh in fact the the word SU

232
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:04,079
that's translated as um right uh if you dig deep down into the

233
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:09,480
dictionaries and into the ancient text it means it doesn't uh it doesn't quite

234
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:15,640
mean like right and wrong it uh some people are translated as consumate it's

235
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:23,599
what it's complete it's What's um uh um is the complete

236
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:32,440
expression of this deeper source that is available when we're free and um anyway so there's right

237
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:38,560
intention right resolve right attitude there is right or consant or

238
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:46,200
attuned or Source uh uh Source uh

239
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:51,800
Speech there is right action there's a right

240
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:56,839
lifestyle sometimes this is called right livelihood but that's too narrow for

241
00:41:56,839 --> 00:42:02,400
what it is it's a whole lifestyle that we live that feels right or consument or

242
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:08,560
and then there's um this right effort just the right way to make effort that

243
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:13,599
uh and the and the goal explicit here is to have an effort that feels like we're

244
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:19,720
thriving feeling of abundance an effort which feels like something is growing

245
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:27,880
again this very different language that that's possible when we understand that it's coming out of this deep source

246
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:33,920
and uh and then uh write mindfulness and right concentration it's remarkable that

247
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:39,559
these deep things can be there so in terad and Buddhism we don't say that we

248
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:48,520
sit like the Buddha being Buddha they say in Zen um but uh rather we say

249
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:58,839
sit uh like the path the eful path be the path um uh being path and that uh

250
00:42:58,839 --> 00:43:06,000
that is the culmination of this path that we're on so I hope that this uh teaching this

251
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,160
week has been meaningful you for you that it points you to some very positive

252
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:19,960
orientation and inspiring orientation about the human potential and what's possible and that um and that uh it has

253
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:26,720
a lot to do in in its culmination and its consummation with a wonderful way of

254
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:34,079
living in this life that is free and uh generous caring and comes from this uh

255
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:39,760
deep place that uh is our treasure uh that we have

256
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:46,280
within and um may you be filled with the wealth of your inner

267
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:59,839
not part of mindfulness but which I want to really integrate in into the practice of

268
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:08,720
mindfulness and then finally um for those of you who would like this end of the year to uh maybe uh make a donation
