1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:10,320
so hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:17,199
i hope all of you who are living in heat waves will

3
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:23,760
take good care of yourself today and be sure to drink and all the kind of

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:31,519
basic things and it's nice to be able to meditate

5
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:37,200
so um this week i'm going to follow continue a

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,200
little bit with the theme from last week of the dharma and what i'd like to do instead of a

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,440
guided meditation is i'd like to read teachings of the buddha

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,440
verse poem that he comes from him that was apparently quite popular during

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,879
his time because it was recited often and

10
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:06,720
the monastic followers of the buddha were expected to memorize this and and

11
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:13,200
and have commentary about it and talk about it and it points i think to

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:20,000
uh it's kind of the essence of some way of understanding the essence of what the dharma is

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,840
this particular verse i kind of think of it as the anthem for the inside meditation movement

14
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,240
so i'll read it and then we'll just sit in silence today we've done a lot of guided meditations

15
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,720
over this time and i know some of you really value them a lot

16
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,920
and it's also very valuable to sit in silence and have more more for that and

17
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,920
so i'll read the poem and then we'll sit

18
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,399
so this this poem is called

19
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:11,440
an auspicious day the buddha said

20
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:18,640
don't chase the past or long for the future

21
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:25,760
the past is left behind the future not yet reached

22
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,080
right here where it is have insight

23
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,599
into whatever phenomena that has arisen

24
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:43,680
not faltering and not agitated by knowing it

25
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,239
one develops the mind ardently do what should be done today

26
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,440
who knows death may come tomorrow

27
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:02,879
there is no bargaining with mortality and his great army

28
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:09,360
whoever dwells thus ardent active day and night

29
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:18,920
is says the peaceful sage one who has an auspicious day

30
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,760
don't chase the past or long for the future the past is left behind the future is

31
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:33,480
not yet reached right here have insight

32
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,840
so with that we'll sit quietly for these minutes

33
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:26,799
the buddha said don't chase the past

34
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:35,120
or long for the future the past is left behind

35
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,080
the future is not yet reached

36
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:46,640
right here where it is have insight

37
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,000
into whatever phenomena has arisen

38
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:57,760
not faltering and not agitated

39
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:03,519
by knowing it one develops the mind

40
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:10,480
ardently do what should be done today who knows

41
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:17,760
death may come tomorrow there is no bargaining with mortality

42
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:25,039
and is great harmony whoever dwells thus ardent

43
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:31,919
active day and night is says the peaceful sage

44
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,320
one who has an auspicious day

45
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,459
[Music]

46
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:17,039
thank you as you know

47
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:25,519
that i value a lot doing a dedication of the benefit at the end of the each sitting

48
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:31,360
and there's a way in which

49
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:39,520
reading the poem of the buddhas is equivalent and as we do our own practice

50
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:46,520
i'm confident that we'll be people who will benefit the world

51
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,158
so hello everyone and

52
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,880
here we begin the next five day series

53
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:58,880
and for this week i'd like to do something a little unusual and that is to repeat the theme from

54
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:06,399
last week i think there's value in it in that the topic itself we can go further with it

55
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:13,360
it's so central and important to the practice that we're doing and also um

56
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:19,360
um sometimes when we keep moving to new themes maybe every week it's uh

57
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:26,880
the heart the mind the body has less opportunity to let each week's theme sink deeper

58
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:33,279
so uh that's the plan and so the plan is to

59
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:39,279
once again go through the five characteristics of the dharma

60
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:45,840
the dharma of the buddha is well spoken it is

61
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:53,440
visible here it is now immediate

62
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,880
it invites inspection come and see

63
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:06,080
it is onward leading and it is to pers it is to be personally

64
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:12,640
known by the wise so this dhamma in pali dharma in

65
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:18,399
sanskrit in english now is

66
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:25,519
you know it means something more than just the buddha's teachings what the buddha was

67
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,640
what his teachings were pointing at the idea is that that the buddha was

68
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:37,279
pointing to something for us to experience for ourselves that we become a wise person who experiences it

69
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:42,880
directly immediately here another place the buddha describes the

70
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,080
teaching he the dharma the teaching he gives as being

71
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:54,880
laid open clear and evident so again this immediacy it's right here

72
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:01,120
to be seen it's evident it's open nothing hidden and

73
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:07,039
so we can enter into this present moment more deeply to discover the dharma for

74
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:13,280
ourselves that's where it is we could also step back a little bit and see more clearly

75
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:19,679
what the buddha was teaching when he taught and had more confidence that what he was pointing to is what was in that poem i

76
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:26,960
read which is now here what's evident what's open what is

77
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:33,118
inviting inspection here and the uh the contrast to this

78
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,638
is in terms of religions and even some ways that people relate to buddhism

79
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:45,520
is belief looking for a belief to believe a doctrine to believe

80
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:52,000
and i know some people have come to buddhism and have the idea that if they're going to be good buddhists they have to believe whatever

81
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,520
the buddha said and or they're inclined to believe and

82
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:03,839
some people have this beautiful thing they say um

83
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,160
for whatever i've experienced for myself it verifies what the buddha teaches so

84
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:16,320
i'm inclined to believe everything he says now even what i haven't experienced myself

85
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,079
so this orientation around buddhism being a belief and we have to believe

86
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,839
in the ancient teachings of the buddha he was actually not interested in belief and was

87
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:34,880
actually quite discouraging of people to believe he said that he teaches the dharma

88
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:42,960
to eradicate belief or speculative views opinions

89
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:49,838
dogma attachments to the teachings speculation

90
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:58,560
his teachings was something very different very interesting story is of a man who was a famous debater at the

91
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,839
time of the buddha and religious debates were really a big deal in ancient ancient india

92
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:10,720
and so he was wanted to really kind of debate the buddha and kind of undermine him and

93
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,800
so he came i guess somewhat assertively to the buddha and say you know what is it that you teach

94
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,839
it was clearly was going to be debate and the buddha answered i teach that

95
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:26,960
with which one would have no quarrels with anybody in the world

96
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,720
and uh so so the guy didn't know what to do with himself and then he left

97
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:39,119
in a huff you know he realized it was no way in for the buddha that was his attitude

98
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:45,359
so this dharma we have that doesn't lead us to quarrel with anyone in the world it's not based on beliefs

99
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:51,920
opinions it's a very interesting exercise to go through uh the teachings of the buddhism

100
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:58,480
very many volumes of what survives and and asked the question

101
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,880
you know this when the buddha was going to teach the dharma in brief what did he teach

102
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:10,079
when he told others when you go out to teach and you want to teach what i teach

103
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:15,680
this is what you teach that when he talked about what the right view

104
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:23,359
is what's the right understanding to have when he talked about vika body translated as true knowledge

105
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:28,480
gnosis vija v i j a

106
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:34,000
and um what did he what did he point to is this the true understanding or the true

107
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,680
knowledge um buddha talked about the goal of practice

108
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,800
what did he talk about and when he taught the people who were maybe

109
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:52,480
closest to him and i think of his son he had a son one son who became monastic in time

110
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:58,320
the story is that he joined the order when he was seven years old and

111
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:05,839
you know we have records of what the buddha taught his own son you think that that's where he wants to emphasize what is most important

112
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:12,960
and so what was it he taught his son so all these questions if you take all of them together

113
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,480
and look at the buddha's answers to all of them phenomenally what you find

114
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,320
is he's talking about something that is evident here and now

115
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:30,880
the first of these characteristics the buddha is san ditiko the buddha

116
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:37,119
last week i said this the dhamma is sanditko it's dhamma is

117
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:42,640
here and now the word is visible here now

118
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:48,880
some people translate this as in this very life and

119
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:54,800
and the idea here is that it doesn't concern a future life or a past life

120
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,320
it's in this very life that we can realize what the dharma is about you don't have to postpone it you don't have

121
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:05,359
to hope for it in the future here and now in the immediacy of now

122
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:10,480
and and so in this very life is a powerful statement

123
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:17,440
because it it places the domain the locus the nexus

124
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,640
the center of what the buddha was teaching as something independent of past and

125
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:29,040
future lives which some people often associate past and future lives as a huge part of buddhism

126
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:35,119
it's certainly an important part of forms of buddhism how buddhism developed and maybe even had a place in the

127
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:42,320
teachings of the buddha but the concern with past and future lives

128
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:49,200
was not something the buddha talked about when he went through this is what the dharma is this is what

129
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:54,320
you should teach this poem i'll read it again that i just read

130
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:01,599
is a remarkable poem because it's in a group of texts many of them poems which in the most ancient uh

131
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:08,000
layer of buddhism there's direct there's indication that this is what people were chanting back

132
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:16,240
then you know we have all these volumes of the teachings of the buddha it's not completely clear what actually

133
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:23,680
belongs to him was his words and how much was attributed to him later but at this earliest historical layer we

134
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:31,760
find that the monastics of the time and the lay people as well were memorizing and talked about memorizing particular

135
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:39,040
verses and texts so this is what they felt was important to remember and to repeat over again

136
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:45,440
and all of these things together can be summarized in this verse that i

137
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:53,359
read before which i now read so what the buddha taught what the goal is what the he would teach his son what

138
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:58,000
um emphasize that people should memorize and remember

139
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,640
and this is the context for what's really considered one expression of what's central in the

140
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:10,079
dharma don't chase the past

141
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:16,000
or long for the future the past is left behind

142
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:22,480
the future is not yet reached right here

143
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:29,440
where it is have insight into whatever phenomena has arisen

144
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,440
not faltering and not agitated by knowing it

145
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:43,760
when develops the mind ardently do what should be done today

146
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,119
who knows death may come tomorrow

147
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:56,800
there is no bargaining with mortality and his great army whoever dwells thus ardent active day

148
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:03,599
and night is says a peaceful stage one who has an auspicious day

149
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:10,400
and the text is uh translated the title is an auspicious day it's in the middle length discourses

150
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:18,160
number 131 and um so when the buddha says in the

151
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,440
five descriptions the dhamma that it is visible

152
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:29,440
last week i said visible here and now and thinking about it it seems like we just say visible here

153
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:35,440
because the next one is about time immediate so it's visible here now it's in this

154
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,560
very life this is a very important principle very important idea

155

179
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:24,880

180
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:33,838
and in that own mind and heart of yours might there be

181
