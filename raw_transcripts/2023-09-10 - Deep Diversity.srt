1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:07,820
so when I was young

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:13,920
I grew up in four different countries and there was a period of time where we

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,740
would actually move between them every year you know twice a year kind of between

4
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:26,220
different ones and so it was a lot of moving and a lot of living in different countries and I was born in Norway so

5
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:33,840
when the one of those four places was United States so I was a foreigner in this country

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,500
and I had this strong wish at the time that I didn't tell anyone it's just it was a something I thought about in my

7
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,200
mind I really wished I could get a United Nations pass passport

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,300
I had heard there was such a thing and uh and um

9
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,399
and excited I didn't want to I wanted to belong to the whole world I wanted to it

10
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,460
didn't feel like I wanted to belong to any particular country but just be Global if they belong everywhere

11
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,560
and uh and some of that was born from seeing the divisiveness that happened

12
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:14,100
between countries and growing up in uh with parents and grandparents who

13
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:20,700
went through World War II and she said you know I was young I'm you know I was young young enough in the 60s

14
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,640
to really still experience the the after effect of World War II and the

15
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,420
divisions between countries and so this idea of you know kind of choosing your country against other countries was kind

16
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,720
of very painful these living in these divisions so uh that was you know that was kind of

17
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:46,259
my wish and now I've been here in the peninsula living here for 30

18
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:53,399
years about I guess 28 years I think living here but 33 years of being here because I started going to school at

19
00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:00,060
Stanford in 1990. and and one of the great Delights for me

20
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,780
in living here in the peninsula is how over these years has gotten increasingly cosmopolitan

21
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:13,020
so maybe I don't have to have an international passport you know I just live here and I

22
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:21,060
appreciate more and more diversity of people from all over the world who come here and diversity within this country and I I feel like it's much richer and I

23
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:27,480
also feel like it's for me personally much safer to live in a diverse community

24
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,060
um and the the representation of that was in all these kind of jumping around and

25
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:41,700
all this I did when I was 20 I lived for uh four months in the biggest hippie

26
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:48,959
coming in the United States it was 700 people who lived in a place called The Farm in Tennessee

27
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,540
and how a bunch of hate the Ashbury hippies end up in Tennessee as a whole

28
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:02,760
you know story and um and and when they were in hey Dash Berry or this locally in the 60s LSD was

29
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,280
kind of like the sacrament for this group of people they had kind of a spiritual bent

30
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,700
and uh of sorts and but they went to Tennessee it didn't really work well to take a lot of LSD in

31
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:20,040
Tennessee back then so when I came there to visit for a few

32
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:26,000
days actually the the leadership of the community was in jail for a year because of

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,879
such things and um but it was it was a year and they came out while I was still there

34
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,340
um and um and so they had to find another way of

35
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:44,580
you know there we can't do LSD anymore here we have to find something equivalent we can do that's legal

36
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:52,200
and the amazing thing they They Came Upon was honesty isn't that pretty cool that honesty is

37
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:59,760
you know equivalent to LSD and now that now there's a Resurgence of psychedelic interests in their in society but um I

38
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:06,480
haven't seen the same Resurgence of honesty but if honesty and psychedelics are equivalent

39
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:13,319
you know let's let's get high on honesty so I was so impressed by this

40
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:19,079
this really blew me away and that's seeing how this community had developed capacities to have these honest

41
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,540
communicate conversations um was the reason I stayed more than two

42
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:31,139
or three days and um and I stayed for four months

43
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:37,380
and uh learned a lot from them was inspired was actually my introduction to spirituality I had no background in

44
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:43,740
religion or spirituality before that but that was a doorway into the spiritual kind of world was that people who were

45
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:50,180
exploring honesty but the reason I left was that it was a

46
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:55,800
homogeneous culture for the most part there are all these people like me white

47
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,100
middle class hippies and I and I've been I I had grown up so

48
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:08,520
so many different cultures that I didn't feel safe to be around people who were too much like me

49
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:15,060
and so I left because because of that reason and uh some people would have stayed because they feel comforted by

50
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:20,280
that and feel like now I belong and and you know now we're all right together

51
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,320
but uh but I actually felt a little that's not quite right to do that

52
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:32,699
so uh because it's very easy to end up with um you know a very strong US versus

53
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:38,759
them and recently in this training I'll tell you about they gave an example of this

54
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:44,400
of of um Sports

55
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:52,380
and apparently there's a phenomena kind of a double standard that if the referee

56
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:59,280
or the Umpire uh kind of is a little bit ambiguous whether the

57
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,919
call was right but it's for your team that's that they got the call was right

58
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:12,300
then you know well that must be right but if it is your team and the call is

59
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:20,580
ambiguous but it's they you know maybe for the Empire the referee says it's wrong then people get really upset

60
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:25,680
the same opposite for the other team if the other team is ambiguous but their

61
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:32,100
team is the referee says it's right it was legal the game then

62
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:39,060
um if we get upset because it's the other team they have it wrong referees I have it all wrong they need to get new referees but if their referee says

63
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:45,240
they're wrong there's a penalty then yeah of course you know so there's a there's a double bind there

64
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:51,300
that's more likely there's a there's a bias towards forgiving or seeing the rightness of

65
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:58,440
your own group and the wrongness of another group and so you see that because I've seen people get it's

66
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,840
dramatic watching people do sports watch sports and how strongly their opinions

67
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,940
can be and how outraged they can be about these referees when they're voting

68
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:14,759
when they're against their own team so that's kind of a representative

69
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:20,340
representative of a kind of deep deep kind of bias that can operate in people

70
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:27,599
when we have us versus them so um I kind of feel uncomfortable for a

71
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:33,240
little bit watching even I am kind of weird I guess maybe for a societal standards

72
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:40,080
um the competitive Sports is kind of strange to me and I I kind of mostly root for the person who's losing

73
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,919
[Laughter] you know because then I want that you know and I like it in soccer where you

74
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:54,539
can come out even you know zero zero or one one and you know that I like that and um

75
00:07:54,539 --> 00:08:00,080
and uh when I was in college in the 70s there was a little movement of

76
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:07,020
Theodore was called um alternative games that people played there were no books written about it at

77
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:13,500
least fun games you could play that were not competitive so maybe that kind of is wonderful and

78
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:19,500
also we lose something in the process but so um

79
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,720
so I want to read um so I want to tell you a little bit

80
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,120
about this training we did for about 30 of us here at IMC called the trading

81
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,640
called Deep diversity and here at IMC we've spent a lot of time looking at diversity issue

82
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:42,120
diversity Equity inclusion issues and um and uh have read some of us have read a

83
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:48,300
lot about this some some here at MC much more than me and we've kind of settled on a

84
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:56,220
particular approach to this Dei work that really we feel works for who we are and that's uh we found it through a book

85
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,740
called Deep diversity and deep diversity uh created the people the author was

86
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:08,640
co-founded an organization called the anima uh leadership just called out of

87
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,459
my leadership organization something Institute or something doesn't have a third word

88
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:19,800
and um and they offer trainings and so 30 of us did the training and it was

89
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,899
quite wonderful I thought two weeks ago and uh and at various times we've been

90
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:29,940
we've had book groups here at IMC reading this book deep diversity and and

91
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:37,620
um with some of our Sangha leaders kind of leading the discussions and um and so we're going to begin to

92
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:44,339
bring more of this deep diversity to IMC and so I wanted to talk a little bit about this if I wanted to do it the best

93
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:49,860
I can and in the context of our practice and what we do here dharmically

94
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:57,839
so I want to begin with a suta and begin or continue with the sutta this course of the

95
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:03,080
teachings of the Buddha where someone came to the Buddha

96
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:11,839
and um said there are these four castes

97
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:20,880
the king oh so so um are these forecasts the Nobles the brahmanas the merchants

98
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,640
and the workers two of them that is the Nobles and the

99
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:34,440
brahmanas are held to be superior since people pay homage to them rise up

100
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:41,100
for them and Accord them reverential salutation and polite services

101
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:49,320
so are there people like that in this country this people who for whom are

102
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,600
held to be superior and people pay homage give them more respect than other

103
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,779
people rise up for them when they come you know kind of listen to them more their voices

104
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:07,620
are more important than other voices are there people in this country who are reverentially saluted and people who are

105
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:13,800
not and polite Services people get preferential services

106
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:21,420
uh periodically I hear from people who say yeah I went to a store and the person

107
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:27,899
there just ignored me I was there'd be Earth first I was in line first and and I just looked felt

108
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:33,920
like I was invisible sometimes people get older they say I feel invisible in society people just

109
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:42,000
overlooked me for that reason people racially are ignored and I remember going to Costco to get it

110
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,779
new tires for my car and there was a black woman sitting there and I came in later

111
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:55,740
and uh and the clerk came to me so I turned to the woman and said were

112
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:02,160
you here first and she said yes but then she explained she seemed okay with it and then we became friends it was very

113
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:09,300
nice but uh but to you know to see this kind of thing over and over again it's quite something in our society that can happen

114
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:14,399
so they might not be brahmanas and Merchants noble people but still we have

115
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,640
enough of this and and in our society that I think we can recognize some of this

116
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:28,579
so maybe the question is almost like you know are these distinctions existing here in our society in some way similar

117
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:34,980
um and um [Music]

118
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:41,880
so um so there's a recognition of these different castes and then the question is is there a

119
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:47,880
distinction or difference among them so the caste system is just taken for

120
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:53,100
granted what's the distinction and difference between them so this is the Buddha's answers he

121
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:59,639
answers indirectly first he says there are five

122
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:08,540
abilities for efforting five efforts we can engage in

123
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:13,800
we have the ability to awaken faith

124
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:19,019
confidence trust deep trust in something and then he gives the example that

125
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:24,060
trusts the capacity for human beings to become enlightened they become free to

126
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:31,380
become liberated of their suffering so it's possible to have deep faith in that that's the first he says

127
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:38,480
the second is um it's it's possible to work for and make the efforts for

128
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:45,899
becoming healthy and that's problematic just the way it's worded here but uh sometimes people

129
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:51,480
don't get healthy physically but you can get spiritually healthy even if if

130
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:59,240
you're chronically ill but there can be effort towards some kind of health health

131
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:05,700
there's efforts to be honest and sincere that's something we have the ability to

132
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:12,360
do that um one is honest and sincere one shows

133
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,760
oneself as one actually is to one's teacher and one's companions in the

134
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,860
spiritual life the other the next one the fourth one is

135
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:28,100
one can be energetic we can really put effort into

136
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:34,740
abandoning the unhelpful things that we do so there's plenty of people who do

137
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:40,139
unhelpful things even harmful things unskillful things and sometimes it's

138
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:45,300
called in Buddhism unwholesome things I like to call it unhealthy because it's

139
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:52,320
easier to identify with it but sometimes what we do is unhealthy for other people not just for ourselves

140
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,620
but to make an effort to stop doing that stop doing things which are unhealthy

141
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:04,199
we have that ability and we have the ability to undertake the

142
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:11,820
helpful things The Helpful wholesome skillful things to do and to be steadfast

143
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:17,639
and firm and persevering in cultivating these healthy things to

144
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:25,440
do so we have that capacity the ability and then the fourth fifth one uh one has

145
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:34,260
that we have the ability to be wise and we in particular we have the ability to be wise about how radically

146
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:40,019
changeable this reality we live in is our experience human life is how much change there is

147
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:47,820
and whether it's change Moment by moment or change year by year societies change all kinds of things change and it's

148
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:53,820
recognizing that change for Buddhists that is the Catalyst for Spiritual

149
00:15:53,820 --> 00:16:01,560
liberation for the here which leads to the complete destruction complete complete end of our

150
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,959
own psychological suffering so we have these abilities

151
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:12,120
so ability to work for to develop Faith to develop some kind of Health to

152
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:19,139
develop honesty to develop uh to to let go of unskillful developed skillful and

153
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:25,440
have this wisdom about the changing nature of our experience so that's what the Buddha this Buddha's

154
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:32,839
first answer about the distinction between people he doesn't answer to answer the question yet but he's setting the stage for it

155
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,959
um and um now uh uh then the Buddha says so there

156
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:45,720
certainly are these forecasts Nobles the brahmanas the merchants and the workers

157
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:52,680
um uh now if they possess these five factors would there be any difference among them

158
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:58,980
in in this respect so first he established these five things people can do abilities then he

159
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:06,480
says what's the difference with between them what distinctions can we make between them in these five degrees

160
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:14,579
and then he makes the analogy there are elephants and horses and oxen

161
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:20,160
that can be well tamed they have the ability to Be Tamed the capacity to Be

162
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:27,240
Tamed um and if there are two oxens two horses

163
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:33,799
and and elephants have been well tamed um

164
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,280
would they if they had the ability to Be Tamed and then are tamed would you call

165
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,440
them tamed oh yeah then we call them Tamed and what about two that have the ability

166
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,780
to Be Tamed but don't get Tamed would you call them tamed and well

167
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:58,740
disciplined no and and then he goes on to say

168
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:04,580
um uh

169
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:13,980
so it's not possible so it applies the same thing to these

170
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:20,880
these five factors these five factors are things you can develop so there are those who develop them and

171
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,840
those who don't and that's the distinction that Buddha wants to make everyone has this ability

172
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,840
but he wants to make actually a distinction here between people those who develop this capacity all the way to

173
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,900
freedom and those who don't those who develop the capacity to be honest and those who don't those who develop the

174
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:48,080
capacity to avoid doing harmful things and those who don't and then he goes on to say that well

175
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,460
if you make a fire from the name lists five different kinds of

176
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:58,860
trees because back then they rubbed sticks together to make fire so if you take you know Oakwood and rub

177
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:06,240
it together or if you take Manzanita wood or if you take fur or all these different kinds of three and you make a

178
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,600
fire is the fire difference with each time no it's the same thing the fire is the same

179
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:19,740
same thing anybody in the forecasts if they actually develop these five

180
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:25,440
capacities they make the same fire same spiritual fire the same qualities inside

181
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,380
of themselves there and if they develop those things then there's no distinctions between

182
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:36,660
them that the Buddha thinks is relevant elsewhere he goes on a different suit

183
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:45,600
does the same kind of idea appears and then he says um can uh people in any of the casts

184
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:52,799
uh kill oh yes but can they not kill oh yes equally

185
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:58,380
how about taking what's give not given if it's stealing and not stealing how about sexual misconduct and lack of it

186
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:05,760
how about lying and not lying how about intoxicating themselves and not the time they can all do that equally

187
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:12,539
he says well then there's no distinction that's relevant between them they're all equal can they can everyone develop a heart of

188
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:19,620
loving kindness that's boundless that includes everyone and the Buddha says and they say yeah

189
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:25,980
everyone can do that it doesn't matter what cast you're in well then there's no real relevant distinction between them

190
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:32,820
so the Buddha is kind of is making distinctions for me people but not recognizing any distinction that makes

191
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:37,980
one person Superior to another in terms of their cast in terms of their

192
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:43,559
race in terms of their ethnicity in terms of their gender in terms of their sexual orientation

193
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:49,140
but how they live and behave ethically in what qualities

194
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:56,340
they develop inside of them those distinctions have some value to for the Buddha but those don't distinction those

195
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:02,059
distinctions don't separate people into Superior and inferior

196
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:10,020
so that's interesting Maybe more interesting I think is the Buddha

197
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:15,120
actually just as they told gay people instructions in meditation practice

198
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:21,120
gave people instructions to living an ethical life he also gave instructions that we should

199
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,160
speak up if people are harming others

200
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:32,840
if people are killing stealing lying involving sexual misconduct sexual harm

201
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:38,340
or causing harm through their intoxication that

202
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:44,100
not only you know not only should we not do that but we should also speak up

203
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:50,820
and encourage people not to do it he never said that we should speak up to

204
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:57,659
uh to be oppositional to anyone about it but we should speak up to point out that

205
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:04,260
this doesn't work this is not healthy and the opposite is so much better

206
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:11,280
so here our Buddha does make distinctions but not about who is superior inferior

207
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:17,760
but about how people behave and the behavior of people is the real

208
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,640
emphasis the Buddha has the actions how we live our life makes a difference

209
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:30,179
and and we want to speak up so in our society we have plenty of

210
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:36,179
people who are killing killing people who literally are killing

211
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:41,580
their Spirit we have lots of situations with lots of situations where in our

212
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:47,700
society in the United States there's taking what is not given there was announcements about the

213
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:54,960
climate change stuff and the amount of taking not given in terms of our consumptions and use of resources I mean

214
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,900
the resources haven't been given freely there's often kind of a kind of they use

215
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:06,480
the word rape often for pillaging how strongly the The Taking of what's not

216
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,520
given goes on in our society and uh in our world

217
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:18,000
so it doesn't take much to see that there's a reason to speak up

218
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,340
but how do we speak up I think one of the things that uh

219
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:29,580
Buddhism emphasized don't speak up until you've looked at yourself deeply

220
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:35,760
understand what's skillful and unskillful understand what's healthy and unhealthy

221
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:41,280
in your own heart first don't act from your greed don't act it

222
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,580
from your hate don't act from delusion monitor yourself learn about yourself

223
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:52,380
about how these horses work learn to recognize how you get caught in

224
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:57,659
attachments in your social relationships and your situation in life learn how to

225
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:04,620
recognize how you get tense and reactive and judgmental learn how to recognize when you're watching a sports game

226
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:10,140
that you've got caught by what the referee has done and you're not really

227
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:16,440
you know you're really attached and I didn't recognize that so that

228
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:23,820
maybe you're not so attached and you can maybe be more I don't know if impartial is the right word but more fair and

229
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:29,340
don't have these double standards so in this training we did they

230
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:35,340
emphasized this quite a bit to the diversity and and one representative kind of study they told us about which

231
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:40,919
had a big impact on me and there's lots of these kinds of studies it's just one representative of

232
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:47,880
a whole class of studies that come to the same conclusion it's called that Thomas Meyer study

233
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:53,820
and they took a bunch of lawyers and offered them a some kind of law

234
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:59,340
brief to analyze and consider and to rate from one to five

235
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:04,380
and this brief had a lot of mistakes in it 22 mistakes

236
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:10,440
some are grammatical some are legal and but they didn't tell that to the lawyers and said just read this and then

237
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:17,280
and then judge it you know just rate it from one to five but then they as part of all this they

238
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:23,340
would say to some lawyers that this was written by a black person

239
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:29,220
and the others it was written by a white person but the exactly the same document just

240
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:34,980
different the the the racial identity of the author was said to be different

241
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:41,640
the difference was that uh for as a white author they assumed it was white

242
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:47,580
author the score would be 4.1 out of 5. when they assumed there was a black

243
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:54,779
author if the score would be that was 3.2 out of 5. what a dramatic difference

244
00:25:54,779 --> 00:26:00,960
this is called implicit bias I mean the lawyers weren't thinking about them wasn't you know they probably

245
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:07,620
weren't aware they were even doing this but there's so many ways in which we have this kind of bias that operates

246
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:13,140
that's a little bit like the sports team or a little bit like you know self and other

247
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:20,880
part of the training we did was that they emphasized over and over again is that stereotype stereotyping others

248
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,039
having bias is just part and parcel of human life it just comes with being a

249
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:34,860
human being the way they wanted to explain it was that this life we live in is so complicated

250
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:39,900
the mind is a pattern recognizing recognizing

251
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:47,520
mind that's going to jump to patterns and make conclusions about how things are without really seeing accurately if

252
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:55,860
we didn't do that to some degree we wouldn't find our way in the world but so so everyone has this

253
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:01,440
but it's possible to become more and more Mindful and aware of how this operates within us

254
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,659
and that's the training and so then with this deep diversity

255
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:12,480
folks talked about the skills that were needed to kind of live wisely in this

256
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:19,500
diverse Society it was like right out of the book for the Dharma practice I loved it

257
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:27,720
so compassion accept the existence of bias except that

258
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:35,460
it exists have a vision of the possibility of being free of being caught by bias free

259
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:40,640
of attachments and have the intention to do so

260
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,720
catch yourself in the act which means notice be mindful to notice

261
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:51,900
how it's operating and name bias and analyze it so name it

262
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:57,140
when you see it it may be your own and analyze it consider what goes on

263
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:04,860
be involved in self-learning learn about bias and not only your own

264
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:10,980
but how this works in our society the social context for it because a lot of

265
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:16,260
it is learned also some of the biases so to think to assume that you don't have

266
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:21,559
bias probably means you have more than you realize

267
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:28,260
um then it was fascinating when it's they're not quite so common in Buddhist circles this one this is like where we

268
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:35,520
have the most to learn the first one seemed fine for us Buddhists I thought but the next one is step into courageous

269
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:41,700
conversations to start on the on a whole not many of

270
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:48,419
you maybe but on the whole are tend to be conflict avoidant tend to err on the side of being polite

271
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:54,539
and you know accepting and peaceful and but the courageous conversations

272
00:28:54,539 --> 00:29:00,179
and then the last one is develop relationships if you really want to work to create a

273
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:08,159
society that is less caught by bias have relationship with people especially people who are on the other sports team

274
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:15,779
when I met my son was in Little League here I sometimes would intentionally go because the baseball games where the

275
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:22,919
bleachers were like there was like the two sides like I said the parents would sit behind this Dugout of their team so

276
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:30,299
there was parents on one side and parents said oh I would often go sit on the team for my my posing team for my

277
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:35,240
son was on it was really weird to sit there

278
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:43,020
but you know I didn't want to you know I wanted to kind of break the you know the Divide

279
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:47,778
and um so uh

280
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:55,279
so this uh exploration of this topic and to do it in a way that is maybe

281
00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:01,799
meaningful fun and not divisive is one of the reasons why we

282
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:06,840
we've now now exploring this deep diversity approach because there's a lot

283
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:12,000
of divisiveness in the world of diversity inclusion and equity

284
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,480
there's a lot of politics political stances that people take in it that are

285
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,760
not really recognized as being political stances they're just like this is true and you're wrong

286
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,980
and get on with it you know or but uh what this deep diversity does is

287
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:34,380
to remove the divisiveness and recognize everyone's involved in this

288
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:41,340
and and so let's take a deep look at it together and uh and so you know there's

289
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:49,020
limitations to that as well but this has been a wonderful thing so that we feel like welcome to step into this in a

290
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:57,000
accepting environment to really look and have these conversations and consider it and how do we go forward from here

291
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,100
and so the Deep diversity work involved four different areas

292
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:08,340
it was looking at bias itself recognizing it understanding the role

293
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:16,020
that emotions have in in the the influence they have on bias so that's a rich area to be mindful

294
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:23,580
of emotions and to understand it that also goes along really well with this practice that we do here

295
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:29,940
and then to take a good look at identity identities people have and how we relate

296
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:36,539
to Identity and the fluidity of identity and and how we react to Identity and

297
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:42,960
and the respect from it is part of all this and then a power

298
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:49,700
and they had a wonderful there's a few wonderful sayings to this but one was about power

299
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:56,820
because it's the animal leadership is the name of the organization so they're focus a lot about leadership and

300
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:04,559
Buddhism we like to consider everyone leaders so it's it's relevant for everyone to step into this kind of role

301
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:13,559
but it's uh they talked about developing leadership power uh based on caring so leadership based

302
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:19,980
on caring not on power so Authority that comes from caring not

303
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:26,640
from the invested power or social power that people are given and I love that that we come from caring

304
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,980
and caring for each other and from that comes leadership or comes working

305
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:38,000
the other thing that I really quote from that organization that I really liked was

306
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:43,380
um if you take sides

307
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:48,539
who's going to see the whole if you if you take side who's going to

308
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:54,000
see the whole and in the teachings of the Buddha I he

309
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,880
he's concerned about the whole as he said the highest order of kind of

310
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:08,279
how to care for everyone is to care for the welfare and happiness of both self and others and for our whole community

311
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:14,399
he was very explicit about this and not to be only care about certain

312
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:22,260
people and not other people and this gets particularly difficult when there's uh hurt harm being done

313
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:27,480
and I was on the I was the chair of a Ethics Committee for many years for 15

314
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:34,380
years I think 17 years a long time and had to kind of uh mediate conflicts

315
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:40,740
that people had and um and the approach that I took which I carefully tried to explain to

316
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:47,159
everyone in Conflict was that I was concerned what was the best for everyone involved

317
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:54,240
and sometimes people are a little shocked by that because what about the perpetrator I mean like yes I'm really concerned about the best

318
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,480
for you what's best for you at the same time what's best for the other person let's look for that let's find that

319
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,059
together and eventually everyone seemed to appreciate that there was value in that

320
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:12,839
but it really it took a lot of work to figure out how that satisfied everybody's needs

321
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:20,158
but it was it was an approach that wasn't trying to set up keep things adversarial but everyone needs to benefit everyone needs

322
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:26,040
to grow so um who looks at the hole who looks that

323
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:33,839
cares for everybody involved in a situation and so this uh animos anima

324
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:39,780
um organization now there's deep diversity seems to do that I seems to have that

325
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:45,118
approach in a very nice way some people are not going to like it

326
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:52,440
because it's um it's not political enough and there's these uh systemic issues in

327
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:58,260
our society that appear to be more political than personal and they acknowledge that very clearly

328
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:04,320
in the organization but um still there's a I think there's a

329
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,980
their approach to addressing it is something that seems Akin or to what we like here the leadership here at IMC at

330
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:16,260
least likes so um so we finished this it was a four day

331
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:21,480
training we did it was really really cool to go through it and and uh

332
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,880
and have these issues raised and to look at it in an intentional way

333
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,700
and so we're hoping as the months next over the next year to introduce this

334
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:39,060
more to the community I don't think we're going to do this like I'm doing today a captive audience who has to sit

335
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:46,079
here and listen to me talk about it but hopefully it wasn't too bad today I was because I'm kind of inspired by it

336
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:53,160
but there will be opportunities to um to sign up for different programs different kind of simple things we're doing to

337
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:59,099
offer offer this training and exploration in our community and the leadership some of the some of the

338
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:04,980
teachers and some of the teacher trainees and other leaders board members and different people are excited by this

339
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:10,740
and are investing their time and efforts to be able to bring this into our

340
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:17,339
community so so some of you will have the option if you you have the all of you have the option

341
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:24,240
to be part of this if you'd like one of the odd things about IMC is that

342
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:31,440
we are a very poorly defined community that's about the strength and a weakness

343
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:38,640
and I like the strength part of it it means that it's open to anyone who comes and if you want to be if you want

344
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:44,460
to be a member of IMC just by wanting it you are and if you're a kind of person doesn't

345
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:50,838
like membership in organizations or we don't have membership that's fine you can come anyway

346
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:57,180
so you know it's kind of like very hopefully fluid you know so so you know

347
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:03,960
participate as it works for you and what's nice for you but we'll be doing this

348
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:09,300
and some of you if you find this interesting what I've said today you might think about looking at reading the

349
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:14,520
book The Deep diversity it's been a very wonderful book for us and and it's a one

350
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:20,820
of the values of choosing it is that it gives us as a community an opportunity to have shared vocabulary shared

351
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:27,540
Concepts to find their way with and to have that shared is really helpful because if if it just makes things

352
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:34,460
easier to have conversations and to understand so

353
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:39,900
there's tea today so everyone's welcome to stay and set up out there and many of

354
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:45,300
us go outside in the parking lot afterwards and it's what I like to do when there's tea day is if you don't

355
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:52,859
mind staying an extra couple of minutes just shortly and introduce yourself to the a couple of people next to you with

356
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:59,280
some sense that if sometimes when someone's left there alone everyone turns you up the other direction look around and make sure everyone's included

357
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,500
because inclusion is important then and say hello and even if it's your first

358
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:11,820
time here at IMC um a year now someone who can welcome that person you're with welcome welcome

359
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:18,000
each other here and say hello and if there's something invaluable or an interesting or problem that are

360
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,480
interesting that came out of this talk I gave you want to share with your friend that'd be fine but it's enough to say

361
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,980
hello introduce yourself and I look forward to seeing you at the T thank you
