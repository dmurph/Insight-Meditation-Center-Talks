1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,640
so

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,480
before i begin this talk

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,679
i want to mention that

4
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,720
the way i calculate and uh

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,199
next monday it'll be one year

6
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,840
anniversary of having done these

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,880
early morning in california these uh

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,800
daily sittings weekday sittings

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,000
meditations and teachings

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,920
kind of remarkable that it's lasted a

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,440
year and

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,160
and remarkable

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,920
for how for many of us how wonderful

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,079
it's been to do this

15
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,960
so i thought that next monday we could

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,280
do

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,559
a community meeting to

18
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,559
acknowledge celebrate this one-year mark

19
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,960
and we haven't done it for a long time

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,840
and

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,600
my own personal life has meant that i

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,199
can't it's been hard to do

23
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,240
add more things like that but i can do

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,600
it next monday

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,760
and so we can um

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,680
so it'll be there'll be a zoom meeting

27
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,880
so after

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,640
uh we finish here at about 7 45

29
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,520
you'll be given access to a zoom link

30
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,360
and then we'll switch over to the zoom

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,000
and

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,600
and be able to meet and hang out and

33

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,479

40
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,439
and then we can also talk a little bit

41
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,759
about some of the maybe some of the

42
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,600
questions and issues around our little

43
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,240
community and this meetings and

44
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,479
the continuation of it and all that

45
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,640
planning to continue

46
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,240
and so

47
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,799
so next monday the 15th

48
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,000
so um

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,879
of the foundational cornerstone

50
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:11,920
teachings

51
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,360
of the buddha is that intimately

52
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,840
connects to both meditation and living a

53
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,599
daily life

54
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,160
is the idea of wholesome and unwholesome

55
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,239
sometimes it's translated skillful and

56
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,239
unskillful

57
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,480
more informally i like to translate it

58
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,040
as helpful and unhelpful

59
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,080
that that there is a uh

60
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,519
way of of uh and it has to do with the

61
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,680
actions what we do

62
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,599
that we and some of those actions don't

63
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,959
really maybe in english we don't think

64
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,480
of them as in actions but

65
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,200
more like states wholesome states but

66
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,680
they still have a kind of a little bit

67
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,120
they're an activity of the mind in the

68
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,200
background somehow

69
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,800
and so um these are these are

70
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,879
states of mind actions of the mind

71
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,480
activities of the mind

72
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,440
ways of being that feel like as if

73
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,040
they're nourishing

74
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,840
and that word nourishing is a is a word

75
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,280
that the buddha used that's

76
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,120
different things different mental states

77
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,640
and mental activities

78
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,879
operated as food as nourishment for

79
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,480
ourselves

80
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,159
so it isn't just simply generosity's

81
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,200
generosity generosity is a wholesome

82
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,640
state healthy state

83
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,640
that is nourishing that has a good

84
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,640
influence on us

85
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,840
so uh loving-kindness is that

86
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,920
mindfulness is considered a wholesome

87
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,319
state that is nourishing

88
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,200
and and has a good influence on us

89
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,599
tranquility is a wholesome state

90
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,640
wholesome way of being that is as a

91
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,360
nourishing it nourishes us nourishes

92
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,280
more tranquility

93
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,400
and and so this idea of

94
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,439
both of nourishment wholesomeness

95
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,799
comes into play now in the third tetrat

96
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,599
of the sixteen steps of anapanasati

97
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,879
in a number of ways the

98
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,000
tenth step is gladdening the mind

99
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,760
and this gliding the mind some people's

100
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,480
translated as satisfying the mind or

101
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,040
or enjoying the mind

102
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,160
and this comes with the ability to feel

103
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,120
the goodness

104
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,840
the delight the enjoyment not just of

105
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,800
pleasure

106
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,240
but of this nourishment this

107
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,400
wholesomeness that can happen

108
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,199
and this comes with as we no longer

109
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,720
fixate or focus

110
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,880
on the details of our inner life

111
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,919
but begin looking at the big picture and

112
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:42,720
that's what uh

113
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,000
being experiencing the mind as a whole

114
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,919
we're not preoccupied with the past

115
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,479
preoccupied by the future our desires

116
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,400
are focusing on particular emotions that

117
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,479
we have that are really troublesome for

118
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,360
us

119
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,080
all reasonable things to do at times but

120
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,479
to

121
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,600
um but as we go deeper and deeper into

122
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,639
meditation

123
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,199
we're relaxing and letting go and not

124
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,039
fixating on things

125
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,360
that there's a softening and a deepening

126
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,560
and an opening

127
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,800
that begins happening that we've become

128
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,919
aware of the

129
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,400
the general the quality of our inner

130
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,759
life

131
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,000
and another way i'd like to translate

132
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,240
chitta the mind or the heart

133
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,880
the whole the holistic a whole quality

134
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,479
of the inner life

135
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,960
and as we let go a lot and going through

136
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,880
these deeper states of meditation

137
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,280
we tap into um

138
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,160
we tap into a sense of wholesomeness a

139
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,280
goodness

140
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,680
and some nourishing nourishment

141
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,680
something it feels very satisfying just

142
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,120
to be here

143
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,240
and now this becomes a valuable

144
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,919
thing to experience this becomes

145
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,000
something to imbibe

146
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,120
to feel to allow itself to be influenced

147
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,400
by

148
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,400
and so and so to understand that the

149
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,960
buddhist teachings is based on this

150
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,520
movement towards the wholesome and to

151
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,880
the degree to which we do

152
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,880
what's wholesome do wholesome things in

153
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,080
our life

154
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,639
skillful things do things which are

155
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,840
ethically wholesome

156
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,560
that is psychologically wholesome that

157
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,360
leads to

158
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,240
a sense of being whole rather than being

159
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,520
fragmented

160
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,720
a sense of being inclusive rather than

161
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,560
holding things at bay and holding things

162
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,720
in check

163
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,520
this becomes very important as we start

164
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,960
moving into

165
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,080
developing samadhi or unification the

166
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,919
eleventh step of anupanasati

167
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,199
breathing in one unifies the mind

168
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,840
breathing out one unifies the mind

169
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,280
another translator

170
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,600
breathing in one steadys the mind

171
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,919
breathing out one steadies the mind

172
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,720
another translator breathing in one

173
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,319
concentrates the mind

174
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,880
breathing out one concentrates the mind

175
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,919
so these words

176
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,280
unify steady concentrate are all

177
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,400
in the domain of this

178
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,680
fourth this third tetrad one experiences

179
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,960
the mind

180
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,840
one gladdens or satisfies the mind and

181
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,160
then

182
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,240
one concentrates unifies the mind

183
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,520
and this sequence points to the fact

184
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,160
that

185
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,039
it's a lot easier for the mind to get

186
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,360
unified to gather together to get

187
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,120
organized to get settled to be steady

188
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,599
when there's a feeling of when the mind

189
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,440
feels like a satisfying place an

190
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,440
enjoyable place to be

191
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,560
the heart is wholesome and good

192
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,960
and so we're not recoiling from inner

193
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,639
pain or struggle or

194
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,400
angst we're not afraid of ourselves and

195
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,960
in trying to avoid parts of ourselves

196
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,879
we've come to the place where we're now

197
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,479
inclusive the mind we associate more

198
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,520
with the inclusivity of the big mind

199
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,400
rather than the particular details we

200
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,319
might still have particular details that

201
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,000
are difficult for sure

202
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,319
but it's not where we're locked into or

203
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,319
what we're preoccupied with

204
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,120
we respect it but where now the mind

205
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,400
holds it all

206
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,360
in a more expansive open way and then

207
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,919
expansive open mind

208
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,199
that is is where we begin feeling uh

209
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,360
something allows for something wholesome

210
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,160
and satisfying and deep to happen

211
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,039
and so rather than huffing and puffing

212
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,720
to get concentrated

213
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,080
it's more like da this is good

214
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,120
the mind wants to settle the mind wants

215
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,320
to

216
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,518
go into uh

217
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,399
into uh you know be more more subtle

218
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,000
doesn't want to be scattered

219
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,399
in fact to be scattered to go into the

220
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,160
past and the future to be caught up in

221
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,200
thoughts

222
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,560
to become narrow again or

223
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,640
locked into something again it just

224
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,560
starts feeling not doesn't really feel

225
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,160
interesting it's not like

226
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,480
it's like why would you and there's not

227
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,560
much juice much energy to

228
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,760
to be distracted because it feels so

229
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,080
good

230
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,000
to be here right here so maybe my way

231
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,839
i'm talking is kind of grand and

232
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,000
grandiose a little bit seems like a

233
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
little bit beyond what's possible for

234
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,040
you

235
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,399
but what i want to emphasize is

236
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,480
that we are kind of moving in the

237
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,519
direction

238
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,200
of an inner goodness and inner

239
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,640
wholesomeness and inner

240
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,640
some kind of way that inner life feels

241
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,080
satisfying

242
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,680
and i like to use the word we feel at

243
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,120
home in ourselves

244
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,040
oh i'm home it's so good to be here of

245
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,760
course i want to be here

246
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,320
and it's with this mind this way of

247
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,200
being

248
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,880
that when we connect to our breathing

249
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,959
that we do it in a way that feels

250
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,240
satisfying tender

251
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,040
caring we appreciate the opportunity to

252
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,560
start again

253
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,320
rather than being a burden and rather

254
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,480
being dejected or dismayed that we

255
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,920
wandered off and thought

256
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,920
we feel ah yes i come home this is good

257
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,680
and then when we sustain the attention

258
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,360
it's not because we're struggling to do

259
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,920
it or holding things at bay

260
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,279
it's because we are ah this is good i'm

261
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,160
home and

262
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,000
this feels nice to be here in the

263
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,760
present moment

264
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,200
so the um it's called the initial

265
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,120
application of attention

266
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,839
this connecting and the sustained

267
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,360
application of attention is

268
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,399
sustaining attention ideally it's all

269
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:30,800
you

270
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,600
all kind of nourishing and maybe each of

271
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,160
you can

272
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,279
have a different um

273
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,839
reference point or example that supports

274
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,360
you for this

275
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,440
i used in the meditation idea of doing

276
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,480
tai chi

277
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,200
tai chi of the mind coming back to your

278
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,320
breathing

279
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,240
hanging in there with the breathing

280
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,640
those gentle

281
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,120
flowing movements of tai chi where the

282
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,880
point isn't to get to the end of the tai

283
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,959
chi movements as quickly as you can

284
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,720
the point is there's an action we're

285
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,079
doing tai chi

286
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,959
but we're each moment we're just is

287
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,880
complete in itself is we're really into

288
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,800
that part of the movement

289
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,959
for some of you might be gardening maybe

290
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,240
you love gardening and just

291
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,640
being and weeding and planting just

292
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,079
doing it

293
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,920
there's not you're not in a hurry to do

294
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,279
it it's just tender it's nourishing it's

295
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,399
maybe it's kind of a parental feeling of

296
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,839
your plan so just kind of tending and

297
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,320
caring maybe it's a craft maybe it's

298
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,760
caring for

299
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,320
someone who's sick that you do do it in

300
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,760
a loving way

301
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,000
so you might think about what example

302
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,800
you have

303
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,360
in your life of doing something which

304
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,079
has qualities of

305
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,279
wholesomeness nourishment

306
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,560
satisfaction inner goodness

307
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,800
that is the that represents for you the

308
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,399
movement we're going

309
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,959
the downhill slope the pull of gravity

310
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,160
of meditation

311
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,480
this is where we go going and

312
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,839
and with that we cultivate unification

313
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,760
we cultivate a steadiness a deep

314
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,279
subtleness

315
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,720
and what some people call concentration

316
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,639
so enjoy yourself

317
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,760
enjoy your mind and or provide your mind

318
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,800
with a way of being that

319
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,519
the mind enjoys let your inner actions

320
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,440
inner attitudes thoughts and feelings

321
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,320
be something the mind really appreciates

322
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,000
that the mind feels ah

323
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,440
this is good the mind says oh i like

324
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,720
being with this person

325
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,959
i like being here i don't feel like i

326
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,120
need to run off anymore

327
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,279
because the way this is operating for

328
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,079
this person this is really good

329
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,720
and maybe your mind will stick around

330
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,360
and

331
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,279
stick around for your breathing and for

332
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,880
your meditation in the present moment

333
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,440
so thank you all very much and i look

334
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,839
