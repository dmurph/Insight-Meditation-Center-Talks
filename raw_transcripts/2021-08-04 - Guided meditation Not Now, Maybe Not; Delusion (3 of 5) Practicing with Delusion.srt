00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:15,519
hello everyone and i spread my warm wishes best wishes

2
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:22,800
to all of you in all directions from here and all around the globe so thank you for

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,519
being part of this

4
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,840
so um

5
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,079
the topic of this week is delusion and i think it's

6
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:47,360
helpful to uh keep in mind or consider at least

7
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,000
that delusion uh the way it operates in a conscious way is

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,079
through thoughts through the thinking mind we have ideas delusion has

9
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:06,080
to do with ideas of what's there whether it's verbal ideas or we see

10
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,479
we have imagery or of things some people think more in images than in

11
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,840
thought than in words and um and so the

12
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,920
um uh one of the you know

13
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:30,640
we'll talk more later about how to practice with delusion but for now i'd like to keep it very simple

14
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:37,200
because simplicity is the is what highlight can help us see

15
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,040
delusion uh when the mind is complicated with lots of thoughts and ideas it's

16
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:50,079
much harder to see it's kind of like a piece of cloth which is filled with stains it's

17
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,280
hard to see one more stain but if the cloth is stained free then a

18
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,960
single stain stands out so a simple mind sees more clearly

19
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,840
what's going on because we can see when it you know when things arise when things

20
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,000
appear and so in that delusion has its uh

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,800
you know connection with thinking i want to offer a very simple practice

22
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,360
around thinking today and that is that as you meditate if

23
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,200
if or when you have thoughts you find you notice

24
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,519
yourself thinking this is an important part of mindfulness to notice we're thinking and

25
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:43,920
sometimes we use mental note thinking thinking or we just clearly are aware of thinking

26
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,800
and then return to the breathing but today when you notice yourself thinking

27
00:02:50,800 --> 00:03:01,440
gently perhaps lovingly say two words and those two words are

28
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:08,400
not now just gently not now now is not the time to be involved in

29
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:16,840
these thinking now is the time for a quieter calmer uh awareness that is not

30
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,519
thought-based so maybe it's a sensation based or sensing based or

31
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:31,360
or observing based just kind of perceiving more directly not through the medium

32
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:38,080
of discursive thought not through the medium of conversational thought or analytical

33
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,840
thought or story thought and so when this more

34
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,080
active thinking of discursive thoughts and train of thinking begins

35
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:58,400
just tell yourself not now not now and then about halfway through

36
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:06,080
i'll offer two other words we'll switch to something else but uh but just not now

37
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,920
and if you have long long periods of time when you're not really involved in thinking then you don't have to say those words

38
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,160
but when you find yourself oh now i've been thinking i'm swept i'm pulled into that world not now

39
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:25,280
and kind of like step back step away um and then return to your breathing and

40
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,040
stay with the physical sensations of the body breathing and when the next thinking comes up not

41
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,160
now and if you have to say not now you know every two seconds

42
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:43,199
you know because thoughts just come keep coming do so gently lovingly so that not now

43
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,520
is a bomb for the mind and heart of the medicine so that the not now

44
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:56,720
is a calming reassuring offering some degree of

45
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,240
ease of peace of of uh equanimity to what's there so you're not

46
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,240
fighting your thoughts or just not now and that repetition of not now that really that

47
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,639
different relationship to thinking than you normally would have maybe we get pulled into it or you believe it or

48
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,880
react to it maybe something will begin to shift

49
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,840
so taking a upright

50
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,759
posture metaphorically or literally

51
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:53,840
and gently close your eyes

52
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:08,240
and taking a few long slow deep breaths and as you exhale

53
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,000
imagine that you're letting your concerns and your thoughts drift away

54
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:21,840
as you exhale those drift away and you settle in to your body

55
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:49,840
breathing in breathing out

56
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,919
and then breathing letting your breath return to normal

57
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:02,960
and for a next four or five exhales continue to relax

58
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:10,400
open your body wherever it's possible to soften and

59
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,840
relax

60
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,840
and then settling into your breathing

61
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,680
settling into the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

62
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,479
settling into the body's experience of breathing so you don't have to be up in the

63
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:22,160
control tower watching or controlling

64
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,759
it's almost like awareness is centered in the body

65
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:41,839
in the body's experience of breathing

66
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,399
and then in a way that seems peaceful

67
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:06,839
or peacemaking even tell yourself the words not

68
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,080
now see if you can say those words in your

69
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,560
mind quietly quiet calm inner voice

70
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,839
not now

71
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:34,800
and when you begin thinking gently say those words

72
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,360
there's no not now means this is not a time for those thoughts

73
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:51,839
they can they can be picked up later not now

74
00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:00,720
without ambition or forcefulness without even expecting

75
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,760
thinking to stop and if thinking continues just gently

76
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:14,880
say it again and again allowing there to be an openness

77
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:21,920
a peacefulness in the moment after saying it

78
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,360
a moment of open awareness

79
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:38,000
and when there's no more thinking where the thinking is not compelling

80
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:47,839
return to your breathing

81
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,920
you

82
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,839
me

83
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,919
you

84
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,280
and then

85
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,520
to offer you two other words that you can say instead of not now

86
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:20,000
you can say the words maybe not

87
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,720
these words can still carry the meaning of not now maybe they can be short for

88
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,440
maybe maybe not now

89
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,960
but also they can be maybe it isn't so maybe it's not true

90
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:46,880
maybe not so as you find yourself thinking

91
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:53,919
peacefully say the words maybe not maybe it isn't so

92
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:04,640
then allow yourself to become free of whatever those thoughts

93
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,799
are

94
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:17,840
and begin again with your breathing

95
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,840
me

96
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,840
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

97
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:32,720
take a moment to let go and do nothing

98
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,240
including not even thinking

99
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:45,940
nothing you have to do or be or [Music]

100
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:54,159
become just a few moments here of letting yourself rest as deeply as

101
00:27:54,159 --> 00:28:03,840
your psychophysical system can rest at this moment

102
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:16,399
or maybe just putting to rest the effort to do or to meditate or to be

103
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:31,840
or to figure anything out

104
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:45,679
and then to bring your attention to the part of your body

105
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:52,880
where your good will lives where love or

106
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,159
care compassion

107
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,480
kindness is born

108
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:10,080
the part of your body that resonates with it or vibrates or

109
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:27,120
opens in the presence of loving kindness

110
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:35,200
and putting aside any thoughts that interfere with your basic simple

111
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:42,398
good will including the thought that it's not here now

112
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:57,039
and turning your to the your gaze to the world around you

113
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:06,240
to the people in your lives in your communities across your lands

114
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,840
around the globe

115
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:23,840
and wishing them well what a wonderful world it would be if

116
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:30,640
people were happy and peaceful if they weren't motivated by their anger

117
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:36,960
hostility greed fear

118
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,360
what a wonderful world would be for all of us if

119
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:51,360
the heart was motivated by its happiness

120
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,880
and so to wish welfare and happiness for all beings

121
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:06,480
may all beings be safe may all beings be peaceful

122
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:13,760
and free and may all beings be

123
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:20,159
free of the delusions that give birth to

124
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,960
fear and greed and hatred

125
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:40,000
may all beings be free of the delusions that keep them locked into their

126
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:51,440
limited view of other beings

127
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:58,559
free of delusions may we all care for each other in this world

128
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:15,840
may all beings be happy

129
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:15,919
uh so the topic of today the third talk on

130
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:24,720
delusion is practicing with delusion and um it can be hard because

131
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:31,679
sometimes part of the nature of delusion is to not know that we're deluded to not know we the

132
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:39,600
delusion kind of camouflages itself as truth or as this is the way things are or and so

133
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,120
it can be hard to notice delusion but it's possible to see delusion for it

134
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,159
for it's what it is it's possible to become free of delusion and

135
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,440
it's a really worthwhile goal because so much of the suffering of the

136
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:02,159
world has some quality of suffering and that and harming how we cause harm in the world

137
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,840
has uh some connection to delusion

138
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:14,240
so [Music]

139
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:21,280
so first it's helpful to have some wisdom

140
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,358
that uh is an antidote to delusion and there's many pieces of wisdom that

141
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:32,480
are useful and um one of them is

142
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:40,000
there's a i learned this as a sufi story uh the man came to a sufi master with a

143
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,118
ring and said can you inscribe in this ring uh some piece of wisdom that's always

144
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,158
useful for me and um and so

145
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:57,520
a week later the men came back to get the inscribed ring and it said this too will pass

146
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:03,839
and so that simple expression this two will pass uh can somehow cut through a certain

147
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:10,079
delusion of permanence or or expectation that it should be always this way or it will be this way and

148
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:18,079
it can free up uh one of my favorite little stories about the bringing wisdom is i heard the story is

149
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:26,079
coming from china and the way that approximately the story is told it can be many little variations

150
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:32,880
is there was a farmer who was quite old and frail and can barely eke out in

151
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:40,800
existence on his farm but he had us a son a strong young man who could certainly help a lot

152
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:46,160
they were still very poor but their young son can do a lot of the work

153
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:52,480
and uh and they had an old donkey that a weak donkey that somehow was their

154
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,480
main way of plowing and taking care of the farm also and one day the donkey died and the

155
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:04,640
neighbor said oh this is terrible i'm so sorry you know this is a terrible thing

156
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:12,000
and uh you're so poor and the old farmer says um we shall see and

157
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,480
then one day the sun goes up into the mountains to collect firewood and he finds a kind of a wild horse up there that's

158
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:24,880
strong and stallion and and is able to bring it back and the neighbors say oh you're so lucky

159
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:31,040
and the old man says we shall see and as the son is training the horse he

160
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:36,720
falls off the horse and breaks his leg and the neighbors say oh no you're so unlucky

161
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:43,520
and the farmer says we shall see and and then the local king recruits all

162
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,560
the young men to go fight a hopeless war against a neighboring country

163
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:55,680
and but because the son broke his leg he's not recruited and the neighbors say

164
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:02,560
oh you're so lucky that your son's not going off to war and the farmer of course says

165
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:08,160
we shall see and so there's a wisdom to we shall see not to be caught in the

166
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:15,520
conclusions we can make and and think that this is the way it is so bringing some wisdom and there's many

167
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:21,440
kinds of wisdom we can bring but wisdom and understanding like that only goes so deep it's a nice

168
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:30,079
medicine it's a nice counter force to our tendency to delusion but vipassana practice involves a deeper

169
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:36,400
look at it and i think of vipassana practice in relationship to

170
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,720
delusion is a little bit of a practice for people who are well established in their mindfulness

171
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,960
because and so just developing mindfulness is an antidote to

172
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:55,040
delusion because as we develop the capacity to recognize moment by moment what's

173
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:02,320
happening so we can recognize oh this is an emotion i'm feeling sad or happy or angry or

174
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:07,920
peaceful uh there's there's a freeing moment in that clear recognition

175
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:15,200
and uh and we're not entangled so much and so all the different beliefs and ideas we have that entangle us

176
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:21,359
are kind of put down and that's a little protection from the deluse delusive ways in which we're

177
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:27,599
involved in our emotions and feelings same thing with the thoughts as we learn to recognize we're thinking

178
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:33,200
just a simple label thinking thinking or remembering or planning

179
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:39,440
uh that also that clear recognition begins uh freeing us from the automatic way in

180
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:47,280
which associations beliefs expectations prejudice bias come you know are are

181
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:53,440
are involved in how we relate to our thoughts the quick ways that we believe it or we're horrified by them or

182
00:38:53,440 --> 00:39:00,000
whatever it might be in the the compelling way we feel like we have to think we you know it's necessary to think

183
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,599
and just thinking oh thinking thinking it's such a peaceful thing to do but it can be so freeing

184
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:11,520
as we begin finding this freedom and simplicity and strength and mindfulness

185
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:17,839
then it comes a time when uh we're able to better and better notice

186
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:23,200
the arising the the beginning of a particular idea

187
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:29,760
and because we can see it arise we're not kind of just lost in the sea of thoughts we're not just kind of

188
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:36,800
being swept along in the great currents of many thoughts but we see the birth of a thought that is a

189
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:42,640
fantastic place where we could um question it where we say is that so

190
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:48,880
maybe not or let's see or um we can see you know oh that is a

191
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:54,640
thought it's just a thought it's not necessarily

192
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,160
true it's not necessarily a reality and so for example if you see a person a

193
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:08,000
stranger and and somehow that stranger reminds you of this really strict elementary school

194
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,359
teacher you had who you were really afraid of and the person looks like the teacher

195
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:21,839
and so the thought comes up the feeling the emotion comes up and thought comes up that um oh this is a dangerous person

196
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:27,760
if we're not if we're kind of just going along and not noticing where these thoughts come from and they just suddenly are there

197
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:35,040
it's easy for the mind to somehow just assume this is true and take it as being a true idea of

198
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:40,400
what's out there the person is dangerous but if we can notice oh there's a

199
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:46,640
oh that person is dangerous that thought arises and we see it just as a thought then

200
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:54,000
it's a powerful moment to both question the thought is it true but also to take a second look

201
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,520
to look again what is really there in front of me who is this person i don't know who this person is

202
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:05,839
it looks like my my elementary school teacher let me take a good look and in fact the

203
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:12,319
person you know that i look carefully at the person um the person seems quite friendly

204
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:18,720
and um and so but it being able to see the rising of it we can question we can see

205
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:24,880
we can not assign so much authority to every thought and we're more likely to question in a

206
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:31,920
healthy way what's there as we begin looking at these thoughts

207
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,200
that arise we begin recognizing some of them are regular patterns

208
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,800
of uh of the same kind of thinking and the when when people practice

209
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:48,079
mindfulness a lot they start seeing patterns of thoughts like their their pattern

210
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:54,640
is that they always think the worst is going to happen or they always think that people don't

211
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:01,760
like them or they always think that um they all you know that they should get

212
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:07,920
what they want it's about all kinds of ideas like that and um when we start seeing patterns

213
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:13,119
then if we start realizing wait a minute this is just a belief i carry

214
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:19,119
and to always apply this belief onto all situations it is a kind of delusion it's a it's an

215
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:24,480
imposition of ideas on something which is not necessarily appropriate

216
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:30,319
those ideas and so then we can start looking at the pattern say oh there's that's it has

217
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:36,240
a quality of delusion to always be seeing through that filter

218
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:42,560
and then we can use our mindfulness to look deeper and see what's underneath that what is

219
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:48,640
the emotion that's driving that is there loneliness is there insecurity is there fear

220
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:55,920
is there some kind of delusion of grandeur or wanting to kind of create a sense of self that is a little bit of

221
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:03,520
a fantasy and it can be some desires we have some thoughts we have uh come from a fantastical way in which

222
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,720
we want to kind of create an idea of who we are that is all good or

223
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:15,200
we create ideas about ourselves that are critical of ourselves and so once we start seeing the patterns

224
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:20,720
of thinking and delusion we have we can start dropping down deeper into the emotional level and

225
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:27,359
the places we that are the sources within for why or how we think this way not by

226
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:33,520
analyzing it but we feel our way in so practicing mindfulness of thinking

227
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:41,440
in a deeper and deeper way connects us to the sources underneath where delusion is born and

228
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:47,119
and this also then gives more freedom and a chance for something to resolve itself

229
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:52,800
or release in a deeper and deeper way most illusions that we have have their

230
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:59,520
genesis and some clinging something we're attached to and uh delusions without attachment

231
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:05,680
generally are not as dangerous as delusions that were very attached to them

232
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:13,760
so there's a lot of words about how to practice with delusion but the simplest way is uh

233
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:21,280
is to learn how to be mindful in the present moment and to be able to track this the flow of

234
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:28,000
present moment experiences we're having so that in that flow of present moment experiences

235
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:34,720
we see well there's the arising of a feeling sensation now there's a thought

236
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:40,000
and to have a settled mind that can watch this arising of thinking

237
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:48,000
and then bring some wisdom to it and maybe one of them is maybe not

238
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:54,240
maybe it's not this way or we shall see we shall see let's wait let's not come

239
00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:00,240
to some conclusion and so to learn how to have thoughts arise

240
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:06,720
and not take them as being conclusive is a powerful way of popping the bubble of delusion

241
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:12,400
because the danger of delusion is often at the authority we give them

242
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:18,000
and if we don't give them authority it's easier to kind of see them for what they are

243
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:26,079
so uh practice mindfulness it's such a great thing and and if you feel like practicing

244
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:31,359
mindfulness is too much work it's really it's not in

245
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:38,000
essence not really work it's rather um trusting that we can rest and

246
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:46,000
be present for the the deep capacity we have to be open present and aware of what

247
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,720
is happening in the present without just open and present awareness and we

248
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:58,319
discover over time that this is the place of non-work in a sense

249
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:05,440
that everything else is just a lot of work a lot of agitation and stress in the mind

250
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:10,480
so enjoy your mindfulness develop it

251
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:17,760
and let it become an intimate part of who you are thank you
