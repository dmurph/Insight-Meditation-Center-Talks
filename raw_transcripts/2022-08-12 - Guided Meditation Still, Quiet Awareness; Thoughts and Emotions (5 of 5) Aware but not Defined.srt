00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,460
hello everyone hello from IMC in Redwood City

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,620
happy to think of

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:22,140
these greetings going out in so many different directions around the world and

4
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:28,859
and um and to have your attention from so many

5
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:34,940
different places all the way around so thank you for being part of this

6
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,760
and I sit here in this large room at IMC

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:50,239
that's kind of peaceful calm still I hear some traffic outside

8
00:00:52,260 --> 00:01:00,079
and so regardless of how I think about you around the world

9
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:06,840
and regardless of how I think about or aware of the drama of the world

10
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,939
the challenges and storms of the world

11
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:19,100
I know it from this place here in this room that's calm and peaceful and quiet

12
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,860
so if you take a light

13
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:35,040
a lamp bulb put it inside a box small box and turn

14
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,939
the light on the light shines and the light bulb shines just as it does

15
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:48,560
if you expand the walls of the Box make it a bigger box

16
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:55,320
it doesn't affect the light the light is just peacefully just shining

17
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,740
if you expand it bigger and bigger and make it as big as this room here

18
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,860
the light just shines the light shines quietly without

19
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:14,940
defining Itself by how far it lights goes doesn't Define Itself by

20
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:20,040
what the light lands on there could be a lot of drama

21
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:27,060
in the room or there could be a lot of Stillness the light just shines

22
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,760
and so the light of our awareness the light of attention

23
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:40,140
it's possible that it can just shine on everything without defining Itself by what it's

24
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:46,140
shining on and that place of awareness then can

25
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:53,760
become the large quiet peaceful room for us or to say it differently

26
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:01,620
the um it can be a

27
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:08,180
still like a Stillness or the calm in the middle of the storm

28
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:15,300
and the storms around could be the storms that existed our

29
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:21,739
thinking it could be the storms of our emotions

30
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,620
it could be the storms the agitation energies of our body

31
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:36,299
and it's possible to know it with a light that's turned on that is

32
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:44,420
not defined by any of it it knows it but is not defined by it

33
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:54,720
and to so as we meditate that's one of the

34
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,939
possibilities here is to discover a still quiet place

35
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:08,400
that may be as small maybe is as big as a large room or as big as the universe

36
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:16,139
that's kind of like the calm in the middle of the storm where we turn on our light

37
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:22,100
and we sit here aware of what is

38
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:29,400
and it's a very different way of relating to thinking very different relating to emotions than usual if we do

39
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,740
we Define ourselves by it or get involved with it participate in it

40
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:42,240
think more about them react to them but the still quiet place

41
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,780
letting all things be but not defined by them so in this meditation

42
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:54,660
perhaps that can be your little mantra uh

43
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:01,620
not defined so whatever you're aware of whatever is happening for you that you can know

44
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:08,639
you can add or imagine you're adding no def no definition

45
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:16,759
not defining Yourself by it so sitting upright

46
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:25,280
in the meditation posture and gently closing your eyes

47
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,860
and without much to do more to do sit quietly

48
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,960
and be aware of what your experience is like

49
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:47,240
before relaxing or breathing deeply just be aware

50
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:57,020
be aware from the inside out your body

51
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:08,660
be aware the emotions

52
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,120
be aware of your thinking

53
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,419
and be aware

54
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,440
that the awareness of it all

55
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:42,860
is like the light that's turned on

56
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:50,000
that does not need to be defined by what it knows

57
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:58,919
and what it knows will change and shift but maybe the knowing

58
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:04,759
can be a calm peaceful place to come in the storm

59
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:14,419
so if it's possible for you see if you can

60
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:25,860
see if you can um drop inside

61
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:32,699
as deep as a place you know where there might be some

62
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:36,479
quiet Stillness

63
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,979
and allow breathing experience or breathing

64
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:05,360
to make itself known to that still quiet place of awareness

65
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:13,259
awareness doesn't go out but experiences comes to it comes to

66
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:19,879
awareness comes into that quiet place

67
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:14,839
being aware mindful knowing what's happening

68
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:24,199
like turning on the light so there's brightness and clarity about what is

69
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:29,480
but not defined by what is

70
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:36,139
an awareness which is not defined by the body

71
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:42,199
and knowing not defined by your emotions

72
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:48,079
and knowing not defined by what you think

73
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:56,300
and knowing which doesn't Define itself either

74
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,079
it just is

75
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,579
thank you

76
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:42,980
and that's still quiet place in the middle of the storm

77
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:51,860
denies nothing doesn't even have to let go of anything

78
00:20:53,520 --> 00:21:01,100
place whether it's quiet awareness where we turn on the light of attention

79
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,120
to see clearly

80
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:16,260
and it's a world of difference to know

81
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,720
from a peaceful place inside

82
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:29,720
or to know while negotiating and

83
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:39,320
entangled participating in what is known

84
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:39,900
and then to again find a place within that's a still

85
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:46,740
quiet space may be associated with knowing

86
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:54,179
maybe a place that's deep within maybe the deepest place of Stillness

87
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:57,080
that you know

88
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,940
and then if you from there if you look out upon your life

89
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:10,759
the issues of your life your concerns

90
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:19,399
from that place of Stillness or peace or depth

91
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:27,679
does that provide a different perspective than the usual one for you

92
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,919
do you gaze upon things differently

93
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:41,778
understand them differently think about them differently

94
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:50,360
how do you see your life

95
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:57,980
when seen Through The Eyes of the peace Within

96
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,500
and to

97
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:42,840
turn that gaze from that still quiet place out into the world

98
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:49,440
not into the people you may encounter today strangers and

99
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,700
people who you know

100
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:03,200
and maybe from this quiet place within

101
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,840
You Can Be Touched more

102
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:18,559
by the humanity and suffering and joys of others

103
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:30,799
from that still quiet place you could gaze upon the world kindly

104
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:40,580
be still and gaze upon the world with kind eyes

105
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:48,779
may all that you think of all the people you know

106
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:57,440
may they be happy may all the people you know

107
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:05,179
friends and foe both may they be safe

108
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:11,659
may all the people you know

109
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:18,919
may they be peaceful

110
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:29,898
and may all the people you know may they be free

111
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,539
and in relationship to all the people you know

112
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:47,340
may you be free not entangled

113
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,778
in your caring awareness of them

114
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:13,059
[Music]

115
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:21,080
so

116
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:30,419
to talk more then this week on practicing with thoughts and emotions

117
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:36,539
the relationship between them and it felt important to as much as it's

118
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:43,279
important to see that there's an intimate connection between how we think and our emotions

119
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:48,659
how we emote and our thinking and that by seeing that connection it's

120
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:53,940
possible to find a degree of freedom that um

121
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:59,820
but more importantly I don't know if it's more important but another possibility

122
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:06,720
is to by knowing and seeing carefully the relationships the

123
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:12,779
entanglements the influence of one emotion emotions and thoughts and thoughts and emotions

124
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:19,380
at some point what becomes maybe strong is not the

125
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:27,299
emotions and thinking but the awareness of them but to be aware I mean I think I think

126
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:32,760
that thinking and emotions is often the place that people get hooked up caught

127
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:39,500
by stuck in reactive in but also it's a very common place to

128
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:45,720
somehow consciously or unconsciously to be defined by to know this is who I

129
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:51,960
am and some people feel it's very important to really be someone like this is who I

130
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:59,100
am and take a stand there and some people are very afraid of being

131
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:05,519
someone taking a stand and there is a third option

132
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:13,980
and that is to calmly and peacefully be aware be present be grounded be be

133
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:19,799
centered in the place where the light of awareness can shine

134
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:25,080
where we can turn on the awareness and see what's there see the emotions see

135
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:31,140
the thoughts that we have uh maybe even see some of the entanglements between them and our

136
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:36,659
entire entanglements with them but to

137
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:41,820
to be aware of it

138
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:47,399
from a peaceful place and that's one of the possibilities

139
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:53,039
through meditation is to become calmer than we usually are in daily life

140
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:58,980
and I say it carefully they're calmer as opposed to some high standard of how

141
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:05,399
calm we have to become but to be calmer or more peaceful and more subtle than we usually are

142
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:10,980
so that we have different eyes to see we have a different way of looking upon the

143
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:16,980
world and as we get quieter and Stiller we were less caught in the world of

144
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:22,740
thoughts less caught in the world of emotions even the ones that are beneficial

145
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:28,919
then the eyes conceived with greater clarity but and

146
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:36,120
we can see from a deeper place within where we have contact to wisdom to

147
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:42,740
understanding to perspectives to attitudes that we're not going to have available

148
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:49,620
when we're caught up in the in the thoughts caught up in our emotions caught up in defining ourselves

149
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:54,440
by it and thinking this is who I am

150
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:03,539
and uh and to have that New Perspective and to then from there maybe think about

151
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:10,138
our life from there see what emotional connection there might be

152
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:17,040
but it's the emotional connection that has a very different uh feel to a very different attitude very

153
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,440
different effect because we're not it's not doesn't come

154
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:28,158
from the contraction of definition doesn't come from the hooks of reactivity

155
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:35,339
it's as if that with there's a Wellspring or a spring within a vast

156
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:42,599
spring Within that um of wisdom of goodness of freedom

157
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:48,419
of peace that we can Avail ourselves of

158
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:57,859
to when we start we are no longer so caught in the world of thinking and emotions

159
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:06,060
and that also allows us to think and if and have feelings from a very different

160
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:11,220
perspective because many of the feelings we have many of the thoughts we have

161
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:18,660
can be very much rooted in definition and seeing this is who I am and this is

162
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:26,160
about me this is about me myself and mine but the still quiet place the the calm

163
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:32,300
in the middle of the storm is not you

164
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:41,040
it's not anyone else but and and whether it's you or not we don't

165
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:47,760
have to think about those thoughts we don't have to Define ourselves by it we don't have to grab a hold of it and and

166
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,220
feel like take a stand on it this is who I am

167
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:58,740
and this Freedom this peacefulness this calm in the middle of the storm

168
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:04,380
is tremendously useful because it'll it can allow

169
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:10,800
a different kind of thinking that's maybe that's not

170
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:18,300
um impatient that's not reactive that's not caring with it as much of the judgments

171
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:25,800
and biases and preconceived ideas that we might have in the surface mind

172
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:31,380
the surface mind that's been so conditioned and influenced by society and events

173
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:38,940
and the same thing with our emotions so a still quiet place within

174
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:46,500
a calm in the storm the awareness that is like a light bulb

175
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:51,440
with that when it's turned on the light

176
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:59,339
doesn't have preferences where the light lands it lands on

177
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:06,440
everything equally and just sees it that's all

178
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:14,460
so I hope that this week on thinking and emotions

179
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:20,579
has given you some New Perspectives to really look at your life and look at

180
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:28,200
yourself understand yourself that and certainly that's part of my Hope was that you would to is to provide

181
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:35,520
New Perspectives that would be freeing the New Perspectives that would be useful to break out of old perspectives

182
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:41,480
that maybe are not so helpful so I hope it worked somewhat for that

183
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:47,099
and uh so thank you for this week

184
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:54,060

185

190
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:35,099
um so please uh just to be aware that there's a certain unknown at some point it'll be

191
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:40,700
put in properly in the calendar IMC calendar

192
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:46,380
and um and then a couple of things uh announcements that maybe it's a little

193
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:53,280
bit relevant for some of you uh way back in the beginning of the year we did this series on this Sati

194
00:38:53,280 --> 00:39:01,079
patanasuta the discourse in the four foundations of mindfulness and I was uh struck by how meaningful

195
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:06,420
the instructions were on the different parts of the body the 32 parts of the

196
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:13,500
body 31 parts of the body meditation that we did a little bit and a friend of mine is one of the Bob

197
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:19,619
Stahl is one of the or probably the biggest proponent of this meditation

198
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:25,859
practice in our Buddhist scene and it does a lot of teaching of it's practiced it a lot

199
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:30,900
um it was kind of us the 32 parts of the body kind of a systematic way of

200
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:38,640
connecting to the body in a very deep way it's a it's a very important practice in therabad and Buddhism

201
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:44,940
so we invited him to come and do a class but it's through the Sati Center and so

202
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:50,060
if you go Sati s-a-t-i sati.org

203
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:55,560
you can find his class there I think it's maybe in September it starts maybe

204
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:00,960
it's an eight-week class and um I think there's uh information

205
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,839
about the Sati Center programs on the what's new section of imc's website

206
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:14,420
and the other thing that's happening in the beginning of October is I do a year-long programs for people who have

207
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:20,640
fairly established practice and practicing for some time and I think you have to have four years

208
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,740
of practice and a number of Retreats silent to be passing their retreats but

209
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:32,880
for those of you who have done that you might be interested it's a one day a month for about eight nine months and

210
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:39,359
this year the topic is meditation and the program is called deepening meditation practice

211
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:44,520
and you can read a little bit more about it in though again the what's new

212
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:49,560
section of imc's website which is on the front page of imc's website the Box on

213
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:54,960
the bottom right and there's applications for that for

214
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:00,060
both programs and and um so so I think the applications for the

215
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:06,800
deepening meditation program is this is in September 1st

216
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:14,819
so thank you everyone and um and maybe I'll be here Monday maybe not and and

217
00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:18,859
