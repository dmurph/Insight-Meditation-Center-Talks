00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,520
hello everyone and

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:12,160
welcome I don't know if it's uh not as light here on YouTube some of the lights

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,359
are not working here at IMC today so it's uh darker here for me but there's a

4
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:25,240
like a broad out a spotlight so maybe there's a little bit more light and you can see well

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:36,040
enough so one of

6
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:45,039
the the name for the people who were the title or the reference word for people who were

7
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:51,239
the direct Disciples of the Buddha is that they are the Savas and

8
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,760
the word savaka means the ones who heard the

9
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:03,000
hearers and um so so I me back in the ancient world there

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,720
was no books so there was only hearing if you any any learning you do uh was uh

11
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,799
you had to hear it and um

12
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:25,880
so but there's something I think very profound about learning the art of

13
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:31,159
listening learning to listen means that we don't assert ourselves in the middle

14
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:36,799
of the hearing we're attentive we uh kind of

15
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,399
clear uh the chatter in the mind the static in the mind so that we we can

16
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:48,840
hear well in the ancient world where you couldn't go back and refer to

17
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,399
books or transcripts of something um if you want to remember and consider what

18
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:02,600
was being said you had to listen well enough to be able to memorize it or to really learn something about it and so

19
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,640
it was a probably was kind of second nature in the ancient world to listen

20
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:15,200
with a higher uh attentiveness or a certain kind of sharper ATT attentiveness than

21
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,920
we do in the modern world because of this need to kind of let it register really deeply so we can remember and

22
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,360
have it as a reference and um

23
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,560
so this metaphor of listening can be metaphor listening can be used as a

24
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:41,360
metaphor for meditation that uh the kind of attention we're bringing to ourselves is uh to

25
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,519
listen well to listen without uh uh the

26
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,440
the static and chatter of the words the images that come up in the thinking mind

27
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:00,640
that interfere with our ability to perceive to sense to feel to

28
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,239
to to hear to see with the inner eye the

29
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:13,560
the our experience and um and to see

30
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:20,480
without interference of bias judgments commentary but to really be a good

31
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:27,560
listener to listen first to find out what's there first to give if you're

32
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,239
listening to a friend to really hear them out to hear what's going on maybe

33
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:39,720
active listening where you may be ask questions to find out more you want to really know uh your friend know what's

34
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:46,760
going on so the same thing when we sit down to meditate we really want to know our experience know what it's like to be

35
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:55,439
here and it can be inter it can interfere with meditation paradoxically can interfere if we're focusing too much

36
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,760
on becoming calm or centered or uh uh

37
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,760
somehow settling our agitation or or trying to attain

38
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:13,280
something uh it can interfere with our ability to really listen well to see to

39
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,639
really attend well to sense and feel more fully what is here what's going

40
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:27,560
on so to be a listener to oneself to be to really take the time to see sense

41
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:34,280
discover what is here and it's a little bit of a paradox that

42
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:41,160
if instead of focusing on becoming calm or becoming concentrated or becoming

43
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:47,600
settled um if we just really get to know carefully attend carefully listen

44
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:56,600
carefully to what's here that movement is itself settling uh calming if we listen well if

45
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:03,440
we listen without interference without expectation without wanting something

46
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,880
from the from the listening just to listen just to perceive just to be here with what

47
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,759
is so for this uh meditation we can um maybe use this

48
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:20,840
metaphor of listening uh as a way of being present for

49
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:27,800
oneself so assuming a meditation

50
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:35,680
posture and either either lowering your gaze or closing your

51
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,960
eyes and without doing anything more than

52
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:50,560
that notice how you are as if you're sitting down with a

53
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:58,039
friend and taking them in as they are today at this time ready to listen to

54
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:05,840
them sit down and just kind of notice yourself how are you what's happening

55
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:13,000
within you is there anything you can perceive

56
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,479
about yourself if you read your posture anything about your posture that

57
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:27,000
reveals your mood your attitude State of

58
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Mind

59
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,960
anything about how you're

60
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:52,680
breathing does it inform you at all about how you

61
00:06:52,680 --> 00:07:00,120
are and the task is just to notice not to fix not to judge

62
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:07,240
but to notice so that as time goes along you can be a better

63
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:13,720
listener a better companion for yourself as you

64
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:31,319
are how are you emotionally

65
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:40,319
how is your thinking

66
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:53,759
mind if your thoughts were in a foreign language so you couldn't understand what you're

67
00:07:53,759 --> 00:08:02,720
thinking what would you perceive about yourself as a thinker right now

68
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:10,479
what would you notice about what thinking is

69
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
like

70
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:42,560
and then in the middle of how you are Center yourself on your

71
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,440
breathing as if the breathing are the words that you listen to when you are

72
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:57,160
listening to a friend open clear

73
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,839
attentive at the center of all

74
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,640
things is

75
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:17,720
breathing breathing in and breathing

76
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
out

77
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120

if you were to live listen deeply to how you

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:12,600
are is there something about how you are that you normally don't

110
00:25:15,399 --> 00:25:21,960
acknowledge is there some truth about the situation about

yourself that you can listen to acknowledge

reactivity an acknowledgement and deep listening what is this that you might

and as we come to the end of this sitting to maybe reflect

119
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:29,520
on the value of listening well to others

120
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,360
to listen before offering our own

121
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:45,919
opinions our own stories to listen not only for what is being

122
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:53,120
said but listen to what

123
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:59,518
people's where people's speaking comes from inside of them

124
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,399
them what's the emotional or Source

125
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:14,740
the motivational Source what's behind the

126

[Music]

127
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:29,519
words to listen with respect to listen with respect for what

128
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:35,559
is behind the words even if you might not agree with it or find it

129
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:39,480
Pleasant to listen

130
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,799
well to listen as a

131
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,399
way of bringing kindness and love

132
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:02,600
respect to listen well to bring people a sense of

133

[Music]

142
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,760
free thank

143
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
you

144
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:25,799
so good day everyone then continuing the list with

145
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:31,360
the of tenfold list the Buddha gave on the 10

146
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:37,080
protectors and it it might be just as useful maybe more useful to call these

147
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:44,760
10 supports and uh life can be quite challenging and uh the challenges can be

148
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:51,399
unexpected and um our inner life can be challenging and uh inner life can be

149
00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:56,840
unexpected just all the ways it shifts and changes sometimes

150
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:03,519
seem ly for no reason and so it's good to have supports

151
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:11,159
it's good to have supports to uh find our way and and U not be overwhelmed or

152
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:20,960
excessively challenged uh Goods have supports that uh keep us balanced and centered and and

153
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:29,080
attentive in a clear and wise way so

154
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:38,200
the the fourth of these supports so so far it's been um uh having a virtuous

155
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:45,320
conduct behaving in such a way that our Behavior doesn't U challenge us and

156
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:51,080
doesn't make things more difficult than they need to be to

157
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:58,840
learn um to learn the Dharma to learn good skills in life to uh be studied and

158
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:06,240
kind of prepared for what we're doing um understand the bigger

159
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:14,679
context the and the third is having good spiritual friends having surrounding yourselves or

160
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:22,399
having reference to uh friends that bring out the best in us who have our best wishes in in mind who uh want to

161
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:28,760
support us who care about our well-being and but to do to do so from a place of

162
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:35,159
Freedom Place of uh not demanding or expecting or judging us for who we

163
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:43,080
are having good spiritual friends and today the the support is um

164
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:49,480
is um being easy to speak to be someone who

165
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:55,639
uh who it's easy for people to say things to you and uh in bod's

166
00:33:55,639 --> 00:34:01,840
translation of the this particular suta uh he calls it he defines it as easy to

167
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:07,840
correct and um in the Buddha's commentary or discussion about this

168
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:13,720
point he describes it as being um easy to be in to receive

169
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:19,358
instructions and respectful of the instructions we receive so whether

170
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:27,440
instruction sometimes maybe is feedback uh is uh is um

171
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,480
people telling us uh difficult things that uh are difficult for us to hear but

172
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,638
maybe we need to hear that maybe sometimes people have criticism of us

173
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:44,520
have critiques of us and so to be e uh uh easy to speak to

174
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:51,320
so it's an act of generosity towards others if they want to come and speak to us about something that um we're

175
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:58,000
generous to them we are willing to receive it we'll take it in as and available for it

176
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:06,920
not to be defensive automatically not to be offensive because we don't like what we're hearing not to immediately uh meet

177
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:13,839
criticism with criticism or with shutting down or with anger but uh to

178
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:19,960
have the ability to be open to be to hear what's being said in an open

179
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:26,400
relaxed way um while so we can really know what's going

180
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:32,119
on we can track ourselves what's going on in ourselves and we can track others and what they're saying

181
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:38,720
well and uh in such a way that we're actually safer uh there is a way of protecting

182
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:45,480
ourselves by being angry and then people just want to go away or they shut up or they stop what

183
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:53,200
they're doing but uh the relationship is damaged that way and long-term safety is

184
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:59,079
not attained uh long-term safety comes from really knowing what people are thinking

185
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:06,079
and feeling and processing and working with it to be angry and get getting someone to shut up and so they never

186
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:12,400
talk about difficult things again um I think makes the situation much more difficult and challenging because then

187
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:20,520
we don't know what's underneath and what people are thinking and what's driving people to what they want to do so take

188
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:27,800
to have the capacity and the the wisdom and the skill to um to listen first

189
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:34,920
to be easy to speak to and um and

190
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:42,480
um uh it's it can be very challenging to do this uh it can threaten our sense of

191
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,960
self that we're capable that we know everything and there's nothing anyone

192
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:55,359
needs to tell us and the fact that someone needs to tell us anything is a sign that um somehow we're they think

193
00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:01,640
we're wrong or bad or they're challenging their self image of being um

194
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:07,880
you know uh quite capable and knowledgeable and and um and we're more

195
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:13,880
in the person to be talking than the person to be receiving uh the idea what what they're

196
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:20,079
saying is is feedback about us can touch some very diffic difficult sore places

197
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:25,680
inside um it we can interpret it in ways that it's much bigger deal than what

198
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:32,079
it's actually being said we can interpret to mean that we're fundamentally flawed and and this is the

199
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:38,520
proof of it we can interpreted that people are being mean and um and

200
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:45,960
unfairly critical and of course sometimes they are but even if they are do we have to

201
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:51,720
take it personally do we have to uh is there any need to

202
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:57,960
reply uh is it um there's a whole other art to there's an art to receiving

203
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:03,359
criticism where we don't believe it we don't accept it but we also don't fight

204
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:08,960
it uh we might listen carefully and then we might say uh I'll think about it but

205
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:16,440
I don't think I agree with you and um and well that's interesting what you're saying and um I'll have to think about

206
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:22,200
it because doesn't seem quite right to me and um and that's kind of gentle way

207
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:29,560
of saying you're not behind it exactly but you are respectful of what's being said said and maybe there is some little

208
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:34,640
uh piece of it is true or or what's true is that the fact that someone has

209
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:40,839
critiques of you maybe maybe what's true is not the words but behind the words

210
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:46,640
why are they doing this maybe they feel challenged in the relationship maybe they're afraid maybe Something's

211
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:55,319
Happened that has created a rupture in the relationship and and this is their way of trying to establish a

212
00:38:55,319 --> 00:39:01,160
connection so so this idea of easy to speak to um

213
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:07,560
uh uh people are comfortable in speaking to us people are uh don't have to be

214
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:14,079
afraid of us when they speak to us so this is a tremendous support and

215
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:20,760
protection because then if there is something we need to hear about ourselves something some way that we're

216
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:26,079
of people are comfortable to come and tell us and this is this is considered

217
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:32,520
in the budha tradition a people like that are a treasure it's a really phenomenal gift

218
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:39,880
and tremendously valuable to have people come to us and say you know you said something and that didn't quite work or

219
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:45,319
uh that was challenging or I think that what you did um C hurt the other person

220
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:50,440
or I think what you did was um you know I what you what you said there what you

221
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:56,119
did there has been difficult for me to listen to and I feel hurt I feel afraid

222
00:39:56,119 --> 00:40:03,480
um you know can we talk about it um uh I've known people who have are so

223
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:09,040
reactive and so tense and so immediately attacking anybody who comes and says

224
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:14,359
anything to them about who they are personally that no one wants to talk to

225
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:19,480
them and um and I've known you know as a teacher I've known people that way and

226
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:27,880
who I've known for years and years and um it were very difficult as a te and as a teacher to get through the the barrier

227
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:33,839
that the wall that's there and um and then at some point when it felt really

228
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:40,599
important that uh to say something um uh to one person I finally said I knew it

229
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:45,960
would be difficult and in fact the person uh became very angry for about a

230
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:51,319
minute very upset and uh and then the person quiet down and thought about it

231
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:56,359
and came back and said oh now I understand what's happening

232
00:40:56,359 --> 00:41:02,880
with me and other people I didn't understand and um and that was a turning point in this person's I think the

233
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:10,480
person's life and within a few years the person ended up uh dying and I think

234
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:16,040
that that conversation we had um was a was such a big turning point that it

235
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:22,079
contributed that person's ability to die peacefully and people would come all kinds of people came to sit with the

236
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:30,240
person and because it was so wonderful and pleasant and to be a with person who no longer had that reactivity and and um

237
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:37,280
defensiveness and anger so to um so you know so I think

238
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,560
she was quite lucky to have someone um finally be able to speak to her and say

239
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:49,280
something and it's unfortunate if we have to wait until crisis before we're willing to hear some feedback from

240
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,560
people there is some people who actually invite feedback and say please if

241
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:02,200
there's if you see anything I say or do do that is not right uh please speak up I welcome it and maybe just do it at at

242
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:08,920
the right time don't do it when I feel grumpy or or when I feel kind of under

243
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:15,319
the weather but I want to hear so easy to speak to available for the community

244
00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:20,480
to say anything and to have the inner resources inner

245
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:26,680
strength to not take it personally and to be able to stand up for oneself and

246
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:33,760
necessary um this is not being a pushover for what other people have to say but it's also not being not not

247
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:40,040
being uh in Conflict for what they're saying and so this is a protection

248
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:46,160
because then we don't end up in Conflict it's a protection because we can um uh

249
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:52,400
we can learn about what we need to learn about ourselves and even if it's not about ourselves we're learning something

250
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:59,839
about the relationship we have with the other person and maybe there is where work needs to be done and um and if we

251
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:04,880
take it personally and then attack back the relationship stays ruptured but if

252
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:11,040
we hear it acknowledge what we've heard maybe even repeat back is this accurate

253
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:16,720
what I've heard uh then uh it settles people they know they've been they've

254
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:22,800
been understood and then you can say well you know I don't think that's right and

255
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,319
here's my understanding of it or I don't think that's right but

256
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:34,119
before talking about what you're saying I just want to say that uh you know I

257
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:40,000
care about you or we're friends and I want to find a way to have this conversation to maintain our friendship

258
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,319
um because sometimes what's going on is underneath the person's criticism there

259
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:52,800
is something that uh different that needs to be addressed some challenge in the relationship and uh and uh to be able to

260
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,079
listen and hear that what's underneath it sometimes uh is invaluable and that

261
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:04,440
also supports everyone it also is a protection for oneself and for others

262
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:11,520
and so this being easy to speak to is not a lightweight thing to do I believe

263
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:17,400
it's a phenomenally significant powerful thing to do and I like to think of it as

264
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:22,720
part of the one of the fruits of doing mindfulness practice this kind of deep

265
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:31,160
way and be able to monitor ourselves know ourselves track what's happening in the uh as things are happening that it

266
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:38,040
supports us to have this capacity to be willing to hear even difficult things or

267
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:43,760
to um so um if you want to be well

268
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:50,119
protected if you want to be well supported um be easy to speak to become

269
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:57,720
a good listener and uh listening both to people around you but also

270
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:04,240
listening to yourself listening not only to the words but listening uh to where

271
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:09,800
the words are coming from not only listening to the words but

272
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:18,040
listening to uh where those words land inside of us and this will make us easy to speak

273
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:24,880
to and find support and protection in being this

274
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:31,000
way so thank you and I would encourage you to look for opportunities even the

275
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:39,000
smallest opportunities even things where people say things that are relatively mild in criticism or feedback or

276
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:45,760
something's difficult to hear um uh experiment with uh being just rather

277
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:53,119
than closing down in a sense turning towards the person you don't have to do this physically literally but as if

278
00:45:53,119 --> 00:46:00,760
you're stepping forward and kind of being available with Open Arms to hear tell me more um turn towards the person

279
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:09,119
and rather than away and and um you know and this this uh uh expression tell me

280
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:14,280
more is a powerful and effective way of

281
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:21,839
um disarming people when necessary and a powerful way of learning more fully may be what we need to

282
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:29,078
hear so thank you and um May may we all be good listeners

283
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:33,119
today
