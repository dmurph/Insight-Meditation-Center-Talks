1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:08,160
i'm struck by all the greetings and good mornings good days and

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,920
one i think is in portuguese and maybe tomorrow when we gather all of you

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,960
all of you who do speak uh whatever language you speak whatever

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,119
your native language is if you want to offer the greetings in your native language in english

5
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:31,359
certainly and any other it'd be fun to see all the different

6
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,718
kind of languages of greeting

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,280
so i offer you a warm hello from redwood

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:50,640
city here at imc in our second gathering for the new year

9
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,640
and one of the things that we are

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,000
discovering in mindfulness practice is

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,640
new new a new relationship to our capacity to be

12
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,280
aware we're discovering something new about attention

13
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,880
and attention awareness is something that where that many of us will use

14
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,560
throughout the day unself-consciously without much attention and

15
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,040
and it kind of needs to be that way we get through the day more efficiently if we just don't have to think about being aware so

16
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,720
much but i but in mindfulness practice we're

17
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:45,520
beginning to discover the nature of something which is very intimate it's kind of always with us

18
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,240
when we're in our conscious moments is to be aware to pay attention

19
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,600
and um and uh mindfulness itself is kind of a i i

20
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,719
think of it as a heightened awareness it's possible to

21
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,160
be rivetedly involved in some kind of absorbed in some conversation with someone

22
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,840
and i might put down my glasses and and forget where i put them like just

23
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:23,280
now i went look to my right when i just a moment ago i put it down to my left and um

24
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,319
and uh and putting down the glasses not to be so attentive to the fact of putting them

25
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,760
down attentive enough to let it register in some deeper way

26
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,800
and so this idea of heightened awareness maybe could be

27
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:47,200
expressed in the little saying that when we do mindfulness practice we stop

28
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,319
for awareness we stop to be aware

29
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:58,000
whatever is happening whatever is going on um uh

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,640
in the moment we're bringing if we're if we're attentive we're bringing kind of a we're stopping to be

31
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,720
aware to let things register in a fuller way and uh

32
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,080
and so what we do as we do this meditation now

33
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,000
the mindfulness of breathing the whole and the whole endeavor the

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:29,280
whole adventure of mindfulness practice the journey of mindfulness

35
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,840
in the instructions of the buddha it begins with

36
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,760
a heightened knowing registering

37
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,280
of the experience of breathing and

38
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:54,080
so when i was driving down here today i needed a certain ongoing attentiveness

39
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,239
to the road to the driving and i couldn't just kind of be casually

40
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,840
you know paying attention to other things i had to be here with the road

41
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,599
when i came down here to imc i looked at these big windows we have here to my left that have these wooden

42
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,440
frames and because i was going to give this talk i asked myself what's it like

43
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,560
to see something new in these windows i've seen them for a

44
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,320
long time i look at them every day but it wasn't so much interested in finding

45
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:35,520
something new but what's what kind of attention do i use so that i can discover something new

46
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,120
what is that a little more sharper focus a little bit more heightened attention

47
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,320
what is that like and then sure enough i saw something new i said oh cool

48
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,720
that's pretty cool that the wood grain has been the carpenter put it in that way for the wood grain to

49
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,840
flow in like that that must have been unconsciously

50
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,759
so as we do something as simple as breathing

51
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,479
it isn't that we're trying to get deeper and deeper into the breathing exactly

52
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:16,639
but more clearer clearer in the attention to breathing

53
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,720
the receptive registering and maybe in the process of just like as if you're going to discover something

54
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:30,240
new in the breath and breathing it isn't so much discovering something new is important but rather the kind of

55
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,840
attention hopefully peaceful relaxedly interested

56
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,000
available without preconceived ideas without

57
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,440
straining to discover to have to acquire something new understanding just kind of a heightened attention

58
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,039
and breathing is the experience the medium through which

59
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:00,479
we are beginning to cultivate this heightened attentiveness one that

60
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:08,160
allows us to become absorbed in the present moment and not distracted by our thoughts

61
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,440
so to assume a meditation posture

62
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:21,440
and to take a little bit of time to

63
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,960
have a posture that allows the chest to be a teeny bit more open

64
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,840
maybe even for the shoulder blades to be allowed to

65
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:45,479
rest backwards down the spot but down the back

66
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,720
and gently closing your eyes

67
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,120
and it's my experience that every time

68
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,360
i sit down to meditate breathing is a little bit different

69
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,560
than how it's been before

70
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,960
or it's going to be unique for this moments

71
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:57,039
and being aware of your breathing and aware of

72
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:03,520
the sensitivity to the experience gently take a few long slow deep

73
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,080
in-breaths

74
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:16,319
and as you exhale what kind of attention is needed that supports you

75
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:22,680
to relax your body as you exhale

76
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:33,120
breathing in breathing out

77
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,719
and then letting your breathing return to normal

78
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:57,519
breathing in and feeling your body on the inhale

79
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,240
and as you exhale

80
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,800
attentive to the experience of relaxing as you relax different parts of your

81
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,800
body

82
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,839
and then settling into your breathing

83
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:17,880
and the rhythm and your breathing can be used to

84
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:25,959
bring attention to awareness itself

85
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,079
attention to breathing

86
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,880
helps us to be aware

87
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,839
of awareness

88
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:09,440
and if there's any strain or tension in your uh tension

89
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,040
as you exhale relax

90
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,680
the strain

91
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,839
it might help be helpful to have a sense of receiving the inhale

92
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,440
receiving it into awareness

93
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:54,279
in what way can attention be calm and peaceful

94
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:18,079
perhaps allowing the thinking mind to become quieter and calmer

95
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:31,200
as if you're going to discover something new in the experience of breathing

96
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,000
curious interested

97
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:51,160
it's not that you have to discover something new you might

98
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:58,560
feel the attention that's used

99
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,600
for that exploration

100
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:38,320
how would you enter into awareness into attention

101
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:45,760
so all there is are almost all there is

102
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,399
is breathing and attention to breathing

103
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:58,560
intention awareness of breathing and breathing

104
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,519
what would what would that awareness be like

105
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:11,959
and be content to discover that in short moments

106
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,760
coming back again and again to discover

107
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,440
a new way a clearer way

108
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:41,079
of receiving the experience of breathing

109
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,600
what is the quality of your attention now

110
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,519
and as i bring your attention to awareness

111
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:44,320
can you take a few moments to sit here with relaxed open awareness

112
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:51,480
a receptive awareness or

113
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:01,080
if it's available sensitive to a clarity of attention

114
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,559
and then i'm going to say a few words

115
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:24,320
concepts see if as i say the words

116
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:30,480
maybe with associations you have with them see how that changes the quality of your

117
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,559
attention of your awareness

118
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,279
love

119
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,559
hate

120
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,919
generosity

121
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,960
greed

122
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,720
wisdom

123
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,600
delusion

124
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,640
confidence

125
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,840
anxiety

126
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:26,320
in a sense awareness is the medium through which these

127
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:33,279
different states operate and they can have a big impact on how

128
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,279
we're aware the nature of attention

129
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,360
but to appreciate that awareness is the medium

130
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:51,360
and to use that medium for the welfare and happiness of oneself

131
00:29:51,360 --> 00:30:00,080
and others and as we come to the end of the sitting

132
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,320
consider how being aware and attentive is a means

133
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:12,640
support for love and good will

134
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,000
for generosity and care

135
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:32,320
and may we stay close to our capacity for attention

136
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:42,320
so that attention itself is the byway the highway the means the path

137
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:48,399
the medium for how we

138
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:55,840
care for this world in being attentive

139
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:04,039
may we contribute to the happiness of others

140
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,398
the safety of others

141
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,240
the peace of others

142
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:25,399
and to their freedom may all beings be happy

143
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:42,529
[Music]

144
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,919
you

145
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,399
um

146
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:17,600
so here we are the second talk focusing on

147
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:24,159
the buddha's teachings instructions on mindfulness practice

148
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:30,399
and it was a surprise many years ago when happily eagerly

149
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:35,919
i picked up the text i'd read it before but i picked up the text

150
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:42,880
and i really wanted to discover uh what did the buddha actually have to say about mindfulness

151
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:49,519
what did he actually say about practicing mindfulness and the word the pali word is sati

152
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,320
s-a-t-i and

153
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:02,880
and i went to this text and as i went through it i was

154
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,638
surprised actually a little shocked that how little he actually says about

155
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:16,638
mindfulness the title of the text is the four foundations for mindfulness

156
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:22,000
and so i thought for sure there would be lots of references to this word sati

157
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,118
mindfulness and then surprisingly there is very little

158
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:34,638
there's a little bit in the introduction about mindfulness just just a statement about

159
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:40,960
it one is um one is mindful

160
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:47,440
clearly aware and ardent so i want you to practice and it's and here mindful

161
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:53,280
is a adjective it's not a verb in the way it's used

162
00:34:53,280 --> 00:35:00,240
and then as i said yesterday morning there was a section beginning it says going to a forest

163
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:07,280
root of a tree empty building sitting cross-legged body upright

164
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:15,440
and establishing mindfulness to the forefront the rest of the long text that we have

165
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:22,000
the word mindfulness doesn't appear until maybe the very end again a kind of a conclusion

166
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,119
and all the exercises all the instructions of what to do

167
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:32,160
are do not have the word mindfulness in them so that was a little bit surprised i

168
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:38,800
thought what does this mean and as i started looking through the text of the of the buddha

169
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:45,119
there is nothing that in his teachings that would that would be comparable to the english

170
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:51,040
expression be mindful like you my mother might tell me you

171
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:56,079
know be mindful gil when i was growing up and

172
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:02,960
where the mindful is used as a verb an activity that you would do do mindfulness

173
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:11,280
and so this sati whatever sati is that was translated as mindfulness was not being something that we do

174
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,960
and um but rather something that um we establish

175
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,880
and if it went through the the different teachings of the buddha i saw the sati was associated with the

176
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:29,440
verbs to abide in to establish to cultivate

177
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,640
so if a farmer cultivates a plant

178
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:40,160
the farmer's not doing the growing the farmer is creating the conditions

179
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,200
the plant can grow um if we

180
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:51,680
abide in dwell in something i love the expression abiding

181
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:58,400
because of me it's just kind of a peaceful way of just kind of yours there and like at home in some place

182
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,440
and it's where you're supposed to be kind of and to abide

183
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:09,520
in sati and mindfulness is current to rest in it

184
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:17,440
and um i once uh made us uh used a photograph or a slide of a big

185
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:23,440
whale floating kind of peacefully in the ocean underwater photograph of this big whale

186
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:29,920
as abiding in this abiding in satin awareness

187
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:36,960
and and so so this sati is not associated with an

188
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:43,119
activity of doing it's more like a state of being aware

189
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:49,520
so what what so how am i supposed to do it what's the activity so then if you go look at this text that

190
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:55,839
we're going to study over these next weeks the actual activities the practices that

191
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:01,599
we do are not practices maybe could be called maybe it could be

192
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:09,119
called mindfulness practices in the sense that they are there to cultivate to establish

193
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:16,160
to grow mindfulness so we can abide in it

194
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:22,720
and and so uh the instructions the verbs of things that we're doing

195
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:30,400
are the first thing that's talked about is to know uh to know that one is breathing

196
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,960
to no one is breathing long when one who's breathing a long breath short when it's a short breath

197
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,240
and um and then there's a later on there's instructions to

198
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:48,800
clearly recognize what's happening so it's a little bit higher uh more

199
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:54,400
order of of mentality mental activity to recognize something and i'll talk more

200
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,400
about that later the text also talks about observing

201
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:06,960
and then it talks about something that has the word sati in it but it's a compound called pati sati

202
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,640
and this is lucid awareness so i'd like to translate sati as

203
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,839
awareness rather than mindfulness partly because in we have this you know

204
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:23,200
wave of the mindfulness movement going through the uh the modern world

205
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:30,320
and um and the the meanings and definitions of what mindfulness is these days is very much

206
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:35,760
influenced by how it's taught in that movement nothing wrong with how it's taught

207
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:41,280
but they use the word mindfulness differently than how the buddha uses it

208
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:47,440
in that for the buddha this word sati is is a

209
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:53,280
state that we can abide in establish cultivate grow

210
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,800
it's not an activity that we do and but the activity we do

211
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:04,800
is this knowing and so but knowing you know we don't want to do a meditation practice that

212
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,400
feels like a lot of work and it makes us busy exactly but the knowing is this wonderful

213
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,960
special quality to know something and it doesn't have to be so

214
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:23,760
you know cognitive or so you know thoughtful a lot of thought involved

215
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:30,160
if i'm sitting talking with a friend and uh and where i'm engaged fully absorbing

216
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:37,040
the conversation and my attention is there for sure and then i put my glasses down

217
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:42,720
and and then i continue talking and then i get up to go to the bathroom and get some tea and come back

218
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:48,640
and then i said where's my glasses i have no idea even though five minutes before i might have put them down but i

219
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:54,960
put them down without clearly knowing i was putting them down or or or clearly

220
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:00,560
present for the experience of of putting them down

221
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,960
and this idea of being present enough to let the experience what we're doing register

222
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:13,359
enough so that it can stay little bit in our memory and that's a that's uh one of the

223
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:21,040
meanings they before the buddha the word for sati had associations with memory

224
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:26,240
and it's the kind of receptivity attention that's required

225
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:32,720
for us to um to kind of remember something later like i said where my glasses are

226
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:40,480
it isn't like we're memorizing which is him in a higher order of mental activity but there's a kind of like

227
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:47,280
i like the expression we stop to know we pause to know

228
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:53,280
we engage knowingly with what we're doing so we're present for what we're doing so

229
00:41:53,280 --> 00:42:00,240
we maybe do one thing at a time we're really there present for it and in that presence there's a heightened kind of

230
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:07,040
knowing recognition kind of attentiveness to the experience

231
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:12,800
as that heightened attention height kind of knowing operates it then supports

232
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:19,680
the cultivation the growing of awareness awareness follows in the wake

233
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:25,119
of the practice of knowing and it's meant to be a peaceful practice

234
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:32,720
so it begins with just knowing the breathing and it's such a powerful practice to uh

235
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:38,319
mindfulness of breathing it's not suitable for everyone so it's fine to do other things

236
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:45,359
but it's a wonderful thing to acquire the ability to get focused centered on the breathing

237
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:51,359
concentrating the breathing to learn to gather the mind together so that when with experience of

238
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:56,400
breathing we're not scattered and distracted we're just there with that

239
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:03,119
as if we're present to know it well as if almost as if the kind of attention

240
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:09,200
we bring to uh if we were going to look at something we've looked at a long

241
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:15,440
long time we've passed it by we've been with it and they said let me stop and look to discover something new in it that

242
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:22,079
you've never noticed before and um not straining to to know or discover but

243
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:29,200
just to relax kind of glancing at it looking at it roaming around the

244
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:36,160
thing oh look at that i never noticed that before about it um and um

245
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:41,760
and so it requires a kind of knowing that uh wretched or something deep more

246
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:47,119
deeply so we could in a sense then remember it

247
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:52,240
i'm spending a lot of time now with my mother who has kind of advanced dementia

248
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:59,280
and we can have wonderful exchanges back and forth and very clear

249
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:05,680
in the moment but her memory lasts probably 30 seconds

250
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:12,240
and so i'll say something and she'll come back with a wonderful reply and um

251
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:19,359
and then i could ask you know if 10 seconds later i could ask the same question and and she would come back with the same or

252
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:26,720
different reply she doesn't remember i said it and so for her nothing sticks

253
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:33,760
there's a clarity to her but uh the attention something about the attentiveness is not all there

254
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,960
that it kind of has a place to register or stay or stick i don't really understand how dementia

255
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:44,240
works so well but uh whether i'm accurate exactly with this is not so important it's trying to i'm

256
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:52,800
trying to convey to you that uh this idea of of um the specialness of knowing

257
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:58,319
that to attend to so that we know it's something in a

258
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:04,560
deeper way and uh but without it being uh heavily

259
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:11,359
cognitive or investigatory or questioning or thought-filled kind of exploration just

260
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:19,119
very very simple so that as we know the breathing and get kind of more and more centered and

261
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:26,400
present for just the breathing we know it more and more clearer and clearer but the mind also gets quieter and more

262
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:32,800
peaceful calmer the difference between a concentration

263
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,839
practice and mindfulness practice is that in concentration practice we're

264
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:43,680
getting absorbed in the breathing in mindfulness practice by its when just

265
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:48,800
through concentration in mindfulness practice if we're getting absorbed it becomes

266
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:55,040
absorbed in the knowing and the clarity of awareness that takes in the experience

267
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:03,520
and so we're more available in mindfulness to register the details the fullness the richness of an experience

268
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:09,200
how it changes over time then we are often if we just do concentration practice where

269
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:16,079
we're just trying to hold the mind still in a certain kind of way or rather than letting the experience become richer in

270
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:22,800
the knowing mind so sati is awareness and tomorrow i'll

271
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:30,079
talk a little bit about how these exercises of knowing and recognition and observation

272
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:37,200
leads to a heightened awareness and this path this journey to heightened

273
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:42,640
awareness is the is the trajectory is a journey of

274
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:48,880
satipatana of the foundations for awareness and

275
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:54,079
in the meantime maybe you'll explore

276
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:59,520
the nature of your awareness of your attention of your knowing

277
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:05,440
all these faculties of attentiveness that we have and for today especially notice

278
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:11,119
the your faculty of knowing to the simplest knowing the kind of

279
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:16,480
knowing that if you really let it register something you would remember where you put your glasses

280
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:21,279
before you put your keys just that simple

281
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:29,760
so um so thank you and i look forward to tomorrow

282
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,440
