1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:07,639
so good morning or good day and welcome to this

2
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:14,000
uh period of time that we're going to explore we're we're exploring insight

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,680
for for insight meditation and

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,199
um when i practiced as a san francisco zen center there was a quote from the

5
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:38,160
founder suzuki roshi that went something like this you're perfect just the way you are

6
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,360
and there's room for improvement

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:52,280
and uh maybe i would say we're perfect just the way we are but there's a possibility of further

8
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,879
growth further transformation so this emphasis on being perfect it

9
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:04,080
goes along with how in the modern mindfulness movement there has been a

10
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,240
big emphasis on mindfulness being non-judgmental awareness where mindfulness is practiced

11
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,280
with a kind of a radical acceptance of how we

12
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:25,439
are and that's true up to a point that uh or in a particular way

13
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,880
it's true that um this radical acceptance

14
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:37,560
non-judgmental awareness means we don't condemn anything or resist

15
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,479
anything but we also see clearly that's the insight piece and we see where there

16
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,720
can be improvement we see where we have

17
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:56,040
tendencies thoughts impulses actions that we do that are not in

18
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:05,799
harmony with a deep settleness a deep freedom a

19
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:13,840
deep integrity that is possible to live with

20
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:22,720
and uh we are looking in fact to not live anymore acting on impulses

21
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,360
of greed hatred and delusion we are looking to become to grow our capacity

22
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,720
for wisdom for peace for joy for love uh

23
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,920
wonderful capacities that we can develop and if we have the opposite of that we

24
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,879
want to somehow see it clearly we want to see that we have attachments

25
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:52,080
clearly and so this radical acceptance or non-judgmental awareness is not meant

26
00:02:52,080 --> 00:03:00,000
to be an alternative to a realism about what we

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,120
want to address what we'd like to change what we'd like to transform

28
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:14,560
and so part of the art of insight is to have insight have clear seeing of our foibless clear seeing of

29
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,120
where it is that we could change in a way and to want to change to be

30
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,319
available to that change to prepare ourselves for that change partly by seeing more and more clearly

31
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,680
uh what's actually going on for us not pretending otherwise not have

32
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,480
some kind of simplistic or naive acceptance naive non-judgmentalism that doesn't see oh

33
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,400
this is not so healthy what i'm doing what i'm thinking what's going on and uh

34
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,040
let's uh see it more clearly let's see if we can have some better understanding of it and better

35
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,560
relationship to it but the art of this as insight practice

36
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,159
is to see where we have foibless see where we have possibilities for growth

37
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:11,400
see what we'd like to transform and to change and to shed to do all that

38
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,600
without it being doing it without a reference to judging

39
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:22,199
ourselves without a reference of being critical or upset or discouraged with

40
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:27,400
ourselves without building ourselves up and so the radical

41
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,440
acceptance is not that we and and non-judgmentalism is not that we don't

42
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,520
see that we have foibless that there's an evaluation a clear seeing but we

43
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:48,120
don't use that information as uh data or evidence or or

44
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:55,360
reason to then uh uh build up stories that were wrong

45
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,360
or bad or the world is bad or it's hopeless and just not adding on to it

46
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:09,440
just very simply look at that i have anger this anger is not so useful anger

47
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,199
has hostility in it let's take a let's look at it clearly

48
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:21,280
let's not run away let's not push it away let's not justify it let's just see

49
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,560
it this is something that we want to grow i'm perfect just the way i am but

50
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:36,960
here's an area of improvement so part of the foundation of insight is this ability to see clearly

51
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:47,440
um you know what we would like to see changed transformed so to assume a meditation

52
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:54,120
posture and to take some

53
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:01,759
time to come into the posture to have an intimacy with your posture maybe swaying

54
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,960
back and forth forward and back in a way that

55
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:15,120
you're looking for a sense of beautiful alertness beautiful sense of

56
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:23,560
the body is going to be present here with where where the sense of

57
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:31,000
awareness arises out of the body out of the sensations of the body

58
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,039
not leaving the body to be somehow

59
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:48,560
offline in meditation but to have an intentional

60
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:55,039
posture even lying down it's possible to add some intentionality to it

61
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,400
maybe simply by how you position your hands or your

62
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,638
arms and then gently closing the

63
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:17,319
eyes and preparing yourself to be aware to be present for

64
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:25,759
yourself with care with kindness with a without judging yourself

65
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:32,560
as good or bad but as bringing awareness as a kind of

66
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:40,039
medicine a kind of self-care a kind of generosity of

67
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:46,880
goodness to attend to ourselves our inner

68
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:54,240
life and that can begin by taking a few long deep

69
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,879
breaths relaxing on the exhale

70
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:29,520
letting the breathing return to normal and with a normal breath continue

71
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:36,640
to soften relax in the body where the feeling the body and

72
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:44,279
relaxing the body is done gracefully beautifully

73
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:25,320
and as you exhale to relax the thinking

74
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:33,720
muscle the thinking mind softing softening

75
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,519
and then having settled a

76
00:09:54,519 --> 00:10:03,480
bit here and now check in with yourself

77
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,240
how are

78
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,320
you is there anything about how you are right

79
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:24,839
now that maybe is not so useful for you or helpful for

80
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:29,800
you in some deep way

81
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:38,480
something you're thinking about some mood some

82
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,839
attitude and if there is let it

83
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:58,880
be without judgment of being good or bad

84
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,440
but as

85
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:11,360
something that would be good to

86
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,600
transform to change to to

87
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:26,279
shed to leave behind and we begin that

88
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:32,839
process not by trying to do that but rather

89
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:42,440
to see be aware [Music] know feel this part of

90
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:49,360
ourselves in a beautiful way in a graceful way giving it

91
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:57,040
breathing room to be itself without participating in

92
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,399
it an honest

93
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:23,199
self-awareness maybe of some way that you are that doesn't serve you doesn't serve the best of you

94
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,320
and then in the middle of that breathe with it breathe through

95
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,959
it as if

96
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:52,800
breathing brings care and

97
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,120
kindness brings a calming force

98
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:29,040
and having done that for a little short while now settle in with your

99
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,600
breathing settle in steady

100
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,680
yourself maybe spend a little bit of some minutes here with the samadei of

101
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:48,680
breathing just breathing

102
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:59,360
if your mind wanders off in thought maybe that represents a movement

103
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,720
of mind that doesn't really serve

104
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,559
meditation it's not about being here and

105
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:21,320
now hold the distracted mind kindly beautifully

106
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:29,159
openly and have the desire to bring the mind

107
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:34,960
back to change the circumstances of the mind

108
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:41,200
to let go of the distractions and begin again here and

109
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,080
now with your breathing

110
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,720
and as we coming to the end of this

111
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:12,320
sitting take a few moments to feel any way in which you're more

112
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:19,760
settled or calm sitting here in meditation than

113
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,880
than you were at the

114
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:34,960
and if you are there's be is there some some way

115
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:42,120
that you're calm and settled that can guide you show

116
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:49,039
you how to be aware of your inner foibless your inner

117
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:54,960
challenges is that you would like to transform or

118
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,360
to shed but

119
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:09,600
first to learn how to hold them calmly with a settle mind and settled

120
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:15,120
heart being aware without any

121
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:21,440
impulse to try to change them or get rid of them or judge them

122
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:28,080
just first to see them and to

123
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:36,919
know spaciously quietly calmly

124
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:43,360
yes this is something that would be good to

125
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:51,760
change and first let me be with it

126
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,320
as it

127
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:11,320
is and is there anything about how you might be calmer and more subtle

128
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:17,960
may be clear with your mindfulness that that teaches you some

129
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:23,760
way how you would like to be in the world with other people

130
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:33,600
to meet them with calmness with subtleness to meet them with care and

131
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:41,080
clarity so that you can be friendly or

132
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:48,000
caring so that you can have space to be well wishing for them

133
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,159
you have the time to gaze upon others with good

134
00:28:55,159 --> 00:29:01,240
will may all beings be

135
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:08,120
happy may all beings be

136
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:13,559
safe may all beings be

137
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:20,720
peaceful may all beings be

138
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:30,240
free and may each of us live our lives to contribute to that

139
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:48,080
[Music] possibility thank you

140
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,250
[Music]

141
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:42,640
so welcome to this fifth talk that introduces the topic of insight and today i would like to

142
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:51,200
emphasize that the classic teachings on inside meditation are offered for a purpose or

143
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:58,559
to say it differently that um uh inside meditation

144
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:06,799
uh is designed for a particular for a purpose maybe you can say many purposes

145
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:13,120
uh but the purpose to institute to in instigate a certain degree of change

146
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,720
transformation within us and uh the most classic buddhist uh

147
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,440
purpose is to become free of suffering to become free of attachments and

148
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:31,200
clinging and it's a remarkable goal in how thoroughly it changes the

149
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:37,200
foundational operating system of a human being is it amazing uh that this is

150
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:44,159
possible and that people experience this other people will see it as more

151
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:51,640
modest goals purposes to live without stress is a common thing in these

152
00:31:51,640 --> 00:32:00,000
days mindfulness is offered as stress reduction uh to understand oneself better to be

153
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:07,120
more self-accepting to be uh to just to get settled enough and see clearly enough to

154
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,480
be able to see the world with eyes of love and kindness so there there's many

155
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:20,799
many purposes people can have but the the purpose is to have some transformation and change and so part of

156
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:27,679
the practicing inside meditation is to have some sense of what purpose you have

157
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:33,039
for it um do you have a vision for how you'd like to change how you'd like to

158
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:41,200
be different do you have a sense of what what why you're doing this practice and um it's not necessary to

159
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:47,440
have that that when i there was a period of time when i practiced that i didn't know why i practiced i just knew that i

160
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,760
was doing it but uh sooner or later when as inside

161
00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:01,360
practice one of the foundational element of it is to have a a uh a directionality

162
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:08,640
a purpose a a some motivation for doing it that's more than just being present

163
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:14,799
in a clear full way um it's uh it's to

164
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:19,840
uh have a transformation and uh it's kind of a

165
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,039
meant to be a natural motivation a natural inclination

166
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:31,840
uh this desire to to change that's no different than if you have a thorn in um

167
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:39,840
you know a finger that you would maybe want to pull it out if you have a thorn in the mind um

168
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:48,080
it's a kind of a natural to want to pull it out if possible and um so uh to see this as a

169
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,919
natural thing having some desire to change some desire to take out a thorn

170
00:33:53,919 --> 00:34:01,679
it does not mean that we're caught in detachments that we're caught in desires that we're doing an uh unddist thing

171
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:07,079
where we are not supposed to have any desire just to be with what is in a naive

172
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:13,280
way no the the purpose of being present for uh way things are to be with things

173
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:19,240
as they are is to serve a larger purpose and the purpose is to become

174
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:26,960
free free of attachments free of stress free of uh uh you know distracted mind

175
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,520
an agitated mind so e everyone each person will have a different maybe a

176
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:38,000
purpose uh and um but uh it does involve

177
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,839
knowing ourselves well enough to recognize that there's something here that we want to change and

178
00:34:44,839 --> 00:34:51,520
transform and um and it doesn't take a lot of you know self-awareness to

179
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:57,280
appreciate that we have some foibless we have some things that we're not necessarily proud of or not necessarily

180
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:03,599
so happy or about it because it's not healthy or it's actually harmful maybe

181
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,720
it's not dramatically harmful but while it's happening it's actually kind of um

182
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:15,480
a drag that it's going on or you know it doesn't feel like we have we're in full

183
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:21,280
integrity and um and so one of the descriptions of what happens in practice

184
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:27,800
meditation practice is that um uh it can be you can be described in an

185
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:35,119
analogy that um say that you're driving a car maybe it's a nice you know it's a

186
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:40,839
jeep or something across a really dirt bumpy dirt

187
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:46,160
road and uh and it's difficult to go because it's bumping a lot and you shake

188
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:54,160
king the car and bumping and and you try to drive slow enough but it's still you know jarring to go up and down and uh so

189
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:00,079
it's hard to do so at some point you figure out uh you know little bit of a

190
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:06,400
solutions you get a really soft cushion to sit on and that makes it a little easier but it hasn't changed how much

191
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:13,200
the car is jarring and bouncing around and uh but then lo and behold you

192
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:19,880
come to a paved asphalt road that's completely flat and smooth maybe newly

193
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:25,240
paved and it goes "ah it's so good to be off the all the bumpy dirt

194
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:31,200
road." but then you notice that that you hadn't noticed before that there's

195
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:37,200
something a little bit wobbly about the axle of the car and in fact every turn of the wheel

196
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,560
there's a little jar a little bump a little knock that goes on and u doesn't

197
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,839
seem so good for the car doesn't seem so safe and it um it uh but you you

198
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:53,920
wouldn't have known that that little knock and little u uh you know hiccup of

199
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,359
the of the axle uh was there as long as you were on the road that had all the

200
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:05,119
bumps and everything you needed to be off it to see it and and then you maybe

201
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:11,839
fix the axle and then you go back onto that dirt road and it turns out now the dirt road isn't so bad that some of the

202
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:18,960
difficulty you had was because of the wonky axle so in this analogy as we live

203
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,560
our busy life active life you know a lot of thoughts a lot of concerns preoccupations

204
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:30,480
um it's difficult to see uh the axles we have that are wonky that

205
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:36,480
ways that we are little bit off and so the purpose of samadei and mindfulness

206
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,680
meditation is to calm down get quieter and as we do that we start discovering

207
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:50,800
what we didn't see before that something is not quite aligned something's not quite right and um and and then maybe we

208
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:57,200
settle that we get the axle fixed and we get uh it isn't just like a one-time

209
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,240
thing then we got quieter still more focused and then we see there's another

210
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:08,800
area where it's now we're quiet enough still enough to notice another axle that's a little wonky and so it could be

211
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,560
progressively the process of deepening in inside deepening in samadei reveals

212
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:20,079
deeper and deeper areas of attachment of clinging that we have and this is not

213
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:25,760
bad news this is actually good news because we can only free ourselves or we

214
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:32,960
can only transform what we know and see so to the degree to which uh practicing

215
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:39,520
uh mindfulness practice brings bad news in that we see ourselves more clearly uh

216
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,560
we should really learn to see that as good news ah good i see it now this is

217
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:50,960
what i have to include in my practice i don't want to go back onto the really bumpy road so i don't even see what's

218
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:57,400
going on deeply inside of me i want to kind of really practice with this the best i

219
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:03,280
can and um so part of the uh doing

220
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:09,839
insight meditation is to have some sense of purpose that supports you to go

221
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:15,839
really deeply in the practice to be able to address and meet all the ways that uh

222
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:23,119
your inner life is challen challenging or challenged and um and to be able to then

223
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:28,880
hold it in a good way in a beneficial way and one of the ways is to be able to

224
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,760
be with it in a relaxed spacious way uh where you don't see that having an inner

225
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:40,720
foable is a crime or having some kind of anger or attachment or clinging or

226
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:47,599
strong desires uh makes you a wrong person uh this is what human beings do

227
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:53,119
what what's really healthy is to see it and know it it's really healthy then to

228
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:59,680
hold it in a spacious way and not use it as a dart to

229
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:05,280
criticize oneself to make on to judge oneself because what the mind is doing

230
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:12,400
or producing and um and then to have a desire for change to be motivated for

231
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,720
that change and most importantly to be willing to

232
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:25,119
change to kind of be open and and prepared to not uh hold on to the most

233
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:32,480
cherished attachments most cherished ways of being most cherished ideas of comfort um so that we can't really do

234
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:40,720
this deeper work of going into um uh all the dark corners of our mind and hearts

235
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:48,400
so part of uh purpose of insight is transformation is transforming changing

236
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,640
freeing aspects ofelves ourselves that we feel are not so useful to have not

237
00:40:53,640 --> 00:41:01,839
helpful that bring suffering to us bring distress to us bring um debilitating

238
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:07,520
emotional pain to us of some sort and um and in the process of that

239
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:16,079
transformation uh we also want to uh recognize not just what we would like to change uh in the

240
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:23,680
that because we want to get rid of it or not have it there we also want to recognize our potential the capacity the

241
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:30,560
seeds inside of us for healthy states of heart and mind for our goodness our

242
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:37,760
capacity for kindness and joy capacity for happiness and peace the capacity for

243
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:44,079
resolve and and uh truth and integrity there's a lot of goodness that

244
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:50,400
we can be developed through through insight so sometimes the insight practice reveals areas that we want to

245
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:56,040
shed sometimes in insight practice reveals the areas that we want to

246
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:01,440
grow and uh mindfulness is a remarkable remarkable

247
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:08,880
uh uh practice uh mindfulness or attention clearly seeing is kind of like

248
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:14,480
a light that um uh uh shines on what's

249
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:21,280
healthy it grows if it shines on what is not healthy within us it tends to take

250
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:28,480
its nutrient away and um the nutrient is comes in the darkness uh when we have

251
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:35,760
the hindrances we don't see what's going on and how we're feeding the hindrances but when we uh have light we stop

252
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,000
feeding it and they fade away if we see in the darkness we don't see our

253
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:47,760
goodness but in the light we can see it and more we see that it tends to grow

254
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:54,800
so this two-fold transformation that insight instigates or supports and um

255
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,839
fading away what doesn't serve and bringing forth more of what does serve

256
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:05,359
without it being so intentional or it's not an engineering project a lot of it

257
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:12,000
has to do with seeing clearly and appreciating the intention

258
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,880
for a transformation appreciating a ch a possibility to change to

259
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,960
improve and to quote again uh suzuki

260
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,319
roshi the founder of san francisco zen center one wonderful attitude to have

261
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:35,200
for all this is the idea that you're perfect just the way you are but there's

262
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:43,119
room for improvement and part of the practice is to allow for that improvement of ourselves

263
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:50,000
so um with that we've offered you some foundational aspects of insight insight

264
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,760
meditation practice and how it works and um next week uh we'll start getting into

265
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,440
it uh where there's a more direct introduction to um five different forms

266
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:08,240
of insight areas domains of insight that um that come into play as we practice

267
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:15,160
and it's useful to see these different areas so that um you can see more clearly what's

268
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:21,400
happening so thank you and i look forward to continuing
