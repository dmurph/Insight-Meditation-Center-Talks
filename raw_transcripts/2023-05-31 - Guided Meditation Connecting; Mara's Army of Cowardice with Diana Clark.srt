1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:08,519
good morning good morning everybody those are just joining I guess everybody on this continent it's

2
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:16,020
morning but if you're on other continents it's not morning so good day whatever time it is or even if

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:23,119
you're listening to this you know when it's not live sometime later but uh

4
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,960
just greetings

5
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:54,660
okay so I think we'll get going here

6
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:02,280
so this morning I'm going to continue on this uh theme of Mara's armies

7
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,280
but before we get there we'll do a guided meditation

8
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,380
click in our meditation posture

9
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:24,780
and if you're sitting up tuning into this sense of

10
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:32,298
a brightness in the body the sense of

11
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,758
moving through space upwards in some kind of way

12
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:53,600
and letting this be the container for experience

13
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:00,020
in whatever way that makes sense for you

14
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,920
yeah so we have some uprightness

15
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:16,040
but there's also softness and ease

16
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:51,799
and connecting with an acknowledgment that to practice is a movement of kindness

17
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:59,220
to come to this meditation maybe to put hellos in the chat

18
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:06,200
is a movement of kindness can we connect with that

19
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:19,340
this well-wishing for others and taking care of ourselves

20
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:38,099
this giving of care respect

21
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:46,760
to ourselves and to others this is a beautiful thing we're doing

22
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:10,040
and then just connecting with the experience of the body more generally

23
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,620
using a light and curious attention

24
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,080
what is the experience of having a body

25
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,638
the experience of the body

26
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:50,599
whatever is there tuning in

27
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:57,680
showing up for that experience

28
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:04,280
as best we can as best we can

29
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:35,340
touching experience with this kind and delicate attentiveness

30
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:49,919
and allowing the experience to be what it is

31
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,419
as best we can

32
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,138
not trying to force it to be different

33
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:11,419
not pushing it away or pulling it in

34
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,819
but allowing the experience to be what it is

35
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:52,440
it's likely the experience of the body includes the experience of

36
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,340
breathing

37
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:31,220
feeling this stretching at the end breath

38
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,979
on the release of the stretch with the out breath

39
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:03,440
again with this kind and delicate attention

40
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:11,240
noticing the transitions between in-breaths and out breaths

41
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,319
inhales and exhales

42
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:06,860
letting experiences come and go

43
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:11,420
arise and disappear

44
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,040
making room for whatever shows up

45
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:35,420
might be sounds maybe a line Body Sensations

46
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,000
might be thoughts

47
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:52,519
can we just simply acknowledge the experience

48
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,620
and gently kindly Begin Again

49
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,480
with the sensations of breathing

50
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:35,300
nothing needs to be a problem

51
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,200
in this spacious awareness

52
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:59,120
as best we can we acknowledge the experience

53
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:07,639
and gently begin again with the sensations of breathing

54
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:19,339
in a relaxed easy manner

[Music]

71
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:22,679
good morning good morning again so today I'm continuing on this theme

72
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:28,020
of these letters a story of letters that

73
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:34,080
Mara is writing to the leaders of his armies he has 10 armies

74
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:40,559
and these are set in contemporary times these letters were written from by um

75
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:48,120
Jean punadamo of the arrow River Forest Hermitage in Northern Ontario Canada

76
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:55,140
and so they're kind of a Whimsical but they have a little bit of bite also these letters and in particular the

77
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:00,840
letter I'm going to be talking about today but before I go into that we might just

78
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:07,620
a reminder who is Mara and Mara is this character that shows up the Buddha to be

79
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:14,220
when he's sitting underneath the Bodhi Tree and has made this commitment that he's going to become a weakened and

80
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:21,659
before Awakening he's the Buddha to be is visited by Mara who is accompanied by

81
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:26,820
10 armies so there's a number of different versions of this story of the

82
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:32,760
Buddha's Awakening but uh I'm just focusing on this one and this character

83
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:39,120
Mara and then as I've said before I'd like to emphasize that in this tradition

84
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:45,179
Mara is not this demon that wants people to go to hell or anything like that

85
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:50,640
more Mara to encourage complacency

86
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:56,399
so he doesn't care if we have tons of central Pleasures in fact he would prefer that that we are having such a

87
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:04,620
fantastic time with our life that we don't even consider practicing to finding a way towards greater freedom

88
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:11,279
so the story of Mara versus the Buddha is a story of complacency versus

89
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:16,380
commitment to practice it's not a story of good versus evil

90
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:21,659
I just want to emphasize that Mara is perfectly happy if we are having a

91
00:33:21,659 --> 00:33:26,760
fantastic life and so we might ask well how can we use

92
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:33,059
these stories these things that you're sharing Diana what relevance do they have us for our practice there's a

93
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:40,559
number of them and one is that it can help us recognize our common Humanity

94
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:47,640
these stories are applicable to all of us and so when we find something that

95
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:52,919
there's letters and one that I'm about to share is resonates with us we can

96
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:59,460
recognize oh everybody experiences this it's not just

97
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:05,640
me and there's a way that there can be this lightning of the load when we realize oh

98
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:11,280
yeah this is part of the human experience and not only does it maybe lighten our

99
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:18,000
load it also helps us to have compassion for others recognize or yeah others have

100
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,878
these same difficulties too and they may be showing up in a particular way because they're

101
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:30,118
experiencing these difficulties okay so with that as an introduction to

102
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:37,260
these letters today I'd like to talk about this letter that Mara is writing

103
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:42,960
to one of his armies the armies of cowardice

104
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:49,080
and this one has a little bit of a um I don't know a little bite to it at

105
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:58,339
least it did for me when I was reading this and so I'm again I'm excerpting this um

106
00:34:58,339 --> 00:35:06,660
has written the letters are longer but I'm just excerpting there them for this so here's Mara writing to the leader of

107
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:14,280
the army of cowardice okay my sixth Army you have a special place

108
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,980
in the task of keeping beings in a state of bondage you weaken the beings whom

109
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:26,579
you attack and render them vulnerable to my terrible aspect

110
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:34,020
I prefer to charm and Delight but I will tolerate No opposition and those few who

111
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:42,180
fail to be seduced by my charm must be terrorized into submission

112
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:48,480
physical cowardice is useful in its place but it is the spiritual and moral

113
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:54,359
type of characters that is the most suitable for our purposes beans must be

114
00:35:54,359 --> 00:36:01,260
cajoled into clutching at a sense of security

115
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:07,560
this is the trick we must play of course you and I know there's no

116
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:12,780
security in this realm and all beings are subject to this awful realities of

117
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:20,780
birth sickness old age and death but no matter the dream of security is a hopeless one

118
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:28,440
but it is powerful beans everywhere are afraid to ask to

119
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:35,760
I'm sorry are afraid to risk what they have and can be seduced to this spiritual impotence by that fear

120
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:42,780
so encourage beings often not to take risks

121
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:48,540
because if they risk they may grow and if they grow they may awaken and then

122
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:55,320
they will be out of their clutches to be sure it takes great courage to

123
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:04,140
plunge into the emptiness and this we can undermine this is after all the golden age of

124
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:10,079
cowardice we can make we can encourage them to

125
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:16,380
make a virtue of their cavities call it Prudence call it responsibility

126
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:21,660
and with that they will get up every morning put on their hats and take this

127
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:28,200
Subway to their dull grind of a job and carefully plan for their retirement and

128
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:33,660
by that time they will be so beaten down that they will slide easily and

129
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:42,380
thoughtlessly the rest of the way to the Grave while never escaping our clutches

130
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:50,220
to reading this it kind of feels uh it's very uncomfortable to read this at least it is for me

131
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:56,720
this idea that golden age of characters and that we have to take risks

132
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:06,240
and this letter to the army of cowardice is pointing to how this we need some

133
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,820
courage we need some courage in our lives and some courage on our practice

134
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:19,859
we might say courage is this capacity to face fear because it's true that as long as beings

135
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:25,520
have something to lose as long as we are exposed to risk and

136
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:31,740
uncertainty that fear is a part of The Human Experience there's no getting away

137
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:38,700
from it and even though we long for this security this wish to not have any fear

138
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:46,500
the truth is that humans are vulnerable and so we will always have a little bit

139
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:53,940
of fear this is sometimes a really difficult pill to swallow but there's also a way

140
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:59,520
in which it's helpful to align with the reality of what it means to be a human

141
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:05,940
and so this stereotypical idea of Courage is this hero who stands up to

142
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:12,380
this beast and we might even say that we have this in this story of the Buddha

143
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:18,480
standing up tomorrow who has these 10 armies and some versions of this story

144
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:24,240
have these armies as 10 different types of bees so the mara didn't want Buddha

145
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,880
to awaken so he brought his army to attack him but that Buddha stayed

146
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:36,540
and practiced and became awakened despite these threats and despite the

147
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:42,720
attacks and we can't you so again

148
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,000
I don't want to like wash over this idea that humans you know that don't have any

149
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:56,099
fear and we shouldn't instead we need a little bit of Courage because no matter how confident or Brave we are or how

150
00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:01,980
many advantages we might have risk is in the essential component of our life as

151
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:07,500
we know it and we're all aware of this accident disease embarrassment

152
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:16,280
humiliation loss failure not to mention old age sickness and death

153
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:25,079
but maybe I'd like to add on to this also that there's this courage that we need to grow

154
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:31,020
sometimes this courage to expand this courage to change to feel Joy

155
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:38,780
to experience the beauty to love the world to love ourselves

156
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:45,119
in spite of all the ways our lives are endangered

157
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:51,540
spite of all the risks um in this human existence brings to us

158
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:57,780
some everyday courage is needed not

159
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:04,619
ation right one of the core teachings is about the truth of suffering and to part the

160
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:11,040
first Noble Truth right there is suffering and it takes some courage to recognize this suffering

161
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:17,220
obvious suffering the way that our lives are at risk in our experiences are

162
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:25,079
ever changing and can't be reliable but also the really subtle suffering

163
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:31,920
a subtle unreliabilities subtle ways in which we're really want

164
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,960
something to be completely stable where we can finally relax

165
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,540
like oh okay I made it but this subtle suffering and maybe it's

166
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:50,220
not so subtle sometimes this way question oh we can't have like this spiritual

167
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:55,740
retirement so it takes courage to do something

168
00:41:55,740 --> 00:42:02,760
other than this habitual way of Turning Away From The Suffering but to acknowledge it and to treat ourselves

169
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:08,640
with kindness and care and to bring our wisdom to the way that

170
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:16,200
we work with this suffering and work with the difficulties but in a way that's appropriate for us to turn

171
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:21,900
towards them and to not turn away

172
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:26,180
which we so often do I know I do

173
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:35,040
so this courage to be with the suffering and so how do we develop this courage

174
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,320
well we often come to meditation practice thinking that it will lessen the

175
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:46,140
difficulties that we have and that will gain some wisdom and gain some new understandings and maybe we'll even have

176
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:52,560
some cool meditative experiences but for all the reasons that we choose

177
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:58,319
to meditate practicing with courage is probably not something that was on the

178
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:06,000
top of our list and yet practicing with courage is a big part of

179
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,520
this practice maybe sometimes it's under the radar but

180
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:17,579
it is what's happening the courage to face things about ourselves

181
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:23,400
but maybe we don't want to face very difficult

182
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:29,339
the courage to face things one more time that we've seen countless times before

183
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:35,400
but to look again and

184
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:42,240
and then Buddhist texts don't really have anything specific to help us with courage but there is a connection

185
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:46,940
between courage and Trust

186
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:52,619
so is there a way in which we can connect with something bigger than

187
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:59,040
ourselves taking the refuges doing meta practice

188
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:04,760
doing any devotional practices that feels comfortable for you

189
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:10,020
and then maybe I'll end with something that brene brown writes in her book the

190
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:16,980
gifts of imperfection brene Brown writes courage is a habit

191
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:22,440
you get it by doing courageous X it's like you learn to swim by swimming

192
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,359
you learn courage couraging

193
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:35,760
and so with that I leave you with this letter from Mara to his army of

194
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:44,180
cowardice an encouragement encouragement for us to find the courage

195
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:50,300
in a way that's appropriate for us honoring and respecting our experience

196
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:58,500
honoring and respecting where we are in our life trajectory and our life story

197
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:05,700
we don't have to jump into the most difficult but is there a way that we can meet

198
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:10,980
some of the difficulties as best we can

199
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:15,740
you learn Courage by encouraging

200
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,859
thank you
