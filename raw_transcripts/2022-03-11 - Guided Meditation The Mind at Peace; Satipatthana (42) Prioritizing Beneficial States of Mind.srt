00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:08,960
hello and warm greetings for our time together here with

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,360
the practice of mindfulness as the practice of satina the practice

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,279
of mindfulness deepens there becomes a shift

4
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,400
that arises because we develop a reference point

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,840
that tends to be very different from how life is usually lived

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,200
mine in daily life it's very easy for the mind to be

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,040
racing around in thoughts to be pushed around by our feelings

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,120
desires aversions to have mind thinking can have stress

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:56,960
connected to it it could have unethical thoughts inclinations

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,600
all kinds of things that can be that are not necessarily for our own well-being

11
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,720
and some way or other we learn through meditation not some way but as we deepen

12
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:15,040
in the practice a reference point of a mind that's possible to be peaceful

13
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,200
a mind that's possible to be spacious non-reactive

14
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,240
that feels harmonious that feels like a valuable place to come

15
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,360
home to to rest in to be with a mind that is not stressed

16
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:40,400
not pushed around by the emotions and desires and aversions we have but the mind that uh can

17
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,600
see it all recognize it uh in a way that's does not cause by any of it

18
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,360
a mind that doesn't cling to anything but sees everything

19
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,119
and now when we have that reference point when we see that difference then

20
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,159
we know something that's valuable we know what direction to go

21
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,200
we know where to arrest the minor what to prioritize in the mind

22
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,879
that to go back to picking up the resentments that we were simmering about

23
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:21,520
or the fantasies we were kind of lost in is a diminishment or as a not the best

24
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,640
place for ourselves to rest in we know something better it's not to be this necessarily

25
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:33,840
dismissive or or aversive towards um certain states of mind

26
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,280
but it's just we know something better if you're walking down the road on a

27
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,760
rainy day and there's a puddle of mud ahead with your

28
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:52,959
clean new shoes we know that it's probably a little bit nicer to keep the shoes clean and so we

29
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,400
walk around the puddle and don't get mud on it it's like that's simple

30
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:05,440
so as we sit today today we'll just sit now and i finished speaking in silence

31
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:12,319
but see if you can find either through a memory or through some hints or some clear connection

32
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,319
a reference point for a state of mind that

33
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,400
is beneficial is valuable to rest in a state of mind where

34
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,720
thinking does not become obsessive thinking becomes calm and quiet

35
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,760
maybe even thinking becomes unnecessary because there's a state of peacefulness

36
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,840
or ease or calm or openness clarity

37
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,120
non-reactivity um that uh

38
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,480
state of rest for the mind so whatever it might be for you some reference point

39
00:03:52,480 --> 00:04:00,879
and keep that reference point close by kind of uh lean into that place support

40
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:08,239
that allow it to grow and as your breathing perhaps breathe with that reference point

41
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,680
and as you do so two things might happen

42
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,680
one is that you might that reference point that place that reference state of mind might grow and develop and help the

43
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,840
mind become more at home and settled and calm and the other thing that might happen

44
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:34,320
um is that um you can't do it but you begin to see clearly

45
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,600
what it is you're doing that uh maybe interferes with or

46
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,440
is uh uh you know uh uh the direction that's going that something is going a

47
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,960
different direction you learn about your tendencies of mind and habits of mind

48
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,759
and as you learn about yourself things that are taking you away from that reference point and no need to be upset

49
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,360
no need to be critical learn the art of seeing that clearly

50
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,160
peacefully so with that i propose that today we'll just sit

51
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,800
quietly with no preparation you've heard a lot of me for these months and will sit quietly

52
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:23,800
and then i'll ring the i'll say the final words of dedication at the end

53
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,840
so

54
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,679
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

55
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:02,278
if you look back at the last minutes of the sitting

56
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,520
what states of mind have been prioritized

57
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,440
by your mind or by yourself

58
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,399
has the mind been in charge and taking you down the highways and byways of

59
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,320
thoughts ideas reactions

60
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:30,720
or have you taken charge in remembering to relax into

61
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:36,480
a beneficial state staying in touch with staying in contact

62
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:43,720
with a place of peacefulness or calm or openness

63
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,760
a state of mind which is not centered on thoughts

64
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:57,960
but rather is open at ease

65
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:03,000
what's which has your mind prioritized

66
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:13,159
and might have been possible for you to have more prioritized

67
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:23,080
tuning in being attuned to the place where the mind is peaceful

68
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:42,799
and one of the advantages of doing this is that the peaceful mind

69
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:49,039
is the mind through which it's easier to have

70
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:55,600
non-reactive good will love

71
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:02,880
which is generous but not needy a compassion

72
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,440
which cares but is not troubled

73
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,840
so as we come to the end of the sitting

74
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,880
with whatever love you have that's generous

75
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:33,440
compassion you have that cares but it's not troubled whatever good will you have

76
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,880
that is easy and peaceful

77
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:46,399
to dedicate the benefits from this sitting the learnings from the sitting

78
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:56,240
the reference points that we've learned to dedicate it for the welfare and happiness of others

79
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:02,559
to wish and hope that whatever we gain is shared with others

80
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:08,799
shared with the whole world so it's not only us that benefits

81
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:13,919
but through us the world benefits

82
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:21,039
may all beings be happy

83
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:27,120
may all beings be safe

84
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:33,679
may all beings be peaceful

85
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,000
may all beings be free

86
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:46,000
and may we have a state of mind from which we can contribute to that as

87
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,080
a possibility

88
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:05,160
[Music]

89
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:15,679
thank you so yesterday we

90
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,640
had a shift in this teachings of sati patana

91
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:26,559
in the second half of the third foundation and it's a shift to

92
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:34,559
a state of mind that is an outcome of cultivating awareness

93
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:41,279
an outcome of no longer prioritizing states of greed hatred and delusion or

94
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:46,480
thoughts or attitudes of greed hatred and delusion and all its subsidiary kind

95
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:52,240
of common ways in which we get caught in thought

96
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,760
limited by our thoughts and thinking where we are excessively focused

97
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:03,039
on objects of awareness objects of attention

98
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,960
if um you know if if

99
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,640
i suddenly started thinking about how it'd be nice to replace a carpet at home

100
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:21,919
and uh then i'm very mindful of the carpet here at imc the i'm focusing on it and i'm so

101
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,960
studying it that i even lose touch with what i'm talking about to you

102
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:33,279
because that becomes the important thing is to you know the object of attention becomes

103
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:38,799
carpets and but in that focus on carpets i'm

104
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:44,640
certainly present and mindful for it but that's not really the the arising of of

105
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:52,720
awareness which is free awareness which is present for things but knows its presence not lost and

106
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:59,200
caught up in the activity so this uh mindfulness begins developing

107
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:05,360
uh strong and stronger there's uh the sense of awareness is

108
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:11,760
is not limited or bound by what the object of attention is

109
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:20,480
and as awareness keeps developing that sense of awareness not being bound or limited but being larger is partly

110
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,520
represented by a sense and under feeling a sense

111
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,960
knowing that we know we know we know we're aware

112
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:38,240
the awareness is not submerged in something the awareness is kind of like the lotus growing out of

113
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:44,320
the muddy water the lotus is not blossoming underwater in the mud it

114
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,839
comes out of the water to blossom so the mind the awareness blossoms

115
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:55,040
and becomes kind of spacious and the important point here

116
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,320
that i want to emphasize is the mind is no longer caught or preoccupied

117
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:06,640
with thoughts with feelings emotions with reactivity with the world

118
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:13,839
it now the mind becomes uh much more uh infused with this wider

119
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:20,000
kind of awareness this presence this attentiveness some people might call it a broad sense

120
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,040
of being conscious of experience where the sense of consciousness is kind of broad and

121
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,800
inclusive and so at some point the the um

122
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:36,000
the then the mind there's a shift in it of what gets prioritized

123
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,560
rather than prioritizing our preoccupations with what we want to get and what we're angry with or upset with

124
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:49,280
or afraid of we begin prioritizing a state of mind which is peaceful or

125
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:55,359
calm or useful and in that calmness and that peacefulness there isn't that kind of

126
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:01,920
narrow tight limited attention on some particular thing the awareness now be feels broader more

127
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,960
expanded and so this shift in the third foundation

128
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:12,480
begins when one knows an expanded mind as an expanded mind

129
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,760
and one knows a mind that's not expanded as a mind that's not expanded

130
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:24,800
so when we begin to sense that the the the size of the mind can be a large sense of mind or spacious or even

131
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,079
boundless sense of the mind or the mind is in fact limited and constricted and

132
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:35,440
preoccupied in something and so this idea if mind under stress is

133
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:41,599
limited and sometimes as the mind begins to open up um we can feel the places where the mind

134
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:47,920
or the body the brain is tense and you can feel how that creates a limit or a boundary

135
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:55,520
or a constriction for this open awareness this open presence and consciousness

136
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:01,520
so at some point there's a shift where we have this as a reference point

137
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,440
this possibility of a calm peaceful more expansive awareness

138
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,720
and and that's a nice reference point but even better is to begin prioritizing

139
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:19,040
it especially giving it at least slightly more priority than the mind's

140
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:24,720
inclination to prioritize the unhealthy states of mind that we go into

141
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,160
and might say that i don't prioritize but the mind will do it for you

142
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:36,560
and we get pulled into this world of preoccupations and concerns that can be quite stressful

143
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:42,800
uh what about prioritizing the peaceful mind the calm mind or the open mind

144
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:49,920
and um and uh not to hold on to it not to make it an object not to con constrict

145
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:56,320
yourself around it but rather to kind of rest in or open to or allow

146
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:02,480
it would be a little bit like someone wants to go swimming in a wonderful pool

147
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:09,920
of water but they're you know maybe they're on their cell phone talking some animated engaging or

148
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,920
upsetting conversation they're completely absorbed in the conversation and so they walk right into the water

149
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:22,960
into the and the water gets deeper and deeper and deeper and maybe suddenly so there's a ledge and that there's no more

150
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:29,040
ground in it but they're so concerned with the phone call they're not paying any attention to

151
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:35,040
floating and so they drown but um you know as we get a sense as we

152
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:41,359
go into the water of consciousness we have a sense that we can there's also floating they're swimming there

153
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:47,920
and so we prioritize floating enough just like that person on the phone should not have the phone in the

154
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:53,040
water probably but would at some point prioritize floating in the water if there's no

155
00:38:53,040 --> 00:39:00,640
bottom and so we prioritize this kind of wider state this peaceful place

156
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:08,640
as we do so and it develops and gets stronger at some point there's a we can know a

157
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:15,200
mind which is unsurpassable and we can know a mind which can be surpassed

158
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:20,240
or a mind that's ultimate and a mind which is not

159
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,800
you know ultimate and what this refers to is the states of enlightenment states of realization

160
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,920
that this movement into this open awareness calm peaceful states

161
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:39,200
can grow and develop and at some point there's a

162
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:46,079
it feels like oh this is ultimate there's nothing better than there's something higher than this because

163
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:51,680
in this state there's zero suffering zero stress zero tension

164
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:57,520
um zero fear nothing that kind of limits it

165
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:04,480
and so there can't be anything more ultimate than this because um there's no abs it's so peaceful there's not nothing

166
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:11,440
that disturbs it no there's not even a self that we're preoccupied or caught up in or

167
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:18,400
or or contracted around there's not even any kind of

168
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:24,800
ripple of self-concern and so it feels it feels so ultimate and

169
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,319
now that this becomes another reference point not just a peaceful mind but now a mind

170
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:36,160
that is so free of suffering that this becomes a powerful reference

171
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,280
point where we know what's possible we know it's possible to live and have a mind

172
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:48,160
and live this way that's this kind of radical freedom and um and then

173
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:55,040
the next sector's one knows a a steadied mind as a studied mind when

174
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:00,160
knows an unsteadied mind as an unsteady mind this is knowing

175
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:06,079
that there is that mind that's peaceful has no ripples on it that's so peaceful and my nose when

176
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:11,119
there's ripples on it and uh so after some very deep kind of

177
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:18,000
realization experience practice still continues but now there's a reference point of what it's like to

178
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,880
have no ripples and so we're much more sensitive to the subtlest little ripples in the mind or the big ones

179
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:32,480
and how there's subtle prioritization of preoccupations concerns and where there's still a little bit of attachment

180
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:37,920
and then the last thing it says in this one knows a liberated mind as a

181
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:44,160
liberated mind and my understanding of this is that that this is a mind which is fully

182
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:50,240
liberated that somehow the uh all roots of attachment all that have

183
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:56,880
been pulled out there's no more attachments nothing no more tendency for the mind to cling

184
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:02,839
and um and that can be known uh

185
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:10,240
and so this is the ultimate the final goal of satyapathana is this kind of liberation

186
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:15,440
and so this third foundation does describe the whole path of practice in a certain way

187
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:21,760
and and and then we'll go on to the fourth foundation which

188
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:27,680
presents that path in a different perspective and the third foundation is from the perspective of

189
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:34,000
um the mind states that we have so um one of the things i'd like to

190
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,280
leave you with in this third foundation is this idea of two ideas that you have

191
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:45,119
reference points and the idea of prioritization what reference points do

192
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,800
you have for a state of mind that is valuable for you really precious

193
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:59,040
that's that is certainly maybe better than some of the alternative ways your mind

194
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:04,560
functions in in maybe some of your life maybe something you attain in meditation

195
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:10,319
or experience in meditation or some other times and how can you beneficially use that as

196
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:16,800
a reference point many ways and one way is to give a certain kind of

197
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:24,000
prioritization to that state of mind don't take it for granted don't think that it's only available in certain

198
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,119
verified states like meditation the more you experience it maybe there's

199
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:34,640
hints of it maybe there's the smell of it or small clues of it

200
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:40,880
maybe it's always present to some degree and and so maybe

201
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:47,119
you can prioritize it or or or let it inform you let it support you

202
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:53,760
in being free and relaxed and present more often than you do an interesting exercise is to go through

203
00:43:53,760 --> 00:44:00,720
the day or the end of the day review the day like write the autobiography of the day

204
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:06,640
based on what the mind was prioritizing and see if

205
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:12,240
you know did you have to prioritize that was that really to your best interest

206
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:20,400
and could you have done different prioritization so that something else could have blossomed so your lotus can blossom out

207
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:26,160
of the muddy waters so thank you and

208
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:32,160
next week we'll start the fourth foundation and so if you didn't follow and well enough

209
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:39,040
this third foundation the fourth foundation as i said does a similar thing from a different angle

210
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:43,920
and through the angle of insight

211
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:50,880
and then um finally so we have for the next days until monday

212
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:56,960
imc is doing this fundraiser for the refugees from the war in ukraine

213
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:02,480
and um i think it's a quite a powerful thing when a group of people gather together

214
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:09,440
to support and raise funds to support people suffering in the world i believe it's beneficial for them but

215
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:15,200
it's also beneficial for others that see this being done to see that there are caring people who

216
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:21,119
are engaged and collectively to make a difference and now so if you're wondering where how

217
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:27,040
you could support the the

218
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:34,640
people of the ukraine when the tremendous suffering they're experiencing right now invite you to join its imc effort

219
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:40,000
and the way you learn about it where you can do that is to go on imc's website

220
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,079

221
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:51,440
