1
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:14,000
so good morning everyone and welcome to our meditation time together

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:22,800
and i'd like to offer you a little exercise today

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:31,599
and now it's not meant to have you be busy but actually help you maybe become quieter and attentive

4
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,800
tranquil and alert and

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,920
as you know a big part of mindfulness practice is

6
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,440
being mindful of the present moment and the question is

7
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:55,120
how long is the present moment and i'd like to propose that

8
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:02,079
independent of any logic that you might use or other things that

9
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:08,640
the present moment certainly can be seen as in an instant

10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,560
it could also be seen as uh some little span of time

11
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,479
maybe a second there's a sense of as we are present

12
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:26,720
mindful of now of this moment there is a sense of some continuity of

13
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,360
the moment some fullness of the moment some uh span of the moment

14
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:40,799
and um it's not exact it's not in different contexts that span might be

15
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,840
different but it's partly this length the span of it is

16
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,960
related to the knowing that is aware that this is the present

17
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,000
moment that um

18
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:02,240
that uh you know it's kind of like the timeless moment that's there for a

19
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,800
little while as we're here as we're present but then mind wanders off or maybe it doesn't feel like a timeless

20
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:17,040
moment but it feels like um it's a a um as we say what's happening now

21
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,400
and there's a little kind of pause or little opening that little

22
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,520
amount of time to take in now and so the question is how long

23
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,120
is your present moment how long is the now for you

24
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,920
and it'll come and go it'll be there for a few as long as it is

25
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,120
and something will happen and and uh you know you

26
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:55,200
reset it you find it again and you find it again and there might be even a sense that you're in a river of time

27
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,760
and that you're kind of somehow maybe um kind of i don't know you're you're in

28
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,280
the current of it for a while and in an eddy or in a current of it for a while then

29
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,959
maybe you've you've gotten stuck on a branch sticking out from the shore of

30
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,239
the river or and then you're back in the current and but the current how long is that current

31
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,920
or the present moment for you and and if you if you're interested in this

32
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:31,040
exercise maybe um you can um try to do it in such a way

33
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:38,159
that the mind becomes quieter stiller tranquil and alert

34
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:46,080
maybe because the mind that's tranquil and alert that's not trying to think about this

35
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,020
is [Music]

36
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,879
the one that reveals the richest feeling the richest sense of this

37
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:03,599
moment now so to take a

38
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,959
alert posture

39
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,840
and gently close your eyes

40
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:29,840
and to take a few long slow deep breaths

41
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:50,479
relaxing as you exhale maybe extending the exhale

42
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:57,240
a bit to allow for a deeper relaxation

43
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,680
and letting your breathing return to normal

44
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:23,520
and then see if for a few moments you can give yourself over

45
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,160
to relax further maybe each time you exhale

46
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:37,440
relaxing the muscles of the face those muscles can fall away from the

47
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,520
skull maybe

48
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,479
it's held in place by the skin

49
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:57,680
no work on your part to keep your face together

50
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,319
softening around the eyes

51
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,919
the forehead

52
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,000
relaxing the shoulders

53
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:50,919
maybe relaxing down the arm and into the hands allows the shoulders to relax further

54
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,560
softening in the belly

55
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,919
deep relaxation the belly the torso

56
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,960
to relax the body

57
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:46,720
is to begin to abide peacefully

58
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,479
here and now

59
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:10,599
breathing in and exhaling relaxing the thinking mind

60
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,400
letting the thinking mind become quieter

61
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,840
maybe thinking is slower

62
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:39,200
maybe thinking has pauses between the sentences or

63
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,839
images

64
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,680
okay

65
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,839
and then to center yourself from the body breathing

66
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:53,200
noticing where on your body is its easiest

67
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:59,399
to experience the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

68
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,040
or where in the body is it most pleasant

69
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,720
to feel the body's experience of breathing

70
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:02,720
and if you're aware of breathing in the present moment

71
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,920
how long is that present moment

72
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:15,200
how long are you in the knowing of the present

73
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,680
moment

74
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:29,320
is it brief touching in is it somehow extended

75
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:39,240
through time through a timeless time

76
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:59,600
and how long is the present moment if you're relaxed

77
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:07,680
at ease with it a leisurely present moment

78
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,320
being with your breathing

79
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,440
to be mindful aware

80
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,079
attune to this present moment

81
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,959
is an attunement to the present moment

82
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:54,480
that's independent of past and future

83
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:03,199
independent of time just now

84
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:10,959
paradoxically for the duration that your mind can rest

85
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,839
in this moment

86
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,240
hello

87
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,080
so

88
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:16,400
and within this present moment for however long it

89
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:24,559
extends for you personally there is change

90
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:32,440
the breathing the body experience of breathing changes

91
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:45,039
like a current in a river

92
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,720
always in the present

93
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:09,120
or like standing on a bridge over a river and looking down in the timeless present

94
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,880
the current keeps flowing

95
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:50,799
relaxing into the present moment is to relax into the

96
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,360
current of change

97
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:02,120
perhaps experience these most easy

98
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:10,600
in the changing sensations of breathing through the inhale and the exhale

99
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:54,919
relaxing and settling into this present moment

100
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,480
maybe near this after sitting for these minutes

101
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:11,840
maybe there's a better sense of an extended present moment

102
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:22,000
not something we search for but something with

103
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,039
which within something within which we rest

104
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,559
trust

105
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:42,799
the gentle current flow river

106
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,880
of the present moment

107
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:58,080
forever long it lasts and then again

108
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,080
and again

109
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:50,320
and as the sense of the present present time

110
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,559
becomes more extended and relaxed and open

111
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,799
we have the greater capacity to know

112
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:10,240
to sense to feel others

113
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:17,398
and our connection to others her response

114
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:29,600
and may our ability to be present for others be present for

115
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:37,440
ourselves in an open extended way no hurry

116
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:46,960
may it be a time for respect and care and

117
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:53,200
a deeper attentiveness

118
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:00,080
to the full humanity of all of us

119
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:13,440
and may this deeper connection be the wellspring of our care for the

120
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:20,799
world a care which is simultaneously a caring for what's best

121
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:29,200
in ourselves may all beings be happy

122
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,600
may all beings be safe

123
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,720
may all beings be peaceful

124
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,679
may all beings be free

125
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,799
and may our attention ability to pay attention

126
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:04,840
support us in making this a better world

127
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,320
[Music]

128
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:22,319
[Music]

129
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:34,120
[Music] thank you

130
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,679
oh

131
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,039
this

132
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,679
so this week

133
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:50,559
i'm taking the time to talk about the five descriptions of the dharma in the famous expression

134
00:31:53,279 --> 00:32:00,840
the dharma is well spoken by the buddha

135
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:07,440
it is visible here and now it is immediate

136
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:16,320
it invites us to see it is onward leading

137
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,720
and to be known by the wise

138
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:29,120
and so today this idea that it's immediate that pali word is akaliko

139
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:36,240
a k long a l i k o or a

140
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:41,679
and it's um the etymology of it is

141
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:47,919
not in time not of time and so

142
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:53,440
some people will translate it as timeless but that suggests something that

143
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:59,120
that's a wonderful experience if we leave it just as an experience experience of being in a

144
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:04,880
timeless moment but sometimes when the word timeless is used

145
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,440
it goes along with some idea that there's some there's a transcendent place that

146
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,480
very far removed from this world here kind of a transcendent consciousness or

147
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:22,840
something and at least that's how i hear some people talk about

148
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:29,279
it uh it um probably a little bit more literal

149
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:35,200
meaning is rather than timeless is not of time

150
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:42,159
in the sense of being immediate and and when the buddha doesn't when buddha

151
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:47,760
kind describes what he means by akaliko this knot of time

152
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:54,799
he refers to it as the ability to be with the present moment

153
00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:00,799
as it's changing as it flows as it arises and passes

154
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:08,398
and this ability to really be in the present not in the static present but the

155
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,679
dynamic present that's how it's immediate

156
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,960
so that's how it's and out of time because the immediate flow

157
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:25,358
in the moment it takes it takes time takes a little more different more complicated

158
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:32,878
or active activity of the mind to have a sense of the past and the future and to bring it into the present

159
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:40,158
but the present by itself and um and so with it it's in the it's a

160
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:47,440
dhamma is a kaliko the dhamma is not of time because change the seeing of change is

161
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:54,560
immediate it's it's a part of the immediacy of attention here and now

162
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:00,960
and um and of course you can argue that well whenever there's change

163
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,000
there has to be some sense of time but

164
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,359
but if you say immediacy in the immediate present really there

165
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:18,240
then there is the sense of watching flowing with the changing nature of time

166
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:24,240
but what do i find even more interesting about this um you know

167
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,359
alcalico this immediacy the immediacy of now the present moment

168
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:36,079
is that the human sense of how long the present moment is

169
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:42,000
variable i would say that for myself if i'm playing ping pong

170
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,359
the present moment is quite short but if i'm

171
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:53,119
laying on the lawn in the park on a nice day looking up at the sky at the drifting of

172
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:59,680
the clouds going by the present moment kind of has a feeling of being more

173
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:05,200
extended more relaxed than uh the rapidity of the present

174
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:12,160
moment in ping-pong and um and so there's a

175
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:18,880
it's somewhat subjective this experience of what is the present moment how long is it

176
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,000
how long has it extended the

177
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,920
william james the american philosopher called the president referred to the saddleback of the

178
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,599
present moment you know rather than being like that it's last briefly for a kind of a

179
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:40,960
saddleback it and maybe i don't know it comes and then it goes

180
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,960
like the bottom of a wave maybe a trough and so um

181
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:52,079
and it does it extend up the sides of the trough of any period of time or is it just the

182
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:57,280
very bottom of the trough and i think his idea is it extends somewhere in some

183
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,400
indeterminate way up the edges of the saddle and

184
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:10,320
something like that so but again what i find most interesting is that

185
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:16,400
how we live our life it can be seen in relationship

186
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:23,359
to our sense of how long this present moment is that when there's greed

187
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:29,680
when there's fear anxiety panic when there is um uh hatred

188
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:35,599
these are emotions that want something to happen right now or fear afraid of something that's going

189
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:42,400
to happen now and so of sometimes there's a quickening of the mind a quick hitting sense of

190
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:48,160
time quickening reactivity and the faster the reactivity

191
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:53,680
it's kind of like ping-pong it's the faster the reactivity the impulsive activity

192
00:37:53,680 --> 00:38:00,160
the um you know the the shorter the moment is

193
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:05,359
uh and when there's a very short moment with that very like rapidity of things

194
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:10,640
uh we might not even be aware of time or the timeless present we might not be

195
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:17,599
aware of the you know what's really going on more importantly though i think

196
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:24,160
is that as that sense of time becomes a little more extended and more leisurely there's more space for the moment to be

197
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:29,200
there and so the present moment you know the with the trough of the wave

198
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,800
becomes wider um then there is more opportunity

199
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:41,040
for some of the deeper reactivity responses emotions that we have

200
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:47,119
that are don't come from reactivity but come from some deeper wellspring

201
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:52,400
within to operate and i think so i in my sense vikkan is

202
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:59,359
not so not to make an absolute case for this but generally

203
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:04,960
things like greed and hatred

204
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,160
anxiety

205
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:19,920
i are kind of needed for human beings in order to be able to respond quickly

206
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:26,400
to threats to what's going on that have to be immediately taken care of and maybe that's one of the reasons why

207
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:33,119
these emotions began for human beings evolutionarily but when they're chronic in us and

208
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:41,280
always there it kind of leads to kind of stress and and kind of a rapidity and a fast mind

209
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,960
and a spinning mind and probably a kind of tendency to create a lot of cortisol maybe even

210
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:53,200
adrenaline stress in the body stress systems in the body stress hormones

211
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,800
and and those limit our capacity to feel

212
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:04,160
the emotions the attitudes that have more to do

213
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:10,880
with um being relaxed being at ease maybe maybe have more to do

214
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:18,160
with um oxytocin or serotonin or different kind of hormones and chemicals in us

215
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:24,720
that require maybe a different kind of relaxation and ease to come forth

216
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:31,599
and so qualities like generosity and love and kindness and friendliness

217
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:36,839
these these feelings belong to the world of extended

218
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:44,960
time where there isn't the rapidity and it's kind of like again if you're

219
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:53,280
you know really maybe caring for someone who maybe is

220
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,319
distressed or hurt or maybe someone a child is hurt that

221
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:04,000
maybe the child is not hurt that badly but is upset then the parent or the adult who's there

222
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,880
maybe the person who's there it's just there an extended way caring

223
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:17,680
giving lots of time and space not kind of like you know tapping the finger and saying you know get over it you know and

224
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:24,800
yes i care for you and stop it because we have important things to do it's like okay now we're here

225
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,160
someone who's dying and we're accompanying their death we're just there

226
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:36,640
and uh and hopefully peaceful at ease extended sense of time or when i've been with

227
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:42,640
people who are dying the present moment seemed very extended like timeless present everything had

228
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:48,160
stopped i'm just there and i'm tapping into something or what's

229
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:55,200
arising inside of me is very different than if i'm driving my car in a crowded freeway and

230
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:02,000
late for something and it's smoggy and trying to find my quickest way that i need to get to where i'm going

231
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,280
that that tends to elicit all kinds of other emotions feelings then care and love and

232
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:15,119
generosity so this idea of the akaliko the immediacy of now in this

233
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:22,000
practice the dhamma is immediate it's now but in this extended now

234
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,560
in this more available and present relaxed time

235
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:35,440
and i don't know if it's okay to say a leisurely present moment and not because we are kind of basking

236
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:41,920
in luxury with the leisurely present moment but rather the relaxed and open here and

237
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:47,280
now with this allows for some deeper wellsprings of our life

238
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:53,119
to appear that cannot appear if we're

239
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:59,680
in the rapidity of greed hate and delusion the wanting the monkey mind that's reaching for the

240
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,960
next branch before it has as soon as it grabs one branch it's

241
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:13,520
reaching for the next branch if our mind is that way always reaching going going going it doesn't give a lot of room

242
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,720
for some of the most valuable parts of who we are and um

243
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:27,119
the valuable parts that don't seem to have any obvious monetary value or obvious status value or obvious

244
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:33,440
obvious value and getting what we want maybe from life but this deeper place

245
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:38,960
that has lots of

246
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:45,440
time for time where we give we have a lot of time

247
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:52,560
for the immediacy of now for this moment and this moment just seems to be to extend

248
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:57,760
and maybe even extend and become longer and longer and

249
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:04,720
then how long can it last this timeless now for you

250
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:09,839
so the dhamma the dharma is immediate

251
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:16,400
it doesn't belong to time and how long can you rest in this timeless moment

252
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:23,359
and can you extend it and what are the benefits of that for you and so i would suggest that this would

253
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:29,200
be a great day for you to experiment with this um take take time

254
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:36,720
to do this take time maybe even put a timer on your on your if you have if you have a like clock you

255
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:42,079
can time maybe once an hour or randomly or something

256
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:49,760
through the day experiment with giving more time making room a

257
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:56,880
pause to see if you can and experience the extended present moment

258
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:03,760
you know if you're playing ping pong stop playing or the equivalent stop doing it and sit down and let there be an

259
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:10,640
extended pause maybe as you have a cup of tea or something and see what's available to you that's

260
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:16,960
different than in the rapidity of some of the things that we're doing what happens what shifts in you

261
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:24,480
what comes so the dhamma is akalikos

262
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,760
immediate is

263
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:36,000
now is not of time

264
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,160
so thank you and and

265
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,440
we'll continue this tomorrow

266
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,920
foreign
