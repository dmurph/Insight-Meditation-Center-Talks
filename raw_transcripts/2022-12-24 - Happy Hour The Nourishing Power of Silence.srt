1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:06,020
so hello everyone hello and welcome to happy hour

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:12,780
um or the theme for for this evening's practice I wanted to

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:18,199
um actually do a revisit of what we did on Wednesday

4
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:24,779
on Wednesday I introduced taking refuge in silence

5
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:30,300
as as an act of care as an act of self-care and love

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,300
and many of you uh reported that that was really calming and soothing that

7
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,579
exploration of of a mostly silent said

8
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:48,719
as an expression of Love meta self-care so um it was so yummy and delicious that I

9
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:58,680
thought let's do it again especially during the um the uh holidays such a busy time that it

10
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,040
can be for for many so especially nourishing to take

11
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:10,200
refuge in silence in peace so

12
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,840
that's all I want to say to frame it and then the rest of it I'll just lead in

13
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,360
the guided meditation so so make yourself comfortable in your

14
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:29,540
seat Landing arriving in this body

15
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,540
In This Moment In Time

16
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:58,259
ah releasing releasing the body releasing

17
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,200
any tightness in the neck shoulders

18
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:13,099
forehead jaw letting your eyes rest

19
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,360
letting your heart rest

20
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,000
feeling your seat on this earth when your feet

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,280
and this Earth were rooted make the breath find you

22
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,640
let the breath find you when you find the breath

23
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:46,680
as if the breath is playing the music of life

24
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:54,739
and this body and this heart playing the scales most beautiful music

25
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:58,760
the music of Silence

26
00:04:51,060 --> 00:05:00,680
putting down whatever is not necessary it's this thought necessary right now no

27
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:07,080
gently putting a gun taking refuge and

28
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,919
breath in the silence and the Peace of release

29
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:15,979
release release

30
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:31,039
taking refuge in silence

31
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,940
loving the silence loving oneself

32
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:45,180
this is an act of self-care self-love self-meter

33
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,940
nothing more rejuvenating more delicious than

34
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:44,279
and this the silence and if thoughts arise gently

35
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:51,920
releasing them not now thank you I'm engaging in self-care

36
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:58,200
just this breath in this body

37
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,860
right now

38
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:24,800
foreign

39
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:47,300
relaxing and receiving the breath it's an act of self-love self-care

40
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,399
and if the Mind needs more support

41
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:41,600
it's okay to offer the phrases of meta to yourself as an anchor

42
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:49,040
may I be safe may I be happy

43
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:56,399
may I be healthy and I have ease

44
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:03,600
but let the words be light so light as if it is a whisper of Silence

45
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,100
stay with the feeling

46
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:35,179
or maybe just the words with your breath say

47
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:43,400
breathing in happy healthy

48
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,260
breathing in ease

49
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:13,200
and if there are a lot of thoughts it's okay don't be disheartened it's the nature of mind to think to like

50
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,559
to think

51
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:24,080
release let go smilingly

52
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,539
hold the breath the silence dear

53
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:43,039
falling in love with the silence if you're falling in love with yourself

54
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,860
not now not now your thoughts are right still I'm not now

55
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,740
foreign

56
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,679
thank you

57
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:26,299
turning your gaze inward into the body Sensations

58
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:33,260
to support stability and silence Within

59
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,500
foreign

60
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,559
relishing silence embracing non-doing as an act of

61
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:46,100
self-care and meta in this moment right here in this body

62
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,899
inviting the attention to be right here with the breath right now

63
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:25,320
as we turn the end of our sitting

64
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,340
practice together

65
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:39,320
appreciating yourself or having shown up as best as you're able to

66
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,580
letting go of the outcome

67
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:51,899
planted seeds embraced silence

68
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:57,000
inner and outer as much as was available [Music]

69
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:04,980
that's it your work is done the mind was wandering or planning

70
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:13,740
remembering emotions are rising Etc it's okay

71
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:21,620

72
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:27,179

73
00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:32,220

77
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,100
thanks everyone

78
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,720
so tonight I was embracing the silences an act of

79
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,750
self-care every visit revisiting

80
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:25,500
[Music] the theme from two nights ago and yet I intentionally provided even

81
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:30,740
less scaffolding tonight less than

82
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:36,480
I think it was less or at least that was the intention

83
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,540
um I'm wondering what what you discovered what a rose for you

84
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:48,419
you can type your Reflections in chat if you want to everyone if it's to everyone

85
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:54,358
I'll read your name if it's to me privately I will only read the reflection not your name

86
00:34:54,359 --> 00:35:00,540
you can also raise your Zoom hand if you haven't spoken recently

87
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:09,380
uh you're invited if you have spoken recently I invite you to pull back and allow other people to pull forward

88
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,140
foreign

89
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:23,460
as a way to support yourself and others one of you says thank you that was

90
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,380
wonderful you are so welcome

91
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:36,920
it's quite sweet to sit together in silence as a self-care

92
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:45,300
Stephanie says it was both calming and chaotic yes both both and both and

93
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:52,619
appreciate you holding both yeah and usually the calming

94
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:57,960
nature of the set can support the chaos Within

95
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,578
the chaos that's happening

96
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:15,000
one of you asks how to relate this practice to Christmas well

97
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:22,800
foreign Christmas can be a very very busy time

98
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:30,240
and sometimes self-care goes out the window because we're running around

99
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,700
like headless chickens so taking Refuge

100
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:42,359
um in silence just sitting doing nothing for a moment just being with the breath with their

101
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:49,200
body as an act of self-care as a as a true Act of caring for ourselves

102
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:55,440
is how it relates to Christmas it's an act of care and another way it relates

103
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:03,960
is um by caring for ourselves in this way we can become calmer have a longer fuse not

104
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:12,359
they should refuse to actually be loving to others to be loving to others and that's the

105
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:18,680
spirit of Christmas kindness generosity Spirit of generosity

106
00:37:28,339 --> 00:37:34,440
one person shares it usually is calming to have silence but tonight I didn't use

107
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:39,800
the opportunity wisely no problem forgive yourself

108
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:46,260
move on it's all right and just the fact that you showed up and

109
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:52,680
sat in silence as much as possible yay yay to that don't underestimate the

110
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:59,000
impact of sitting in in sanghae even though there was a lot going on internally

111
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:09,300
Charles Lee shares was able to turn towards an old Dark Knight of the Soul memory with self-compassion ah oh sweet

112
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:17,220
thanks for sharing that especially turning towards it with self-compassion yeah

113
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:23,099

114
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:27,560

117

Suzanne oops

118
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,359
I'm trying to keep the ones that are sent to me uh private but sometimes I

119
00:38:54,359 --> 00:39:02,040
slipped so just finish this when the person says just finish the solstice Retreat oh yes

120
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:07,200
no worries that was okay thanks thanks Susan one person just finished the

121
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:15,839
solstice Retreat so this meditation was synergistic on the retreat when I felt confused or

122
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:23,220
uncertain I heard your voice saying you know how to do this a simple meta it was supportive thank

celebrate Nikki mess with with my family as well as Christmas

126
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:44,280
um another person shares remembering some traumatic events but silence was

127
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:49,619
calming and I wasn't as activated as I might be experiencing self-compassion

128
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:56,400
beautiful such beautiful Reflections tonight thank you all ah lovely

129
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:03,540
oh more and more is coming uh yeah the idea of being in love with

130
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:10,020
myself is is wow powerful another person says when I focus on my

131
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:15,420
breath I start controlling my breath how do I stop this and just observe the breath

132
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:20,579
as it is the what can be supportive is to

133
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:28,440
consider um the two words actually three words relax and

134
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:35,040
receive relax and receive so keep relaxing keep relaxing

135
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:40,680
keep relaxing and keep receiving so that there's not this sense of focusing on

136
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:47,760
the breath going out and capturing the breath but just receiving the breath become becoming receptacle to receive

137
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,640
the breath become receptacle

138
00:40:55,020 --> 00:41:01,380
another reflection at the end of The Meditation I told myself when you plan for the future I understand that you are

139
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:09,300
trying to help I understand that you value preparedness and you wish to help me meet the challenges that the future

140
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:16,260
will bring thank you mind when you remind me of past missteps I understand that you're trying to help I understand

141
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:23,339
that you wish to help me avoid repeating those mistakes thank you Mike oh beautiful that is such a lovely

142
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:32,579
beautiful comeback passionate perspective to take to to a Wandering mind to offer it appreciation and Grace

143
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:38,339
and and and ah and release beautiful

144
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:45,240
it's such beautiful Reflections tonight coming out of the silence

145
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:50,820
one more person I was trying to let go of a relationship hurting me so much but

146
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:57,300
gracefully I was so sad but now felt so peaceful yeah

147
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:03,900
great that all can be both sadness Grace

148
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:12,140
and beheld the peacefulness of silence and all so powerful your reflections

149
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:18,720
ah it's also I realize it feels more peaceful when the reflections are typed

150
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:24,660
in chat and I read them out loud um it's

151
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:31,500
I feel like there is a calmness in the space that remains not that I I don't

152
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:38,220
like you raising your hand and saying them in your own voice but just observing uh given that the theme was

153
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:43,380
peace and quiet

154
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:50,220
yeah they'll go back to the person who asked about trying to focus

155
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:57,119
who focuses on the breath and starts to control the breath yeah really have the

156
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:03,180
sense of you're sitting in this this embodiment you're sitting in a

157
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:08,640
receptacle of ease and receiving the breath however it shows up just relax

158
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:14,460
and receive relax and receive so can be quite powerful and they might

159
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:20,520
seem like simple instructions but they can really transform the way we relate to

160
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:28,920
the breath as if we're going out and trying to grab it so dear ones Let's uh let's turn

161
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:38,099
let's turn our um attention to practicing together in

162
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:43,859
small groups and again maybe we just sit together in

163
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:49,079
silence tonight can be so powerful so powerful in small groups

164
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:54,720
just sit together in silence and maybe maybe a ward wants to come up be a word

165
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:01,319
or a phrase or a share comes up maybe not maybe you'll say something maybe another

166
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:07,800
person says something um I'd let sitting in Silence with others be

167
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:15,359
predominant and it might feel awkward it might feel uncomfortable do not rush to feel the

168
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:21,540
silence do not rush to feel the silence because we often do that with friends and family

169
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:27,000
instead of just holding space these folks you're sitting with they

170
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:33,060
know how to hold silence they're good at it they love it as much as you do so so

171
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:38,579
just hold silence together maybe for a few minutes and then if

172
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:44,640
words arise and keep your eyes open actually in the group keep your eyes

173
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:50,160
open and hold silence maybe you're doing silent meta for one another maybe you're

174
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:57,540
doing silent meta for one another no questions just if share comes up you

175
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:03,900
can share something and if not just hold silent presence

176
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:10,880
with one another how powerful how radical yeah the breakout group or groups are primarily silent tonight

177
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:18,240
enjoy take care of each other take care of yourselves okay here we go

178
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:23,460
and if anyone is willing to and oh it's seven o'clock but if anyone is willing

179
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:29,640
to quickly very quickly share uh what it was like to hold Silence with one another

180
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:34,680
