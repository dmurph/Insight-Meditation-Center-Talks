1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:09,120
hello and welcome and we're here to

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,040
do something relatively simple

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,279
to sit quietly

4
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:30,080
being attentive to our present moment experience

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:37,760
to make it a little bit more complicated we do it through our

6
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,960
direct capacities for attention capacities for

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,200
direct awareness through the senses of our body through our body

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,440
aware of the present moment through our body

9
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,000
where the present moment through our capacity to kind of

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,880
mentally observe or perceive what's happening in the present moment

11
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,320
the simple mental perceiving that's prior to stories prior to

12
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,720
interpretations prior to commentary judgments

13
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,960
staying close to this place of direct experience

14
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,600
immediate experience being simple enough to be there

15
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,119
and the part of the fruit of practice is to begin appreciating

16
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:45,360
this simplicity of being simplicity of attention settling into it

17
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:54,360
enough that we realize that some of the alternative ways of being

18
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,240
are less beneficial are less

19
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:08,160
satisfying that to get swept up in stories swept up in

20
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:15,520
analysis commentary judgments swept up into the future in the past

21
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,200
becomes less satisfying than the simplicity of being here

22
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,480
so it's not a matter of convincing anyone that it's valuable to be

23
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:33,599
here in a very simple direct way but rather for each of us to discover

24
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:40,239
that for ourselves by having enough connection to this present moment

25
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,840
that we notice we see we recognize

26
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:55,200
that the alternatives are not as satisfying maybe not even not as beneficial

27
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,519
not as peaceful happy

28
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:09,280
or not as insightful not giving us clear perception of what's happening

29
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,879
so you might consider this today that we're sitting here

30
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:24,080
to be to have a very simple presence to rest in a simple attention

31
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,640
just enough don't be does not be dramatic just enough to recognize

32
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,040
that when we lose it it's less satisfying

33
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:46,360
it's alienating we lose touch with ourselves we get into fantasy

34
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:54,080
we get into ideas of what is right and wrong and what should be happening and

35
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:01,560
we give rain to our anxieties our fears our desires

36
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,720
in a way that is not they might be pleasant some of things we think about

37
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,879
and do but pleasure is not the same as a deep abiding satisfaction

38
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:22,799
as if we're really at home in this universe and this at home in ourselves at ease

39
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,080
to be reassured with just being present here

40
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,639
that buddhist word for reassurance is the same as to breathe easily

41
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,680
to be able to breathe easily here and now

42
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,800
so to assume a meditation posture

43
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:56,680
that will support you in this simple present simple attention to hear

44
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,720
and to relax your gaze

45
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,400
you're looking at the screen then perhaps drop your eyes

46
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,520
downwards so you may be you're not gazing at it

47
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,120
and soften your gaze

48
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,840
and then maybe even close your eyes

49
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:41,280
and everything we need to discover the dharma for ourselves

50
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,000
is here

51
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,479
in the in your body your heart your mind

52
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:59,199
not to be figured out but to be revealed as

53
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,680
your attention gets simpler and simpler just here

54
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:13,759
so to enter this world where the dharma is found you can take a few long slow deep

55
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:20,800
breaths as if you're choosing to embody

56
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,520
your body

57
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:37,360
as if you're planting yourself here in the soil

58
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,360
of your physical experience

59
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,599
then letting your breathing return to normal

60
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,759
and as you exhale to relax your face

61
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,440
softening around the eyes

62
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,840
the jaw it might be helpful to let your lips

63
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,880
fall slightly open

64
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,759
and as you exhale to soften relax the shoulders

65
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,720
release the shoulders to the gentle pull of gravity

66
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,520
as you exhale softening in the heart

67
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,400
many times our desires and fears

68
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,199
take us out of our hearts

69
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,080
and to relax and soften back into the heart

70
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,080
and to soften the belly

71
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,680
to spend a lot of time with the belly tight and contracted

72
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:01,519
is often a symptom of not being present

73
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,279
but being concerned about other things

74
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:31,920
and then breathing normally with the exhale

75
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:40,080
appreciate the exhale the release the relaxing

76
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,480
the movements tingling as you exhale

77
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:08,240
maybe as the end of the exhale you can release relax

78
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,040
so that you exhale a little bit longer

79
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,959
without effort just relaxing

80
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,439
and as you inhale

81
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,360
appreciating the inhale

82
00:10:51,120 --> 00:11:00,600
and if it seems appropriate for you to center yourself in the body's experience of breathing

83
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,600
simplicity of attention with the breathing not ambitious

84
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:20,079
not trying to do a lot or attain anything as you sit here

85
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,120
except appreciating the simplicity of attention

86
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:35,200
here to the breathing [Music] to your body

87
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,200
to the present moment

88
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:49,120
and if anything takes you away from that maybe

89
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:55,279
there's a way of seeing it that you understand that it's less

90
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:03,279
satisfying than settling into a simplicity of being

91
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,399
where you have a chance to breathe easily

92
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,760
be at ease in a deeper way

93
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:22,360
just here in the simplicity of the present moment

94
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,840
as we come to the end of this sitting

95
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,640
if you have some appreciation for

96
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:51,760
some simple way of being present here and now for your experience for yourself

97
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,039
and how that might be better than the alternatives that your mind might

98
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:01,240
where your mind might take you

99
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,559
chances are that that alternative that is not as satisfying for you

100
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,200
might not be so satisfying for others as well

101
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,880
that maybe there's something about being at ease

102
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,919
assured confident settled in the

103
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,840
simplicity of our being

104
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:41,760
that is a gift for the other for others maybe it's a

105
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:47,760
way of helping others to be at ease around us

106
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,080
maybe it's a way for us to be more attentive to others in a simple direct

107
00:28:54,080 --> 00:29:00,559
way maybe it's easier for us to access

108
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:05,760
our care our love our kindness good will

109
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,840
maybe it's easier for us to experience the suffering of the world

110
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:20,720
without being swept up in some of the alternative ways of thinking and feeling

111
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:27,720
they're not so useful for us or for the world

112
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,440
and so as we come to the end of the sitting

113
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,399
perhaps there's something about how you are

114
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,919
having sat for these minutes

115
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:58,158
that can be your gift so you live this day or the next day

116
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:05,679
a little bit more inclined to contribute to the welfare and happiness of others

117
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:12,640
and may it be that growing out of our simplicity of being

118
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:20,480
that we live so that all beings may be happy

119
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:26,640
all beings may be safe all beings

120
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,679
may be peaceful and so that all beings

121
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,080
may be free

122
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,640
so today is the fifth talk on patience

123
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:06,480
and um in offering and today's topic is um

124
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,279
the patient acceptance of truth

125
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:17,519
or the acceptance maybe it means the basic the willingness or the openness

126
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:24,960
to stay close to the truth so patient acceptance of the truth

127
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:31,440
when i began this series i

128
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:38,240
introduced it by saying that i wanted to try to have the reference point for patients for this discussion

129
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:44,240
not a directive that just you know from 0 to 60 you should be patient without any

130
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,519
other context but rather that many of you have been meditating for

131
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:56,799
some time and have been in dharma practice for a long time and so the hope is that it has given you

132
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:03,840
some reference point for a way of being that is satisfying

133
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:11,600
that is worthy of staying close to some way of being true to oneself true to life to

134
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:19,360
and that this meaningful to stay close to and then a recognition that as the mind

135
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:25,440
the heart departs from that gets involved in other things other reactions desires

136
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:31,200
attachments addictions aversions resentments hostilities

137
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:37,518
fantasies fears anxieties

138
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,320
commentary complaining all kinds of things the mind does that

139
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,600
it's less satisfying than what we've tapped into

140
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:58,640
it's less meaningful it's less true and and so to be patient is not to overlay

141
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:04,399
patients on top of our experience not to bear down and tighten up and not react

142
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:10,880
but rather patience is staying true to what we know is valuable is coming

143
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,159
back and staying with it staying close to what we know as valuable

144
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:21,519
and not giving in to these forces of anger resentment

145
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:28,399
impatience that that might come along as dharma practice deepens

146
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:34,960
so does the contact our contact with something that feels truer and truer

147
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,399
our contact with uh deep sense of peace and ease

148
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:45,760
happiness well-being that can kind of well up from the inside

149
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,039
that's not dependent on the thing experiences in the world not dependent

150
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:58,240
on on what happens around us with other people not not this doesn't depend on getting a

151
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:04,080
raise at work or winning the lottery or it doesn't depend on

152
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:10,560
you know what other people do and but really it seems to well up from the inside out

153
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,679
and it's become something we carry with us a sense of well-being that um

154
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:21,679
ideally becomes strong enough that we're not buffeted by the experiences around us and we're not

155
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:28,960
dependent on the world around us to behave in a certain way or not dependent on people to be a certain way

156
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,398
because we carry with us the stability and this well-being

157
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:40,320
and so as that deepens and deepens uh we become more clearly aware

158
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,760
that what takes us away from it and we become more clearly aware that

159
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,599
this is true here that being less selfish is a true thing

160
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:57,200
and so the patient's acceptance of these truths of

161
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:04,000
this deeper well-being this the value and not clinging the value of not being hostile

162
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,720
the value of not being selfish self-centered the value of not clinging and holding on

163
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,240
to things these kinds of things are seen as being true

164
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:22,480
so in buddhism this kind of truth statement or true is less to do it's not propositional

165
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:29,280
truth so much but rather the truth of how we respond to and be with whatever is happening in

166
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:35,040
the world that we don't be with it with clinging or hostility we don't be with it by

167
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:41,040
overlaying layers and layers of stories and commentaries and reactions and bias

168
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:47,359
and so the patient's acceptance of truth is difficult sometimes

169
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:53,599
to stay close to the truth of non-clinging st stay close to the truth of

170
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:59,280
it's not worth getting involved in ambition

171
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,960
and busyness it's not worth getting so busy trying to save the world

172
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,320
from all possible catastrophes that we're not going to be effective

173
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:16,720
the so to be to to recognize all kinds of things we recognize that how we are

174
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:23,280
are not a useful good way of being and to be patient with that a patient acceptance of that

175
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:29,119
sometimes is the hardest form of patience because what we're working with now is being patients with these inner

176
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,720
impulses we have that that can be quite strong the

177
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:43,440
conditioning we have the the attachments we have and so to see that our attachments arise

178
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:49,839
and have the patience acceptance of what's truer so that we don't give in to our attachments

179
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:56,240
to see that the delusions arise in our mind biases arise in our mind and to see it

180
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:04,079
with the kind of clarity that they if this is not truth true what's true is not giving in to them

181
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:10,560
not being caught in them and so and there can be a tug of war it can be kind of like wait a minute uh you know

182
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:17,359
this is the this is how i've lived my life or this i won't be safe if i don't act this way or react this way

183
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:22,800
and so this patience acceptance of the truth and this goes deeper and deeper and

184
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:30,320
sometimes some of the deeper acceptances of truth have to do with

185
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:37,599
really being beginning to see how changeable how

186
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:43,440
inconstant how impermanent this world that we have as it is and

187
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:49,119
and that can be kind of frightening it's kind of like we want some stability we're gonna hold on to something

188
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:54,720
and so the patient's acceptance of not holding on not clinging in the middle of this world of

189
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,160
impermanence it can seem a little bit frightening but we've learned over time

190
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:06,240
that uh we you know it doesn't really work to cling it doesn't

191
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:12,400
really work to hold on tight it doesn't really work to resist

192
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:18,640
the changing uh nature of this reality we live in it doesn't work to try to keep yourself

193
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,760
young forever and um at some point

194
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:30,240
uh you know we can't hold on or cling we have to kind of patient's acceptance we're getting older

195
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,280
patients acceptance of these kind of basic human existential truths that we

196
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,760
at some point are put very close to directly to confront and and meet patients acceptance that we're

197
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:48,640
dying patients acceptance that there will be loss patience acceptance of

198
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:54,240
um even with loss that it's not worth getting

199
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:00,160
there's a ways of being that is simply not worth it that the reactivity to that we normally

200
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:06,400
what maybe we would have and we're being patient so we don't succumb to these ways of being

201
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:12,800
that we know we've learned are not useful not supportive

202
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:18,880
so in this way uh what i'm pointing to is that we're learning to become our own

203
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,400
reference point for practice we're learning to recognize in ourselves

204
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:30,240
uh what is valuable and what's what it's valuable to stay close to

205
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:37,760
so that when it's time when we need to be patient with ourselves it's because we know something

206
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:43,040
valuable we know something important and we've experienced it

207
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:50,560
and we might lose touch with it but our memory still says wait a minute i know that this reactivity i have is not the

208
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:56,400
way forward i think that at least need to be patient to not give into it

209
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,000
the patient's acceptance of truth is this acceptance that it's not uh is the

210
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,920
truth that this is not worthwhile doing so i'm not going to say what i'm going to want to say i'm not going to do what

211
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:14,560
i'm feel compulsed to do i'm going to be patient with this

212
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,760
and that occasionally these acts of patience requires a lot of

213
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,200
you know effort um you know say the pull to addictions

214
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:30,400
can be so strong the pull of desires pull of hostility the pull of things

215
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,160
have to be different and so it's okay to succumb to my anger or something like that

216
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,920
are so strong and one of the ways that one of the very interesting things to do

217
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:50,000
in being patient and not giving into it is to uh feel the strong compel sit and be

218
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,880
quiet maybe in meditation maybe sit down in the chair and feel the strong compulsions arise

219
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:03,200
and and that might they might come with a whole army full of lawyers

220
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:09,680
that tell you you have to act it has to be this way but sit with it all

221
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:16,000
kind of like a rising wave until the wave has crested and you find yourself in the back of the

222
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:22,079
wave and and then decide what the wise thing is

223
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:28,079
to do but when you feel the compulsion to act or to speak it's probably not the best

224
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:34,079
time to do so because chances with compulsion there is not wisdom and you're not

225
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:42,160
connected to something that you've learned is a valuable place to talk from or to act from

226
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:48,960
the valuable place of wisdom from which to participate in this world of ours

227
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:56,960
so this idea of being patient with compulsions because we know something be truer and we accept that

228
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:04,480
and so we don't act by the compulsion and then ride the wave until you find yourself on the backside

229
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:10,240
and in the middle of these compulsions it can feel impossible to wait it feels like it has to be now

230
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:16,160
but it's just a wave it's just everything has its time

231
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:22,720
everything has a half-life and will eventually pass away and to become confident in that truth

232
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:29,119
patience acceptance of the truth that all compulsions will pass

233
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:35,119
all attachments will pass if we allow them to and so

234
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:41,200
learning how to be patient and not giving in to them is um

235
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,838
you know is a gift for ourselves and the world

236
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:53,119
so patience acceptance of the truth so you might consider

237
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:58,920
today what have you discovered

238
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:04,240
that is more important that's more true that you want to stay true to

239
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:10,079
what have you discovered that's true that teaches you what not to do what not

240
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:15,520
to say what not to react to not as not because you're and you're not

241
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:21,119
not you're not avoiding reacting that way or speaking that way as repression

242
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:26,480
but rather because you know the opposite is true that

243
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:33,280
that you lose yourself in the reactivity that what's most true about yourself is

244
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:39,839
is not found through that reactivity that can feel so compulsive

245
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:47,040
what do you know what have you discovered that's true for with by which or for which it's

246
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:53,040
useful to have patience acceptance and um

247
00:43:53,040 --> 00:44:00,680
so thank you and um one more talk tomorrow on patience
