1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:08,360
yeah good morning everyone welcome to IMC and to our time

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:15,520
together and I'd like to begin with an ancient analogy that

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:21,240
um Buddhist analogy and that is that of using um

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,039
picking up a quail little bird and bringing it to

5
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,758
safety and the idea is that the analogy is that you don't want to hold the quail

6
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:41,840
too tightly and you don't want to hold the quail too Loosely so neither forcefully nor laxly

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:50,360
neither with stress or strain and not with u hesitation or or kind of

8
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,399
complacency or something it has to be just right just

9
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:01,399
between those two so in the same way uh the Buddha says that when we make effort

10
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:08,320
in doing Buddhist practice it should be kind of like holding that Quail so

11
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,439
neither too much effort or too little neither straining nor being LAX or

12
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,439
laxidasical neither uh stressful or complacent

13
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,720
they're just finding a just the right way and um and so in this

14
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:31,040
analogy uh what you're doing is less is isn't really

15
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:39,320
highlighted it's how we do it that's being highlighted and this is one of the principles of Buddhist practice that uh

16
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:47,159
more important than what you do it's how you do it and the how you do it then guides

17
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:53,119
actually what you do it's uh so that you do the thing which is ethical or

18
00:01:53,119 --> 00:02:00,680
appropriate or healthful healthy and um so uh so the how do it is

19
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:07,439
is so important that uh one of the principles in some Buddhist teachings is

20
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:14,480
that uh the the goal of the practice should be found in the means so the way

21
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:21,200
your practice should contain qualities characteristics of what the purpose of

22
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,599
the practice is the goal of the practice so for example if the goal of the

23
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:33,319
practice is to be peaceful then you should find uh some PE some sense of Peace in how

24
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:39,120
you do the practice and uh you don't get to Peace by straining or struggling or

25
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,879
being in conflict with something you find some way to be peaceful in the

26
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:52,280
practice if you want if you want to become a generous person practice

27
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:59,840
generosity there should be generosity in the very thing that you're doing uh if what you want is to become

28
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,319
is to not to cling then uh you should practice in a non- clinging way or it

29
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:13,440
should contain some quality it's hard not to cling but uh at least that should be an orientation that we don't cling as

30
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,120
you do it uh one of the ideas here is that the

31
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,400
most healthy thing you can do for yourself in a spiritual life is to

32
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,640
liberate the heart to liberate the Mind from all that uh cause of suffering to

33
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:38,239
yourself all the ways in which you cling or resist or shut down or push away that

34
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:45,920
um that are actually ways of causing self harm just because partly the very nature of clinging the nature of intense

35
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:51,239
resistance to ourselves some part of ourselves is um that in itself that is

36
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:58,840
suffering in and of itself and if we do some if we practice in an unhealthy way if we live in an

37
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:05,599
unhealthy way then uh that's the that's what we're setting up to be the goal or the

38
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:11,400
consequence so if we live with hate uh chances are that it just kind of

39
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,880
reinforces the hate if we live with love chances are that reinforces love and so

40
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:27,160
we want to be really careful so there we could say that's what love or hate but how we do anything uh we want to uh so

41
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,120
so um and one of the very important principles in Buddhism is the idea of

42
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,919
wholesomeness the idea of doing things in a Wholesome Way no matter what you do

43
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:46,479
do it wholesomely and what wholesome means it feels for our psychophysical system it

44
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:52,160
feels nourishing it feels healthy to do it and uh and that reference point for

45
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,919
health is something that is um somatic you can you can feel it you know it for

46
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:04,960
yourself in a very clear way and the the analogy I used like to I don't if it

47
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,759
works for all of you but um I've been maybe doing some heavy work in the

48
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:17,120
backyard gardening or something gotten sweaty and hot and tired and and dirty

49
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,680
and um and then I'll go Tak in a shower and I feel so clean like it's my my skin

50
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:30,280
kind of vibrates with a feeling of being clean and good and settled and I feel all warm or

51
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:37,160
or um or when I was a little when I was a small kid um I would take a bath and

52
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:44,319
at the evening before going to bed and then I would just put in my pajamas and slip into bed but my mother had um just

53
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:50,039
washed and the the sheets and so they were still warm from the dryer and that

54
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:56,319
was just so it just felt so somatically comforting meaningful healthy to kind of

55
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:02,240
be clean and into these warm sheets so I don't know if that analogy works for any

56
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,720
of you but the idea that's a sematic you can feel that what you're doing feels good for the heart good for the mind

57
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,919
good for the body and um and that's what makes it wholesome and uh that also then becomes

58
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,880
a guide for what we do because some things we do will never feel that way if

59
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:27,880
you lie it's just not going to feel that way if you are form if you are hating

60
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:35,039
someone or hating something it's just if you really pay attention to the sematic experience of it um it it deep down

61
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:40,440
inside or it's not going to feel comforting or meaningful or or healthy

62
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:47,479
even the only thing that might feel attractive is sometimes something like hate comes with a lot of energy and

63
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:54,080
comes with a lot of righteousness and that can feel good but if you feel those

64
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,240
they don't feel good in any deep way either even though there might be energy good some kind of being energized or

65
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:06,039
feel powerful or something that might have a good feeling but to have power from that if you really pay attention

66
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:12,440
will not feel wholesome so uh so this idea that uh and

67
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:18,479
uh the we want to pay attention to how we're doing things and um and the most healthy thing

68
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:25,560
you could do is become um liberated from clinging this is a core definition of in

69
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:31,960
Awakening or Liberation is that we no longer have the forces in inside of ourselves that are going to add this

70
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:38,199
kind of suffering stress UNH wholesome feeling for what's going on for us and

71
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:45,639
you can't find the wholesome results by doing UNH wholesome things so so the

72
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:50,840
idea is to use ourselves as the book use ourselves as

73
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:58,560
the guide for how we find our way by noticing how we're doing things how

74
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,759
we're doing it how doing it and um so one of

75
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,720
the uh kind of consequences of Bud of doing Buddhist practice is that

76
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:17,560
increasingly as we mature in the practice we have an increasing focus on how we're doing

77
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:25,319
things and one of the benefits of that is that you can then it's easier to bring the practice into our daily life

78
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:32,760
maybe at first you don't see what the connection is but as you continue practicing why if you if if meditation

79
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,518
makes you feel at home makes you feel calm peaceful gives you a healthy Good

80
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:45,399
Feeling then at some point it might occur to you why should I only have that kind of Good Feeling while I'm

81
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:50,480
meditating I mean you know the line between meditation and life is not that

82
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:57,200
sharp why not have that kind of healthy feeling everywhere I go and so then uh

83
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,440
for some meditators that's a turning point in their whole practice because then they have a reference point for how

84
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,839
to live their ordinary life so they're not sacrificing or giving up or

85
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:14,200
compromising that sense of well-being uh in their daily life as well and so then

86
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:21,079
the one of the tasks in daily life is how we want to do things how do we do it

87
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:26,120
that it's healthy how we do it that it's stress free or or diminishes the stress

88
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:33,920
how do we do it so that it creates a wonderful sense of Health wonderful sense of Vitality even that as we go

89
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,680
about doing it and uh oddly enough maybe that when I

90
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:46,440
had came to that point in my practice uh that's one of the reasons I went to live at a Buddhist Meditation Center because

91
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,640
I wanted to find ways to uh take what was happening in meditation and discover

92
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:57,519
how to live that my daily life and I thought by if I lived in a Buddhist center where that was the whole point or

93
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:04,160
the community was all doing the same practice that then somehow I'd find myself more able to bring the practice

94
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,640
into daily life and um but then I was in a Buddha Center so we meditated

95
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:15,360
more and so that wasn't exactly what I came there for but it was it was a nice

96
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,600
kind of consequence because then it became even more clear the difference or how to do this you know the meditation

97
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,880
deepened and then they had diff different reference point for done doing in daily life and and then uh and then

98
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:34,639
so then I wanted to do it even more and then I went from living at a Buddhist center to I moved to a Buddhist

99
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,959
Monastery and uh again not to meditate more but it turned out that if you go to

100
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:47,040
a Buddhist Monastery you meditate a lot more and um and so then there was this

101
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,440
wonderful kind of circular movement of meditation and finding out how to live

102
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:59,320
this in my daily life and apply it and um and so this idea then of of

103
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,600
finding you know the maturing of Buddhism has to do with the uh being

104
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,880
interested in how to find this healthy way of being Wholesome Way of being um

105
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,560
throughout our life you know why not and the why not is not answered by some kind

106
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:22,959
of moral dictum di rule or something but rather it's uh because the the reason

107
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:31,000
the whole you know is that to not do that hurts to not not do that is a drag

108
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,839
you feel how not to do that you you yourself are diminishing the quality of

109
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:44,040
your inner being your inner well-being that uh if you uh are doing

110
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:51,079
UNH wholesome things then you're you're you're kind of harming yourself in a certain way and if

111
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:57,760
you and if you can feel that self harm then why would you continue you know I mean of course some

112
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,560
people will come up good reasons but uh but uh but generally it's you

113
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:10,519
know why would you continue doing that and um and so that's the motivation even

114
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:15,959
for then stop doing the unhealthy things and what should you do instead well if

115
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:23,279
you're interested in a Buddhist practice you would search for the healthy alternatives of how to do it and um so

116
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:30,040
generosity instead of being miserly being uh loving instead of being hateful

117
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:35,920
being um being generous instead of greedy

118
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:42,199
being wise instead of foolish being equanimous or patient rather than

119
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:48,000
impatient or reactive so they're go the list can go on and on to kind of how we

120
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,519
what we're looking for and um and then at some point uh

121
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,639
with this whole process because Buddhism has this path to maturation maturing to become healthier and healthier in this

122
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:06,600
psychological spiritual way at some point uh the reference point for how we

123
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,760
practice is also affected by what we're discovering through the practice and at

124
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,399
some point there are three things that become the basis or the foundation for

125
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:23,279
how we want to do this practice itself and these three things are ways that the

126
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:29,240
goal is really found in the means and uh more and more as you practice the you

127
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,440
know you have the sense of this is possible to have this Awakening experience or something but then the

128
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:40,360
qualities of that what that is uh you turn back into how you practice so it

129
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,560
becomes the reference point for how to practice and that's immensely supportive me immensely

130
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:54,160
helpful and um so I'd like to offer you three of these qualities one is that uh you base your

131
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,880
practice on not depending on anything most of us so are constantly as

132
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:06,360
to go through life we're depending on something that we're kind of the mind is preoccupied with concerned with wanting

133
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:12,160
there's us some some condition that we want to get or avoid and which are very

134
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:21,040
n very nature of Consciousness very nature of the way we attend to the world attend to ourselves is is not depend not

135
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:28,040
independent not non-dependent but it's really dependent on wanting something not wanting something some condition and

136
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:34,800
the remarkable thing can discover through this practice is a way that our awareness our attention the way that we

137
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:42,680
attend the way that we are present for ourselves here that um uh it's free from

138
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:48,040
any kind of dependence on anything else of course we live in dependence on the

139
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:54,399
world and breathing and eating and people and Society in all kinds of profound ways important ways I don't

140
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:02,360
want to dismiss that but it's also possible to sit in meditation for for example or go to the local park and just

141
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:08,720
sit on the bench and kind of just just gaze upon the world there or

142
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,600
something and uh and um and feel like there's a way a sense of presence or way

143
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,800
of attending or paying attention that is not dependent on anything it's not

144
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:26,079
relying on anything not attached to anything not requiring anything to be any particular

145
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:32,480
way and uh and and have the opportunity and have the situation where you to let

146
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:39,160
go of all the things upon which we our Consciousness our mind is operating that at that moment is dependent on other

147
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:44,399
things and just be there is really remarkable

148
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,480
thing I traveled through from a different time zone yesterday so my my

149
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,639
whole six my little inner clock was kind of a little bit off I suppose and uh so

150
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:00,639
I woke up in the middle of the night and um and at first first my mind was

151
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:06,399
dependent on a lot of things it was a dependent on the idea that this is not

152
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:12,880
good it was you know if I don't get enough sleep then I have to give this Dharma talk tomorrow and you know I'll

153
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:19,680
just fall asleep during my Dharma talk and this will be bad my reputation's at stake and so you know so all these

154
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,959
things were kind of you know kind of operating maybe and uh and

155
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:33,240
um and then I you know was my my whole up operating system was operating under this assumption that I need to sleep I

156
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,680
should sleep I have to do what I need to sleep here and um and I've done this

157
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:45,759
enough times now to know that it's that it's not a helpful St position to be in it's not just like self-defeating almost

158
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,560
to have those those ideas and and so um I've learned to just lay there and um

159
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:58,959
and and try to be content with the moment and just I take it as a time for practicing and I'll lay there and I I'll

160
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:04,360
often first uh just relax my body usually if I really want to go to sleep

161
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:11,678
or think it's not right to be awake um if I pay careful attention I find that there's tension in my body um and

162
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:18,520
sometimes it's in my forearms it's very subtle uh sometimes around my chest sometimes in my face and so I'll lay

163
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:24,918
there and just kind of relax those things relax those things soften and relax and then I'll uh tune into my

164
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:33,039
breathing which has been a lifetime kind of practice of mine just just be there but as I do that I'm just seeing can my

165
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:39,360
mind uh operate without dependence on anything without needing to be any

166
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:46,080
particular way or have any values or purposes or fears that it's kind of the

167
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,280
foundation for the whole mental activity that I'm doing and eventually I this you

168
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,360
know it was easy matter eventually I could sit there lay there and just be

169
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:05,320
kind of oh I'm content nothing had to happen nothing had to be any different I was just awake and I wasn't tired so

170
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:12,520
that wasn't a problem um the only problem was the idea that I should be awake I should be sleeping but that was

171
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:18,240
just an idea so do I want to base my inner sense of well-being on an idea and

172
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,760
um so anyway so so then eventually I fell asleep and then I slept more than I

173
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,960
usually do and um so um so to to find a way to

174
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:37,200
practice where the practice is not depending on something not requiring anything to be any particular way is one

175
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:45,320
of the one of the characteristics of the practice becoming mature and that's the same as so so in terms of that being a a

176
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:51,880
um a quality of the goal The Awakening experience is the same way the the mind

177
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:58,799
that becomes free liberated in Buddhism is radically and fully now present some

178
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:05,120
people would say radiant um without any any depending on anything

179
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:14,400
whatsoever um and um so that's nice so so so those those

180
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:21,440
qualities then you know that's that's the orientation so I'm practicing now am I depending on something some people are

181
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,000
depending on getting concentrated life only if I get concentrated will it really work it count I have to get

182
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,799
concentrated well that's a depend end and state to be in um and other would be

183
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:39,240
wow my mind is really distracted I'm caught up in my thoughts so a dependent way of thinking would be I have to stop

184
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:45,120
doing this I have to be undistracted I have to be you know not so lost in my

185
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:52,760
thoughts well that's to be dependent if you ask yourself what is it to be nondependent here for a

186
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:58,760
non-dependent attention and you kind of feel your way into the answer the the

187
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:04,320
the consequence of that is you're kind of in the present moment rather than

188
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:10,679
trying to be in the present you find yourself way in the present so we'll get back to this point so I said there's

189
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:17,520
three three characteristics of the goal that are that we then find in the means uh the other one is

190
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,840
freedom and that is it's these are all related but for some people these

191
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:30,159
different words work better for others but now now what's we're we're we find it we recognize that part of ourselves

192
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,520
is free of greed hate and delusion part of part of who we are part of what

193
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,200
awareness is part of our heart part of our very being has some characteristic

194
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:47,960
of non- clinging non grasping non-closing down non um you

195
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:54,919
know non-grasping nonattachment and uh and ultimate

196
00:20:54,919 --> 00:21:02,400
freedom in Buddhism is a radical total complete letting go of every attachment we possibly have uh even at first it's

197
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:09,520
just temporary but it's really you know it's really kind of maybe it's a pun but it's

198
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:15,159
mind-blowing that that you know the degree of of uh the all attachments are

199
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:21,200
blown away and um the um and so now we're

200
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,400
finding that how you know finding some quality of non-attachment that's in the

201
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,679
nature of how the mind operates and we're building on that growing on that letting that non- clinging begin to

202
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:39,600
spread into more and more areas of our life it's one thing to have some sense of what it's like to not cling it's

203
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:46,360
another thing to be able to apply that to in all the circumstances and place that we live so part of the maturation

204
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:53,200
of Buddhism is the is the expansion of that into more and more areas of our life so then now practi is based on this

205
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:59,840
notion of freedom freedom from clinging and the third is peace

206
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:06,080
that uh that one of the primary kind of um emotional I guess kind of

207
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:13,080
characteristics of Buddhist Liberation is a very deep state of peace and so so

208
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,440
now there's a reference point to that peace and so is it peaceful is there

209
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:24,279
peace as I do this do I sit down and am I immediately kind of content in content

210
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:29,400
in a contentious mode of being with the world with myself my immediate L uh

211
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:35,159
focusing on what's wrong right here and I had to fix it uh instead when my those

212
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:42,240
things might exist but but the orientation is how do I do this peacefully where's the peace as I find a

213
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,960
way to change what I have to change how do I find peace with sitting Brea

214
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:54,000
breathing here and being practicing how do I find peace in a situation that's uh

215
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,080
may be very conventionally very challenging all around

216
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:07,960
me the um um I recently I I remember I was in a

217
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:14,039
situation where the people around me were having some major conflict but nothing was required of me I didn't know

218
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:20,080
them that was they were strangers it was a public place and so it wasn't really my place to get involved to you know the

219
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:27,480
anger and what was going on but it was kind of uncomfortable to sit there and so I just sat and I didn't close my eyes

220
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:34,600
I thought that would might be kind of weird for the people I was kind of sitting close to them uh but I didn't want to make any problems for them like

221
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:41,000
looked like I was closing the tune them out or something so I just kind of lowered my gaze and then I looked inside

222
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,559
and could I be peaceful as opposed to reactive or preoccupied or caught in by what they're

223
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:54,320
doing and and judging them or whatever it might be could I at least be peaceful in this

224
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:00,960
situation and uh and I thought that was a nice Sol for me that was a better alternative than the things were already

225
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,440
going on my mind because I wasn't you know I was kind of having my reaction to

226
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:11,760
them which was not healthy so I thought Let's do let's do the better alternative

227
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:17,240
here so I could find my peace and I don't know what happened in the end

228
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:22,960
but but um you know I was as I said I wasn't involved with the

229
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:30,039
situation and um so those three things uh nondependent

230
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:36,399
freedom and peace these are the three as we mature in practice at some point that

231
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:43,600
becomes the reference point that becomes in the ancient Buddhist language um they say it's the basis of the practice we do

232
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:50,120
the practi is might be the same practice we did as a beginner it might be something like beginner some people do breath

233
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,399
meditation just tune into to the breath and um and uh so it might be the same

234
00:24:55,399 --> 00:25:01,039
practice as always but now the practice is in for informed by these qualities or

235
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:07,200
supported by these qualities and that makes all the difference in the world because that's where we're trying to

236
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,399
grow we're not necessarily trying to grow become better and better uh people

237
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:19,919
better and better at mindfulness of breathing we're trying to become um um more and more free as we do mindfulness

238
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:27,360
of breathing and mind and whatever practice we're doing then becomes the way that we're cultivating the how okay

239
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:36,360
how I'm going to do how how am I going to do mindfulness of breathing how do I meet it and not a few few people uh who are

240
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:42,120
beginners and uh maybe sometimes longtime practitioners find the breathing

241
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:47,840
boring why would I do it it's so boring and um and the the mistake

242
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:53,840
they're making is that they expect the breathing itself to be the solution

243
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:59,279
there's something is there's something in breathing that's the key in the Magic The Magic doesn't come from the

244
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:07,080
breathing per se but the magic comes from how we're with the breath and the how is where something

245
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:12,480
begins shifting and changing and at some point the breath can be experienced as

246
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,919
being a tremendous pleasure a tremendous beautiful thing to experience and can be

247
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:23,440
very captivating and fascinating to be with a breath but so you might say oh

248
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:30,240
the breath is fascinating and then your friends you know your neighbors say what my this is so

249
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,760
boring but it's not because the breath is inherently wonderful it's the how

250
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:41,679
with the breath and the how then uh uh

251
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:49,039
changes um how the breathing is experienced so it's the how that shifts

252
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:54,320
something and how we see the breathing or how we feel the breathing so that it starts feeling it very different it can

253
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:01,200
be quite beautiful and peaceful and inspiring to be with a breath but it isn't so but you have to

254
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,399
understand it's a lot of it has to do with the how another thing about this thing that

255
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:13,200
these three qualities of the goal that's uh it's in mature practice is is found

256
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:19,799
in the mature practice non-dependence freedom and peace is that

257
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:25,000
as you go about your life if you focus on that even if just one of those maybe

258
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:33,279
a piece is the EAS easiest one maybe rather rather than focusing on mindfulness um uh it might actually be

259
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:38,840
better we're like this mindfulness movement part of right so we think that mindfulness is all about what we do

260
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:45,200
we're supposed to be mindful I have to be mindful should be mindful and I'm going to be mindful I wasn't mindful I

261
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,799
can't be mindful mindful mind are you being Mindful and people ask you what's

262
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,518
your practice I'm being I practice

263
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:03,320
mindfulness what if people instead of what what asks ask you how are you

264
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:10,799
practicing I think it would be more useful but maybe it's too personal to do it in you know polite

265
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:16,360
company but um but uh you know rather than asking what are you practicing uh

266
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:23,360
how are you practicing that would be kind of like uh to be asked that question is is kind of

267
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:30,159
personal ask that question and and you're accountable now for something personal but how you bring yourself to

268
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:35,440
it if you say well I pract what do you practice I practice mindfulness of breathing

269
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:42,200
great what are people going to say you know that's nice you I do that too or I've heard that's a good thing or you

270
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:49,320
know it's just kind of something abstract it uh but if they ask how are you practicing now we're talking about

271
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:54,760
something very personal oh I'm pack practicing with a lot of aggression

272
00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:01,399
thank you I'm you know I'm going to get in lighten their bust I know how to do this and I'm going to push and assert

273
00:29:01,399 --> 00:29:10,840
myself and I'm I'm I'm I'm doing it to be the best enlightened person on my block wow okay well that was

274
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:16,559
clear um but if you but if you say rather well how well I'm trying not to

275
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:22,480
be contentious I'm trying not to be uh in argument with reality I'm trying to

276
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:28,360
find my peace with how I am in this world um you know that's a very very

277
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:34,600
diff then then we're focusing on what is actually important what is to be developed what we're

278
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:40,440
developing and but how this folds back into the practice of

279
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:47,120
mindfulness is that if you focus on how to be peaceful in the present

280
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:55,720
moment lo and behold you have to be mindful but if mindfulness becomes a

281
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:03,000
byproduct not the thing you're trying to to do so if you focus on how you should

282
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:08,200
be you can't help but to be mindful because the how always puts you in the

283
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:17,279
present moment how are you doing right now what's happening for you right now as you do this and so if you looking for

284
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:23,080
freedom from clinging in how do I go through this day so that I'm free of

285
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:28,240
clinging well this is now that I have a flat now that I have two flat tires my

286
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,600
car I think this is a good time to experiment explore this because now I'm

287
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:39,080
have so much reactions I I have a lot of things I cling to being on time to the next thing I was supposed to going to

288
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:46,519
and clinging to how wrong the people at the tire company were to give me those old tires clinging to you know just like

289
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:53,600
it goes through you know there's a long list of things that now suddenly woke up that I'm now clinging to or reacting to

290
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,840
or resisting okay how do I want to be with this

291
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:05,039
should I I'll yeah I'll write an angry letter to that tire company or how do I want to be with this

292
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:13,720
well how do I want to be with this is of course I'm angry of course I'm afraid of course this is difficult can I hold this

293
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:19,519
peacefully can I hold my clinging with non- clinging how do I do

294
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:25,080
that well it turns out you have to be kind of mindful to do that mindfulness

295
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:30,240
has to mindfulness and follows by the very motivation to what you want to do

296
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:36,080
so it might be a a valuable reframing of mindfulness

297
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:41,960
practice uh because sometimes the the simple idea that I'm practicing

298
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:48,960
mindfulness supposed to be mindful um is a little bit too abstract and have a little bit more sense of Duty little bit

299
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:55,519
more sense of a rule you're supposed to follow and it can be hard because maybe it's not being

300
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:03,840
Guided by the how Guided by a so maybe somatic

301
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,159
heartfelt body felt mindf sense of what is healthy and what is not healthy what

302
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:15,320
is wholesome and not wholesome but if you say but if you say okay I'm going to I'm going to figure out how to be

303
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:20,960
peaceful here that's going to be my practice and how am I not peaceful and

304
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:28,240
what would peaceful look like and how would I feel that how do I feel the lack of peace and how do I hold it peacefully

305
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:35,000
um then after doing that for a while you find out wow the last five minutes I've been really mindful you had to be

306
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:40,760
present and attentive in order to answer those questions and uh and then at some point

307
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,799
you might occur to you how do I continue being mindful oh

308
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:52,360
now there I am I've been mindful for five whole minutes I I think if I just continue the

309
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:58,399
mindfulness continue the state of present moment awareness that's going to maintain

310
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:06,760
uh my peace so the goal it to have the goal

311
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:12,440
expressed in the means to be very careful not to try to get somewhere in your

312
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:20,440
practice without considering how you include the destination in how you're

313
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:27,279
practicing and it's a very very effective form of self- protection you

314
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:32,720
do that and you're protected from straining striving wanting being

315
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,240
conceited being somehow there's all these ways in which practice gets

316
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,360
hijacked by our attachments and our fears and our resistances and our

317
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:49,279
dislikes and likes and um but if you're constantly asking you this question about the how

318
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:55,679
am I practicing how is this supposed to uh in it of itself Express part of the

319
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:02,120
goal then you it's kind of a prote ction because you'll notice when you're straining you notice when you're

320
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:08,118
clinging as part of your practice and so it helps helps to support a healthy how

321
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:15,800
your practice and if your if your how your practice is healthy then um you'll

322
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:23,040
become more healthy at least spiritually or psychologically so the simple principle

323
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:30,240
of today that I'm hoping that if you me if you want to memorize one few words about

324
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:39,000
that carry with you as a reminder is um that uh to have the goal in the means

325
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,960
have the means Express what the goal is include the

326
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,118
gold so the two aren't so far

327
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,200
apart and if the goal seems so far away though the

328
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:01,640
enlightenment boy that's like seems like a good idea but I'll never get enlightened in this life it's just like

329
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:07,320
too impossible well if you're caught up in that kind of

330
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:14,920
idea then the goal is not in the means but you instead of you go wow yeah

331
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:21,240
it's probably really far away you know the total full absolute

332
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:28,640
complete Enlightenment of the Buddha that's maybe a little bit far away but um but look at that I can be a little

333
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,960
more less clinging right now look at that I can do that I could not be so

334
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:39,000
caught and trapped by this idea of ultimate Enlightenment and right there

335
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:46,280
you you contain part of the goal and then you build that and expand that how you

336
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:52,240
are so we have uh nine minutes left before the tea time everyone's welcome

337
00:35:52,240 --> 00:36:01,400
to stay for the tea and uh wholeheartedly welcome nice to have you here and um and if you'd uh be willing

338
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:09,560
to uh you don't have to stay now we can end but uh it's very nice when we have tea to for uh uh to stay for a few

339
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:17,000
minutes and to meet some people in the community and say hello and and I'd like to emphasize how valuable it is for each

340
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,400
of you to welcome the other here that even if it's your first time you're already here you're part of the

341
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,359
community so you can welcome the person you're with even if they've been here many times just say hello and welcome

342
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:36,040
and say your name and and that's and then if there was something that was important meaningful for you or

343
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:42,000
something that was evocative for you or provocative for you about this talk maybe you can share some simple thing

344
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,599
about that uh with your partner and um so also it' be nice if you kind of look

345
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:53,440
around maybe it be groups of two or three but look around because sometimes people turn opposite directions with

346
00:36:53,440 --> 00:37:00,160
person in the middle left alone so I just look around so everyone gets to kind of be included and and if

347
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,440
you prefer just sit in silence then you close your eyes and it's kind of nice to listen to all the talking and then you

348
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,760
can stay for the tea or whatever you'd like to do is fine and I'll ring a bell in a few minutes when it's time to stop

349
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:16,480
for the tea and so thank you
