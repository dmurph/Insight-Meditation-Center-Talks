um I change the settings right now my muting won't become possible and also I

27
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:23,160
change the the chat settings on Zoom so that the chat will only come to me

28
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:29,220
but I ask that we keep that channel quiet um because it can be quite distracting

29
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:36,120
and last but not least I turn on the recording for the sake of Audio Dharma

zones joining each other to practice so

33
00:07:56,099 --> 00:08:02,220
so for our theme for practice for this moment in time

34
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:09,180
I'd like to um invite us to consider

35
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:18,360
um the cultivation of appreciating that support support is available support is

36
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:25,259
available support is available and support available internally

37
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:31,199
available externally there are many sources of support internally that

38
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,959
sometimes when things are challenging in our lives we may not we may forget the

39
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:45,080
support the sources of support that are available internally and of course externally many sources of support

40
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:51,480
and through remembering through remembering this goodness of support we

41
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:58,500
can tie back into we can connect back into the uh sense of Goodwill kindness

42
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,779
goodness that's available for us internally and externally that we are

43
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:10,080
held in so that is our way in tonight and of course I will say a lot more

44
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:17,279
um during the meditation and I think that's enough of a frame so let's just dive in

45
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:23,700
and practice together so so I'd like to invite us all to settle

46
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,920
to settle and arrive to settle in your seat

47
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:35,940
in your sit bones however you are sitting or lying down or

48
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,760
maybe standing if that's what's appropriate right now

49
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,399
and turning your gaze inward connecting with the breath the

50
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:56,660
sensations of the breath the lower abdomen

51
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:44,180
and letting letting awareness be spacious and receive receive the breath

52
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:53,399
sensations of the breath relaxing softening letting go of whatever is not needed in

53
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:59,220
this moment letting yourself be simple

54
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,199
space of the heart the mind to be simple

55
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:06,319
and if thoughts are rising saying hello

56
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:13,740
serving as entertainment distraction plans it's

57
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:18,500

61
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,959

62
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:38,899
calming soothing settling with each breath

63
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:21,620
that this breath in this moment be nourishing all that's needed all that's needed nothing more

64
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:27,180

66
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,579

00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:54,240
showing up and be supported and appreciating enjoying that support

163
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:00,599
and the question the inquiry tonight is

164
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:06,480
for each person to name one source of support internal or external and then

165
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:13,020
the next person and then the next person it can be like a celebration celebrating all these sources of support and people

166
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:19,560
might name some things you haven't even thought about like oh yeah that is the source of support in my life

167
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:26,099
um can be quite quite inspiring this practice Above and Beyond in the the things that

168
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:31,380
I've shared and mentioned so so the invitation is in the small groups

169
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:37,140
again showing up with support showing up with the intention to support each other

170
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:43,740
yourselves and um and sing and again will go around each

171
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:50,820
person sharing one then the next person and then the next person then I'll come to you again sharing something else as a

172
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:58,200
source of support and then going around and round can again be quite inspiring not asking questions not directing but

173
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:05,760
just showing up you can also show up with silence and say I'm showing up with Silence of offering my awareness and

174
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:11,220
support and that's perfectly fine you don't have to speak you can show up

175
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:17,280
um and and offer your your presence um

176
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,920
be kind to each other be kind to yourself propose those are the important

177
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:29,940
things to remember so I'm going to open the rooms right now if it's possible for you

178
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:35,460

184
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:40,200
discover in this practice either the guided meditation as you explored on your own or in the group as you explore

185
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:46,680
sources of support especially if you haven't spoken recently I'd like to ask you first to uh

186
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:52,319
to pull forward into the brave space

187
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:58,980
sharing your insights bill please

188
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:05,339
uh some of our group mentioned something that I'm not maybe I misunderstood what I

189
00:54:05,339 --> 00:54:12,059
heard or maybe I got it right but the idea occurred to me of supporting Myself by supporting others like my doing

190
00:54:12,059 --> 00:54:17,700
volunteer work and that sort of thing so yeah thank you beautiful yeah thank you I

191
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:23,760
love that yeah that is a strong support yeah beautiful beautiful when we give we

192
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:31,940
actually receive so much and the volunteer work is definitely an example yeah red please

193
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:40,079
I I think I'm uh stating the obvious but I just want to State it anyway that this

194
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:46,980
exercise just brought forward this extraordinary structure of support uh

195
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:54,240
that was you know largely human and uh you know if I would have had time to get beyond

196
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:59,940
all those people for whom I feel such gratitude for their support then there

197
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:07,200
would have been a whole bunch of other non-human supports too you know like the the road that I can step out on and the

198
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:15,240
fact that the mail comes or all these things but but also um the fact that I've have the opportunity

199
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:21,780
I've had the opportunity in in big ways and I hope we'll continue to have the

200
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:29,579
opportunity to be of support to other people and and it's both of those things that are really important

201
00:55:29,579 --> 00:55:37,859
um and I I feel like I can't quite express it all but just the the depth of support the Love by so many people

202
00:55:37,859 --> 00:55:44,339
um I'm just really grateful for that thank you thank you Fred

203
00:55:44,339 --> 00:55:51,900
you put it so well so well thank you the as you said it wasn't quite the

204
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:57,480
obvious that you said I think there are many nuances that you added uh and and

205
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:04,740
you put it eloquently so thank you for speaking so uh Ali please

206
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:12,180
yeah thank you thank you for the uh exercise I'm beginning to see the uh

207
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:18,300
the goodness that I have and then the support that I have for me I mean what is right with me versus what's wrong

208
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:24,240
which has been like deeply conditioned yeah yeah thank you Ellie and that's

209
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:30,359
that is so common for all of us human beings it's the it's the conditioning we

210
00:56:30,359 --> 00:56:35,900
have to turn towards what's missing what's bad what's negative it's it's it's

211
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:41,040
for all of us humans we turn to toward do we turn towards that more more than

212
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:50,460
towards what's good what's what's working what's great so yes welcome to welcome to Being Human Ellie

213
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:55,800

216
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:15,240
very used to this uh like you say it's kind of human to look at the other side

217
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:22,680
of it I found it wonderful and I was excited and I noticed I was excited to

218
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:27,740
do it I and I noticed I had a hard time keeping it

219
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:33,059
non-egotistical that I I had to continually like remind

220
00:57:33,059 --> 00:57:40,140
myself oh let's steer it back to just what we're grateful for not what we you

221
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:48,000
know might be proud of or something like that yeah so anyway that was interesting yeah yeah

00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:16,220
to notice what you noticed to notice that oh yeah okay now we're
