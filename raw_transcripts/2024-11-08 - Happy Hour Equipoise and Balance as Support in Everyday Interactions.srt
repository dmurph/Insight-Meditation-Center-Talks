25
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,519
I'd like to continue with the theme of this week the theme of this week has been

26
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:54,319
equinity for obvious reasons because it's been a very busy week with lots of

27
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:00,920
news and tumultuousness no matter which side you're on it's been

28
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:07,360
busy and full and exciting so times like or or exciting one way or the other

29
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,760
anyway I'm going to just leave that you know the V the feeling tone might be positive or negative but regardless

30
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:22,080
equinity is the practice for times like this equinity establishing ourselves in in

31
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,920
groundedness in in uprightness in calm in neither

32
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:38,680
being pushed away nor being dragged into the sense of um yeah equinity equipoise

33
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:46,959
that's another alternative translation of uh of opa opa often translated as

34
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:55,560
equinity equipoise calm balance balance also um another very helpful translation

35
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:03,159
so I like to continue this week um with equin practice and of course can do

36
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:08,959
these practices in so many different ways in the past few nights I've um

37
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:15,040
starting Monday night I entered it in a different way similarly Tuesday and

38
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,720
Wednesday and tonight we'll find our way with in different ways of of entering

39
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:29,880
and and holding and cultivating equo equinity all right that's enough of uh a

40
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:36,800
setting a uh framework for what we will do and uh let's begin let's begin

41
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,639
so let's land let's arrive in our

42
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,919
seats there you're standing so whether you're standing sitting lying

43
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:59,160
down whatever posture you might have in this moment

44
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,120
inviting yourself to connect and really become

45
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,880
aware of this body sitting standing whatever posture

46
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:26,520
it has really become aware how it is

47
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,919
folded or unfolded it

48
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,039
and inviting your body to relax soften

49
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,199
and your heart to relax as much as

50
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,199
possible receiving receiving the sensations of breathing in breath and

51
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,879
out breath in the abdomen or anywhere else that the breath

52
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,120
is very

53
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,840
clear and whatever is arising in the heart the body and the

54
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:31,080
mind making space kindly gently L lovingly not

55
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,639

mind and heart and just that that acceptance of

58
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,800
what's present can create a little more

210
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:20,760
questions would love to hear from you so what's what's a lie for you how was this

211
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:28,880
practice for you especially I'm curious what did you find when you tried to tune into eonic the equipoise while

212
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:35,000
interacting with others what did you find was helpful in real time to keep

213
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:41,920
your stability and balance and again remember you're sharing your uh if you choose to share

214
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:49,400
you're sharing for the benefit of others as well as yourself being witnessed

215
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,480
so I see Isabelle's hand let's see there

216
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,920
you go

217
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:06,440
uh it was really nice to not pressure myself to have to talk say as many words

218
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:13,880
as I usually do that was really nice I often feel that way and I don't I'm not

219
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:21,400
in tune with it so it was really nice to have it be okay tonight to do that nice

220
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:26,480
yeah thanks for sharing this it's always okay it's always okay not to say much

221
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:32,240
just say if you were and I appreciate you you being in tune with that and naming that tonight that it was

222
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:39,520
supportive for you it's great Jerry um thank you Nikki and thank you

223
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,720
for the original the direction on the larger group I think I was answering

224
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:52,079
that it seemed that um anxiety be gets anxiety anger begets

225
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:58,760
anger so the calmness of people's voices within the small group certainly added

226
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:04,040
to my sense of um keeping myself anchored

227
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:10,839
so tones of voices can certainly contribute to nice nice the calm voice

228
00:47:10,839 --> 00:47:16,720
of your fellow practitioners helped you be more calm this is lovely thanks for

229
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:22,720
sharing this Jerry ah so nice such a great support and yes

230
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:29,040
absolutely anxiety begets more and fear be gets more fear Etc it's the law of

231
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:35,160
karma this moment reconditions the next moment increases the probability of the

232
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:41,720
next moment being of the same ilk if we're angry In This Moment the probability of us being angry in the

233
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:47,800
next moment increases call it karma call it Neuroscience actually karma is more

234
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:54,599
holistic anyway not just to reduce it to our just to the what happens in in one

235
00:47:54,599 --> 00:48:01,520
organ anyway Susan so I have been very emotional for the

236
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:10,720
last even even before the election I've been have an emotional um week and so um it was my

237
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:16,200
word was balance and when I was in the breakout room I just kept breathing

238
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:22,079
really deeply and that really helped me do that and at one point I could just by

239
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:28,880
something that someone said that had it didn't trigger me or anything like that but I get some emotion around it because

240
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:35,359
it was about women and I was able to like close my eyes and just be in that

241
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:44,280
moment and have it be okay thank you you yes great thank you

242
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:51,680
Susan yay we can keep our equinity and equipoise our balance our calm in the

243
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:57,440
midst of what could be agitating or triggering ah the the world for all of

244
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:03,160
us would be a much more wonderful place to be both how we are for ourselves how

245
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:10,079
we interact with others or less we don't fly off the handle this is wonderful thanks for sharing this suan so for you

246
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:16,119
deep breathing really brought this sense of present presence in what was happening to your body to Dear to

247
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:24,799
realize okay dear I need to close my eyes just be with this ah it's okay I can be with this lovely yay thank you I

248
00:49:24,799 --> 00:49:30,839
see if you um Reflections in chat bill says what helped me was awareness of the

249
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:36,680
chair I'm sitting on like part of being embodied great great awareness of the

250
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:44,200
chair yay embodiment is that is is is exactly feeling where your B what your

251
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:50,640
body is feeling internally as well as the touch points so feeling the chair is great thanks

252
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:58,079
Bill Marian says what helped me was saying I will be settled no matter what to myself made it intention yes the

253
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:03,760
power of intention love it thank you Baran thanks for sharing that very

254
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:09,760
powerful yeah powerful practice tonight and especially I really Lov how you

255
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:15,000
shared you really took on uh this practice instruction invitation to

256
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:22,920
practice with it in real time and goodness if we can take this to our interactions in daily life somebody says

257
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:29,839
something and we just get reactive and we don't even notice and fly off the handle and stay stay and we might

258
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:36,040
respond of course but we might respond from place of balance and care than

259
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:42,040
rather than reactivity so dear ones let's let's

260
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:47,319
close it seems like it's enough it's been a quiet night we'll have more

261
00:50:47,319 --> 00:50:54,680
silence so thank you all thank you for your presence for your practice for the sake of yourselves and all beings
