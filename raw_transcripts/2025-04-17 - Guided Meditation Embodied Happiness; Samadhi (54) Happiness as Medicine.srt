1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:06,400
hello and welcome back to IMC those of you who

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,480
are with me especially to Spirit Rock and

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:19,000
uh I think it would be nice if I could broadcast every day from a place like Spirit Rock outdoors and

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,800
uh it's not so convenient to find a place that's quiet for that purpose but

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,960
uh this works to be here

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:39,320
so we're continuing in this practice of

7
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:46,200
samadei and there is a variety of happinesses

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,719
joys that are elicited in the in the practice of

9
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,840
samadei and beginning to appreciate the different kinds of

10
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:04,320
well-being that come along ong it helps the process clinging to it striving for

11
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,560
happiness is not so useful but recognizing it or allowing it and um

12
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:18,720
valuing it when it happens is helpful so in the beginning of um the practice

13
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,439
of going into the Janna there is the happiness of

14
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:30,759
um the joy the h kind of happiness of uh for the time

15
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:37,079
being at least during the time you're meditating the the kind of

16
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:42,799
happiness of being ethical here and now in this

17
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:50,119
state in this body we're not going to cause any harm and so that's

18
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:57,320
there there's a happiness that's a contentment that just for now we have

19
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:03,119
enough we have enough to be sitting quietly and closing our eyes to meditate

20
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,000
we have enough shelter enough clothes we have enough food just maybe just

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,200
enough and uh and it to have a contentment rather than a feeling of

22
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:24,520
lack and then there's the happiness of no longer being caught up in

23
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:32,319
preoccupations no longer being caught up in the concerns for you know our challenges in the world

24
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:39,280
not to put those challenges away or deny them or repress them but for now they

25
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:46,160
are left outside the meditation

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,519
hall so the happiness of not being preoccupied and then there's the

27
00:02:53,519 --> 00:03:01,360
happiness of seclusion of having left things outside the metaphorical meditation hall now

28
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,760
we're in this kind of different zone sacred zone contemplative

29
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:13,319
zone now we can really and and kind of uh

30
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:19,480
legally put aside our concerns for the world our uh

31
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:27,840
responsibilities we've left we've kind of checked them at the door we've kind of now we're kind of here and we can

32
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:36,560
focus internally to this body and mind to this time here and there's a happiness of

33
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,400
seclusion happiness of no longer being preoccupied with the world no longer

34
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,080
living in the world uh rattled by or pushed this way and

35
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:55,840
that way by what happens that can be for later but for now the happiness of being in this space

36
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:05,080
of meditation there's the happiness of then being able to give oneselves over

37
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:12,319
wholeheartedly to um sincerely to the process of meditation

38
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,440
through just giving ourselves over in a unified way gathering

39
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,479
ourselves together being complete feeling whole feeling here grounded

40
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:31,720
feeling somehow solid feeling settled this is good this is a kind of

41
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:38,320
happiness and then there comes the happiness of uh the mind being equist

42
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,720
and non-reactive the happiness that's a happiness of the

43
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:52,919
body and I like to think of it as the happy body the body is a field of

44
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:58,000
well-being maybe very difficult to imagine for some people

45
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,160
but now we get to dip into the lake of

46
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:11,919
well-being the wake of happiness some people call it the wake of bliss

47
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,600
so assuming a meditation

48
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:24,000
posture and giving some loving care to your

49
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,600
posture caring for how the posture for

50
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,840
meditation can help you feel solid

51
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:41,400
alert here rooted

52
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:47,199
perhaps to whatever surface is holding you from

53
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,240
falling by the pull of gravity

54
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:06,479
here on this spot and gently softly closing your

55
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:19,280
eyes and with the assumption that one way or the other even in the smallest

56
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,120
corners of your body there is well-being

57
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,080
there is some feel form of well-being

58
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:39,160
happiness perhaps it's simply pleasure that is not because of

59
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:46,560
anything but it just because it arises out of being settled

60
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:53,400
being alive the sensations of being alive that

61
00:06:53,400 --> 00:07:01,840
appear here and now maybe some of them are pleasant

62
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:10,240
enjoyable maybe qualifies as being symptoms of happiness to be

63
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:22,520
here and then as you breathe maybe breathing more deeply

64
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:29,120
fully breathe into and with whatever that sense of pleasure or

65
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:37,919
happiness is giving it permission to be

66
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,120
there and giving yourself permission to feel it as you

67
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,360
breathe as if you breathe through it and with

68
00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:02,960
it and as you exhale to relax let

69
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:20,360
go and if it's possible to have a momentary pause at the end of the

70
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:26,360
exhale so you can feel the goodness or

71
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,758
sweetness of simply being here here and

72
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:44,360
now letting your breathing return to normal

73
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:51,200
but continuing for a little while to have that little pause at the end of the

74
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:58,920
exhale as a way of feeling whatever is good or comfortable

75
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:08,440
settled enjoyable in just being here and now

76
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:17,279
independent of the world independent of obligations

77
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,279
preoccupations sometimes it can be nice to make a small half

78
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:54,120
smile especially if that triggers a little bit feelings of joy or delight

79
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,760
and whatever good feelings that come from the small half

80
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:14,920
smile orient your meditation your efforts your how you see

81
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:22,120
things through the lens of that well-being that joy

82
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,760
breathing in

83
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:41,399
joy breathing out relaxing

84
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:10,880
and as you relax below the joy

85
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:16,600
below can you find the happy body the happiness of the

86
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:23,399
body a contentment a sweetness

87
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,079
a vitality that feels

88
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:45,880
pleasant and this should not be feared

89
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,720
breathing with the happy

90
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:15,440
body and all other things can be known within the field of

91
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:20,399
happiness the lotuses in the

92
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,439
lake gently

93
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,320
breathing in the vast

94
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,600
space of happiness

95
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:48,399
contentment allowing the thinking mind to get quieter

96
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,600
letting go of thoughts as you

97
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:07,800
exhale so there's more space to feel the happy body

98
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:48,559
as you meditate trust the

99
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,880
well-being of meditation of being present

100
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,640
present with every

101
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:12,360
breath breathing the body breathing in joy the body breathing in

102
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,400

well-being more than you trust whatever you're thinking about

104
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:31,280
relax the thinking mind so you can

105
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:39,080
feel the well-being of your body

106
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:17,640

[Music]

136
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,240
thank you

137
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:56,600
so hello and welcome to the next talk in this series on

138
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:04,799
samadei and uh in the week of the third Janna and uh the instructions in

139
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:11,440
meditation that's given for fir first the third Janna is very simple

140
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:19,240
uh the actual things that we do um it says that one enters and

141
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:25,960
abides and experiences happiness in the body

142
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:32,000
so one enters and abides in this deep state and one then experiences the

143
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,120
happiness of the body that's the instruction the most active instructions

144
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:43,640
experience the happiness or almost the most act active and then it goes on to say give this

145
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:51,799
instructions so this if you want to do something if you're a doer this is what you actually do in the third

146
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:59,240
janna you would pervade saturate ate and permeate this

147
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:07,000
body with a with happiness so no part of the body is not

148
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:15,600
touched i mean it's kind of remarkable instructions to spread to happiness

149
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:21,200
around the body so that the whole body feels happy

150
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:31,919
now whether the word should translate it from poly into English should be happy or happiness is a person dependent

151
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:39,279
each of us will have a different relationship with different words and different inner states so it's in the

152
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:46,880
family of happiness states so maybe it's contentment maybe it's a sweetness maybe

153
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,320
it's a deep sense of being cozy and comforted

154
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:58,039
maybe it's a kind of ting warm glowing sense of

155
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:06,120
aliveness maybe it's a kind of glowing happy feeling of peace in the body

156
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:12,919
so you know the idea is to here is not to take

157
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:22,960
um some impersonal idea of what these words are but to make the words personal

158
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,080
so the word happiness find a way it can become your word with what you recognize

159
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,440
and can feel inside for yourself and eventually we come into what I call the

160
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,080
happy body the happiness body many of us walk around with a fear

161
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:46,320
body and the whole body is tensed in a certain way and and hyper vigilant

162
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:53,200
because it's just filled courarssing with fear some people are in the sadness body

163
00:33:53,200 --> 00:34:00,080
that depressed body the grief body some people might be in the volcanic

164
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:05,120
anger body rage body and so the whole experience of the

165
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:12,320
body shifts and change what's going on there's the ecstatic uh body of

166
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:18,240
something really fantastic happening maybe you think winning the lottery for

167
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:24,240
millions billions of dollars is a good thing and you're just like your whole body is just kind of firing all the

168
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:29,960
neurons is fire firing with excitement and there's the excitement

169
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:35,679
body uh there's the uh nurturing tender

170
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:43,398
uh caring body of maybe caring for a injured bird

171
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:50,679
or maybe holding a newborn baby and uh the whole body shifts and

172
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:59,119
changes so in a sense we have different bodies and uh and the happiness body is

173
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:05,359
another one and one and that's part of the movement in meditation in samadei

174
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:14,079
practice is to move into these really healthy and healing bodies and one of the ways to do that is

175
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:21,839
to have a kind of a good meditation posture good means

176
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:28,320
maybe dignified maybe upright maybe um or maybe it's better to define it by

177
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:36,160
what it's not it's not collapsing it's not recoiling it's not

178
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:42,400
shutting down it's not reaching for and trying to make something happen

179
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,800
um and so uh we're not we're not being the the posture

180
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:53,599
itself is not under the sway of what's happening in the world

181
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:59,119
and what's happening with our emotional life inside terms of the posture so the

182
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:06,000
posture becomes kind of like the monastery the posture becomes a meditation hall the posture becomes the

183
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,800
source that can the container that can hold everything and we begin to

184
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:19,040
experience and recognize how much we in fact are being swayed this way and that

185
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:24,880
way by what's happening in the world what's happening with our relationships what's happening with work and family

186
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:33,720
and home that our moods and emotions are so dependent so uh influenced we're so

187
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:39,440
influencable by all the things that's happening around us we're constantly

188
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,680
reacting this way and this way and that way and uh

189
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:52,240
samadei is the practice of beingcoming so fully present and home and stable

190
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:58,079
here in the moment that the posture is no longer being

191
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:03,720
uh under the influence of emotions the world the events of the

192
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:12,320
times and then slowly the inner life the inner the heart the the yoni the deep

193
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:19,960
place inside um begins to come alive the inner life becomes

194
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:25,119
alive independent of what's happening in the world

195
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:31,119
and this is a revolution for some people revolution for the heart to feel a sense

196
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:39,440
of well-being to feel a sense of aliveness uh uh contentment peace

197
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,760
uh happiness that's not dependent on what is happening in the

198
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:50,119
world and this is not a betrayal of the world betrayal of our

199
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:56,000
relationships it's actually putting ourselves in a really healthy way that

200
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,160
we can go into the world into our relationships in an infinitely better

201
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:09,000
way where we offer it our clarity offer it our fullness offer our um

202
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,760
peace offer our respect our attention that can't be offered if part

203
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:21,119
of what we are is reacting to the present moment caught up in our desires

204
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:27,720
caught up in the feelings emotions about and desires and aversions that have to do with the present moment and what's

205
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:33,119
happening we don't bring the fullness the best of us when we're being swayed

206
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:40,680
this way and that way so the training in samadei is a fantastic training for daily

207
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:49,000
life and knowing that might make it easier for your mind body heart to be

208
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:55,599
willing to put aside the world put aside your

209
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:02,760
relationships put aside your preoccupations because you'll be coming back to them after the

210
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:08,119
meditation and you're putting aside long enough to be

211
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:15,599
transformed be changed into a kind of deeper settleness deeper fullness of

212
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:22,839
being so that and so in the third Janna it's having a sense of a happiness

213
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:31,880
body and um and to feel that happiness body to feel kind of cozy

214
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:37,320
delighted contented that we carry with us into the

215
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:44,119
world and that's medicine for the world if we go into the world angry that's not

216
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:50,320
medicine if we go into the world distressed that's not medicine there's

217
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:56,880
enough anger enough distress in the world do we really want to add

218
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:05,680
more because we're angry maybe and because we're distressed because we care

219
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:11,040
in that caring make yourself the medicine that

220
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:16,240
the world needs make yourself the medicine that you need

221
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:22,880
that's the function of deep samadei that's the function of deeply settling

222
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:30,400
and going into this deep deep place it's not an escape from the world it's a it's

223
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,000
an ability to be become whole complete with the best that we have available as

224
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,040
a human being and with that comes a

225
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:49,800
profound aspiration to live for the welfare and happiness of this world

226
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:56,560
without sacrificing our own well-being it's much easier said than

227
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:04,319
done but that's the principle of this practice it is possible to learn that

228
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:09,960
and it's a worthwhile skill to learn and

229
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:17,640
so I'll read the the description of the third Janna one more

230
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:23,800
time furthermore with the fading of

231
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:29,079
joy a practitioner abides at quantamus

232
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:35,599
aware with clear recognition experiencing happiness with

233
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:40,800
the body the practitioner enters and abides in

234
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:49,119
the third Janna which the noble ones declare a economous and aware one abides

235
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:58,040
in happiness the practitioner pervades saturates and permeates this body with

236
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:07,520
happiness freed of joy so that no part of the body is not touched

237
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:14,119
i celebrate this description what a great

238
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:19,560
phenomenal pointing to a human potential that we have that you

239
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:25,599
have it is possible we can This is a potential we

240
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,640
all carry within us

241
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:36,200
so may you be your own

242
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:44,119
medicine may you be the medicine for the world thank you
