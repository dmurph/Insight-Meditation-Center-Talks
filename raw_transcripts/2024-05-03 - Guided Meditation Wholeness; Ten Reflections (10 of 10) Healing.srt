1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:06,600
good morning or good day hello

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,839
welcome and um as we're coming to the end of this

3
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:22,039
two week series for this meditation I'd like to uh introduce something which in my mind

4
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:27,080
my heart is a kind of a uh the Gathering Together of all that that we've done

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:33,759
these good morning oh all of these

6
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,559
days and

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,399
um sometimes the word Dharma is used to refer

8
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:54,280
to uh something profound in our own nature that we have the

9
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,120
nature of being Dharma

10
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:13,880
vesicles for the Dharma we are uh we are there's a wonderful

11
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:21,280
capacity force uh wonderful processing that is

12
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,520
within our psychophysical being which we can't exactly appropriate as being

13
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,520
mine in a sense from a certain kind of way it's a greater

14
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,720
power within us that is not what we normally identify as me or the me the

15
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,159
one who's going to do something and um we have agency but one

16
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:54,240
of the really powerful ways to use that agency in Dharma practice is to use it

17
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:01,399
to create the conditions for our own inner nature d

18
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:08,239
nature to move through us and a lot of uh the Dharma Dharma

19
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,319
practice sooner or later has to is about getting out of the

20
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:18,720
way not interfering not blocking not

21
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,319
messing with the natural movement Dharma movement within

22
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:31,360
us and sometimes that movement is a movement towards healing

23
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:39,599
and our heart's nature is to heal if we allow it if we create the

24
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:47,560
conditions and the time and the and the non-interference and a radical non-

25
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:56,680
interference radical way of not being a victim not being a fixer not being a a

26
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:03,159
um avoider not being a Builder and maker of making things

27
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:11,000
happen the natural movement towards homeostasis or towards health or towards a certain kind

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,760
of healing sometimes it's a process of maturation maybe we are healed in

29
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:27,519
conventional way and psychological way and something begins moving through us to mature us to we grow and develop and

30
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,120
Blossom come into fruition is the Buddhist language for

31
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,120
it and so to have a profound

32
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,720
respect for our own capacity and everyone's

33
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:53,480
capacity for this natural natural process of healing

34
00:03:53,480 --> 00:04:00,239
maturation of moving into a kind of wholeness or moving into a kind of

35
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:08,400
healing moving into a kind of [Music] maturity that is

36
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,959
wholesome that is in some ways

37
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,880
ethical so as we sit with this

38
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:26,880
meditation the task is to sit with mindfully present for our experience

39
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,360
centered and maybe in the breathing and being very simple being here and

40
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:40,280
now but notice whatever takes you away notice whatever takes you away from

41
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:47,320
this this inner process that needs awareness for it to make have space for

42
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:54,680
to allow it to come and grow and uh whatever takes you

43
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:01,919
away notice whatever ways you interfere with it judge it try to fix it try to

44
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:08,600
avoid it react to it to see if there can be a radical way

45
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,199
of getting out of the way of your deeper nature of your

46
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:19,319
psychophysical system and sometimes certain things will

47
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:25,000
have to get more intense before they heal before they

48
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:31,720
resolve but to have the profound trust to the trust in getting radically out of

49
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,120
the way and staying present so I hope this makes

50
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,759
sense so to assume a meditation

51
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:53,039
posture and one of the ways of understanding this meditation posture it's a posture that is that

52
00:05:53,039 --> 00:06:01,360
doesn't interfere with the

53
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,680
full Dynamic

54
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:13,880
freedom of this inner process while we sit

55
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:20,560
still not to hold ourselves still but to softly allow ourselves to

56
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,000
be still so

57
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,599
there's a kind of soft space for each unique thing that's happening

58
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:41,360
within us to appear persist pass

59
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:51,520
away and perhaps you gently close your eyes and with the eyes

60
00:06:51,520 --> 00:07:00,319
closed a kind of soft homecoming to the body

61
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:08,599
a soft willingness to turn the

62
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,720
attention here in this body at this

63
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:25,039
time and as you breathe in to feel the

64
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:31,120
body feel the tensions of the body without

65
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,039
reactivity judgments to feel on the inhale and

66
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:43,879
relax on the exhale and if relaxing is too active

67
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:50,039
allow for a release allow for letting go in the body

68
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:52,360
as you

69
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,479
exhale for

70
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:54,360
and finding where in your body the body's experience of

71
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,959
breathing has some sense of freedom

72
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:05,480
where the inhale begins freely on its

73
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,600
own maybe in a different place where you might be controlling the

74
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,519
breath where the exhale happens on its

75
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:30,920
own and as you stay with your breathing in and breathe

76
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:37,800
out maybe you can have an appreciation whatever piece little piece

77
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:43,000
of breathing is a natural

78
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,000
process that happens without you're interfering and

79
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,279
doing consciously and intentionally and it could be as simple

80
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:05,519
as the contact of your skin against your clothes how it shifts as you

81
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,000
breathe or the expanding and Contracting movements however

82
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,160
subtle in your back rib

83
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,279
cage for

84
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:38,839
and then noticing any way in which you interfere or avoid

85
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:43,120
or judge or try to

86
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:57,200
fix instead leave things alone radically

87
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,440
alone maybe with the

88
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,240
support of the way in which breathing happens

89
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:17,480
naturally breathing is the

90
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:29,399
centerpiece of a natural process that everything is part of

91
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:35,600
if we can get out of the way

92
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:44,079
while clearly aware of what is here

93
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
for

94
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
for

95
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
for

96
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,000
for for

97
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,959
for

98
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,000
trusting trusting the natural processes within

99
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:00,839
us works best

100
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:10,160
when we're radically thorough in non

101
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,160
interference noninterfering

102
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:26,558
awareness really present here in a clear Living Way

103
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:37,200
not participating actively in anything leaving all things alone each

104
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:45,640
individual thing that arises within us around us let it

105
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:57,840
be content to just be

106
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
aware

107
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

108
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

109
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
for

110
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

111
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

112
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
for

113
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,559
for for

114
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:18,640
whatever is happening make room for

115
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:27,000
it don't do anything about it just know

116
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,240
it in this simplest way you can be

117
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:41,919
aware be mindful know that it's

118
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,679
happening like you would know clearly a

119
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,720
cloud floating in the sky

120
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,480
or water flowing down a

121
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:26,278
river let it be let life flow Here and

122
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
Now

123
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
for

124
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
for

125
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
for

126
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
for

127
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
for

128
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
for

129
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
for

130
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,159
for for

131
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,399
and then as we come to the end of this

132
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:30,760
sitting to imagine how how it can be deeply

133
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:41,919
respectful of others to from a place of our confidence our

134
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:49,600
safety our self-respect that we can just know

135
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:56,960
others as they are take the time to listen to others to

136
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:03,000
see them to hear know them without our agendas without

137
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:11,039
our interference not giving in to

138
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:16,440
others but not asserting ourselves on others not avoiding

139
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,320
but present

140
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:29,720
interested knowing each person in their own right for who they

141
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,960
are not for what they are to

142
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:42,799
us free of our fears free of our

143
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:50,360
desires just allow and know others and maybe there too there's a

144
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:56,159
natural process that unfolds and one of

145
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:02,679
those is our our love our good

146
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:08,440
will our sense of being in communion

147
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:17,240
together May our good will spread out into the

148
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:24,039
world may it be a bomb may it be medicine for this suffering

149
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:32,039
world that we offer it our good will our kindness our

150
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:36,120
friendship compassion

151
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:49,360
love that respects each thing in a profound way free of our

152
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:56,039
interference may all beings be

153
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:59,919
happy may all be

154
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:10,559
beings be safe may all beings be

155
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:19,360
peaceful may all beings be free

156
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,630
[Music]

157
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:36,639
thank you

158
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:34,799
so today the I I will I will reflect on that

159
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:42,880
final and 10th of the 10 Reflections and in some ways I very much

160
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:50,039
think of them it is following all the others all the others are a foundation for this last

161
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:58,159
one and um I think of it as healing so yesterday was reconciliation

162
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:04,559
today's healing and the difference between reconciliation and healing in the way

163
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:10,760
that I'm using it here is reconciliation is the healing we do

164
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:16,559
socially the coming into wholeness into communion and coming together and with

165
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:25,200
kindness with Good Will with others healing I use here as how we

166
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:31,840
reconcile ourselves with ourselves how we come into communion to wholeness

167
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,880
with ourselves and uh I like to believe is

168
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,000
not a coincidence or not a or that it's very

169
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,799
significant that the English word

170
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:58,320
wholeness and healing and health all kind of come from the same uh uh

171
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,840
indoan Roots through the Germanic

172
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:11,079
and Scandinavian and northern European languages that

173
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:17,599
um that there's something about uh healing and health which means to be

174
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:24,679
whole to be undamaged to be un uninjured and um to be complete in a

175
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:35,398
certain kind of way and uh and so uh to not be divided in ourselves and

176
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:42,760
there are times when we are at war with ourselves we have uh we have values we

177
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:48,560
believe in and but we don't live that way we we have ways of being and

178
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:55,200
thinking and feeling which somehow or other not we think is not acceptable and we have to get rid of it push it away

179
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:02,680
and uh I've seen in some people quite an intense standoff kind of a impassible

180
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:09,839
kind of Checkmate around the war between different parts of themselves and

181
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:17,560
um and so to uh heal the divisions we have to heal the ways in which we are

182
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:24,520
critical of ourselves angry at ourselves hostile towards ourselves heal the ways in which we shut off from

183
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:31,400
ourselves uh divided in ourselves and uh and one way or the other most

184
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:37,599
people are to be attached is to be divided to have hostility towards others

185
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:45,480
is to be divided in oneself to live caught in fear is a way of not being

186
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:50,760
whole and of course there's good reasons to be afraid and fears are necessary

187
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:57,720
important part of life in certain kind of healthy ways but there are ways in which people get stuck in ways that

188
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:03,680
they're not full not whole not complete of these 10

189
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,640
Reflections I think over the last one is being the one that uh is uh is closest

190
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:16,440
to being religious um the these 10 Reflections as I've introduced them come from the world

191
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,680
of chaplaincy where hospital and prison and and hospice

192
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:28,800
chaplains um especially in some parts of this country like California are available to do Interfaith chapy

193
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:37,280
Interfaith spiritual care where they meet people of other religions in their own and not to prze but rather to

194
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:43,839
support them in their own way and um and so the orientation has to

195
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:49,440
be kind of more spiritual than religious more and and it's so broad these 10

196
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,560
Reflections that um these themes that they also work for people who are

197
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:00,680
non-religious or humanists or atheists they're such fundamental human things

198
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:07,720
but as we get to this sense of healing the possibility of healing the trusting of healing of

199
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:12,960
wholeness that there's something here within us that is a kind of a greater

200
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:20,200
power than what we have uh full agency over that's different than what we have

201
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:26,160
control over or can make happen or do or um something that we no longer need to

202
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:32,520
resist and hold hold back from something quite significant that in a sense in my

203
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:41,079
language is a greater power within us that um that uh is not appropriated to

204
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:50,200
our identity to that part of it that we create a self and build up a sense of self and um it's not so strange what I'm

205
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:57,839
saying uh and as as often will point out it's kind of like the natural great

206
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:04,440
power of physical healing from a cut we can cut ourselves and uh it's a Rel

207
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:10,079
physiologically a fairly complicated uh multifaceted event for the body to heal

208
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:15,760
itself but if we can let it get out of the way of the healing keep the wound

209
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:22,839
clean keep it from getting dirty not not pick the scab that uh the body has a way

210
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:31,079
of healing up to a certain point and the certain point is I still have on my back of my hand um the

211
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:37,000
remnants the leftover of uh that's I think fully healed and as far as healing

212
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:45,000
is concerned but I I um I still have the scar of being deeply cut on my hand and

213
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:51,560
um the U and uh and I appreciate the scar

214
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:59,119
that's left it reminds me of my fragility my morality my by uh all kinds

215
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,359
of things um that's part of the wholeness is to include that what's the remnant of

216
00:39:04,359 --> 00:39:10,760
what's there it's not necessarily we have nothing left over psychologically

217
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:18,000
emotionally physically from how we get healed but um but there is this power

218
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,359
within that this Force this ability this capacity within that I can't say it's

219
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:30,119
it's mine in the sense where I I usually usual place where I identify or me as

220
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:35,680
the agent me as the experiencer me as the doer me as something and it's a so

221
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:41,680
lovely to relax and trust this deeper process I still have a role uh to

222
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:47,319
support that but it's a role mostly of non-interference don't interfere with

223
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:53,359
the healing that goes on and this is also true in the heart emotionally it's

224
00:39:53,359 --> 00:40:01,920
true in the mind we have a phenomenal our whole psychophysical system is kind of maybe built to move towards balance

225
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:07,359
to homeostasis to wholeness um and we very sophisticated

226
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:15,680
system within us that none of us can fully understand how it works and so at some point in Dharma

227
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:23,839
practice to uh the movement towards wholeness or to Freedom or to peace or

228
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:29,920
to non Divi not being non-divided um um requires a radical

229
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:37,440
kind of non-interference a radical trust and allowing for this natural maturity the

230
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:43,560
natural healing that uh our system is capable of but if we're always writing

231
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:50,599
close like a kid in the backseat saying are we there yet are we there yet we're always there kind of you know pushing

232
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:56,359
and trying to make it happen or scratching the scab uh uh this natural

233
00:40:56,359 --> 00:41:01,920
process cannot happen and so to to come into some deeper trust

234
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:11,200
that allows some deeper uh movements within us to begin unfolding and opening and and um and

235
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:16,400
coming into a kind of wholeness and part of that process is

236
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,599
healing a personal healing healing within ourselves and of course the the

237
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:29,079
reconciliation with others is not going to be independent from our healing and our eles in the way I'm using these

238
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:34,920
words um they're not separate but they uh there is a whole process of

239
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:40,160
selfhealing that goes on and for many people when they come to Dharma practice

240
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:47,359
uh in the beginning uh I think a lot of what's happening is healing uh or if you don't like the word

241
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:55,280
healing or it's not quite right for what your process is coming into a wholeness and to some degree it's it's

242
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:01,960
it's aided by a certain humility uh not the humility of beling belittling

243
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:09,280
oneself or being submissive or anything but the humility of not feeling that uh

244
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:15,800
uh we know everything we're in charge of everything we can do everything ourselves and and kind of just Barrel

245
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:22,640
ahead and make everything right there is a humility that trusts and allows for um

246
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:30,000
the that we don't know it all we're not the one who's the doer and the maker of it all we have to allow some other

247
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,440
process to unfold make room for it and that allowing then just that

248
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:43,119
itself heals some of the divisions that are formed by excessive um self

249
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:48,480
assertion self de deprecation humility is not

250
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:55,040
self-criticism or diminishing yourselves it actually heals that as well it's we

251
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:02,280
come into a Simplicity of being and um and from that Simplicity of being

252
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:09,920
from that kind of simple maybe humble um wholeness or healing then when

253
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,960
we we can still be agents in our life we can still do things we can still live

254
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:24,319
with dignity and value and purpose and meaning but it comes from a very different place it's it rises within us

255
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:32,640
with uh uh without stress stress without strain without creating further division

256
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:40,000
either socially or personally so this personal

257
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,319
healing and uh remember Steven Levine a wonderful teacher from many years

258
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:50,760
ago made the distinction for Me Maybe other people maybe have done it between

259
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:57,760
um um curing and healing and he worked a lot with people who were dying

260
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:04,359
and he was kind of the one of the pioneers of the hospice movement in working with death and dying and uh and

261
00:44:04,359 --> 00:44:11,160
he was a uh aided and supported people in their last days of their life to be

262
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:17,079
healed in a psychological emotional spiritual way uh that didn't cure them

263
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:24,000
of their illness um so didn't bring them back into physical health but uh

264
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,480
still helped them with profound movement towards healing and it was one of the

265
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:34,880
greatest things I that uh we can do for someone as they're dying or we can do

266
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:41,960
for ourselves if we're dying is to come into that wholeness that personal healing it is

267
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:49,440
possible and uh and uh and it's not the same thing as having a

268
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:57,040
cure so um so what is your experience of personal healing or if you prefer com

269
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:02,400
coming into wholeness and U or if you prefer rather

270
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:08,280
than these positive formulations uh uh becoming

271
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:13,680
undivided um and how does that work for you and

272
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:22,559
how do you move into it and is there space in your life to trust it more to allow for it more to happen it takes

273
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:27,599
time and we have to give ourselves time I like to call it sacred time

274
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:34,440
for this process to unfold within us so those are the 10

275
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:39,960
um Reflections and I'm delighted to have shared it with

276
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:45,800
you and uh and uh if you want more of

277
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:52,079
this then uh in the fall I'm going to do a program through the Sati center that

278
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:58,319
is kind of uh adop adapting some of the things that we do in the uh uh

279
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:04,200
chaplaincy programs I teach that uh that presents it kind of to a lay audience or

280
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:11,400
to people who are not being trained to be chaplain but uh some of the fundamentals of spiritual care and uh

281
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:17,440
one of the things we'll go through over the year is these um 10 themes we did

282
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:24,599
this last two weeks so that's on the Sati Center website if you're interested and then for the next three

283
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:29,680
weeks I won't be here and um teaching a teaching a retreat for the next two

284
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:36,079
weeks and going on a pilgrimage Buddhist pilgrimage uh the following

285
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:42,359
week and um and so next week Shelley G will come a wonderful teacher from Santa

286
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:47,760
Barbara and then may uh Elliot will come and and I don't think we have a teacher

287
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:54,079

288
00:46:54,079 --> 00:47:02,359
hands so thank you very very very much and um I appreciate very much that uh I

289
00:47:02,359 --> 00:47:09,240
had this opportunity to reflect on these themes with you
