1
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:07,560
so hello and welcome

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:17,520
to the Insight Meditation Cent YouTube meditation

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,519
session I'm very happy to sit here with all of you who are

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:31,279
participating so this is the 25th of the

5
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,520
25 sessions introduction to meditation

6
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:44,760
sessions and um and mindfulness has a lot to do with

7
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:51,440
noticing what is happening and with that kind of

8
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,920
emphasis it's easy to overlook that one of the things is H that is

9
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:02,399
happening is the absence of things things disappear and they're no no

10
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,640
longer there suffering disappears and is no longer

11
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:15,520
there and the absence is significant absence allows for

12
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:23,600
silence absence allows for Stillness absence allows for

13
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:30,439
spaciousness and sometimes when we practice mindfulness what stands out as

14
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:36,040
the predominant experience or what stands out as a significant thing to

15
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:42,439
take in let register are these absences the absences of

16
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:47,840
suffering the absence of tension and in that absence there's a

17
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:55,119
kind of nourishment some goodness there sometimes that you want to take in that

18
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:02,399
if we go on to the next happening thing we don't take time to register and receive the benefits

19
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:09,599
of that those absences the absence of noise is silence

20
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:18,000
the absence of agitation is stillness the absence of contraction is space

21
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,480
spaciousness and um these qualities can always be present to some

22
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,640
degree in some ways and certainly search ing for them

23
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,480
or trying to make them happen is not helpful but sometimes they

24
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,319
support mindfulness as we're paying attention to suffering as we're paying attention to

25
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,360
agitation as we're paying attention to ways where the mind is tight and

26
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,120
contracted there can also be a connection

27
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,760
to silence in the noise there's also

28
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:07,879
silence important part of music is the the silence between the

29
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:13,120
notes in the agitation there can be

30
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,840
Stillness probably wouldn't know you were agitated unless there was some reference to

31
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:28,239
Stillness maybe a subconscious one and the absence of

32
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:34,879
contraction just on the edges of the contraction edges of

33
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:42,720
the tightness tension just beyond the edges of our

34
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,400
thoughts there is space so with that as

35
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,480
a introduction maybe during this

36
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:02,760
sitting you can from time to time know notice if any of these qualities

37
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:11,640
of Silence Stillness and space is there for you maybe at the end of every

38
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:21,359
exhale maybe if you let your thoughts drift off away let go of your

39
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:28,600
thoughts maybe there at the end of the sentence that you're saying end of the

40
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,520
image some of these three qualities are

41
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:39,840
there maybe mindfulness

42
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:47,120
itself mindfulness in the middle of everything the mindful the awareness

43
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,120
itself has these

44
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:01,560
qualities maybe in the middle of awareness there is silence

45
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:10,360
Stillness spaciousness and that it makes a world of difference to be

46
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:16,160
aware centered on those qualities then it would be for the

47
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,960
awareness to be also noisy agitated

48
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:30,039
contracted so we'll sit in silence and allow you to

49
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:35,120
be your own teacher give yourself your own guidance

50

for

88
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:11,279
and as we near the end of this sitting

89
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:18,840
finding where in your body do you feel

90
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,960
softness a soft sense of

91
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:32,240
being maybe there soft Ness associated with

92
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,600
breathing maybe with a

93
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:51,120
belly maybe some places on the edge of your body along the skin the

94
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,360
arms the

95
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
chest

96
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:06,120
and is there any softness in the

97
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:15,080
mind maybe it's easy to find tightness and contraction agitation

98
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:20,080
but is there also softness in the

99
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:35,720
mind maybe the softness that is on the edges of the

100
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,760
Mind touching the space and the silence

101
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,480
beyond the

102
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:01,919
mind maybe a softness in the

103
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:15,000
heart and if the Heart Is Not So Soft maybe at the center of the

104
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:22,840
heart inside of the tightness or

105
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:29,440
protectiveness there's a place a spot of softness

106
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:38,679
and in whatever softness you have associated with

107
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:46,559
Maybe Might there also be some sense of

108
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:58,840
Silence the space of the mind that tends to be filled with words words and

109
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:04,200
images now has more silence in it than

110
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:19,600
before a Stillness in the

111
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:29,320
body as softness as soet with spacious

112
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:42,360
feeling and sensing within with outside of you the edges

113
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:48,440
between you and the outer world where there might be

114
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:55,200
Stillness silence

115
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,679
spaciousness that can hold all all

116
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,000
things that is

117
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:13,480
soft and in that Stillness and softness

118
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,240
silence can you

119
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,720
feel a

120
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:34,880
selflessness freedom from self

121
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:59,240
concern and staying centered in all of

122
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:07,240
this bring to mind the world of people and events activities you you'll be

123
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:12,279
involved in today or

124
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:23,519
tomorrow gaze upon it with Stillness and

125
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,159
quiet

126
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:41,320
and bring forth whatever well wishing good will love

127
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:46,080
kindness care you might have for

128
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:53,240
others and let that be supported by the

129
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:59,159

peaceful may all beings be free

134

some of you do before 7:45 uh just wait for

150
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:19,160
me so hello and as I start this uh last talk on

151
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:25,119
introduction to mindfulness meditation um and considering that this

152
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:30,760
is the last of 25 I'd like to say that um I plan to

153
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:37,400
continue with this kind of uh series uh starting next week and maybe we'll call

154
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:46,760
this uh intermediate mindfulness or introduction to mindfulness part two um but I think that

155
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:54,520
uh uh there's much more to to say that kind of Builds on what we've done so far and

156
00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:02,200
and all at the heart of mindfulness practice and for today um the in a sense maybe

157
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:07,960
it's poignant at the very end and also in the end where they this coming to a

158
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:15,400
conclusion that all things must end that all things come to um uh a time when

159
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:21,280
they are not there uh except saved on the internet but all things are are not

160
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:29,280
there and um and that that what follows that the end end of things is an

161
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:35,079
absence and that absence of course can lead us to loneliness and sadness and

162
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:40,119
grief all kinds of things when the things come to an end and we miss them or we love

163
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:48,119
them and there's also something very poignant in absence that uh we can find

164
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:55,440
sometimes in this practice um maybe it depends on what the absence is but one of the key absences

165
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:03,240
we're looking for in the Dharma is the absence of suffering and when that absence is there

166
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:10,720
uh then um uh if that absence is there then uh

167
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:17,920
that is sweet or that is freeing that's uh very nourishing to feel our existence

168
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:24,599
without suffering as part of it and so one of the things that we want to be attuned to when we do mindfulness and

169
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:31,359
recognize is in fact absence um uh there's a very

170
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:36,480
strong instruction in mindfulness practice to pay attention to what is

171
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:43,480
happening but what is happening is uh is certainly the you know Central to this

172
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:49,240
Enterprise but uh what we really want to look at is um not really but we want to

173
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:55,960
also include um when some things are no longer there so if we're no caught up in

174
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:03,200
distracted thinking and it just goes on and on and then when it's absent when it stops finally uh don't just don't go on

175
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:09,839
to the next happening take time to register oh that feels good how it's

176
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:17,440
good that absence of thinking if you're filled with anger and the anger dissipates and disappears take time to

177
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,480
register the goodness of that absence what's available what it feels like to

178
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:31,200
have that absence and absence is doesn't make for a very sharp um object of attention uh it's

179
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:39,240
more amorphous or diffuse or um you know it's uh almost bordering on imagination

180
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:45,200
you know we know we remember in our imagination memory that something was there not here

181
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:51,560
now uh there's tension in our bodies that we carry and that if the tension the

182
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:59,240
tightness in the body dissolves there's the absence of that tension and how does does the body feel then without

183
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:07,680
it um and um so the

184
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:16,359
um um so as we sit and meditate for being mindful of what is part of what is

185
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:22,800
is absence and some of the qualities of absence that uh can stand out sometimes

186
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:29,920
really loud in a sense really strongly is uh the uh an absence that is uh this

187
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:35,040
marvelous sense of Silence in the mind the mind is not thinking so much or

188
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,119
thinking at all uh marvelous sense of

189
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:47,599
Stillness uh I love the image of uh a very still quiet morning Lake before the

190
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,880
sun rises and and there all the animals and birds are quiet and no wind and it's

191
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:58,160
just so peaceful and still sometimes you can feel that that

192
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:07,520
inside and sometimes um there's the uh the absence of um of claustrophobic

193
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:14,000
objects all this stuff happening and Sensations and this and that and there's a sense of spaciousness in

194
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,480
awareness and um a lot of thinking makes the Mind claustrophobic maybe and but

195
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:25,760
the spacious mind has lots of room and the nourishing part of

196
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,440
Stillness silence and spaciousness I associated with uh when there's softness

197
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,920
as part of it or diffusiveness as part of it um where there's not a lot of

198
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:42,839
constructs of self and um where there even self self-centeredness self-c

199
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:48,640
conern drops away there's kind of selfless quality in it and this uh

200
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:56,599
absence of self-concern a absence of self- referencing a absence of self

201
00:40:56,599 --> 00:41:04,680
constructing itself s being itself self measuring everything according to the self a kind of feeling of experience of

202
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:10,520
absence of self even uh is also soft and wonderful and

203
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:20,560
peaceful and and absence has um a quality of um freedom in it and this

204
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:27,119
absence is uh is uh can be all this all these wonderful absences

205
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:33,040
can be experienced in mindfulness itself when mindfulness is just kind of a clear

206
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:39,400
awareness of what is in that clear awareness clear almost like the clarity

207
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:46,000
itself um you can see is the clarity is absence of of smudges absence of

208
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:55,319
obstacles to see and in that Clarity then there's ABS absence of noise absence of agitation

209
00:41:55,319 --> 00:42:00,800
absence of contra ction in the clarity of mind that is mindfulness when

210
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,839
mindfulness is really strong and centered um it's it's characterized by

211
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:13,920
these absences which are almost synonymous with freedom a sense of clear

212
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:21,160
Independence where mindfulness is knows what's happening

213
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:30,200
but in knowing it is independent of what is happening not entangled not caught not

214
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:36,079
reactive and that absence of being caught the absence

215
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:43,119
of being entangled the freedom of suffering that's there this is one of

216
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:50,040
the great experiences that mindfulness can bring and what's wonderful about this is

217
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:56,720
that this kind of Freedom this kind of experience in a certain way is portable

218
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:02,000
you can bring it with you into the world and when the experience of freedom is

219
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,800
strong enough then you probably always have a reference point maybe it's uh

220
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:13,240
it's you know we're too busy sometimes to notice it but just to be able to turn

221
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:19,480
towards it and see ah there's that freedom there's that Refuge of

222
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:26,599
Stillness spaciousness silence softness this Refuge of freedom right

223
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:33,680
there here it's with me and uh and then mindfulness becomes a

224
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:39,960
wonderful nourishment that promotes greater and greater

225
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:46,599
Freedom so thank you for being part of this 25 session introduction to

250
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:09,480

251
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:16,599
okay so wonderful to see you and

252
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,920
uh so maybe people are still

253
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:29,240
coming and um I so I'll start by saying how grateful I

254
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:35,040
am for all of you who come to YouTube it's been a wonderful thing to be able

255
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:44,359
to offer these kinds of teachings and um and uh it was my you know when I first

256
00:47:44,359 --> 00:47:51,240
um decided to dedicate my life to Buddhist Buddhist practice

257
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:57,119
and uh which was now you know over 40 years ago

258
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:03,240
uh I um image I had for myself was that uh I would be I was going to be as Zen

259
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:09,240
priest as and Monk and I'd have the key to a small storefront um Meditation

260
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:14,960
Center in some City and um that pretty much was just like a room that I had the

261
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:21,800
key and I'd keep it clean the place and I'd go early in the morning and open up the door and sit and meditate with

262
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:28,920
whatever whoever came to support their meditation and so this AA of getting up in the morning and sitting with people

263
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:35,440
uh was something that's always been in my mind as a central part of what you know my life was going to be about and I

264
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:41,960
do that on Retreats uh certainly I'm very happy I get up for the first sitting and I love sit doing it but here

265
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:47,319
since the we started this YouTube at in California at 7 a.m. I just delight at

266
00:48:47,319 --> 00:48:54,280
the chance to get up in the morning get ready have breakfast and then come down here and be able to sit with people and

267
00:48:54,280 --> 00:49:01,160
it's not quite a storefront with we have here but um uh I don't know exactly what

268
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:07,000
this YouTube space is but um it's uh very very satisfying and I'm happy to be

269
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:14,240
a part of this and to do this and um the

270
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:22,280
um and the idea I don't I don't can't imagine that we we'll stop doing this YouTube now um you know when I when as

271
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:28,400
you know when I go away and to do something then I we have this wonderful teachers who come and teach for me and I

272
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:33,799
can imagine someday in the future that maybe there'll be a transition where I teach less and some of those teachers

273
00:49:33,799 --> 00:49:40,880
teach more but for the time being I have no plans to do things differently um as we're doing it

274
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:47,319
now and then um uh you know I do I do have some some

275
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:55,160
concern for how to continue to support those of you who primary connection is through YouTube this way and uh some of

276
00:49:55,160 --> 00:50:02,040
you might might find it very interesting to um some of you already do is that uh

277
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:08,559
with the pandemic uh We've started to offer Retreats dayong Retreats and longer

278
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:13,680
Retreats uh res uh um uh on zoom and

279
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:21,200
some of them are called hybrid where uh participants are some PE participants are in person at our retreat center and

280
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:28,119
then there's lots of people who can do it more people can do it online on Zoom then or can do it in person and it's not

281
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:33,160
uncommon for us to have Retreats with 100 people on zoom and 40 people at the

282
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:39,319
retreat center which is the maximum we can hold and um and then we have day longs

283
00:50:39,319 --> 00:50:45,559
as well on Zoom that uh through IRC I'm doing one I think I'm doing

284
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:52,319
one maybe in a couple of weeks in a week or so so

285
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:57,839
um anyway so wanting to support you in some way and so hopefully we do some of

286
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:03,040
them and and I know that Matthew Bren also wants to have something uh wants to

287
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:08,520
do offer something for us on YouTube um and I need to be in conversation with

288
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:16,000
him and how he wants to maybe add an additional thing uh weekly which I think be quite wonderful many of you know him

289
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:22,920
and find him wonderful and and you know and of course some many of you know that Nikki mapori and now Liz Powell and some

290
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:27,960
others are also offering happy hour sometimes on YouTube um so there's more

291
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:34,200
and more available as we go along here so um do you guys have any

292
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:41,200
questions you'd like to ask maybe from this uh inter meditation series or from

293
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:47,960
um anything at all that's somehow related to what we're doing here and it would be best if you can raise your hand

294
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:54,200
your Zoom hand which means that if you don't know how this in the bottom screen of your screen there's a menu in there

295
00:51:54,200 --> 00:52:02,079
it should say reaction and um and now as you finally a chance you're allowed to have a reaction um and

296
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:07,839
um and and push a button and um to and

297
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:14,640
I'll see your hand and can call on you so I see p

298
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:23,839
Padma let's see wait second I have to I see p oh let's see what oh hang on a

299
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:30,839
minute I have to I have to um uh change some things here I have to

300
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:36,839
go find the YouTube and and make it

301
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,440
silent

302
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:59,960
somehow okay so YouTube is now silent

303
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:05,799
see you see I um I turn off the sound on my laptop

304
00:53:05,799 --> 00:53:12,880
when I do this uh and so then I forget to turn it on and when I do it's confusing so now I think I'm ready let's

305
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:19,200
let's try again Padma okay can you hear yes thank you thank you Gil thank you

306
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:25,640
thank you for all your services and U I'm grateful that IMC came into my live

307
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:32,000
like 7 years ago and it's been nothing but bliss fall um couple of questions um

308
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,880
so you know I attended all these 25 sessions um even though I've been practicing for a while I'm still a

309
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:44,079
beginner um and you know I do notice it and it's really nice when I notice that

310
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:51,760
how the mind is going um and uh but my question is that isn't the noticing part

311
00:53:51,760 --> 00:54:00,240
still the mind that's question question number one question number two is completely different which is you know I

312
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:06,079
had this thought for a while I think I talked to a couple of teachers too it's like I wish IMC has this community

313
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:12,520
living I want to just live and breathe in the community um so what are your thoughts on that I mean it's like more

314
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:18,799
like going into the monastery style I guess I don't know but I I think it would be such a great thing to have it

315
00:54:18,799 --> 00:54:25,720
in California and I'm sure I'd love to contribute in any way I can thank thank you very very good questions so the

316
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:30,880
first one let me see if I can repeat it um we we're practicing mindfulness of

317
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:37,359
everything mindfulness of the mind but the mindfulness itself the noting itself is the mind and so you're a little

318
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:44,280
confused about that like how can the Mind know itself or you're kind of stuck in the mind you can't get out of it um

319
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:51,160
it's not like I'm stuck it is nice I do get that moments of the just whatever you call the quietness Stillness and I

320
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:58,240
don't even feel my body and it's beautiful you know it's just like a floating Sun and then slowly I'm like is it still my

321
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:05,880
mind you know um but I'm not stuck there you know I'm just going through the waves still right yeah yes that's nice

322
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:11,520
yeah so I don't think you should worry about it the um the yes every in a c

323
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:19,240
certain kind of way everything is mind uh and um and uh sometimes it seems

324
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:25,440
like we're surfacing to make a note to recognize what's going on and so you just

325
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:30,680
recognize oh I feel like I'm surfacing and then you uh let make the note maybe

326
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:38,119
or don't make a note and sometimes you can start feeling yourself surface as you the intention to note come up with a

327
00:55:38,119 --> 00:55:46,160
thought arises and then you say no thank you and then you you settle back in again and uh and just be relaxed about

328
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:51,480
it all because it's the rhythm of maybe coming up and having a note and then not

329
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:57,880
being not being ruffled by it and then you settle again and there are times when there's no need to make any note

330
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:03,920
there's no need for the the the the to to have this active recognition but

331
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:09,760
that's mostly when things are very very quiet and still and empty and um but

332
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:15,960
it'll it'll come in and come out and your job is just to be at ease with whatever happens at that

333
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:22,319
point and so and and part of that ease is uh at this point no need to figure it

334
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:27,599
out because that's that's that's agitated mind if that's figuring it out

335
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:35,640
does that does that help yes okay so then with um with the

336
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:44,280
um um this you know uh retirement kind of uh retirement community or IMC you

337
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:50,079
know kind of uh place where people can live together um that would be lovely to have

338
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:56,079
and uh sometimes I've thought it would be nice to uh there's an apartment building next door here here and I don't

339
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:02,039
know how many units it has maybe 10 units or something I thought wow if we or someone could buy it we could have a

340
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:07,480
community people living right next door and that would be nice and and you know

341
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:13,680
people are complicated so it'll have it'll have its other aspects and then

342
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:18,880
the other is um been many people have asked for is is in fact a kind of

343
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:25,119
retirement community and um and the San Francisco Zen Center has just opened one

344
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:32,359
uh that uh took maybe took 15 years of uh or uh uh

345
00:57:32,359 --> 00:57:37,680
planning uh at least 10 years of planning and no maybe maybe almost 20

346
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:43,160
years um they didn't know what they were doing so one person with uh their the

347
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:49,799
vice president at a certain time with not a lot of support from the community thought we have to do this and and

348
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:57,160
researched and planned and created the connections to make it happen and they failed and they started again and then

349
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:02,280
it worked and now I think it has 200 units and people are now moving in and

350
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:08,599
some of the people I've I've talked to who moved in there love it up there it's a kind of a Buddhist retirement

351
00:58:08,599 --> 00:58:14,480
community and it's actually a Buddhist Quaker they kind of a partnership with the Quakers which is kind of

352
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:22,359
special and um so what I've seen from San Francisco Zen Center there's there there's a um model in this country uh

353
00:58:22,359 --> 00:58:27,559
for how to create retirement communities that's supported by some of the churches

354
00:58:27,559 --> 00:58:34,640
some of the big denominations have these these nonprofit Wings this is what they do is they create retirement communities

355
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:40,960
and the Quakers have a preeminent one they really people they really high quality and caring kind of way of doing

356
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:49,720
it and other uh and so there's a way of doing it and partnering with people who are in the business of it but um it's a

357
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:56,400
lot of work uh you know maybe if if one person put their whole full time uh task to it

358
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:03,440
that could probably be done but um um I can't you know I would love to

359
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:12,760
see it happen for us but I don't see the volunteer who's going to step forward to make it happen unless you want to do

360
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:17,078
it thanks again thank

361
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:25,599
you okay so I see a hand I got looking the wrong place and for that I have to

362
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:29,640
put on my glasses Mary

363
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:37,200
Lou well thank you Gil these weeks have been so helpful and I'm glad we're going

364
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:43,960
to go deeper um in the coming weeks um my question today is about earlier this

365
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:49,319
week you were discussing the aperture of mindfulness moving close or moving far

366
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:58,720
away and lately um I've had some oh uh work anxiety concern for another being

367
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:07,440
and there's not much I can do really about the situation and I have just had waves of

368
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:15,000
emotion during on the cushion and off the cushion and of course when it happens on the cushion there's a part of

369
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:21,079
me that's like no I want to be settling and following the guidance but I can't

370
01:00:21,079 --> 01:00:28,319
there is no way it feels like I can step further away um so then I just follow

371
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:36,319
what I believe is the instruction that if something's predominant you stay there and it EBS and flows you know

372
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:42,039
comes and goes but I guess so my question is is there a skillful way or

373
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:47,799
should I or could I be learning to step further away when something like that

374
01:00:47,799 --> 01:00:54,680
happens and what does um widening an aperture even about maybe something not

375
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:59,799
is is is you know emotional how does that work how does it look to step

376
01:00:59,799 --> 01:01:05,559
further away great wonderful question so it stood out for me that when you talked

377
01:01:05,559 --> 01:01:11,200
about uh you're talking specifically you're talking about um how to be

378
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:18,240
mindful with it how to be and you know there's other other practices to do like equinity that might be helpful sometimes

379
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:25,000
but but let's just stay with the mindfulness for now and uh and it struck me that you talked about it being waves

380
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:32,039
you talked about it the es and flows so you see so there's some freedom in you to be able to just let it pass through

381
01:01:32,039 --> 01:01:37,640
and and and kind of go kind of be there and know that it's passing through as opposed to getting locked into it so

382
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:42,920
you're already in a good sh good spot one of the things that might be helpful

383
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:48,799
because of how you're practicing with it uh is to kind of just accept that oh

384
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:55,079
this is The Human Condition uh people have had this kind of feelings this kind of kind of loss

385
01:01:55,079 --> 01:02:00,440
this kind of concern for people for Millennia this is The Human

386
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:06,000
Condition and not not to dismiss it or belittle it but to kind of allow

387
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:12,680
yourself to accept your humanity and you know this is how this is life is hard life is has this part as

388
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:20,039
part of it and in some sense of course we want to have this capacity to feel sadness and concern because because we

389
01:02:20,039 --> 01:02:26,839
love and this is the this is part of Love um so so then with that kind of

390
01:02:26,839 --> 01:02:33,799
acceptance then very carefully and maybe lovingly uh just allow it to be there

391
01:02:33,799 --> 01:02:40,960
allow it just be and move through you and move through you but pay attention to it until maybe you start seeing oh

392
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:48,039
look at that there's resistance there look at that there's I'm holding on to something there or look at that there's

393
01:02:48,039 --> 01:02:54,400
a uh uh I'm thinking of myself as a victim of all this and so that e that

394
01:02:54,400 --> 01:03:00,240
you know and so you want to see where the extra is what are you doing that's extra without

395
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:06,440
disrespecting the basic feeling because it might be you know it's that very normal what you're experiencing but

396
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:14,440
slowly teas apart what's extra where the attachments are or the clinging is or something or maybe you assign meaning to

397
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:20,720
it and this assigning a meaning is after while that's extra you know it may just be more simple with

398
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:26,640
it and that Clarity then might help you to do what you're asking to do to step

399
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:34,640
away from it um which is and and one way to do that more specifically is um uh is

400
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:41,520
to use Mental noting so you know I don't exactly what it is but let's call it waves for now

401
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:49,599
just generic um there's a wave and then you can fe uh just recognize it as wave

402
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:55,760
but pay attention to the tone of voice in which you're saying it with because the way way that you're relating to it

403
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:02,440
you're involved with it in might be contained in the voice you know you might be saying you know you might be a

404
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:07,960
little bit afraid of it and so oh wave coming oh wave you know and you can feel

405
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:15,160
hear that in the voice or you can or it's anger or you can or confusion or something and see if you can find a

406
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:22,200
place to use the mental note that's free of that reactivity and that might create the

407
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:30,279
distance you're looking for the bigger you're looking for then it might be easier to oh okay um now I have this

408
01:04:30,279 --> 01:04:34,920
bigger uh point of view to hold it

409
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:42,000
in yes thank you so thank

410
01:04:42,839 --> 01:04:50,798
you so then uh is it uh

411
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:59,200
Zoo how do you pronounce your name Zoo okay you're still

412
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:11,920
muted maybe I can help you oh with

413
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:20,640
that there we go got it great okay um so

414
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:25,960
my question is about my um posture um

415
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:35,720
I was unable to sit for a very long time so I started lying down with my back on the floor and my legs on a chair um and

416
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:42,200
I've been doing that for maybe two or 3 years and finally the injury has

417
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:51,000
resolved itself and I can actually sit again and I find that

418
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:57,279
um I actually get much deeper lying down and much more relaxed and much more able

419
01:05:57,279 --> 01:06:05,440
to stop uh the mind is much much calmer so now that I sit the meditation

420
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:11,960
does not go as deep and I'm wondering about that um you know whether

421
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:19,079
I if it's okay to be lying down or whether I should try sit um sitting

422
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:26,039
again if if you have an opinion about that would be great great well certainly

423
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:31,640
uh it's fine to continue the way you were if that worked well for you and

424
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:38,799
you're learning something very significant from that deep piece that you have there at some point you I hope

425
01:06:38,799 --> 01:06:46,960
that you become interested in uh how to carry some of what you're experiencing in meditation into your daily life the

426
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:54,359
the line the mind that's in meditation and the mind that's outside meditation is the same mind it's your mind and so

427
01:06:54,359 --> 01:07:00,520
you know there's no you know to limit that possibility of that peace you have in meditation and not the rest of your

428
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:06,000
life is a you know is unfortunate you why not you know have it be

429
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:13,480
continuous and so a big part of mindfulness practice at some point is practicing in daily life and uh and uh

430
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:19,359
bringing this into daily life so one possibility is that um sitting in in the

431
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:26,880
ight meditation posture is the uh is the uh is the is the intermediary that'll

432
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:32,359
help you bring it into daily life so you can do one of two things you can

433
01:07:32,359 --> 01:07:38,440
continue with lying on the floor the way you have been for your primary

434
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:45,359
meditation and then when that finishes if you have time um uh stretch your legs

435
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:51,440
do something that you know prepares you and then go back and sit uh in upright

436
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:56,599
position uh but you have the momentum you have the still the the residue of

437
01:07:56,599 --> 01:08:01,720
the earlier meditation that you get to kind of bring that deeper piece there

438
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:08,599
into that posture because you already prepared yourself and then you get to explore what it's like there with the

439
01:08:08,599 --> 01:08:14,319
idea is at some point you're going to explore what it's like to start bringing some quality of it uh some

440
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:19,679
characteristic of into your daily life so that's one thing you can do the

441
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:25,199
other you can do is just say well I've done now a few years of this floor thing

442
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:30,920
and uh that was uh meditation with u uh training wheels and now I'm want to take

443
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:38,000
off the training wheels and just jump right into sitting upright and it's going to take a while to get to the same place but that's that that's you know

444
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,080
when you take off the training wheels you're a little wobbly on the bike so you're you know a little bit wobbly

445
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:49,000
sitting upright and it'll take a while you're so fortunate to have had this reference point this possibility and now

446
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:55,600
you're going to learn it in upright and that what you learn there will be a great foundation for taking it into life

447
01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:00,838
so those are the two things I suggest thank you so much wonderful

448
01:09:00,839 --> 01:09:07,719
thank you thank you Captain

449
01:09:07,719 --> 01:09:14,520
hi hi girl thanks so much for all these teachings today the softness I think at

450
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:19,838
the end especially was really helpful and it's kind of related to my question

451
01:09:19,839 --> 01:09:25,798
which is I notice when I'm not today maybe but there's been other dayses

452
01:09:25,799 --> 01:09:34,758
where you've talked about resting your eyes in their sockets and also like relaxing the belly and I find both of

453
01:09:34,759 --> 01:09:40,120
those very challenging um especially

454
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:47,600
when um sitting upright for my belly I can't quite figure out how to relax it

455
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:54,679
sometimes and then I think I create stories around it that I'm trying to relax but also I also can't figure out

456
01:09:54,679 --> 01:10:02,120
how to get my eyes it feels like they're just constantly looking and I wondered just if you had any thoughts about that

457
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:10,280
yeah so with the eyes uh the eyes often most of the time will

458
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:17,280
be gently moving in the sockets just kind of floating in there so if that's what's

459
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:22,760
doing just be relaxed that's fine but if it's you're actively kind of more looking you know like every time if

460
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:28,320
there's a you're left knee hurts and you can see your eyes kind of like go and almost you know your eyes are closed but

461
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:36,080
you're kind of looking in that direction then you're uh too involved and so the first line of how to practice with that

462
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:42,520
is um be content just knowing that's the case it's just one more thing to be

463
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:49,440
mindful of oh look there I'm doing my thing again just that's how it feels this is what how it is now and just

464
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:54,560
there's something very profound about being relaxed about anything that's going on including something you think

465
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:59,640
shouldn't be happening um drop this shouldn't be happening just um okay this

466
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:06,280
is how it is I'm just supposed to be mindful how things is and this is how it is and that kind of that acceptance that

467
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:11,800
kind of clarity and then really seeing it that itself over time begins to relax

468
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:17,640
those things so that's one possibility the other possibility is to

469
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:23,000
spend some time actively relaxing the the eyes at least um feeling where the

470
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:31,040
tension is maybe spend you know five minutes at the at some point during the sitting doing a a scanning of eye scan

471
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:37,920
and uh just scan all around the eyes the inside where where's the tension where's the holding what does it feel like to be

472
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:45,159
looking this way I am my my eyes a little bit popping out of their sockets are they like I'm reaching out

473
01:11:45,159 --> 01:11:52,480
into the world to grab something or is there some emotion that's connected to there oh look some people their eyes are

474
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:57,840
a manifestation of of anxiety it's oh there's a little bit of apprehension

475
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:04,880
there that's interesting so then you then it becomes apprehension meditation you know leave the eyes alone and just

476
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:10,000
connect to the anxiety that might be there um so those are some things you

477
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:16,199
can do and I don't know if that resonated with you with the eyes with the belly it might be have something to

478
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:22,320
do with the posture you're sitting in uh so you might see if there's an

479
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:29,199
other posture that's more upright or I don't know if you use a back rest or not in chair but maybe sit away you know sit

480
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:36,120
sit in such a way that there's a little curve in the lower back so that you know at least in principle gravity will pull

481
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:42,080
your your belly forward and um but you know I carried a lot of

482
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:49,800
tension in my belly when I started meditating and uh it was surprised to me how much and I would relax it I could do

483
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:55,960
that and it would last for half a second and uh and so I didn't make it

484
01:12:55,960 --> 01:13:02,440
like a constant project but after a while it just became an ordinary everyday kind of thing and meditation

485
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:07,719
that three four five times in the course of 40 minute meditation I'd relax my

486
01:13:07,719 --> 01:13:14,360
belly and then I didn't worry or wasn't concerned that half a second later it got tied again it was just okay this is

487
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:19,880
how it is and then after year some years of doing that the belly started to stay

488
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:27,239
more and more relaxed now I don't know if you have the patience for years but um I didn't mind because I I

489
01:13:27,239 --> 01:13:32,560
wasn't really trying to I didn't have an idea that it should be different and

490
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:38,360
that was kind of a Saving Grace for me I just okay I'm tense I'll relax nope it

491
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:44,199
that was nice for a half a second but and then I went on with my meditation while thinking about it for another 10

492
01:13:44,199 --> 01:13:51,840
minutes and then I tried again and so so uh so that kind of ease with it all

493
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:56,920
usually works well that is so helpful thank you very much

494
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:03,880
thank you nice to see you nice to see you so Emperor

495
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:10,760
empero actually this is uh Nate I'm on my mom's Zoom accidentally I thought it was mine

496
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:16,120
hi hello yeah I've been I've been meditating with you almost I think a

497
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:21,440
year and three months right I caught Co just to tell you a little I'm not going

498
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:28,120
to go on and on I caught Co I was having long Co symptoms and um I was told by a

499
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:35,400
community that had autoimmune disorder to meditate and I can tell you today right now I'm much more active and I'm

500
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:44,360
much more happier since meditation I really am um but I get a lot of pressure in my

501
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:51,400
in my scalp here here a lot of lot of pressure ears everything lot of

502
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:56,880
pressure and um I I just remember you uh saying things

503
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:02,760
in class breathe into the chaos right and and that's actually helped me a lot

504
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:09,040
expand and relax great that's yeah very good that sounds

505
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:15,080
excellent I mean so I mean one of the primary kind of uh aspects of

506
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:20,320
mindfulness is what I already said now is to in a certain way accept what's

507
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:26,000
happening don't fight it don't be concerned but be mindful of it uh so you

508
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:31,840
want to bring your your your mindfulness to that tension and do a guided tour of

509
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:38,000
your attention like high tension we're friends we've been around for a while and then just kind of scan around feel

510
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:43,320
where it's happening in your body and then if you can breathe with it or breathe through it and expand with it in

511
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:49,159
it or with it like you do fantastic so you're on the right you're on the right

512
01:15:49,159 --> 01:15:56,000
track um yeah you know it that's changed my life I no longer have anxiety

513
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:01,360
depression um it's I used to have really bad I was in the house for like five

514
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:09,360
years I had gor phobia I I it was so bad and this has allowed me to just sit and

515
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:16,719
confront I started with Zen meditation and like how you started uhhuh that was really

516
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:24,560
difficult and I come from a really religious background like I learned my Rosary in Latin and I had an experience

517
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:33,040
in My Religion but then I've had my experiences with meditation which are all my very personal ones yes fantastic

518
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:38,400
well I'm very happy to hear this and um one one thing you might consider since

519
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:43,600
you brought up this topic of the pressure in your head is that for some

520
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:48,639
people uh that happens when uh they're medit when they're meditating they're

521
01:16:48,639 --> 01:16:55,600
trying too hard yeah I know I know that I read up on this okay am I trying too hard I keep

522
01:16:55,600 --> 01:17:03,400
going and it might not it might not be so but it sounds like you're finding your way very well and I think my job

523
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:09,679
listening to you is to uh uh celebrate with you how well you're doing and how

524
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:16,719
well this meditation has worked for you and and how well you're finding your way and uh maybe more than just celebrate

525
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:25,280
with you maybe I can be your cheerleader thank you I want you to use your strong voice one time though to

526
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:30,880
you okay meditate

527
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:36,360
meditate have a good morning man thank you very much great thank

528
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:40,719
you so

529
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:48,719
Steve yes I'm amazed that I have this opportunity to speak to you Gil it's

530
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:54,639
it's um you've been one of my guers um one of my my guides for the last few

531
01:17:54,639 --> 01:18:00,400
years actually I started listening to you in audio DH many years ago so it's really an honor to and I want to course

532
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:07,800
express my gratitude right now but I do have a Dharma question um I um well it's more of a

533
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:16,040
psychological or Dharma question it's about um unpleasant emotions and um the

534
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:21,960
resistance to them I you know I think I through you and other teachers i' I've

535
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:27,199
I've recognized that there's distinction between the two of them and I've been working with the resistance I really

536
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:34,560
think I've made some some Headway on that I think there's tightness in my chest and my worry about what I'm

537
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:40,040
feeling have I I well I've been able to actually the tightest in my chest is is

538
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:46,560
really vanished through just kind of feeling into it but there's some unpleasant emotions that are still there

539
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:54,199
that have been refreshed for good reasons because they're unpleasant and especially fear fear is um I I've tried

540
01:18:54,199 --> 01:19:00,600
to um just feel into that but it doesn't work it seems like

541
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:05,760
it it overwhelms me and I know you've been um you have a great way of of

542
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:11,520
addressing my personal concerns on on your morning um talks and so you I've

543
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:17,199
heard you say it before but what if it's overwhelming what can you really do

544
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:22,239
about fear how do you work with it is it maybe I should use meta or some some

545
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:28,040
other hack or something because I just can't dive into the fear it overwhelms

546
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:33,719
me great well thank you this is very important what you're bringing up and it's this is a you know you're not alone

547
01:19:33,719 --> 01:19:41,840
with this kind of concern and so I appreciate the chance to answer this not just for you but for others as well the

548
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:48,440
um so you know it's it's very personal ideally the answer that the teacher

549
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:56,000
gives is very personal and really knows a person well because uh fear can be

550
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:03,120
debilitating and uh and fear can be connected to extremely deep things inside that maybe it's better to work

551
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:09,000
with a really good therapist uh with this so with so so we have to take a

552
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:17,320
little bit of a grain of salt what I'm about to say and uh and consider whether it suits you but here I'll tell you I I

553
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:25,080
am having um I do have a a therapist I'm not sure if it's a really good therapist but I'm not asking for um I do I do just

554
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:30,760
see the distinction between the two um job descriptions you're but I'm asking

555
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:38,840
from a Dharma perspective yeah yes yes so um uh I would

556
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:45,880
uh uh find circumstances where you feel pretty safe

557
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:53,040
maybe for you it's safest you know if you know you have your therapist later in the day for example or find a

558
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:58,960
circumstance where you know uh where you don't have to do anything for that day

559
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:04,280
and you feel like you can kind of you know just be yourself for a while or

560
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:11,520
recover or uh make sure you know get get you I don't know what anything at all make yourself safe even if it means

561
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:16,560
getting an extra lock for your door or something whatever it makes your heart your mind feel like okay it's this now

562
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:21,840
it's safe or have a friend nearby um and then meditate with the

563
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:28,320
fear and let yourself be

564
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:34,040
overwhelmed try that and and uh and uh and let it take

565
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:39,800
its course but the way to do this to let let

566
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:49,639
let it be overwhelming is have a good meditation posture that you do not

567
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:56,280
compromise so for example you wouldn't collapse you know or you know or tense up and

568
01:21:56,280 --> 01:22:03,320
start pulling away or you know you would just you know hopefully it's a nice comfortable po enough Co posture but you

569
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:08,360
you stay in the posture and then whatever overwhelm you're having and

570
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:16,120
fear you're having compost it in the body let the body hold it let the body

571
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:22,280
process it just bring it back and feel how it is in the body so compost in the body is the same thing as feeling it in

572
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:27,600
the body body and just come back feeling the body as opposed to the stories and

573
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:36,360
the some of the mental reactivity that might be and uh and if you can relax the body around the fear great so you so

574
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:43,800
really see it through let it overwhelm you overwhelm you with those conditions I just provided and see what happens on

575
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:51,000
the other side of the overwhelm is there I know this is a

576
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:57,120
dangerous question for the you asked you mentioned my therapist should be should be helping me as well but is it you're

577
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:04,920
giving me a you're you're implying that there's a there's good things on the other side yes you give me a faith of

578
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:10,880
that yes I'm applying there's good things on the other side and uh it's possible to live without

579
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:17,440
fear and anxiety and so some people will do this on Retreats meditation Retreats

580
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:22,600
uh because there it's it's very safe and you have the whole day to kind of let it

581
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:29,000
wind or process and you don't have to go to work you don't have to talk to people and uh so some people find that's good

582
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:36,719
place and whether it's a right place for you uh it might be something you want to ask your therapist uh and say you know

583
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:43,080
I'm thinking about doing a retreat or something or um dayong Retreat you can do the one on zoom we're going to have

584
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:48,880
soon um and um but ask you know ask your therapist because I I don't know you I

585
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:54,560
don't know how intense it is and what can happen with with uh fear is it there

586
01:23:54,560 --> 01:24:01,120
can you know you know there can be panic attacks it could uh it rather than finding more uh uh

587
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:07,800
mindfulness uh it triggers more fear and then it kind of spirals out and so if you if if you notice that it's really

588
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:13,880
spiraling out um you have to be cautious maybe it's not healthy for you but if um

589
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:20,480
but overwhelm and spiraling out are two different things so so uh so you have to be able

590
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:27,840
to be Discerning about what's happening but but in principle that's what I recommend you that you uh you just uh

591
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:33,159
trust it trust the process and and open to it let it be overwhelming and breathe

592
01:24:33,159 --> 01:24:38,520
and stay and stay and if you stayed for a long time 40 minutes 45 minutes with

593
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:45,000
it then maybe get up and do some walking meditation or walk around the block and then come back and

594
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:52,480
continue I could go um I know that I don't want to I think this a short question the your the routine of your

595
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:57,520
Retreats I'm sure other people would be interested in hearing the general

596
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:05,600
routine because I've been to a Zen Retreat and I kind of know the traditional Zen session format do is

597
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:12,400
that an appropriate question to answer right now or I could ask a on teacher uh yeah it's fine the we have I think we

598
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:19,080
have the schedule for our Retreats on our website but the difference between Zen and our Retreats Insight Retreats is

599
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:26,119
and Zen the schedule is required everyone has to show up and in our Retreats the schedule is a

600
01:25:26,119 --> 01:25:31,960
recommendation and so if you need to take a break it's easy to take a

601
01:25:33,239 --> 01:25:40,000
break and so you know but we have a lot of sitting through the day sitting and walking meditation in Zen the walking

602
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:46,760
meditation is usually 10 minutes for us it's a 30 to 45 minutes so there's a bigger kind of break between sits in

603
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:57,440
that way great so then we have

604
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:04,560
Susan hey folks hi David

605
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:13,239
um sort of along the same lines I don't have a teacher I don't have

606
01:26:13,239 --> 01:26:20,920
never done Refuge or any of that so but I do read and I study on my own and I've

607
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:27,480
been coming to these sessions for um quite a

608
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:38,239
while but one of the things that I'm sort of trying to um figure out

609
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:45,760
is we are told and Neuroscience tells us that the things that we focus on become

610
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:52,440
stronger stronger and stronger like rots in your mind whether they're emotions or whether they're thought stories or or

611
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:58,960
whether they're whatever um and in the Buddhist you

612
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:07,239
know um interpretation that would be the more you you know more thoughts or um

613
01:27:07,239 --> 01:27:14,560
attitudes you uh have in your mind that's what's going to

614
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:19,800
become a stronger inclination for your mind for your attitudes and then

615
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:26,199
eventually I guess becomes part of your character or that's what's built your character so

616
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:34,480
we are also instructed to when something comes up that's not

617
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:42,840
particularly helpful wise you know it's um that to sort of sit with it and feel

618
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:49,520
it even more and more and more and I'm wondering where's that line

619
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:55,639
between okay it's um what is it desensitization therapy you know letting

620
01:27:55,639 --> 01:28:04,880
the spiders crawl all over you until you're no longer afraid of spiders and when is it um indulging the fear or the

621
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:11,719
emotion thought even more yes this is a very important question thank you and uh

622
01:28:11,719 --> 01:28:18,440
it's very important that we can start Discerning the difference between participating in difficult States

623
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:24,360
activities of the mind that reinforces him for example versus uh uh being

624
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:29,440
mindful of them which is is uh a different uh track in the

625
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:36,159
mind it's a different activity of the mind that we're trying to reinforce and strengthen not trying to uh strengthen

626
01:28:36,159 --> 01:28:43,520
our neurosis and so the um uh so uh uh but

627
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:49,719
some people can't it's it's difficult to see the difference between between the two the way that we get involved and

628
01:28:49,719 --> 01:28:55,520
participate and in our NE kind of negative mind States uh is

629
01:28:55,520 --> 01:29:01,320
almost us unconscious and so we bring mindfulness to it and the mindfulness itself is just

630
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:10,199
more of the same as before and it's we are then reinforcing it and so it's not so healthy so uh one

631
01:29:10,199 --> 01:29:17,880
of the uh instructions I offered uh this last week or two was the idea that um

632
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:23,920
when you when you're mindful of something like especially it was for thinking thinking mind

633
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:31,159
is um do it for only three breaths because that might be enough to

634
01:29:31,159 --> 01:29:38,119
kind of uh inter interrupt the usual way in which we're feeding the thinking

635
01:29:38,119 --> 01:29:43,719
mind but we're not uh we're then not likely to keep keep somehow

636
01:29:43,719 --> 01:29:51,400
unconsciously feeding it and then we come back to the breathing and then it might be a few breaths later you go back and notice thinking again but uh but not

637
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:58,520
just stay on it all the time and that principle might also be true for some emotions that uh if we stay with some

638
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:04,080
emotions too long like with fear it might be that with fear um there's it's

639
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:09,400
uh it's almost automatic that some fear is carried in the mindfulness itself

640
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:16,600
which then maybe subtly is subtly not so subtly is reinforcing the fear but if we do three breaths with fear and then

641
01:30:16,600 --> 01:30:24,040
return to the just breathing for a while and then relax and then three breaths with fear that might support uh this

642
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:31,400
shifting of the of what's being uh developed in the mind and we are in

643
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:38,239
Buddhism trying to develop positive states of Mind by their repetition by feeding them and some of the positive

644
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:44,480
states of Mind are mindfulness so uh Joy uh

645
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:50,639
Tranquility uh uh concentration or this kind of steadiness of mind

646
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:57,600
equinity um there's a faith that we want to we want to strengthen um the kind of trust or

647
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:03,360
confidence we want to strengthen so there are kind of good states of mind

648
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:10,280
that uh we want to recognize and and um and allow for and but what happens with

649
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:18,040
the best states of mind that comes with meditation uh they're there because of the absence of other hindrances they're

650
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:25,000
not there because we're participating in them and so then we're allowing for them we're kind of getting out of the way

651
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:32,679
we're more like making room for them so they can grow and spread rather than engineering them or trying to push them

652
01:31:32,679 --> 01:31:38,960
to be better or something um so when the when the self is involved with self uh

653
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:45,639
when uh too much self concern is involved with the mindfulness then chances are we're

654
01:31:45,639 --> 01:31:52,400
feeding the wrong thing when well you bringing up another

655
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:57,440
the other flip side of it for me in terms of

656
01:31:57,440 --> 01:32:02,400
the kind of difficult

657
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:07,719
um easy way that you can um subtly shift

658
01:32:07,719 --> 01:32:14,320
things so the idea of the positive states of

659
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:24,040
Mind At what point are I mean the idea that maybe um shifting in that way is also a

660
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:31,280
way of suppressing and denying you know okay I'm going to suppress and deny and

661
01:32:31,280 --> 01:32:39,360
allow I can allow certain things to Bubble Up but I have to push something else's you know see what I'm not very

662
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:47,199
experienced at this so this is what I see my own I worry you know like okay is

663
01:32:47,199 --> 01:32:52,440
this really something that's naturally um it you know sort of

664
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:57,880
drifting off because I've let it go and something positive is coming up or

665
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:06,239
really is that subconscious suppression repression um and

666
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:13,080
then you know grasping after something that has a nice um sound to it you know

667
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:18,280
like um you know equinity or whatever sure and sort of labeling it so I feel

668
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:24,480
okay that's okay but in fact it's really um disengagement from something I don't

669
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:31,480
want to feel and these are all things happening kind of yeah at the margins of

670
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:38,480
subconscious yes great so the fact that you're uh concerned with this thinking about this is a good sign this is

671
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:43,679
healthy and appropriate to have this kind of self-reflection these kinds of questions so I appreciate that quite a

672
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:49,400
bit um the other but uh the fact that you have it I would like to uh suggest

673
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:57,280
to you that uh that uh you have a Discerning mind you don't have to be actively using

674
01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:04,560
it as much as you're using that uh uh it's there for to support you that what you need to do is

675
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:11,320
to trust the practice and that everything will be be be revealed over time so if you're

676
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:17,960
repressing things a you know it's not not a crime to repress things so I

677
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:24,719
wouldn't you know treat it as a crime it's like you know you know you're you know you're not a bad Buddhist because you're repressing things there might be

678
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:32,000
good reasons to repress it might be better than the alternative for some people so uh but if you're

679
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:37,719
mindful um uh and learning to be mindful of the body and with time you get to be

680
01:34:37,719 --> 01:34:43,880
mindful of your reactivity the tensions in your body and sooner or later you'll

681
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:49,600
start noticing you're repressing you'll see it and feel it and then the practice

682
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:56,360
becomes self-correcting and don't be don't be ahead of yourself don't guess and worry

683
01:34:56,360 --> 01:35:03,840
that it might be happening if you want just assume it is happening it's okay and um and just keep doing the practice

684
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:10,119
until it becomes obvious in your experience oh yeah there it is I see it I'm doing it again you don't have to

685
01:35:10,119 --> 01:35:16,239
guess whether you're doing it or not you know you're doing it and you feel the tension and you feel the downside of it

686
01:35:16,239 --> 01:35:23,400
and then you're ready to do a course correction but don't do a course correction until the mindfulness has

687
01:35:23,400 --> 01:35:28,920
revealed its full Glory trust the practice just do the

688
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:34,560
practice with what's obvious do the practice what's going on and you have the discernment I'm repeating myself you

689
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:41,480
have the discernment to notice these things so you can now relax just trust the process the practice just be mindful

690
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:46,679
of how it is don't second guess don't worry about what's not obvious and the

691
01:35:46,679 --> 01:35:53,400
practice of self-correcting over time thanks

692
01:35:56,320 --> 01:36:02,280
Ash thank you Gil um I feel in some ways that that question might have answered

693
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:07,880
my that answer might have answered my question I had a clear question at the beginning and then now I'm having a

694
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:15,440
little trouble framing it I've been meditating with you for 20 years now it's 2004 when I started listening to

695
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:21,800
you and have made felt feel like a lot of progress equinity and um sense of

696
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:28,480
openness or noticing when I'm contracted and when I can Orient towards an opening

697
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:34,320
towards what's coming so this is on the cushion as well as in livelihood and in

698
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:41,920
interactions and I guess um without just uh keep going and begin again you know

699
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:49,000
what's next ah what's next for you m well uh I

700
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:55,000
have a clear sense of what's next for next for for you but I don't know if your life life circumstance allows for

701
01:36:55,000 --> 01:37:00,679
this yet so it might be some years away but you're ready to sit some long

702
01:37:00,679 --> 01:37:06,080
Retreats and uh you know minimum a month it could be the two-month at

703
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:12,840
Spirit Rock it could be longer at IR uh at IMs um so uh that's uh you're ready

704
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:18,000
for a long real you know in residential long

705
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:23,080
Retreats yeah I'm oriented towards that opening that space yeah yeah so that

706
01:37:23,080 --> 01:37:29,000
that that's I think I feel like that's what's next for you I mean you know in terms of I don't

707
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:36,159
know you're you're practicing great as you are so it's not like you're missing out but uh in terms of my you know my

708
01:37:36,159 --> 01:37:41,480
wish for you that's an addition to what you're already doing would be a long

709
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:51,360
retreat okay thank you and then uh is it Jean or jeie it's

710
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:59,679
or Genie work um long time listener first time caller um and I'm just so grateful for

711
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:08,760
this opportunity and um I might get a little choked up because uh like Nate the

712
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:14,840
um having a practice and having access to insight has absolutely transformed my

713
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:22,400
life in ways that I never imagined to be possible um and so thank than you um

714
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:28,239
from all the depths of my heart um for that and thank you to everyone who sits

715
01:38:28,239 --> 01:38:33,400
because you know we perfect in some way by practicing

716
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:38,520
together um and I think my question is

717
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:46,480
um related to that because in this world where there's so much suffering and so

718
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:55,280
much Injustice that it can sometimes feel deeply unfair to even sit and I know

719
01:38:55,280 --> 01:39:04,760
rationally you know the reasons to do it you know both from like literature and then experience but

720
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:12,599
sometimes just balancing that feeling that by practicing I'm being

721
01:39:12,599 --> 01:39:18,679
unfair um so any thoughts or guidance that you can offer would be most

722
01:39:18,679 --> 01:39:25,520
appreciated ah I'm I'm very touched than appreciative of you saying all of this and with the

723
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:32,239
question concern that you have and I I probably won't be able to do a good answer for you personally I'll do my

724
01:39:32,239 --> 01:39:37,480
best but uh um well I appreciate first how

725
01:39:37,480 --> 01:39:42,679
meaningful the practice has been for you and so one

726
01:39:42,679 --> 01:39:47,960
possibility is that um you're ready for something different

727
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:54,000
now and of course I hope you keep practicing you know some every time but maybe it's

728
01:39:54,000 --> 01:40:00,320
time for you to uh do something that responds to the suffering of the world more actively or more fully than what

729
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:05,719
you do now I don't know what you do now but uh maybe it's time for you to

730
01:40:05,719 --> 01:40:12,960
actually uh bring the practice to something uh and whether it means that

731
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:18,800
um you know that you go to the Gaza or the Ukraine and try to

732
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:24,119
help the children there who are suffering so much or whether

733
01:40:24,119 --> 01:40:30,840
you uh you know form a neighbor neighborhood support group for people who are suffering in your neighborhood

734
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:36,159
you know I don't know what it would be it does doesn't have to be dramatic um you know you're not going to

735
01:40:36,159 --> 01:40:42,679
end some of the wars in the world but uh do something and as you do it and

736
01:40:42,679 --> 01:40:50,960
probably you should start something small uh you know easy to do but do something and uh and as you do it uh

737
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:57,599
check in with yourself keep keep checking in be honest about how it's going and you might then at some point

738
01:40:57,599 --> 01:41:05,840
because you know what you're capable of uh how much suffering you're capable of having at some point you'll say okay now

739
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:12,040
I know I need this practice you know now I really need it yes I read the I read all the stories

740
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:20,000
why you should be practicing and how it helps other people but now it's you know it's true if I don't practice now uh I'm

741
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:26,880
going to make a mess what I'm trying to do for the world and that might be the phase you're in and you do that for a while and then

742
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:33,440
you might be uh ready for like with ush go off with ush to a long

743
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:39,800
retreat is that okay as an answer for now yes that is that's very helpful uh

744
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:48,080
as an answer for now and and it brought uh additional clarity as well about what is or is not um ready great okay thank

745
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:54,719
you thank you so maybe we'll do two more and I see two hands up so it's um so

746
01:41:54,719 --> 01:42:04,480
it's uh is it mij yes thank you um thank you yolan s um my question

747
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:12,000
has to do with um being a senior and an advanced senior and coming to Buddhism

748
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:17,040
as a practice and finding that many things that I thought were resolved in

749
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:23,760
my life through a a longtime spiritual practice and also many years of therapy

750
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:30,159
have opened up and um I um and and I

751
01:42:30,159 --> 01:42:36,560
hear that it takes time for these things to take place and I'm at I'm beginning

752
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:45,080
at the end so so how does a senior come into uh active Buddhist practice

753
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:52,639
okay well active Buddhist practice where do you live in in uh San Jose oh San

754
01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:59,239
Jose um so IMC does have a senior sa a group

755
01:42:59,239 --> 01:43:04,599
that meets most I'm doing senior sa I'm doing the eight path okay so you're

756
01:43:04,599 --> 01:43:10,719
doing lots of I I attend I've been attending your um uh meditation practice

757
01:43:10,719 --> 01:43:15,440
for over a year

758
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:23,159
so you know so I don't really know you maybe we've had one other conversation like before I somehow recognize you so I

759
01:43:23,159 --> 01:43:32,000
apologize for if I don't remember if we met so it's a little bit hard in this context to have a a really deep meeting

760
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:40,320
with you about this and to be able to offer you something uh if I take a risk with you and with everyone here uh if

761
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:47,520
that'll be okay that's fine you so you've had a long spiritual practice and so maybe you have you can um brush me

762
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:54,880
off if I say something which is not helpful um so it's a thought

763
01:43:54,880 --> 01:44:03,320
experiment or it's based on this premise you might already have a very strong

764
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:09,080
foundation and the question is can you call on your existing

765
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:14,639
Foundation as a as a as a foundation with which to practice with the

766
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:24,599
difficult things which are arising now I I do find that helpful and can you

767
01:44:24,599 --> 01:44:31,119
do so in such a way that your the issues you have do not

768
01:44:31,119 --> 01:44:37,560
get resolved is there something more important for you that can that's here

769
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:46,198
that can be present that uh for you that uh doesn't depend on these issues being

770
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:54,040
resolved my uh my desire for for coming to Buddhism was to uh face dying

771
01:44:54,040 --> 01:45:02,560
consciously yes so that that was where I was going to go with you so

772
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:09,080
imagine that you're on your deathbed and you know somehow you

773
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:14,119
understand you have about five minutes left to be alive that's the circumstance and it's

774
01:45:14,119 --> 01:45:19,400
you're comfortable you know you're dying the best way you could imagine but you you

775
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:25,880
you have 5 minutes left and um and then you

776
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:33,320
remember I think I overpaid my credit card I better do something about this

777
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:40,000
and call my credit card company and try to fix this and would would is that the best way to

778
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:49,158
spend your last five minutes alive no not for me so so what would be

779
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:57,360
better to be present to what's happening uh right with me at that that moment and

780
01:45:57,360 --> 01:46:03,639
and why why is that why is that better than uh dealing with money is important right it was you earned it and you

781
01:46:03,639 --> 01:46:10,599
should not lose it and so why is it why being present at that moment is more

782
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:17,679
important that the money is is of no use to me at

783
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:23,679
all um it it has no meaning uh at that particular time it's a p it's something

784
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:29,040
that's over and done with uhhuh okay okay so that's nice I'm happy to hear

785
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:35,360
this now what about um and then your the last five minutes and uh some fear that

786
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:40,719
you have that you still carry with you comes up and there's that old friend

787
01:46:40,719 --> 01:46:48,840
your fear so well that's probably a good thing to do for the last five minutes is to really get into it and be afraid and

788
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:54,360
you know you know it wouldn't wouldn't that be a good use of your

789
01:46:55,119 --> 01:47:00,239
time no um uh I I'll tell you my concern

790
01:47:00,239 --> 01:47:06,840
now is is um uh my children um

791
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:14,280
uh letting go of of that letting go of them uh letting go of the things that

792
01:47:14,280 --> 01:47:20,840
that were guiding um cares and concerns in my life and joys and opportunity in

793
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:26,840
my life and being present you know to what's happening with me right so in you

794
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:33,440
have five minutes left yeah and your your your kids your family is around you

795
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:39,800
and they they value you so much you've been kind of a teacher a model for them and they're looking to see how you're

796
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:48,560
going to die do you think clinging to your kids is the final message you want to give no

797
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:52,320
what is the final message you want to give

798
01:47:53,599 --> 01:48:02,239
um again just being where being in that moment and doing where my the journey

799
01:48:02,239 --> 01:48:10,560
taking the Journey of my life in uh in a peaceful calm accepting way fantastic so

800
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:17,080
mij so I apologize if some of the things I say were a little B coarse or something but uh but uh you have a

801
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:23,560
foundation you know something already you know something very profound about the value of being present here in a

802
01:48:23,560 --> 01:48:30,199
peaceful way it's in you already can you call on it more

803
01:48:30,199 --> 01:48:37,280
now why wait I I feel that that's the practice

804
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:43,080
and what comes up are are things that I thought were resolved for instance i'

805
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:49,560
I've worked in in counseling with people in death and dying yeah and and being at

806
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:57,480
this side of it is different uhuh in a way so so so I I I agree with that so

807
01:48:57,480 --> 01:49:05,280
now we come back to what I said in the beginning do you have the ability to be honest about what's coming up for you to

808
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:13,719
meet it with mindfulness and intelligence and maybe even try to find a way through it in a way but not you

809
01:49:13,719 --> 01:49:19,040
don't need to have it resolved you can breathe and be present

810
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:26,119
just fine with the issues coming up because you only have five minutes

811
01:49:26,119 --> 01:49:31,560
left maybe you never know you think you I'm trying to offer

812
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:37,960
you a different perspective on this is this working it is you think you're up

813
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:43,040
for the challenge yes I am and I would love to

814
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:48,639
talk to you about it someday or let hear how it's going and if you're in San Jose maybe you'll come up one Sunday morning

815
01:49:48,639 --> 01:49:55,119
when I'm here and you can say hello hello okay thank you thank you mijch so

816
01:49:55,119 --> 01:50:02,800
then the last one is

817
01:50:06,119 --> 01:50:11,719
Charlie hi Gil um hello from uh near

818
01:50:11,719 --> 01:50:17,880
Boulder Colorado and um now that we all

819
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:23,639
have learned how to die I don't know what else there is to

820
01:50:25,599 --> 01:50:31,199
say well thank you for that and well if you learn if you've learned how to die

821
01:50:31,199 --> 01:50:37,440
then there there is something important to do and that is to live your life

822
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:42,639
Fully live Li live live your life

823
01:50:47,199 --> 01:50:52,440
compassionately that um that sounds sounds like it's in line with with what

824
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:57,480
I'm uh trying to do and I just wanted to express a lot of appreciation to you for

825
01:50:57,480 --> 01:51:02,679
the support I've received from joining you for these guided meditations these

826
01:51:02,679 --> 01:51:12,320
past six weeks and um and and a little bit before that I'm um finding a lot of

827
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:17,719
um it it the

828
01:51:18,719 --> 01:51:25,159
uh there's always been a a tension in my mind about in meditation

829
01:51:25,159 --> 01:51:31,079
between um oh I guess it's a kind spiritual

830
01:51:31,079 --> 01:51:37,599
bypass escapism going away from Life um through silence through being alone

831
01:51:37,599 --> 01:51:46,159
versus connection uh compassion as you're saying the point of life right um and

832
01:51:46,159 --> 01:51:51,400
um it's and so um

833
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:56,760
it sounds like you know you talk about you talk about both of those things you

834
01:51:56,760 --> 01:52:03,400
know you talk about creating space and distance from aspects of mind and part

835
01:52:03,400 --> 01:52:09,119
of me says No I don't want to do that I want to be with everything I don't want to create space and distance I want to

836
01:52:09,119 --> 01:52:15,599
be connected to myself every part of myself every part of the world I don't want to go away I don't want to escape I

837
01:52:15,599 --> 01:52:21,880
don't want to bypass I don't and then um

838
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:30,320
then I'll just think and think and think and kind of time goes by and

839
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:37,119
um there's um I don't know I don't not sure what my

840
01:52:37,119 --> 01:52:44,719
question is in there there's always there's been this tension between being connected allowing everything versus

841
01:52:44,719 --> 01:52:50,679
creating space um distance seeing things

842
01:52:50,679 --> 01:52:57,560
does that make does that sound like a question yeah yeah I understand your question but turns out both are possible

843
01:52:57,560 --> 01:53:04,800
actually if if you do both they both become better for each other so for

844
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:10,159
example uh do you have this concern about being disconnected from people and

845
01:53:10,159 --> 01:53:15,239
separating yourself and locking yourself out of people's lives when you go take a

846
01:53:15,239 --> 01:53:21,760
shower and close the door

847
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:28,840
I just imagining inviting everyone to come with me yes no exactly I want to be alone for

848
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:36,400
that one and and uh and because in principle what we're doing there is getting clean and when we're clean then

849
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:43,560
people want to connect to us you know if you never took a shower people would probably be you know pulling away but

850
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:49,840
you're you you you go back clean and refreshed and you're so much better for

851
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:55,440
making that connection to people that rhythm of going pulling away and locking

852
01:53:55,440 --> 01:54:01,360
the door in the bathroom to shower and coming out clean is a natural

853
01:54:01,360 --> 01:54:07,840
Rhythm meditation the same way we learn to kind of cleanse ourselves by being a

854
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:14,239
part in meditation closing our eyes so we come back better cleaner Fuller and

855
01:54:14,239 --> 01:54:20,880
what we're looking for in meditation is not to be um apart from people

856
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:28,520
we're looking to be to avoid being entangled with people and we come together like this

857
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:36,840
where it's uncomplicated it's clean it's full it's caring not caught up in people with each

858
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:43,079
other and and and ultimately we we have better better connections when there's a

859
01:54:43,079 --> 01:54:49,880
separation that comes together like this where each person is met in their own wholeness which a lot of people don't

860
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:57,360
know how to do but to discover your own wholeness your own fullness your own freedom in

861
01:54:57,360 --> 01:55:04,400
meditation then allows so much more to happen when you come together it's actually the relationships become

862
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:12,639
richer so I I so you can do both and don't set up one against the other they

863
01:55:12,639 --> 01:55:20,400
both support each other like showering and then I would encourage you

864
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:26,119
so I I love it that you're this way that you have the sensibility you're concerned that you have a practice that

865
01:55:26,119 --> 01:55:31,880
you want to be in the world and connected maybe in a compassionate way

866
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:37,280
um uh I think you probably have good things to do in the world for the world

867
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:41,800
and I would encourage you to be uh

868
01:55:43,639 --> 01:55:49,920
courageous thank you um I will do my best great and hope
