so so hello greetings everyone here

129
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:59,060
and online hello so for today's

130
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:04,260
Reflections I wanted to to offer some

131
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:09,980
some thoughts for your consideration on the theme of

132
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:16,320
the journey is the destination the journey is the destination it's the

133
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:22,619
saying that you might have heard before in different contexts and in the context of our practice

134
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:30,119
actually in Buddhism in our spiritual practice it takes particularly special meaning so I wanted

135
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:36,140
to explore that a little bit and not just from a cognitive stance but also

136
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:44,400
offering some some tools of okay so what what if we how how would our stance how

137
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,040
would our daily perhaps practice shift if we

138
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:56,400
brought if we worked with this practical tools so so news you can use so that's my

139
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,940
intention today and also some engagement I'd love to have some engagement on the topic because we all have had some

140
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:10,619
experience with with both the opposite and also wisdom with the journey being

141
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:16,320
the destination so let's explore this together how does that sound

142
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:22,800
for it okay so

143
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:30,359
so let's start by actually exploring in an embodied sense because embodiment is

144
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:36,359
first and foremost is the exploring everything in the body is is is the

145
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:41,820
foundation of the practice is the foundation of practice and

146
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:48,720
in the Sati patana sutta in the four establishments of found four

147
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:55,200
establishments of mindfulness um where the Buddha talks about the four

148
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:00,240
establishments of mindfulness the first one is the body the first and primary

149
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:06,420
one is the body it's really exploring mindfulness of the body and and many of

150
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:12,300
you might be familiar with body scans which are drawn from the mindfulness of the person so basically embodiment

151
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:17,579
really having this basis of the body is the very first Foundation whereas in the

152
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:23,579
west we like to think of mindfulness as oh thoughts and mind I want to do the

153
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:29,220
third Sati patana mindfulness of Mind first whereas mindfulness of the body is

154
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:37,260
first second is mindfulness of feeling tone vedana Pleasant unpleasant or neutral

155
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:42,540
just this constant push and pull we have towards everything right that's the

156
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:47,579
second establishment the second Foundation the third one

157
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:55,440
is the Mind mindfulness of Mind mind States

158
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:02,339
Etc exploring that and then the fourth one the fourth satipatana establishment of mindfulness

159
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:09,780
is mindfulness of dhammas or um basically various conditions for

160
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:17,880
example the four noble truths is part of that the hindrance is basically knowing the algorithms the an awareness of how

161
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:25,380
it happens how it goes after you've got the basics down it's kind of knowing the pros the processes dhamma is kind of the

162
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:30,720
fourth one mindfulness of the processes processes of Liberation the Eightfold

163
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:37,859
Path isn't there so but coming back I just wanted to mention the four as a review the first one is mindfulness of

164
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:44,520
the body the body is so important embodiment awareness of the body

165
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:51,000
um exploring the body the body as a as a tuning fork also we get to know so much

166
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:57,720
about our state of Minds about our state of emotions based on what happens in our bodies and

167
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:05,460
in the west we're often cut off from our bodies we're like walking heads with the bodies kind of disconnected

168
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:13,200
whereas the body really both supports embodies us grounds us in our

169
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:19,500
practice ah have you noticed if you're stressed if you take a breath

170
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:25,740
body right breath in the body ah and if you've been in your mind blah

171
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:32,160
blah what I do about this ah there's a sense of grounding there's a sense of awareness okay maybe I know

172
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:38,760
how to do it by this I don't have to spin out in your mind you can become embodied so basically talking about how

173
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,800
important embodiment is not the focus of this talk

174
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:51,119
yet we're going to talk about the journey as a destination but but we need to start with the body otherwise we'll

175
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:58,020
get all too heady right okay so now that I've espoused I've sung

176
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:03,240
the Praises of of really becoming aware of your body and embody him into

177
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:10,440
practice in fact as you're sitting right now can you become aware of your body posture more aware what's happening in

178
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:15,800
your body how are you sitting where are your feet

179
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:23,819
if you feel embodied is there a sense of Integrity in your body would it help the shift to feel more of a sense of oh yeah

180
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:29,940
really sitting and and engaging with the Dharma right now

181
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:36,480
does your body feel that way so now as I invited you to feel into your body in

182
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:42,960
this moment ah as I feel into my body yeah I'm sitting sitting upright there's a sense

183
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:48,119
of uprightness in the body which also magnifies

184
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:57,240
sense of wholeheartedness of wanting to share the Dharma with you so there is a connection between the embodiment and

185
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:04,079
and the mind so now if you drop in

186
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:12,060
this reflection that the journey is the destination

187
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:20,220
what if you drop that into your body right now and see what happens my journey let's make it personal my

188
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:25,619
journey my journey In This Moment In This Moment

189
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:31,520
of being alive is the destination

190
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:38,280
drop that in and breathe with it a few breaths my journey

191
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:42,140
in this very moment

192
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:53,000
my journey in this very moment of being aware being alive

193
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:05,599
is the destination they're not separate

194
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:28,740
dropping it in feeling into what what arises in your heart what

195
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:35,280
arises in your body what realizations what reflections what does it feel when you really

196
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:41,000
connect with this let's drop it in one more time a third time

197
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:55,200
my journey in this moment in time however it's showing up right now my

198
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,660
engagement the way I'm showing up

199
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:06,660
on the Arc of my journey the way I'm aware the way I'm responding

200
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:14,640
the way I'm receiving perceiving this moment of my journey

201
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,660
on this path

202
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:28,039
is the destination they're not separate they're not different

203
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:52,440
and notice what arises how your body feels how your heart feels

204
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:58,700
dropping it into your body not your mind let it reverberate

205
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:11,099
this is it this is it this is it

206
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:14,780
the journey is the destination

207
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,400
so

208
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:39,020
you want to open your eyes if it feels okay now

209
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:45,440
there's a lot I want to share with you but I would also like to

210
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:51,720
maybe at this point as we're kind of exploring this what comes up for you what came up for you as you explore this

211
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:58,680
what reflections um if anyone is willing to share any

212
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:04,400
thoughts that came up any shifts any realizations wow

213
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:11,660
yes please if we can change the mic yes yes definitely

214
00:50:12,359 --> 00:50:17,579
I was assuming we're going to use the mic for the benefit of people online thank you so much for being the

215
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:22,980
micrunner well it just showed me the presence is it

216
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:27,799
brought me to the present real gift

217
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:34,200
thank you thank you so much exactly their sense of presence like wow it yeah

218
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,680
beautiful

219
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:50,579
you're gonna get your work out today actually maybe the next person can pass it so you can rest if you wish hi um

220
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:57,660
so when I was embodied I really felt it settling in and I felt myself

221
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:04,740
grounding and then it almost felt like my mind was like no no don't do that we still have

222
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:10,319
to figure out the future and you have to plan on it instantly I noticed that

223
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:16,740
shift going back and forth like my mind almost thought it's unsafe too

224
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:23,460
said Lynn let myself fully believe that yeah that's what I noticed yeah

225
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:29,880
wonderful Insight that is so powerful what you just noticed in this small

226
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:37,680
little experiment wow that is powerful so powerful that there's some belief in

227
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:42,780
your mind that it's not safe that it's not safe to settle even for a brief

228
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:50,160
moment because here we're going to take it all back like this is just a moment right oh sweetheart it's okay you can

229
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:55,500
rest yes so that's it that's a big Insight that you've just had right now

230
00:51:55,500 --> 00:52:00,780
about your own psyche and the way and and might have come up for others as

231
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:06,420
well so so one way to to then work with that

232
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:11,460
because yes of course there is planning and doing in the world and yet we do

233
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:16,859
need that respite we do need that and if we're always carrying that heavy weight

234
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:23,400
we never we never have the time to have a perspective we're always in the middle of it I know you know that we know that

235
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:29,040
and yet there's something there's some belief right which is often unseen so

236
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:35,700
it's fantastic that it just became seen right now yeah you're showing yourself thank you right

237
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:41,960
um to say okay you know thank you Billy thank you you're trying to support you're trying to

238
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:49,559
warn me protect me I I really appreciate the the kindness there and yeah don't

239
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:54,900
worry it's so it's really you I've got this there's a moment of

240
00:52:54,900 --> 00:53:02,280
peace and I'll come back and just right now I'm gonna take 30 seconds five minutes 30 minutes a day a week to just

241
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:11,160
be and and I'll have a fresher perspective for a as Einstein says um on

242
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:19,460
my childhood Heroes um we can't solve our problems with the same mind

243
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:23,240
that created them

244
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:31,160
and this is the same mind right it just wants to problem solve and problem solving problem like okay

245
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:37,619
it's a different mind we want to cultivate a different mind thank you thank you thank you so much for sharing

246
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:44,359
that any other Reflections or insights this is so great

247
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:54,839
as I was sitting with the thought um a lot of I mean memories came for me

248
00:53:54,839 --> 00:54:01,800
like um like my school days and like some you know pivotal moment in my life that led

249

me here and I'm happy today you know that I'm here and some key people that

250
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:13,559

252
00:54:20,339 --> 00:54:27,359
me you know sitting with us yeah thank you thanks for sharing that it's so for you there was a sense of oh yes these

253
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:34,200
points of the journey these really these various points of the journey and this moment is part of this these are these

254
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:40,619
destinations the people who have been significant being here so all of it it's not just I'm going somewhere but it's it

255
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:46,740

beautiful so appreciate your reflections any last burning ones before we transition

258
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:03,140
last burning

259
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:16,079
for me uh what came up was like when he was given those instructions

260
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:21,359
when you mentioned like in this very moment that's when I noticed that in this very

261
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:26,579
moment I'm free and then just for few seconds I felt

262
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:36,380
that freedom and after that worries about life outside this room came up but just in those few seconds I felt free

263
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:43,619
ah thanks so much for sharing that that's so beautiful lovely it's just moment of Freedom there's a

264
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:50,940
there is a door opening there's light shining in oh yeah right here wow it's possible it's

265
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:56,700
possible the sense of Peace sense of ease it is accessible it is accessible

266
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:02,040
here yay beautiful that's it that these are

267
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:07,260
mini nibbanas these are many moments of Awakening and freedom right here it's

268
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:15,740
possible and then they keep expanding and expanding expanding becoming more beautiful thank you thanks so much

269
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:24,059
thank you all for sharing your Reflections how how enlivening to actually have this kind of a interaction

270
00:56:24,059 --> 00:56:30,540
from from us and you will have more maybe later in the talk I'll ask you more but

271
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:36,300
and also something else I wanted to say um after Genie shared about you know

272
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:43,260
feeling present with dropping this reflection as I've been actually working with this

273
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:48,480
reflection for a few days and every time I drop it in in my daily life I'm going

274
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:53,520
about doing this and that and I drop in the reflection the journey is the

275
00:56:53,520 --> 00:57:00,420
destination ah wow this moment of the way I'm showing up the way I'm being the

276
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:09,540
way I'm about to send this email this this is it this is all these modes it's not just

277
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:15,140
not in fact the sense of um

278
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:21,900
going somewhere right in if we think of a destination you know sometimes we have

279
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:28,140
this this sense that um or are we holding back on our lives oh

280
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:33,960
when I grow up once I grow up once I graduate once I get married once I meet

281
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:40,740
my soul mate once I get the job the dream job once I retire once I you know

282
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:47,579
there's all sometimes there's one side that once this thing happens then I'm going to start living I'm I'm going to

283
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:53,280
be that's that's where I'm going that's my destination it's kind of unconscious

284
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:58,680
and you know or or when I'm awakened oh yeah I'm going to do all this practice I'm

285
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:04,079
practicing so whenever I'm liberated I'm I'm enlightened once I'm enlightened oh

286
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:10,559
yeah then I'll I'll have you know I'll have it all figured out and I'll just be living in

287
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:17,640
my happy retirement of Awakening um it doesn't work that way of course it

288
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:24,900
doesn't work that way right so I'll say more about the The Awakening bit but but a couple things to say one is I I

289
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:31,260
realize this this um mindset especially when I was in grad school when I was in grad school at

290
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:36,960
Berkeley um I remember there were some of my school excuse me said maybe that was not the

291
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:42,180
case when I was an undergrad but in grad school there was something but the intensity of it that people completely

292
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:47,880
gave themselves to the grad school curriculum so many of my uh classmates

293
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:54,059
had this sense of oh once I graduate I'll explore my hobbies or I'll do this

294
00:58:54,059 --> 00:59:01,440
which I love and I haven't done it for years and whatever it might be one side so so there's this sense of oh putting

295
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:10,440
off our lives putting off like there is this destination which is graduation right or whatever it might be and

296
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:16,079
and for me was so interesting and in some ways there uh maybe it's more

297
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:21,540
subtle for us in different ways it's not so so big you know if I I had seen it in

298
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:27,240
myself at some point oh when I moved then you know maybe I'll give away the stuff and I'll clean up this corner like

299
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:34,740
wait I don't have to wait until that happens like I can do it now like there's so there could be these subtle

300
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:42,359
these destinations we set up in our lives instead of it being right here this is it this is it

301
00:59:42,359 --> 00:59:47,579
these moments that were alive we have the grace of Being Alive and Kicking

302
00:59:47,579 --> 00:59:54,720
being alive breathing sentient have agency

303
00:59:54,720 --> 01:00:01,920
this is it there is this title of this book by one

304
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:08,099
of my favorite authors Milan kundera the Czech author and the title of the book was

305
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:15,000
um life is elsewhere it's a great book life is elsewhere such an interesting title of it right

306
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:21,900
the sense of oh life is elsewhere it's not here it's whatever you're doing this is not this is not it other people or

307
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:29,339
other places or you know it's like fomo I think it is translated to fomo I think nowadays like oh this is something life

308
01:00:29,339 --> 01:00:36,480
is elsewhere as life is not elsewhere it's here it's right here in this moment it's right here in this room

309
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:42,480
this is it the way we're showing up the way we're engaging in this very moment

310
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:47,940
is the destination it is the destination also as it relates

311
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:53,880
to the teachings of the Buddha and the Eightfold Path so I'll get a little more specific in a moment but in the general

312
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:59,058
way for each of us to feel into that for ourselves

313
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:04,200
there's no redo there's no recital there's no rehearsing this is it this is

314
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:09,720
our lives this is our life the way we're showing up and and fashioning our lives

315
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:15,619
in every moment fashioning our Karma fashioning our our Legacy or our

316
01:01:15,619 --> 01:01:22,200
awareness ourselves it's right here it's right here the journey is the

317
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:28,619
destination right here it's not so separate it's not so heady thinking about in the past or

318
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:35,339
future it's right here Liberation is not elsewhere Liberation

319
01:01:35,339 --> 01:01:42,299
is also right here so so this invitation

320
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:49,440
to consider this to drop this in actually drop this in reflection maybe every day for hopefully the rest of the

321
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:54,660
day you'll drop it in and you'll you'll experiment with it as you leave it's one of my invitations

322
01:01:54,660 --> 01:02:00,000
it will invite us to stop sleepwalking because we're sleepwalking usually we're

323
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:05,099
always pulling towards the next moment pulling towards the next moment the next

324
01:02:05,099 --> 01:02:11,040
thing the next thing either we're pulling towards the back you know we're regretting what we did or said or you

325
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:16,140
know we're pulling back or we're pulling forward usually we're pulling forward the next thing the next thing okay

326
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:21,240
when is it lunch when is this when's that plan okay that to-do list okay I finished that okay the next thing is

327
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:26,520
still left to do next next next it's like you know going on on um if you

328
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:32,040
think of a journey eh a literal Journey if you've gone on a

329
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:39,780
trip either yourself you've seen that tendency in yourself or you're seeing that tendency in in your other Travelers

330
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:46,380
you've traveled with a travel Partners there's sometimes a sense of okay all right the next the next place we're

331
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:52,200
going to go see that Temple we're going to see that site next next like it's okay you go there two seconds you go to

332
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:58,500
the Eiffel Tower okay two seconds okay next the next place next right it's like wait a minute actually taking the Buster

333
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:05,160
or walking there is part of this journey it's the whole thing it's not just okay getting there two seconds next next so

334
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:11,940
so we sometimes have this tendency in our lives next thing next thing next

335
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:19,260
thing next thing like this is it the way we are actually the way it's not just

336
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:24,960
taking off the to-do list the to-do list

337
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:30,119
we're all going to die with the to-do list unfinished

338
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:38,000
I've just accepted that I'm never going to finish everything I want to finish it's just not going to happen

339
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:49,859
So speaking of that I um love teaching mindfulness of death which

340
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:57,780
some of you know mindfulness of mortalities it's one of the topics and themes that I love to teach on and

341
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:05,880
when I teach um courses one thing that I've done is to invite folks to explore

342
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:14,099
writing poetry writing death poems which are very common in in Zen Buddhism writing

343
01:04:14,099 --> 01:04:20,460
death poems before they die also the the equivalent of it in in the west is the

344
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:25,500
Epitaph Epitaph being this the short saying that goes on the tombstone of

345
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:33,599
people and given that the tombstone is small epitaphs tend to be pretty short

346
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:40,559
I've invited people over time to write many and this is one that somebody wrote

347
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:49,940
once I get the job once I meet my soul mate once I'm free below me

348
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:57,660
quite profound yeah so that tendency that that we have like yes always

349
01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:02,880
reaching for the next Once I do this once I do that once I'm free once I'm

350
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:08,579
free once I'm awake and liberated ah below me so we never know how much time

351
01:05:08,579 --> 01:05:13,040
we have this is it this is it

352
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:23,160
so say some more specific things now as it as the path and the journey relates

353
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:28,559
to the way we live within the Buddhist context so making it a little more

354
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:37,140
specific now so the Buddha taught by suffering and the end of suffering

355
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:42,720
but the end of suffering is not a destination so much you know we think of

356
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:48,359
nibana as the end of suffering like that's it end up suffering

357
01:05:48,359 --> 01:05:54,720
but it's again it's not so much of the place you go and it what place you reach

358
01:05:54,720 --> 01:06:00,720
and then that's it did you ever consider that the Buddha continued to meditate

359
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:05,240
and practice after he was enlightened

360
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:11,298
yeah just think about that for a moment

361
01:06:12,599 --> 01:06:20,280
so it's not so much a destination the practice that we do the the engagement and the way we live and also in in in

362
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:27,059
um Zen Buddhism there is this beautiful saying before Enlightenment chop would

363
01:06:27,059 --> 01:06:34,440
carry water after enlightenment chop wood carry water

364
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:41,339
so Enlightenment again is This Not That is not a happy retirement of it's the

365
01:06:41,339 --> 01:06:48,539
continuation of engaging with life continuing to engage and and I love that

366
01:06:48,539 --> 01:06:58,980
that you share this moment of many nibbana I mean many pieces oh yeah many Freedom many and and the moments

367
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:06,119
so so Freedom becomes a part of the path not separate from the path it's not that

368
01:07:06,119 --> 01:07:12,119
we're doing all this practice to to become free as you have whether you're new to practice you've

369
01:07:12,119 --> 01:07:18,660
been practicing for a while if you've been practicing for a little bit at least you can tell that oh yeah

370
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:24,900
there are things that used to perhaps bother you or get on your nerves or you

371
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:32,339
lose your cool and now wow there's a little more freedom there's a little more freedom about those

372
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:37,799
topics in those areas maybe there's some areas that are still really challenging for you but don't either

373
01:07:37,799 --> 01:07:44,039
a few areas there just a little easier now so and you're continuing to practice

374
01:07:44,039 --> 01:07:50,760
you're here you're continuing to practice and engage so so are the the

375
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:56,039
freedom becomes part of our practice becomes it's just there's more and more

376
01:07:56,039 --> 01:08:01,140
and more it's not like it's there's nothing and all of a sudden who rise like there's more and more freedom

377
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:06,359
becomes part of the path and in fact um

378
01:08:06,359 --> 01:08:12,839
the path itself the path of practice itself is the path of freedom is the

379
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:19,738
path of happiness in and of itself there's a beautiful I want to read this quote um

380
01:08:19,739 --> 01:08:28,880
for you this is from Sister true dedication who is um

381
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:37,199
one of the Disciples of tiknot Han and let me read the quote first so

382
01:08:37,199 --> 01:08:42,620
um she says in his later years of teaching

383
01:08:42,620 --> 01:08:48,778
tiknot Han revised his translation of the Eightfold Path

384
01:08:48,779 --> 01:08:54,238
to be not merely the path leading to happiness

385
01:08:54,239 --> 01:09:01,980
but the path of happiness he taught that in the true Spirit of the inside of

386
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:09,838
inter-being every step along the path leading to happiness must be happiness

387
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:15,359
itself if we suffer along the way

388
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:22,400
we've lost the game already I think that's quite profound

389
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:29,040
that every step along the path leading to happiness must be happiness itself so

390
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:34,738
if you translate Liberation freedom is happiness right that's another way to relate to it

391
01:09:34,739 --> 01:09:42,120
it's not the path just leading to happiness it is it is happiness itself right here right now the journey is the

392
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:48,420
destination so I want to talk a little bit about the

393
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:55,860
Eightfold Path um and what I just read by the way this paragraph from sister to dedication is

394
01:09:55,860 --> 01:10:01,560
from the recent uh lines or there's there there are articles on the

395
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:06,660
Eightfold Passage each author has written one one article on the Eightfold

396
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:13,320
Path from one person from each tradition of Buddhism it's quite sweet

397
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:19,080
actually to see that so so the Buddha taught

398
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:24,960
suffering and the end of suffering of course sometimes people are on the

399
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:31,620
outside they focus on the suffering oh Buddhism is all about suffering no it's about endless suffering

400
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:36,900
and and happiness really happiness and and the path of Happiness just a sister

401
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:41,900
true dedication I was talking about the path of happiness

402
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:49,920
so in the four noble truths so the Buddha talks about yes there is suffering there

403
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:57,000
is stress in life that's the first Noble Truth of course there is stress it's there's stress in life period all of us

404
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:04,080
have it all of us have challenges it's just a part of being human and they're big stresses and small stresses they're

405
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:10,560
they're the losses they're the challenges the tragedies the the

406
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:17,699
um the the griefs and then they're just the everyday stresses you know

407
01:11:17,699 --> 01:11:23,280
you have to feed yourself and take care of yourself and bathe yours it's just all of us like oh yeah that too that too

408
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:29,900
there's limited time and there's just little stresses or tiny little stresses it's just part of Being Human

409
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:38,280
and and the second um Noble Truth is that that grasping

410
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:44,580
clinging is the cause of the the dukkah the sufferings like wanting things to be

411
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:51,239
a particular way and clinging to it and and or getting rope burned rope burn is

412
01:11:51,239 --> 01:11:57,000
is when impermanence happens things are shifting and changing so so if you think

413
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:03,300
of you're grabbing a rope that keeps running through your hands right you're holding onto the rope and it keeps

414
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:08,400
shifting each and he's stop up don't change

415
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:13,739
you're getting rope burn that is that's another way that we heard

416
01:12:13,739 --> 01:12:19,920
when we try to stop things from changing and changes the nature of life

417
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:26,340
and the third Noble Truth but yes it is possible to be free it is

418
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:32,460
possible to have freedom it's it's possible to be happy it is possible in the midst of all this in the midst of

419
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:37,860
this craziness that is life human life it is possible to be happy and free and

420
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:45,179
engaged not that you're going to go sit on top of a mountain okay I'm liberated finally uh no it's it's being engaged in

421
01:12:45,179 --> 01:12:50,520
the middle of it and and okay and then people are on the edge of their seats okay but all right

422
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:55,860
tell us how uh the hateful path here it is this is

423
01:12:55,860 --> 01:13:02,400
how you do it this is how it's done the Buddha tells you how it's done that's the recipe April path okay

424
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:09,000
all right okay eight full path but then Eightfold Path this this path

425
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:14,159
right it's like okay I'm gonna do the first and that second and I'm gonna do all these steps like okay and then I'm

426
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:22,739
gonna get to Nevada no I actually ate full path if you've noticed it's it's it's drawn as a as a wheel it's not a

427
01:13:22,739 --> 01:13:30,540
path right have you haven't you thought about well it's talk it's taught as a path and a path usually is

428
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:36,239
like right when you go on a hiking path right it's one step after another right

429
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:41,760
whereas this path is drawn like it's is a wheel it's an eight spoke wheel oh

430
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:47,880
that's an interesting path there was a sign right that it's it's

431
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:53,580
this it's right here it's your why speech and it's wise it's

432
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:58,980
perspective and it's wise livelihood and it's wise mindfulness and cause it just

433
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:04,679
it's all here it's all here it's all here and it's not that and you

434
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:12,120
can you know it's all together it's all intertwined it's all here the journey is the destination

435
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:17,239
the way you engage is it

436
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:24,179
this is it so

437
01:14:24,179 --> 01:14:31,920
the right so the different aspects of of the Eightfold Path with

438
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:38,820
um wise View and by the way the the translation often from Sama the word

439
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:43,920
samma summer which can be translated in the

440
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:50,280
Eightfold Path as right view or wise view or appropriate and the word right

441
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:58,440
remember at the beginning of my practice I had a little bit of like what right like right wrong seemed very Puritan but

442
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:05,460
actually the translation of the word really is appropriate what's the appropriate what's the useful view

443
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:10,860
what's the useful speech what's the appropriate speech in the right time

444
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:16,560
what's so think of the word right as the right tool so you're not going to use

445
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:22,739
the wrong tool like if I wanted to use the striker you know the cup a glass full of water would not be the right

446
01:15:22,739 --> 01:15:29,880
tool the striker would be the right appropriate tool right so think of right as appropriate so or

447
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:35,280
also wise Right View right intention right speech right action write

448
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:42,179
livelihood right effort I actually prefer the word engagement because effort sometimes in

449
01:15:42,179 --> 01:15:49,140
the west brings a sense of effort whereas engagement really what is appropriate engagement in the moment

450
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:56,640
with whatever we're engaging and um and wise mindfulness right

451
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:03,780
mindfulness paying attention and samadhi concentration collectedness of

452
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:09,678
the Mind the sense of stability wise stability

453
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:19,140
so so

454
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:25,679
the goal is the path the goal is the path

455
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:33,480
the way we live our lives every moment the way we pay attention

456
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:38,900
the way we meet suffering

457
01:16:39,239 --> 01:16:46,440
our own suffering and the suffering of the world the way in each moment we are engaging

458
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:52,080
internally and externally this is the destination

459
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:56,960
it's not elsewhere this is it

460
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:09,900
so in some ways it might seem like a paradox because we

461
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:15,840
are practicing and we're going to have more and more ease and freedom and yet this is it

462
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:21,060
if we have The Stance of oh somewhere to go somewhere to get there's always this

463
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:27,600
this this this Restless mind this this wanting mind it's actually the second

464
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:33,900
Noble Truth clinging wanting like ah somewhere to go next thing

465
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:40,460
we're causing more suffering through our practice whereas this is it

466
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:47,880
so so I want to invite you all to

467
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:54,719
to drop in the phrase into your body the rest of the day and if it works for

468
01:17:54,719 --> 01:18:00,960
you maybe the rest of the week this week try the journey is the destination

469
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:07,800
or make it more personal my journey in this moment is my destination this

470
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:15,199
this how am I showing up how am I meeting the suffering how am I meeting others see with kindness with generosity

471
01:18:15,199 --> 01:18:23,000
this is it this is it we don't know how much time we have this is it

472
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:30,440
so thank you all for your kind attention

473
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:37,500
I hope some of these Reflections have been supportive and helpful than whatever

474
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:42,600
isn't helpful Let It Go it's all good

475
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:48,120
and maybe given that we have just a couple of minutes left I will ask if

476
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:54,480
there are any final Reflections since I promised I would open the floor again through any final Reflections or

477
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:59,300
questions maybe people make space for what

478
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:04,940
if anything is arising

479
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:19,100
yes Genie yes it's coming your way

480
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:25,920
in the beginning I think I heard you say that there were four things

481
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:33,840
and this was one of them the um the first one but I don't know is

482
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:40,800
that am I miss hearing oh yes I think at the beginning when I was setting the stage I was talking about

483
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:47,580
um when I introduced the topic the journey is the destination then I talked about how embodiment is important so the

484
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:53,159
four Sati patanas the four establishments of mindfulness body

485
01:19:53,159 --> 01:19:59,760
vedana feeling tone the third one being the mind and the fourth one being the dominas the processes those are the four

486
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:07,320
that I mentioned okay yes thank you for repeating no problem and then I invited us to really engage with the first one

487
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:12,360
because that's the foundation of the body and drop it into the body not just

488
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:19,280
the head not just thinking about it but dropping it in that was the entryway into our meditation

489
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:26,000
there's one more company

490
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:33,000
I had an image of my son when he was little and anyone who's a parent would probably relate to this

491
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:41,760
is we're going to the library or we're going to the park but for him it was the going that you

492
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:46,800
have that you're going to yeah and so I that that was the journey yeah not being

493
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:52,920
at the park it's going to the party yeah beautiful thanks so much for adding oh

494
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:59,040
my goodness yeah I feel such tender children are like that right they're like on the way it's like oh they're

495
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:04,560
just enjoying everything on the way they're going it's the going it's the go

496
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:11,900
that's it it's the going love it I love it Nancy please

497
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:18,360
thank you I was just gonna say the idea of dropping that in in sort of the

498
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:25,440
middle of the day in the middle of what you're doing uh actually seems like a good

499
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:30,600
sort of diffuser and that if you're reminding yourself

500
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:36,179
that the journey is the destination when you reach those difficult moments

501
01:21:36,179 --> 01:21:42,480
either with other people or in yourself it is that at that moment that the

502
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:49,080
practice is really the most important yeah and so um

503
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:54,719
yeah thank you thank you so much yeah

504
01:21:54,719 --> 01:22:01,560
I appreciate what you said exactly it's just a reminder because we tend to forget or become so focused on the thing

505
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:07,620
and the next like yeah this is it actually this is these are the important

506
01:22:07,620 --> 01:22:15,480
moments it's all important but especially those moments yeah yeah challenging moments thank you

507
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:27,320
thank you all thank you so much for your engagement with this topic may you be well may you be happy may we serve well
