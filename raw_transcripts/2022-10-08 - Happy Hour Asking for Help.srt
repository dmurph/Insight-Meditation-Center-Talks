1
00:00:00,979 --> 00:00:06,180
great great so so today I'd like to

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,519
invite us to um engage with

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,940
um asking for help as an expression of meta

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,039
for ourselves and for others so

5
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,560
so let me say a few more words about what I mean and how to how to think

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,899
about how to consider this this asking for help asking for support

7
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:41,520
so so asking for help sometimes it can feel

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:49,379
like a um an admission of weakness or or or putting a burden on someone else and

9
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:56,520
we you know we could have this um delusion of Independence that we can

10
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:05,659
do it all by ourselves instead of a sense of healthy interdependence so

11
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:13,260
so to shift our perspective or or invite ourselves to consider that asking for

12
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:20,759
support asking for help is not just good for us but also good

13
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,860
for others and for the relationship so

14
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:34,080
let's start with others we're inviting we're asking others to to be generous or giving them our the

15
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,780
opportunity we're giving them the opportunity to be kind to be generous to

16
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,790
share their resources to share their time their attention their affection

17
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:52,740
[Music] um so it's it's wonderful to be able to give

18
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:58,560
to support others and if if we don't give others the opportunity we're we're

19
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,780
closing ourselves off like an island I can do it all by myself similarly

20
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:11,220
there's with this sense of you know if we consider our own thinking about not

21
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:17,220
you know needing help but having a hard time asking for help there could be many different

22
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:24,720
um thoughts about that one is oh I should be able to do it by myself well really

23
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:32,099
is it helpful to to bring the shoulding should all over ourselves

24
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:38,760
um also it's there is strength There Is

25
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,040
Power invulnerability in sharing

26
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,260
in allowing um

27
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:56,160
others to support us and this is an as is an expression of care not just for them but care for ourselves so in that

28
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:03,720
way it also shows as Meta Meta for ourselves so if you were your own best

29
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:12,599
friend were very caring say benefactor caring mother father whatever works for you

30
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:18,480
your own caring best friend your own caring benefactor and you saw that oh

31
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,760
yeah actually support would be really helpful right now support would be

32
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,360
really helpful right now is an expression of meta to reach for that

33
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,819
support for that help in whatever way

34
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:43,739
um it would be would would support us so it's an expression of meta for ourselves and also as as I mentioned earlier as an

35
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:50,299
expression of creating relationship it's it's giving and taking acknowledging our

36
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:57,360
interdependence in the world that we have resources to give and

37
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:05,220
others have resources to give so it is this acknowledgment of giving and receiving instead of feeling that we're

38
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,939
an island we can do it all by ourselves because we can't none of us can

39
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:16,079
we all live in this abundant generosity

40
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,560
of the universe and generosity of others helping us supporting us us helping them

41
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,620
supporting them so making this both more visible

42
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,620
and opening our heart opening our minds to uh to this giving and receiving of

43
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:40,440
support that can make more happen back in part of the cause and conditions of

44
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:48,060
making more possible in the world so In Praise of asking for help and one

45
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:53,940
other thing I want to also bring in here is when we ask others for for help we're

46
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,979
acknowledging we're giving them credit that they have

47
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:04,560
resources maybe we're reaching out to a friend for their time for their care for

48
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,020
their wisdom um for their

49
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:18,000
um know-how for their skills we're acknowledging them we're seeing them we're letting them be seen and how

50
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,340
beautiful it is what a gift it is to let someone be seen and of course in this

51
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:28,620
way of asking for help and support there's a lot of wisdom that comes here

52
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:35,520
that in to to be appropriate with our request not to be overwhelming with our

53
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,580
request but both to ourselves but to others it's also the other aspect of

54
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:49,259
generosity as the Buddha teaches about generosity to give to people

55
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:54,440
um appropriately not to tax ourselves not to be um

56
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,240
Not to cause ourselves harm or other people harm when we are being generous

57
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,860
right similarly the other way around when we're asking for help to keep those in

58
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:13,860
mind right to keep um to ask for support and help in the

59
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:21,180
wise and caring way um so so as to acknowledge

60
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:29,639
of both others limitations and in some cases actually we can let them them decide so it's anyway this can be a much

61
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,699
longer discussion uh because there's so many caveats here but but but let's

62
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:43,580
let's um let's consider reaching for support as how can it be

63
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:51,000
what are the areas in our lives that we don't reach for support and it would

64
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,340
behoove us and others to actually acknowledge our interdependence and and

65
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:01,919
ask for support so so

66
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:07,620
I think I've said enough and let's I'm gonna do a guided meditation I'm sure

67
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:15,360
questions Etc will arise we'll we'll discuss at the end but for now let's not uh invite

68
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:23,099
our minds not to get into all the caveats and oh what if this what if that and and try to stay with with this

69
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:28,740
simple with the Simplicity of these Reflections in ways that you know can be

70
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,020
supportive for you you know if there are areas that it's not supportive for you

71
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:39,479
it's okay let it go you don't have to get stuck in those what ifs right now

72
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:45,380
but see the ways that it can be supportive and nourishing for you okay

73
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:52,099
all right so so uh let's practice together so I'd like to

74
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:57,740
invite you to get into your meditation posture

75
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:05,599
ah to arrive to land in this body

76
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,139

feeling your feet your sit bones your hands foreign

163
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:51,200
areas there's something in my life something that

164
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:02,820
I do need support with help with and maybe I have a sense of

165
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:08,940
shyness to ask for help or feel vulnerable or whatever the reason

166
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,360
but

167
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:22,860
it would really support me and others that I serve and support

168
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:27,140
if I reached out for support in this area

169
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:35,419
what if what if I opened up

170
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:45,500
acknowledge my interdependence

171
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:58,500
opened up what it opened up to this River this flow of

172
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:05,520
giving and receiving and invited asked for support ask for

173
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,700
help

174
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:30,080
realizing that not only would this benefit me but

175
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:37,740
likely the person who will be seen recognized acknowledged

176
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:44,880
for the goodness for the capacity to support me and this co-creation goodness good support

177
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:50,480
could help others it's bigger than me it's not just for me

178
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:57,380
what's beyond me I have the support

179
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:06,320
I can be more available support others better

180
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:09,860

183
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:47,520
already planted the seed of the reflection now just breathe let it seep into your

even though it's so juicy to think now let go you can do it let's go

189
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,820
foreign

190
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:53,960
asking for help or support it's not just about me

191
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:57,860
it's not a selfish Act

192
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:13,520
and allow us be more to fulfill our potential

193
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:21,898
to serve others to be available for others

194
00:34:21,899 --> 00:34:29,460
it's impersonal acknowledge being part of this

195
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:35,549
low of giving receiving [Music]

196

00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:47,580
meeting others needs be beautiful acknowledged to be vulnerable in this

198
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,639
way

199
00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:00,800
it's both personal and not personal

200
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:17,359
asking for help oath helps us another is fulfilled

201

interdependence of giving receiving giving help receiving help

210
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:35,839
thank you so much for your practice everyone thank you

211
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:42,720
ah so we have a few minutes for Reflections questions comments what you

212
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,960
might have discovered realized aha moments challenges can raise your Zoom

213
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:55,020
hand you can type in chat if you type to everyone I will read your name if you just type

214
00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:00,540
to me it'll be a private comment and uh what did you discover or what did

215
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:05,900
you realize ah

216
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:11,900
any aha moments more challenges for the benefit of everyone

217
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:20,760
and as I wait I'll maybe share with practice reports something that came up for me which is

218
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:28,680
um a sense of there is a sense of empowerment in recognizing areas that

219
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:34,680
that I shy away from asking for help or support and how actually it's impersonal

220
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:41,400
it's it's not about me asking for help supports me support others it's such an

221
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:47,700
interesting realization it really expands the heart expands my heart

222
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:56,059
um into into seeing that that interaction Madison please

223
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:02,640
yeah um I had like a reflection and then a question

224
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:08,040
um the reflection was similar to what I'm gonna lower my hand okay

225
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:13,260
what you just said of I've never thought about the fact that like when I look to

226
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:18,599
myself for help it's like a way of recognizing that I

227
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:25,560
have resources to give myself and I I just really want I really

228
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:32,220
appreciated that that perspective so thank you for that nice thank you

229
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:40,200
and I I'm wondering so I love this framework around asking people for support because

230
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:47,940
it's it's a way of giving them like you said an opportunity to feel their own value and to be connected and

231
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:53,400
and do a generous Act um and I've been struggling with a few

232
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,500
family members who have become very greedy

233
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:04,200
um with like around money and

234
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:09,359
I and like in the same way that I've asked for support and locked from

235
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:15,839
through lots of forms like I think asking for money is the same thing um it's a way of

236
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:22,500
giving them an opportunity to be generous so I'm I've never really dealt with someone like

237
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:29,160
yeah I just wanted to know if you had any advice on how to work with that or

238
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:34,740
just be patient or just continue to like give them love I don't know

239
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:42,000
um but I was stuck with that yeah thank you Madison thanks for both of these Reflections and really also

240
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,099
want to acknowledge again the first one just this sense of oh yeah empowerment I

241
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:52,920
have resources to give myself a sense of empowerment it's yeah there's wonderfully and there is strength wow

242
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:59,579
such a beautiful realization I want to celebrate that and really highlight that and um

243
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:04,800
this asking for for support for help and especially when it comes to financial

244
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:11,820
support um it's it's so interesting that money can can bring up this this this not

245
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:17,579
um uh for for many people even if they have the resources but it you know if

246
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:23,040
they don't have resources that's another thing but if they do have it it can be complicated and yet it's such a great

247
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:28,980
area for practice it's such a great area for practice for everyone so so for you

248
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:34,099
as as you brought it in it becomes a practice of of um

249
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:41,940
asking or inviting them giving them the opportunity to to support you uh giving

250
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:47,760
them the opportunity to be kind to be generous so it's an invitation from your heart

251
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,760
with that perspective and to be very clear in your heart as you are asking

252
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:59,000
them that you are going to care that care for them love them no matter what

253
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:06,780
but that you need to be clear in that ask it needs to be part of your practice

254
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:12,060
um so that's the part I invite for you and maybe even say that as you sit with

255
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:17,480
it as you practice with it in your invitation that this is the way that your support your help will support me

256
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:24,599
and I care for you I love you it's not going to impact our relationship either way so so you really need to be clear

257
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:30,480
that in your own heart in your own practice and then you give them the opportunity

258
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:37,560
with with it they'll accept it or not or they'll get entangled and that becomes part of their practice right

259
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:44,579
um and but as long as you have this Clarity of intention and Clarity of Love

260
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:52,800
um for you that can be this this ease yeah yeah I think the this ease is like

261
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,680
my like heartbreaking over there their heart clothing

262
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:04,920
but I think yeah just connecting to like the love is probably a good way to ease

263
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:11,880
that feeling yeah yeah exactly and connecting to the love and also connect to the compassion especially if they do

264
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:18,720
have the resources um and and they're getting tied for and for you to have compassion for them

265
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,839
really connect Like Loving them so much that ah loving their their karmic

266
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:32,700
potential you know you know what they how should I put it there's a sense of um you know your heart not closing if

267
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:38,400
they are getting entangled loving the the pain they are going through

268
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:44,160
loving them even more with compassion but they're getting entangled

269
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:50,880
right it's so taking a bigger perspective does that make sense

270
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:56,359
yeah thank you so much yeah thanks for bringing that in Madison

271
00:43:56,359 --> 00:44:01,920
yeah um Claire I see your hand and

272
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:09,800
um asking you to unmute and I see he who says one B cannot create a honey Factory it takes a hive I love that

273
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:17,420
um no I just want to thank you very much because this is an area that I have been working on and continue to work on more

274
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:22,440
I think I've mentioned before I'm an only child and I grew up fiercely

275
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:29,220
independent and self-reliant um and as life went on and I started

276
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:34,680
meeting more life experiences unpleasant life experiences I started to learn a

277
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:41,339
little bit but I forget to ask for help at the point but what I discovered when I started to do it that I really wanted

278
00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:47,940
to share with the others in case anybody hasn't tried it yet is that there are a heck of a lot of people who really like

279
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:54,060
to help and it makes them happy when you ask and it was it's such a pleasant

280
00:44:54,060 --> 00:45:00,540
experience when that happens you know I don't do it frivolously but there are times that I really do need help and you

281
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:05,760
know I'm now very comfortable with you know if I ask the right people there

282
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:12,960
it's going to work and they will be grateful for having been asked and I'll get one you know the support that I at

283
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:20,160
this point need so um I think it's a great topic thank you yeah beautiful thank you so much Claire

284
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:27,359
I love it I both love that as you share it you you've you know you grew up as an with a sense of Independence and I'll do

285
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:34,500
it myself and not asking for it and then you've taught yourself to oh yes to ask and how beautiful that is that learning

286
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:42,180
that re re reteaching yourself loveliness you're you're teaching yourself it's like if this poem flower

287
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:48,900
teaching itself I'm totally messing it up but maybe somebody will type the who remembers the poem the flower that

288
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:56,099
reteaches itself its own loveliness or reminds itself of its own loveliness there's a sense oh yeah oh yeah teaching

289
00:45:56,099 --> 00:46:02,339
yourself of your about your interdependence and then what you what I so appreciate you highlight

290
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:11,160
is is yes people love to help I found that too it's it's it's beautiful that

291
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:17,940
people are happy to help and and I know that for myself when somebody asks me for support I'm happy to support them

292
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:25,319
