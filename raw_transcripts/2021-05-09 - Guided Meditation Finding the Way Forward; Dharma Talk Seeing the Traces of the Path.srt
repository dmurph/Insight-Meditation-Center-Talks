1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,600
good day warm greetings from imc it feels to me like it's been a

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:16,320
while since i've been here and um happy to be sitting here and and

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,640
somehow in my heart feeling a warmth and a connection to this wide

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:31,199
youtube audience all of you so thank you for being here

5
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,920
the um

6
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,840
one of the

7
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:54,239
underappreciated aspects of meditation is that right from the very

8
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:01,120
beginning even the beginning of someone who's starting a meditation practice for the first time

9
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:09,680
the the there are

10
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,479
hints or clues for where this practice is going and now

11
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:22,640
what's being developed and to start tuning in or recognizing

12
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,560
these hints these little traces of the goal in a sense from the beginning can be very helpful

13
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,680
and it kind of is as maybe a guide maybe a simple guide for

14
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,759
the path of meditation and so for example

15
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:46,320
if you sit down to meditate and

16
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,799
you're sitting or lying down to be still and not moving that

17
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,640
right there there is no longer the engagement with all the movements of a

18
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,320
lifetime movements of speech movements of action

19
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,599
spinning around concerns with movement fidgeting that might go on and in that

20
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:18,319
stillness of the body there can be a kind of a release from all the

21
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:26,160
activities that might feel kind of good like wow it's like taking a rest if you sit down to

22
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,239
meditate and you sit and take your posture and then you relax your shoulders

23
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:41,200
in that relaxation there is this hint of the whole whole path of meditation that um

24
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,720
that in the relaxation there is a release a release in the shoulder maybe even a

25
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,239
release in the mind because of the close way in which the mind and body are connected

26
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,959
and there is a release right there and um and with that release there can also be

27
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,000
some shift in the mind there might the mind might become subtle more settled maybe

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,200
a little bit more something settles in the mind just as the shoulders settle also it uh

29
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:18,159
something can um become clear there's on this little

30
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:26,080
moment of clarity with the relaxation and so this release and clarity

31
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:34,159
however small it is when you first sit down that is the

32
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:40,640
way forward that's what meditation is kind of opening to and opening to and and

33
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,400
expanding and growing and so to feel it right there at the beginning

34
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,280
and to kind of feel there's there's the way forward not to try too hard to always release

35
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,879
and always be clear the basic idea is just to see clearly what's going on

36
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,799
but when there are releases when we're no longer caught up in our thoughts and concerns

37
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,000
our story making mind when we let go of a thought

38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,079
in that letting go is a feeling of release there's a feeling of openness

39
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,320
feeling of space feeling of non-preoccupation

40
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,759
and that without feeling that sense that experience of non-preoccupation of release

41
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:35,360
that's the way forward that to be appreciated to feel that rather than quickly going

42
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,280
on to the next thing let go of your thoughts and then you have a duty to go into your breath and like let's go

43
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:48,160
get to work so to appreciate the the goodness that happens the value

44
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,280
the benefit the goal that's right here of freedom

45
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,400
each little moment take a few moments to appreciate

46
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,160
the good impact the good consequences of relaxing the shoulders relaxing the belly

47
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,960
letting go of the thought relaxing the mind and that is getting a sense of that and

48
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:18,800
appreciating it points the way forward so assuming a stationary

49
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,840
posture posture that you can be still in for this 30 minutes

50
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,680
and to help you even maybe it's easier to become quieter and still in the

51
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:41,440
posture if you do kind of maybe sway back and forth a bit or a little bit gently

52
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:48,400
rock yourself a teeny bit maybe sway around so that you can kind of better

53
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:55,520
find the center and come to a place of balance

54
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:07,600
so your whole body somehow is finding here to be still and quiet

55
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,280
and then coming into stillness with your body

56
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:22,160
appreciating whatever lack of

57
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:34,080
work frenetic energy busy doing that we can be caught up in

58
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,720
to come into a posture that represents peace and quiet

59
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,840
and then to take a few long slow deep breaths

60
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,520
maybe three quarters full

61
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:03,840
and as you exhale relax your shoulders

62
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,840
perhaps appreciating whatever softening of the shoulders there's there

63
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,840
the release

64
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,840
and letting your breathing return to normal

65
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,440
taking a few moments to now relax different parts of your body

66
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:54,319
and each time if you're able to soften relax settle in your body to appreciate

67
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:03,520
what that feels like the goodness or the rightness or the release that happens

68
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:13,840
you might soften relax your belly

69
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:28,800
appreciating if the belly softens how the lack of tightness contraction

70
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:41,839
holding provides a release a sense of freedom or ease

71
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,480
as you exhale relaxing in the chest

72
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:09,839
around the heart

73
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:23,839
on the exhale releasing the shoulders

74
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:33,040
maybe the parts of the tight shoulders don't release at all but

75
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,839
maybe there's a little softening around the tightness

76
00:09:49,600 --> 00:10:05,839
and as you exhale to relax muscles of your face

77
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:23,600
and also any contraction or tightness in the mind

78
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,600
any pressure you feel in the mind or tightness

79
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,839
as you exhale can that be softened relaxed

80
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:45,200
released and however small the release is

81
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,839
to appreciate

82
00:10:51,760 --> 00:11:01,839
what's nice about that release

83
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,480
letting go of your thinking

84
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:29,600
appreciating maybe the more spacious feeling that can

85
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,880
come with not being preoccupied even if it's just

86
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:43,839
for a couple of moments

87
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:02,480
and then as we continue this meditation whenever you notice there's contraction

88
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,240
or pressure tightness

89
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,160
this grasping or clinging to anything or

90
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:24,320
relax let go and appreciate

91
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,519
whatever feels good about no longer being caught up in a

92
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:39,839
contracted state or pressured state

93
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,639
now in the lack of contraction maybe it's easier to for the awareness

94
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:53,680
to be clearer

95
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,519
clear awareness of what is

96
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,839
releasing all concerns and

97
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,839
preoccupations

98
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:21,360
let go of your thoughts and appreciate

99
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,639
that release and opening and quieting

100
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:34,560
of a thinking mind perhaps noticing if then without the

101
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,560
thinking there's more clarity in your awareness

102
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:55,839
clarity about here and now

103
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:13,120
can you relax your body further

104
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:19,840
and in the relaxation feel the release

105
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,919
feel a certain kind of freedom or ease

106
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,278
can you relax your mind

107
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:42,960
settle it quiet and in doing so appreciate

108
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:50,640
the absence of busyness the absence of chasing thoughts

109
00:24:51,039 --> 00:25:01,840
the pressure to think

110
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
so

111
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,399
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

112
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:15,840
to once again let go of your thoughts

113
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:28,080
release and relax whatever holdings you have in your body and your mind

114
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:35,360
appreciate how doing so might allow you to be more present for

115
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:43,840
other people more present for the tasks at hand

116
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:56,960
that the more you're at ease the more that you're not preoccupied and

117
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,480
have the pressures of agitations of greed and hatred

118
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:11,200
fear that there's a potential for

119
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:18,880
attention clarity availability of

120
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:25,840
seeing clearly what's here maybe with an open heart

121
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:41,120
and that meditation is not only for our own benefit

122
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:49,600
but also sets the stage for ways that we can be

123
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:57,440
more caring more present for others that's a stage for us to

124
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:04,240
have the heart respond to others with care and kindness

125
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:10,960
with compassion and appreciation

126
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:20,720
with generosity

127
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:28,158
so may it be that this meditation that we've done today may it serve us

128
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:36,720
may it serve others in our ability to be present attentive

129
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:43,280
present to to see and understand and

130
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:50,800
appreciate other people whether in person or other ways

131
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:58,399
may it be that as we free ourselves

132
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,640
that freedom

133
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:13,359
is expressed in a greater care and love and benefit

134
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:20,800
for the world around us may all beings be happy

135
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:32,960
may all beings be safe may all beings

136
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:40,880
be peaceful may all beings be free

137
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:59,838
and may we contribute to that possibility

138
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:12,280
[Music]

139
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:20,480
so the buddha gave an analogy which i would like to adapt for

140
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:27,119
this talk today he talked about a forester someone who

141
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:33,680
worked in the forest who roamed around the forest for their work and

142
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:41,680
one day came across the traces of an ancient road

143
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:48,160
that had maybe been mostly overgrown and difficult to see but he saw a trace of it and he

144
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:54,400
cleared the cleared a little bit and started following the road and clearing

145
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:03,280
it and following it and finding his way through it until he came to a ancient capital

146
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:11,119
that had long since been overgrown and been abandoned and and so then uh the forester went back to

147
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:17,280
the monarchs of the lands and explained what had been found

148
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:26,720
and the monarchs came then to clear the road fully and to reinhabit the great capital

149
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:34,079
so um partly what this analogy is used for in the teachings of the buddha is to

150
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:39,839
suggest that what the buddha had to teach is

151
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:46,480
ancient he didn't invent it he didn't just you know dis invent something or make something

152
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:52,320
that hadn't already been there but it was there available for everyone except it was

153
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,359
overgrown with our preoccupations our attachments our

154
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:03,440
contractions our clinging our graspings our fears our hatreds our delusions

155
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,839
and uh so forth and that um the uh

156
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:14,880
and so he's rediscovered this ancient potential is the ancient

157
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,000
possibility for all of us and the task is to kind of clear the road and to

158
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,599
reinhabit this beautiful place that has always been there for us waiting for

159
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:31,599
us in a sense so so the question is what is the trace

160
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:38,960
that we can find if we are the forester what is the trace uh what's the hint that shows us the

161
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:45,280
path forward and this idea of a road or a path is such a big metaphor in buddhism

162
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:52,720
about the journey of practice the way that we grow and develop in the dharma and

163
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:58,000
i just love the idea of being on a journey that has an arc as a beginning middle end as an

164
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,200
unfolding over time and i think partly why i love it is that

165
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:10,400
it's so so organic so part of the human condition that there's always change there's

166
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,079
always a movement going on and we see it with young children

167
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:22,480
that if you haven't been around a child for some time you see that they've grown physically and they've grown

168
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:28,319
mentally and capacities and all kinds of things and that with the right conditions they

169
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:34,560
grow beautifully and and you can't really stop them from

170
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,160
you know without a lot of effort the natural process of their growth the change that they

171
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:45,520
unfold the maturation and so the same way our maturation

172
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:52,880
psychological and maturation that we have doesn't end when we're 18 or 21

173
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:59,440
but that continues into adulthood and right up until the time we die and many of you can probably recognize

174
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:06,720
that in some ways you're wiser than you were 10 20 30 40 50 years ago

175
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:13,680
things that uh disturbed you tremendously or things that you were afraid of or you resisted or that

176
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,880
you really were grasping onto and clinging to there might be some things you no longer do

177
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:26,000
that you've changed and you're let go you're wiser you see clay more clearly and you know they're better off options for

178
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:33,040
you or what you used to have no you don't see the allure of it anymore

179
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:39,119
so um there is kind of a natural movement and people who don't do any buddhist practice at all

180
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:45,839
go go through a changing unfolding of it sometimes there are

181
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:52,640
challenges or things that um interfere with uh them the

182
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,720
maturation of wisdom and in that process and people get stuck they get disappointed

183
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:07,119
they get betrayed they have disappointments they somehow they get uh closed down um shut down

184
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:14,240
and uh and so then are not available for the continued maturation process which is pretty a natural process

185
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:19,920
and so buddhism is going along with that process and then setting the conditions

186
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,920
in place that that really brings out the best in us that brings out

187
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:32,640
that freedom freedom from being shut down closed down being having the heart

188
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:38,240
covered over with mud or with overgrow overgrown overgrown with

189
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:44,720
all kinds of vines and shrubs and stuff that it doesn't allow the heart to radiate or

190
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:50,000
shine and so this idea of a path then a

191
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,119
journey of that maturation process is often talked about in buddhism so

192
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:00,640
what is that what is that traces we can find and what i'd like to

193
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:07,040
say is that those traces are available at the very first beginning of meditation

194
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:12,720
the first even before meditation even the first teachings or ideas of

195
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:20,880
meditation where there's a maybe a recognition that oh these teachings point to something i can

196
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:26,160
feel i can sense i can to it that there is some freedom some ease

197
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:32,000
some absence of stress that is possible for me

198
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:39,200
and that is the beginning that's the clue that's the first traces of that road

199
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:45,520
and what that means is that the traces and the road itself are not complicated metaphysics they're

200
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:51,839
not uh complicated beliefs and philosophy but something experiential something we can

201
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:58,720
see and feel and experience for ourselves i in the simplicity of that's as simple

202
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:04,079
as if you hold your hand in a tight fist it begins being a problem

203
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:12,160
but if you release the fist it becomes a lot easier it's a fist feels freer and more comfortable so

204
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:18,079
we have all these fists of the heart fists in the mind we have all these ways we contract or

205
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:24,480
there might be strong resistance or strong pressure that lives inside of us

206
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:30,560
that kind of obscures it gets in the way of our sense of ease

207
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:36,720
or peace or freedom there might be a strong desire you need to have something now you need to have

208
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:43,040
this now and and without this i can't be happy and the very intensity of the desire is

209
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,240
the very thing that keeps us from being happy rather than the thing is going to make us happy

210
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:55,680
it's that intensity of wanting that uh obscures our natural capacity to kind of

211
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:01,680
for the good heart to just kind of manifest to show itself to relax to open that

212
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:07,280
doesn't need much but space doesn't need much but quiet and freedom

213
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:14,079
to do so to be to express itself and so um and so it's this

214
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:20,400
experiential sense of this the difference between being stressed and being not stressed being contracted and not

215
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:26,880
contracted being in bondage to something versus being freed from it

216
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:32,400
being feeling under pressure and then the

217
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:41,040
release of the pressure to feel the weight of the world and the release of that weight to feel um a strong kind of shutting

218
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:48,720
down of resistance and then the release of that resistance so there's all kinds of things like that that those are

219
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:54,640
the traces of the path that's that's what we're clearing

220
00:45:54,640 --> 00:46:01,440
so when we first sit down to meditate then the shoulders relax in that relaxing the shoulders is the

221
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:07,920
very is the first maybe trace or hint of what buddhism what this buddhist

222
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:13,280
practice is all about and so rather than thinking that relaxing your shoulders is a

223
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:18,640
you know preliminary practice or a you know kindergarten practice of

224
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:25,040
buddhism it's it itself is a little movement

225
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:32,400
towards that ease towards that freedom and so rather than just relaxing the shoulders and then quickly moving on to

226
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:38,560
the whatever practice you're going to do to take some time to appreciate to feel

227
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:44,560
ah oh yes it's a little bit more easy there now more relaxed more open

228
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:50,000
a little softer or sometimes when i relax my shoulders

229
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,040
it feels like i feel ah that's good but when i do so what i feel what's left

230
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:02,640
is a little bit the underlying tension and holding that might be there and and i feel that's good oh this is

231
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:08,160
good too to know this to be aware of it and to be close to it

232
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:14,560
to feel it because that's the way forward and to go back to being tight so the

233
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:20,160
underlying tension is kind of masked that's not desirable it's really it's

234
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:25,200
good to relax to feel what's going on here oh yes it's like this

235
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:31,359
and then that allows for over time so deeper relaxation deeper release

236
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:39,280
and um so something as simple as relaxing the shoulders you i've been you know in

237
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:47,200
social situations where i noticed my shoulders were tense or my stomach was tight and then i relaxed it and

238
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:52,960
and it's not like something to write home to your you know you know write home about and

239
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:58,079
say look what great thing i did um you know if i attain the fulfillment

240
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:04,319
of buddhist practice you know it's kind of silly to do it that way but

241
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:10,640
in talking that way i am pointing to that there's a trace there there's a this is the path this is where

242
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:17,599
the way forward this is what it takes it isn't like you relax your shoulders so that now you can go read some big

243
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:23,200
tome of buddhist philosophy you relax your shoulder so that's the

244
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:29,920
the door that's the book we're reading we're reading the book of softening releasing opening

245
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:36,720
together with clarity and uh and um

246
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:43,040
there can be with relaxation a little sense maybe a minor sense of

247
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:48,640
clarity the awareness becomes a little clearer and these two together

248
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:54,880
release and clarity those are the the primary things that we're

249
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:01,280
appreciating valuing opening to uh remembering to do as we do this

250
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:06,800
meditation buddhist practice letting that grow these grow and develop

251
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:13,280
and doing so then allows for this maturation allows for the greater clearing of the road until we

252
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:19,760
come to this great capital at some point but it gets uncovered so that's one kind

253
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:27,760
of analogy the analogy of you know a path that we go but it's just an analogy and

254
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:33,680
another way of saying this is that we are going from one place to another we're going

255
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:40,079
from here or self-suffering to there we're not suffering at all that's the

256
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:45,520
kind of the the over overall kind of simple description of the buddhist path

257
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:52,400
and so it but however it's not a geographical journey it's not like we're traveling anywhere

258
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:59,680
in the world it's all about what happens right here and and each step along the way

259
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:04,880
is not about doing something so that you can get some

260
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:12,800
place in the future but each step along the way is itself a fulfillment of the

261
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:20,319
of clearing that clearing the road or the expressing or finding even a small degree of what the whole

262
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:26,880
path is about the freedom from suffering from stress from contraction from pressure from resistance from fear

263
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:32,640
and so to really appreciate this that it's just right here and right now

264
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:37,839
what we're doing in this regard it's sometimes said in buddhism

265
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:43,280
that the fast fastest way to go from a to b

266
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:49,040
is to be fully at a so not to be so involved in getting

267
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:55,119
anywhere but really take and really be here with what's happening now

268
00:50:55,119 --> 00:51:00,720
and and that's very much the same process because if you you sit down just anybody

269
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:06,640
you know they sit down to start paying attention to what's going on they might find that there's a lot of

270
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:12,960
physical agitation they don't want to sit there they want to they have a lot of things they have a long to do list and they're anxious to do it all and

271
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:18,240
there's all this restless nervous energy in the body to do and and because there's all this restless

272
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:24,160
nervous energy it actually feels better to enact it or act out the energy that is

273
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:31,839
sit still and feel it and makes us busy again and keeps people spinning until they're exhausted

274
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:38,640
but so notice this energy of wanting to do and then maybe settle back and relax the body and

275
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:44,960
until there's some ease and presence just things can unwind and then we notice that the mind is not

276
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:51,119
here and now with in the past in the future thinking about things and so then there's a process of

277
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:56,240
releasing and letting go of that to be here and then we notice that we're

278
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:02,079
here okay but we spend a lot of time analyzing and telling stories about here and what's

279
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:08,480
happening and what where we're going and what's happening and so we see what these all this story making mind and all

280
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,760
this analysis of what and plans about what to do about that's

281
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:19,119
also keeping me from being here at a really present so then we let go

282
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:25,119
of the stories we let go of the plans we let go of the analysis of what's happening because

283
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:30,880
it keeps us removed from the experience and so we find this a we kind of keep

284
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:38,480
shedding letting go releasing all the things that keep us from being present in a very good high

285
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:43,920
quality way and and it's not about getting any plays

286
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:50,640
as it is really arriving and being here in a fuller and fuller way so in that

287
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:59,520
sense we're learning to be fully at a but in doing so we are shedding releasing understanding

288
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:06,000
all the things that help the process of maturation unfold the process of inner growth the

289
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,839
process of movement towards freedom to wisd towards wisdom towards compassion and love

290
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:19,520
all those things now have space and room to unfold and grow and so there is that kind of a going

291
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:28,160
from a to b simultaneously we're becoming transformed and changed in that process

292
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:33,760
and even if you don't want to be transformed in that process

293
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:40,160
you can't help human change we're all changing psychologically we're all changing physically

294
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:47,520
day by day hour by hour through this lifetime but what we can do is create really good

295
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:54,000
conditions for that change to happen in in a way that's beneficial

296
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,119
and if we continue to live under stress if we continue to live not really

297
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:04,480
connected to ourselves uh spinning out with desire and agitation and

298
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:11,839
wanting the next thing and making the next plans and or always hiding and and closing down

299
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:19,200
and not really being honest and present for what's happening those are powerful conditions that uh

300
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:26,480
influence the direction of our maturation and it can be a direction which is not so good

301
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:32,240
and but if we meet ourselves our life with courage with

302
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:38,240
goodness with presence with love with letting go

303
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:46,079
opening up and then that creates a very different set of conditions where things start feeling safe inside

304
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:53,200
where there starts feeling a fearlessness inside whether starts feeling um it gives it as

305
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:59,280
appreciation and love and care for what's here and those are very different influence

306
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:05,599
on how we change and mature over time and so simultaneously to the practice

307
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:10,880
being fully here at a nowhere but here

308
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:18,319
we are putting ourselves in a process that uh has us go from a to b

309
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:26,400
has us go from who we are today to what we can become as we become freer

310
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:34,880
and more compassionate more more liberated in this whole process

311
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:40,640
and but whether you're looking at it from going a to b

312
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:48,640
the road in the forest that's overgrown and you're clearing it or it's simply that you are already at

313
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:56,319
the palace and there's nowhere to go nowhere to be however the palace is overgrown the

314
00:55:56,319 --> 00:56:02,319
capital is overgrown with lots of shrubs and trees and vines and dirt and

315
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:09,440
so it's not a matter of getting anywhere but it's a matter of clearing all the

316
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:16,160
overgrowth so the capital can be inhabited and so either way the met whatever

317
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:22,480
metaphor analogy that you prefer or both of them but they're both the same process

318
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:29,119
and a process that develops the more we can appreciate the benefit

319
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:36,000
of each moment of release we can appreciate the value or the goodness of letting go

320
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:42,079
of opening up of not resisting not chasing desires and wishes and not being

321
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:47,520
agitated and swirling around in stories not caught in the grip of resentments

322
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:54,160
and anger hostility all these things that are kind of the overgrowth

323
00:56:54,160 --> 00:57:00,880
that prevent us from seeing this wonderfulness that waits for us inside this and what's

324
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:07,280
quite beautiful and um and that we can inhabit the beauty that we can inhabit

325
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:15,920
and maybe this inner beauty this inner freedom and peace that can be where we take up residency

326
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:22,240
and whether it's a path from a to b to get there

327
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:29,280
eventually we're there and we're taking a presidency in this wonderful beauty

328
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:36,559
or if it's just being at a fully nowhere to go

329
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:43,440
no road to it no path we also end up taking up residency

330
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:50,960
to a beautified heart that he has become free and compassionate

331
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:59,599
so um so recognize even at the smallest

332
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:07,280
initial steps of the path of release relaxation opening up

333
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:13,680
seeing clearly what's here oh stopping to look oh this is what's happening in in the

334
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:20,319
relaxation in the stopping to look and see clearly recognize the best you can

335
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:26,720
the whole goal of the practice is found traces of it

336
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:37,599
you're already there you have it you can you have what it takes

337
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:44,799
and now keep doing it keep opening to it keep practicing it repeatedly over and

338
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:52,880
over again so this can really make space and grow and develop and and there's a wonderful word

339
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:59,359
in the teachings of the buddha it's

340
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:10,880
means to make it abundant so and he says by repeated practice

341
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:18,160
we make it abundant so make your freedom make your peace make your

342
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:23,599
beautiful qualities of art become abundant for you

343
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:31,040
by just continuing to practice over and over again what is available

344
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:36,400
for a beginner at the very start of their practice

345
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:43,040
so thank you very much and for today and

346
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:53,520
