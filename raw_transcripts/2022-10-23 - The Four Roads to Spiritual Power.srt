1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:08,820
there's a particular teaching of the Buddha that for

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:16,160
ever since I learned about it maybe some 30 years ago or so I've ignored it

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:24,960
and and even though it has a very central place the Buddha got organized

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:33,059
his practices in the mind and the mind states that develop as your practice were organized into a list called the 37

5
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:38,880
wings of Awakening so the four foundations of mindfulness of five faculties some factors of

6
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,640
Awakening the Eightfold Path there's like these list of lists they add up to 37.

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,820
and um and there's a list of four called the four sometimes it's translated into

8
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:59,460
English as the four roads to spiritual power or psychic power the word is Idi uh I

9
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:06,420
think maybe in Sanskrit it's a city but Nepali it's IDI and um and it's a little bit strange the

10
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,939
formulation of it and it's never clear what and there's never there's no discussion about it and so what does

11
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:18,780
this mean and it has this word IDI which means psychic power and and I just kind of like this is too much

12
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,939
to handle for me and then uh last week I read an article

13
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:32,640
by wonderful uh colleague of mine wonderful teacher in our tradition named Ruth King and this uh this article she

14
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,360
explained it in a very ordinary she did she denatured it or demythologized it or

15
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:47,460
made it ordinary made it accessible he said wow this is fantastic I loved it and um and uh and she did

16
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,740
what the Buddha did with things in at his own time he would take these uh

17
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,780
wonderfully Supernatural or psychic power ideas that existed back in those

18
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,180
times and he would regularly say oh yes we do that too but let me tell you how

19
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:09,360
we do it and inevitably what he did was he uh kind of made it ordinary

20
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,940
into this you know something that was ordinary that human beings can do rather than some of the more kind of

21
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:21,300
Supernatural Dimensions that that uh sometimes they these existed in his time

22
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:27,060
and so he he already had a customer doing that and so when I saw with King do it I said oh

23
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,640
so I was a little bit inspired by her a little bit borrowing from her way of doing it I'm going to offer my take

24
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:41,340
on these four and one uh one time sometimes they're called four uh practices or four roads

25
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:48,840
to success any kind of success in any Endeavor that you want to do in life no matter what it is

26
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,300
um to think to include these four approaches to doing them what can help

27
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,760
you be successful in what you do and I apply to Dharma practice I think

28
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,980
it's particularly significant as its support as an aid as a as the offer kind

29
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:11,940
of uh some power or some some some strength to your success as a as a

30
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:19,560
meditation practitioner or a Dharma practitioner and these four roads to power are or

31
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:30,379
some people call power to success whatever it might be and um our um the desire

32
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:37,680
um effort thinking about things thought

33
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,560
and investigation it's kind of a very rough translation of these

34
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,739
and so the first one is desire and what's nice about these four is that

35
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:56,760
it's very easy to listen to Derma teachers like me and uh and here somehow the opposite

36
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,040
idea that you know like you're not supposed to have desire in Buddhism

37
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,980
that uh you're not supposed to make kind of strong effort you know you're supposed to be kind of chill and relaxed

38
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:14,900
and you're not supposed to be thinking in meditations or thinking is out that thinking is bad

39
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:20,400
and that uh I don't know about investigation maybe but but um

40
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,340
but here here the Buddha puts kind of its center of the stage the idea of

41
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:32,759
Desire that and I like to think of it as Dharma desire mic desire

42
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:38,940
and the word for desire is Chanda this is important because the

43
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:44,180
problematic forms of Desire the Buddha has different words for it

44
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:49,440
for example it literally means thirst this is a part this is the kind of

45
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,919
desire that's considered to be a source of suffering that is suffering to be kind of the compulsive desire

46
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:02,580
that you know it really it's it's thirst it's not any old desire and so the word Chun does an umbrella

47
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:08,699
term for all forms of Desire but in this list it's kind of dharmic Desire desires

48
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:16,139
that um that have equality what makes them dharmic one of the things is that

49
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:22,740
there's no clinging involved with them clinging is a source of suffering can there be desires without the Eddie

50
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:29,300
clinging and can there be desires that are for the Dharma for practice for Liberation

51
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,320
for compassion yes the answer is of course

52
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,800
and nebula talks about marshalling that kind of Desire standing behind it Gathering it together and having it be

53
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,419
strong for you and so if you want to have a success in what you do

54
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:56,039
become clear about your desire and sometimes people emphasize having

55
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:01,199
really clear about intention but intention and desire you know well I

56
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:09,180
think are overlapped quite a bit just intention seems I don't know uh more inspiring it's probably more

57
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,580
sophisticated maybe or intention is um you know it doesn't quite feel like

58
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:20,520
desire which you're not supposed to have um but um

59
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,620
but we're resurrecting the word desire and here in a useful way an important

60
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:32,100
way you have to want something and if you don't want something why would you do it why would you pursue it

61
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:38,639
why would you engage you have to want to come to IMC you know I don't think any of you probably none

62
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,520
of you just happen to be walking down the sidewalk and someone pushed you in

63
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,400
um you know you have to want to be you have to want to be here you know something something has to bring you and

64
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,979
um meditate sit down to meditate you know to on a regular basis there has to be a desire for it

65
00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:02,539
how to have that desire be without clinging is the art how to have the desire without

66
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:09,600
compulsion without expectation without being attached to results and is part of

67
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:15,539
the art of learning how to hold desire but still to be clear about the desire

68
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:21,919
to be clear about the intention I spent a good part of my Dharma life

69
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:28,020
reflecting on intention and I would ask the question regularly to myself what's my deepest intention

70
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:33,780
here someone else would my teacher might ask what's your practitioner might ask

71
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:40,080
what's the heart's deepest wish what does your heart most want

72
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,220
and this idea of the mo what the hearts most wants so what's the deepest wish it means to go through the layers

73
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:51,720
underneath the conceit underneath our fear underneath our greed underneath our

74
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:58,620
you know all these layers of places that are not really at the heart but the question kind of presupposes

75
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:05,039
that there's something very significant beautiful wonderful a

76
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:11,280
treasure to be found you know and you can get deep enough to go to the hearts you know the deepest place within

77
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:18,539
that there's something really to honor and respect and to maybe be guided by

78
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:24,599
so this idea of you know once you look at like you know bring desire to the table

79
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:30,060
means reflect on desire think about it be clear about it don't just take the

80
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:37,020
first desire that comes along but uh you know drop down and what is what is it you really want

81
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:42,719
and a fascinating exercise is if what you most want is something which is

82
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:49,440
stated in the negative you know I Want to Be Free of fear that's wonderful but if it's in the

83
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,980
negative it's something what you don't want then um ask the question if I could have

84
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:02,820
that what do I want then so if if there was no fear

85
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:08,100
what then is my heart's deepest wish and that might kind of bring you to a

86
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:14,399
deeper level underneath it and that might also change your relationship with the the fear for example when you

87
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,779
realize there's a bit deeper thing that's your your hearts call your the calling of your heart

88
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:26,519
the second of these four practices for success

89
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:33,000
is the poly word is virya b-i-r-i-y-a

90
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,959
and uh it uh is a word that uh uh implies a lot of strength that's

91
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:45,360
associated with the word Vera which means hero so some people like to translate it as

92
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:52,200
courageous effort thank you so there's a kind of oomph so like it isn't like you know easy going

93
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:57,360
it isn't like again here it's not all about being chilled you know these Buddhists are supposed to be calm and

94
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,399
easy going and relaxed and I think that's nice maybe it's true kind

95
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,459
of but it doesn't mean that we also don't make a lot of effort you know and serious effort and you know

96
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:15,600
this is important um in this world of ours for many of us not everyone in the world but in many

97
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,980
people in our kind of neck of the woods there's a lot of great things to do

98
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:29,160
there's so much we also unless we have like too much too many wonderful things to do too many good causes to be

99
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:36,420
involved in too many Recreation opportunities too many Netflix movies too much you know and um

100
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:43,200
and then there's a kind of neurosis of trying to have it all or if you're not up to speed then you go to the block

101
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,240
party and you're kind of like you know not holding your own in the conversations you're supposed to have to

102
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,720
know something about everything and and um but a wise life

103
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,820
that really kind of looks carefully at desires what's what you most want

104
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:05,519
is going to start whittling away the things that get in the way of going deep

105
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,940
going seriously with what's most important uh if you if you want to live your life

106
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:18,959
skimming the surface of all all these things that's maybe a little bit unfortunate when you want to go deep

107
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:26,940
and that's what Dharma practice is possible is to really if this is important for you really do it put effort into it make

108
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:33,120
energy to it don't expect it just kind of like you know you know

109
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,940
there's something called uh bookstand Buddhists the people who just you know you know

110
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:45,480
you know read little Dharma books in the evening before going to sleep or something and I don't want to knock the importance of that that's a wonderful

111
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,940
thing by itself but if that's all you do then it's like reading the menu all the

112
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:56,579
time you go to the restaurant this is a great restaurant didn't I you know and

113
00:11:56,579 --> 00:12:02,839
all you do is ever ever do is read the menu and they never order the food so

114
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:09,000
you know so if you just read Dharma books you know it's like them just it's just a menu kind of

115
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,360
so you have to engage in the meal you have to eat it so you have to make effort and then this this word very such

116
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,959
a strong word it kind of means courageous effort and um and so what does that mean for

117
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:28,740
you I just love the word courage in French comes from the word heart so what's the heart's deepest wish

118
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:34,320
number one now what's the hearts kind of wholehearted

119
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,160
engagement in what you're doing to be wholehearted

120
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,600
and don't be afraid of making effort don't be afraid of being wholehearted

121
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,899
the art of it though is what is dharmic effort dharmic effort is effort which is

122
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:59,279
done without conceit conceit is where we bring ourselves along measure ourselves I'm failing and

123
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:05,639
I have to do better I have to get a badge for what I do and you know be able to show the block party you know how

124
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:12,300
great I am in my effort and how I succeeded and um mostly Dharma practice is kind of

125
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:18,740
like baseball we're you know baseball batters mostly fail

126
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:25,680
I think you know how many times do you does your mind fall off the breathing

127
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,560
when you can meditation and go off into thinking about it I mean probably baseball players have better success

128
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:38,220
than we do you know but but uh but you know this

129
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:45,660
Dharma effort has nothing nothing we don't don't measure it the conceit of success and failure and

130
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:51,180
get caught in the kind of what's important is the engagement how we

131
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:57,420
engage how we engage wholeheartedly without strain without measuring

132
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:03,480
ourselves without kind of the ordinary kind of conceits of being successful and

133
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:09,060
being a failure these these don't really apply here but rather what really

134
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:15,839
applies is the wholehearted application then you're doing the best we can that's

135
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:21,660
what carries the day the third of these four is uh the word

136
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:26,760
is chitta c-i-t-t-a that are usually translated as

137
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:33,600
mind but cheetah in in in the ancient Pali language can also mean uh thought

138
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,720
Thinking by itself sometimes people Scholars of study I think that's that that she tells the

139
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:45,660
thinking mind as opposed to the whole mind but any case to hear think of it as

140
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:54,000
thinking and that is have desire make the effort but think about it

141
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,420
spend time being could do this in a considered way don't just be blind and Thoughtless and

142
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:06,240
just I'm supposed to do it because I'm supposed to do it reflect and contemplate and think and

143
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,060
have conversations with friends and stretch your mind to kind of uh so you

144
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:18,740
can do it in a way that's more intelligent better informed better considered

145
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:25,139
they sometimes people get the impression that with meditation that he has to not think at all and therefore I'm not

146
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:31,920
supposed to think in my life um I think that the thinking learning how to think well

147
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:38,160
is an art that we all should learn ing how to spend time you know even taking even going to the Community

148
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,680
College and taking a class in critical thinking skills that's a good idea

149
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,380
and just really learn how we make mistakes in our you know in our

150
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:54,660
cognitive um understanding of things because we we

151
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,699
make leaps we make assumptions we believe things that shouldn't be

152
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:07,320
believed automatically we don't learn to question and look and what's going on here so learning the art of thinking so if

153
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:13,199
you want to do something well really consider your desire make the

154
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:20,160
effort and think about it well and then the fourth one is and one of

155
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,380
one of the ways to think about it well a kind of a guideline for it is as you

156
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:31,380
think about things think about it in a way that makes you more peaceful

157
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:37,740
a big guy you know it's a track how you're thinking and if thinking is stirring you up

158
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:44,699
making you anxious or making you whatever then um it's not so much not only what you think but how you think

159
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:50,519
that's important and so see if you can adjust how you're thinking

160
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:56,279
so that the thinking itself starts to kind of encourage a calmness a

161
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:01,399
peacefulness and ease rather than the opposite

162
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:08,100
the fourth of these roads to success is um

163
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:13,199
I called in before investigation and um

164
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,839
and now this goes along with this uh and how I understand it is that when you

165
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:25,620
engage in doing a thoughtful way you want to learn from what you're doing

166
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:30,960
so this is called in some circles it's called action reflection

167
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:37,500
you act and then you reflect about what you just did and from a Dharma point of view it's

168
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:45,480
often reflecting on what are the consequences of what I do did this work out what was the impact of this am I

169
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:53,280
better off because I did this or am I worth worse off that I asked am I more attention tense

170
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,460
now or I feel more alive and vital and and relaxed now

171
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:04,200
so we want to track ourselves and monitor ourselves and learn from our

172
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:10,080
mistakes learn from our successes learn from what what works and doesn't work

173
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:16,740
and that takes time to reflect and to investigate to consider to evaluate how

174
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:22,620
it's going as we're doing it and um so this idea of having a sense of

175
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:29,880
the consequences is Central to the teachings of the Buddha he was a consequentialist

176
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:36,960
he was regularly and constantly looking at describing uh what we do from the

177
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,419
point of view of the consequences it has so consequences means that you have to

178
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:49,380
think about a little bit you have to reflect you have to investigate you have to track what's Happening Here

179
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:55,380
and um so you know why this is quite unfortunate and why it's a drag to hear it for some

180
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:02,039
of you is that it's work you have to give yourself time for it

181
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:07,380
and you have important things to do right like I won't go through the list

182
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:15,539
and um and then and it is work but it's a work that leads to rest work

183
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:23,039
that leads to the mind being being de-stressed we have to engage something

184
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:31,860
and it's a work that maybe becomes rejuvenating vital welcoming and uh

185
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:37,320
until we can reclaim the word work be

186
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:43,919
wonderful as opposed to work being discouraging I'll have to do more work

187
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,320
again more work I think some people in English the word work is not a welcomed

188
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:55,860
word but I I think if we learn how to do it all this well

189
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:02,760
it's I think becomes more and more welcome because we feel the benefits it feels inviting invite and invigorating

190
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:09,900
or revitalizing and we start discovering through Dharma practice this whole process of Desire

191
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:15,179
engagement reflection and and evaluation

192
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:23,280
it feels more and more like second nature it's almost as if it's almost as if um it's kind of what the heart does

193
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:29,220
if we get out of the way well enough if we have a clear sense of a desire

194
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:36,000
that is healthy and maybe it almost feels natural to have then the rest can follow almost as if

195
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,400
it's natural and it doesn't feel like work after a while just feels like this is what life

196
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,980
is this is what we do for some people what seems like natural

197
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:52,799
and what we who we are and what we do is be neurotic because that's the habits that we formed

198
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:59,400
and created and all that and fear and anxiety and all kinds of things become second nature because we repeated it so

199
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,340
much and it's inconceivable that it can be different it can be different

200
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:11,700
we can transform ourselves and change we can develop other skills and ways of

201
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:16,799
being that become second nature and these the and the and the one of the

202
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:23,059
one of the perspectives for understanding how to do that through this is these poor

203
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:30,720
roads practices for success and which you can apply to almost

204
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,059
anything you want to do in life but in Dharma practice we do we apply it

205
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:43,919
to our practice so you might try it this week you might try to maybe you know you could do take

206
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,500
one of the four One A Day for four days and just kind of let it write it down a

207
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:55,620
piece of paper or the word and put it on your I don't know sticky notes a few sticky notes put it

208
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:02,880
on your wheel of your driver your your steering wheel of your car or your mirror or someplace where you are next

209
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:09,380
on your phone that that's the place

210
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:16,679
yeah and so a day on desire Dharma desire

211
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:24,900
a day on effort to darn my effort curvature's effort a day on consideration reflection

212
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:30,600
thinking about it Dharma thinking and today an evaluation looking at the

213
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:37,679
consequences considering it and um spend time with us and see if it you

214
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:43,159
know get a hang of it to get a sense of it learn how to develop it learn how to

215
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:48,299
you know make it make it an art form or a skill or a craft that you've developed

216
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:55,200
it so it becomes easy it doesn't become like you know it doesn't become this like heavy work it becomes and you know

217
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:02,760
vitalizing work if you call it work so um

218
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:10,020
what are your thoughts about this any questions anything you want to be clarified or do you have any protests

219
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,500
anything

220
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:25,200
um so it feels like almost when I think about this I need to start with the

221
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:31,320
fourth one first because that kind of leads to you know

222
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:38,520
the investigation feels like the to uncover the things first fantastic I

223
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:45,179
think that's great because um what that means is you're going to be looking at the consequences of how

224
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:51,419
you're living your life now and what you might discover might inform how you go forward and what desires you

225
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:59,120
want to have yeah yeah I love that thank you starting with the last one

226
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:08,220
I just may want to make a simple observation the comment that lady made there reminds me of the circle that you

227
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:16,500
have you investigate you form a desire you you put a very uh sincere effort into

228
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:22,440
the into the work I had to improve and then you basically evaluate and reflect

229
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:28,320
and then Circle goes around there very nice yeah it's a circle like a spiral come around and around and it keeps

230
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:35,179
developing and growing yes that's very nice idea yes in the other hole

231
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:42,980
that's okay there we go it's a race

232
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:49,260
that's not very dharmic it's the effort

233
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:56,039
oh uh I really appreciated the

234
00:24:56,039 --> 00:25:05,360
Clarity around desire around uh cultivating wholesome desire

235
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:13,260
because uh for me I've always been very driven

236
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:19,679
and I think for a long time in my practice I kept thinking that that was something I kind of needed to get rid of

237
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,779
or not be so involved with

238
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:30,179
so when you described a desire without clinging

239
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:35,539
or greed or aversion

240
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:41,220
that really landed for me wholesome desire agree horse and desire

241
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:46,919
yes and uh and it can be uh strong it can be something we put a lot of effort

242
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:52,980
into and you know it makes you know that really dedicated so some someone might think wow that person's putting a lot of

243
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:59,059
effort I wonder if that person's too attached and they ask you and you say no

244
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:04,140
I just have a strong desire and I have a lot of energy for this and I'm I've

245
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:09,779
given myself over to it and so that's a it's a beautiful thing to do

246
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:15,059
sometimes I I have sometimes the aspiration to I say that some I'm a

247
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:20,820
wannabe obsessive because I really like engaging and doing

248
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:25,980
and I just want to have sometimes more time to just give myself over to what you know one thing for a while

249
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:32,760
so it's a beautiful thing just to do one thing and sometimes I feel nourished by just doing one thing for a while and

250
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:39,380
just you know just really get myself over and there's a kind of Harmony that sets in in my system when I just really

251
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:45,139
spend time with one activity so yeah

252
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:51,320
I appreciate very much your your wisdom today thank you thank you

253
00:26:51,320 --> 00:27:00,299
and it made me think about my own practice in the practice of

254
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:06,539
living in that fashion which is for me mindfulness for the most most part um and what came to mind was Tara

255
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:12,360
Brock's reign rain do you know that yes acronym okay so I'm going to speak it

256
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:20,299
just because I think it's so applicable and Rain stands oh look at that rain stands for recognize allow

257
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:26,700
investigate and nurture which the essence of that is compassion self-compassion

258
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,980
and I bring it up because if I stopped with the four roads that you just shared

259
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:39,059
and I I have so very much to learn I'm a beginner um the question I sat with was well as I

260
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:46,919
investigate what do I do with all the emotions because here I am in my human body facing my habitual ways of being

261
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:54,059
that may be problematic or may not be and what what do we do with that and that's what made me think of Tara

262
00:27:54,059 --> 00:28:00,000
because the only thing I can think of to do with that is when they arise

263
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:08,400
to let them be there and love myself through it right because inevitably there are things that come up that take

264
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,440
me away from that that space that you just described which I do know and

265
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,500
experience but I certainly must practice to be there as much as possible so thank

266
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:25,440
you for the great the validation thank you love it

267
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:31,380
that was easy earlier in your talk Gail you talked

268
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:38,580
about how you have to the Buddha talked about clearing the path before you can see

269
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:44,340
more deeply for me that took about 15 years of meditation retreats

270
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:50,159
and the dedicated practitioners program that gave me the Forum in which to do

271
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:55,980
what you're talking about what I know about myself is without a

272
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:01,500
lot of support I I just don't

273
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:09,360
have the discipline I I don't I I can't I I have the idea that I want to do

274
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:15,960
these things but in daily life I unless I put myself in some kind of a

275
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:22,200
program I I don't stay with it that's fantastic so you you just in some ways

276
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:28,880
we can we can kind of evaluate to what you just said from this point of view of the teachings you certainly have a desire

277
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,860
as you reflect and look at yourself and you find it's difficult to do it alone

278
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:40,440
and so then you know so you see it doing alone the consequence of doing alone is you don't do it

279
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:47,220
and so but you still have this desire so what's the right effort what what how how to go forward with this and so for

280
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:53,279
you maybe it's to do it in community to make sure you have Community then you do it in the community and you find oh

281
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:58,980
yeah that works I'll do more of it so that's that would be an exact a

282
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:06,120
simple example of using these four to um you know to to to to address what

283
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:12,000
you're addressing but you're already doing this I think you just didn't have to have these categories to put them

284
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,580
into and um and then you might do it for another 15 years or something probably

285
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:24,960
take that for me and then at some point you might discover you know this is nice but I think I should uh uh you know I

286
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,539
see the consequence has been good and something might occur to you and say you know maybe I should try

287
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:37,200
an experiment because a lot of the Dharma practices good think of it as an experiment let me try an experiment

288
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:43,140
let me see what it's like now to practice alone let me do a self retreat

289
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:48,659
let me go off someplace for four days by myself and see if I can do a retreat without

290
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:55,440
any support from anybody else and and because I've been practicing for so long

291
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,899
and uh and then you find oh this is hard but maybe I have to find the discipline

292
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:06,000
inside now and not to rely on the group to support me and that's the I think this is the next

293
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,640
step for my growth and that's what happened to me that they're that very thing I wasn't

294
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:18,299
planning on it that kind of stumbled into it um I'd done all my Retreats and all my practice in Zen where you it's all group

295
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:23,820
practice and then I was introduced to this vipassana practice in Thailand and the

296
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:29,580
Abbott the monastery said oh go out there at that little Hut to the end of the monastery uh overlooking the rice

297
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:36,000
fields and stay there by yourself and practice all day and then come see me tomorrow so I went out there to do it and I

298
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,760
realized wait a minute I've never practiced all day alone and I said oh

299
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:47,940
uh this is this is I have I have to call on uh something inside of me I never called

300
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:55,440
on before I call the discipline then but this is you know an inner motivation that's and so that that became a growing

301
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:01,620
Edge for me so so this I'm not I'm agreeing with you I'm just I just wanted to say at some

302
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:08,159
point you might also find as you do as you do what you most supportive for you you might find that the the question

303
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:14,820
will come should I experimentally differently am I ready for an experiment that's that's so helpful I I really

304
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:21,720
don't have a group in which to practice now I probably need that uh the idea of

305
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:29,159
doing something alone scares me but it intrigues me too fantastic so then uh apply these four

306
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:34,740
steps to practicing alone you know what's desires what's desire

307
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:41,340
really fuse it or animates it in a good way would it be a good desire what's the importance of it what's the what are you

308
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:46,860
trying to really trying to do in a deep way and then what's the right effort

309
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:52,140
and then think about it for a while to really kind of get clear about what's

310
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:58,260
all it involves and then when you do it start doing the feedback loop of action reflection

311
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:02,120
thank you thank you thank you very much

312
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:13,860
being a discussion um I was looking for peace and safety

313
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:19,500
and I you know I didn't have it for a little bit so I've actually decided to

314
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:27,240
go into self-retrieve for three weeks prior to going into one week retreat with you in

315
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:33,240
person so I did it two like two days straights Friday and Saturday about six

316
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:41,700
hours straight and the way I kind of handled it was having darmi the day I woke up and as I

317
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:47,220
was approaching it I was reading choosing the emotion or topics or

318
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:53,760
dharmic idea that calls to me and listening to your talk and then having a

319
00:33:53,760 --> 00:34:00,000
meditation and listening your talk and meditation and I was able to go through that five to six hours

320
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:07,440
and I found incredible safety and peace just within me knowing that you know I

321
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:13,740
have some sensitive issue that I'm dealing with and emotion and what would

322
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:20,638
you think because for me this is how I'm approaching I'm in a private retreat with you where I who I'm whom I feel

323
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:27,480
safe and I'm gonna go find myself the safety that I can create because ultimately the

324
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:32,580
fears or the anxiety or the strong emotion that I have

325
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:39,960
really I really do need to take care with myself and have defined I think I need to find it within me yes to develop

326
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:47,158
that so um what would you recommend and then the way I was thinking about it is when I

327
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:55,080
didn't want to get out of my home I could reframe it I need to take care of my mind I need to

328
00:34:55,080 --> 00:35:01,700
take care of my body the body they need to relax so I'm doing this for me

329
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:07,500
so what would you do to prepare I don't think I'm just gonna I'm just gonna keep

330
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:12,780
this whale until I get to the in-person retreat without too much expectation

331
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:18,180
yeah but what would you is there any other thing you could recommend within

332
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:23,460
it a couple of things occurred to me one is it's wonderful what you described that the part of the action reflection

333
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:28,980
thinking about what you've done is that uh you might as you reflect the way you

334
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:35,339
did in seeing the benefits of what you've done let it let it support or nourish your con your confidence

335
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:43,859
your self-confidence that oh I can do this so that your I can do this in certain lit in ways and and

336
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:51,480
um so you have so that's one and the other is when you come to the retreat center uh you have a variety of

337
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:56,579
options of how to practice there and if you you found that it was beneficial to

338
00:35:56,579 --> 00:36:02,099
explore the edges of practicing alone you might try it even at the retreat to

339
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:07,859
do some of the meditations in your room okay well you're alone and see if that some of what you've been learning the

340
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:13,200
last few days benefits you and and you can carry it with you there and and uh

341
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,480
and see you know and then and you evaluate how is this working in the context of practicing in Silence with

342
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,520
other people is this making me feel less safe or more safe to have spent some time alone

343
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:30,060
okay and then during the next three weeks I'm going in the Intensive continuously doing maybe not six hours a

344
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:36,540
day maybe three to four hours just go into deeper and deeper and deeper I'm kind of doing the same thing that I had

345
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:43,020
done in the past when I go into one week Retreat where I did this intensive Retreat and it became intensive sessions

346
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:49,020
for myself it became much more meaningful when I get there so so this

347
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:56,099
is wonderful but keep reflecting on how it's going okay learn from how it's going evaluate study yourself carefully

348
00:36:56,099 --> 00:37:01,560
and some days it might work really well but you know we are we have all these emotional ups and downs in our life

349
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:08,220
right so you're tracking yourself and you might say oh today is a day to really do something different because I

350
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:13,560
don't feel I woke up kind of feeling pretty vulnerable so I think I better you know just read a

351
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:21,359
book [Laughter] okay so thank you all for being here and

352
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:28,800
coming uh and I invite any of you who want to meet me in the parking lot if you want

353
