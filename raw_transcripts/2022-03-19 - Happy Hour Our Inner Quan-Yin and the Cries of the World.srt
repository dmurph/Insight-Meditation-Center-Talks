10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,120
hi nick so all right so for the theme for tonight

11
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,600
what i would like to um share is um

12
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,280
is inspired by something that i read

13
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,600
from john keats the poet who [Music]

14
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,040
who lived who actually um just a little bit about john keats which

15
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,479
i didn't know he died from tuberculosis when he was 25 years old

16
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:34,720
and it was actually he also lived through a time

17
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,880
a time of pandemic there were many people in his family who were ill who died before him he

18
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,320
went through a lot of suffering and uh

19
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,759
and this is a from a letter this quote that i found it's from a letter

20
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,840
that he wrote to his brother just so beautiful so beautiful

21
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,439
so he says call the world if you please

22
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:10,720
the veil of soul making then you will find out the use of the

23
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,560
world i am speaking now in the highest terms for human nature

24
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:24,560
admitting it to be mortal which i will take here for granted of course he's talking from a particular uh perspective

25
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,840
from the christian perspective but let me um i say soul making soul is

26
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,280
distinguished from intelligence there may be intelligences or sparks of the

27
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,959
divinity in millions but they are not souls t till they acquire

28
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,239
um uh personality itself and then he ends

29
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,760
do you not see how necessary a world of pains and troubles

30
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,480
is to school and intelligence and make it a soul a place where the heart must feel and

31
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:05,120
suffer in a thousand diverse ways i read again the highlights the parts i

32
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,400
want to highlight do you not see how necessary a world of pains and

33
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,400
troubles is to school and intelligence and make it a soul so here

34
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:24,720
maybe in the words uh he's talking about intelligence so knowing awareness and that that all the pains

35
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:31,360
all the sorrows of the world are necessary in order to take this knowing to take this intelligence as a

36
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:38,239
human being to make us into a heart so maybe instead of the word soul i use the heart how to make a

37
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,760
mind and make it into a heart that that the suffering of the world is needed for

38
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,959
us to feel compassion for ourselves for the others

39
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,879
and he ends by saying a place where the heart must feel and suffer in a thousand diverse ways

40
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,159
so call the world if you please the veil of soul making or maybe i would

41
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:05,360
say the veil of compassion the veil of heart-making

42
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,760
so there are different ways different

43
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,199
teachings of course this is a teaching in buddhism that that com that

44
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:23,600
compassion arises suffering isn't just in vain

45
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,199
and and of course well here's another teaching and buddhism that comes to mind

46
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:35,120
that there are two types of suffering in buddhism there is suffering that leads to more

47
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,120
suffering and there is suffering that leads to the end of suffering

48
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,040
so the type of suffering that leads to more suffering is just ah why me this is

49
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,199
terrible why is it happening to them this is awful just more suffering just suffering wallowing and suffering

50
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:59,840
wallowing in pain wallowing in pain that's the type of suffering that leads to

51
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,360
more suffering and of course we all know that type right when the mind just takes

52
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,400
off and we're wallowing in it and then there is suffering

53
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:17,360
the second type of suffering is one that leads to the end of suffering and that is the profound

54
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:24,080
teaching there is so in that way it depends how we approach suffering

55
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,680
how we see suffering if we wallow if if

56
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,360
we get lost in it they're just piling piling on we're

57
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,400
suffering whereas if we open our hearts open our hearts to

58
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:47,120
compassion we cultivate compassion as keats call the world

59
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,320
in this world the veil of soul making he says i call it compassion

60
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:59,440
making making us into real human beings who feel who love who are compassionate

61
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:07,440
um fully inhabiting our humanity

62
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:14,800
and a compassionate heart has freedom there is freedom and compassion

63
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,840
there is strength and compassion there is beauty and compassion there is peace there is bliss in compassion

64
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,440
so the suffering as we work with it with compassion they

65
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:34,639
can open our heart for compassion towards ourselves and others and also there are wisdom practices when

66
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:42,160
we see when we see the unsatisfactoriness the suffering then can lead

67
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:49,360
to seeing the three characteristics which i have mentioned before impermanence unsatisfactoriness and not

68
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:56,479
self and again it's the end of suffering in the way that we're not impacted by it of course the

69
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:02,080
suffering still happens for us and others in the world challenges but there

70
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:09,120
is instead of saying we're not impacted by it maybe i should say um we don't wallow in it that's what i need to say

71
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,639
of course we're impacted because our heart opens up to compassion

72
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:20,960
when there is suffering of course our perspective changes

73
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:28,639
so that when suffering arises for ourselves or for others in the world

74
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:35,039
the automatic response is compassion is care and there's a stability there is a

75
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,240
beauty there's a goodness in compassion and

76
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,319
in the bigger perspective of equanimity holding it all holding it all spaciously

77
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:53,360
very very spaciously very spacious comings and goings again

78
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,960
we are impacted and yet we don't

79
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,319
wallow we don't wallow in it our perspective doesn't become limited to

80
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:10,840
just the suffering we don't just identify with the suffering for ourselves and

81
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:17,360
others okay that was a longer darmet than i intended to give but

82
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:24,080
that's the framing for tonight dear friends let's practice together

83
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,280
let's land let's land in our seat

84
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,549

90

out of care out of love releasing entanglements

91
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,680
just to stabilize just to cultivate stability

92
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:42,240

93
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:50,040

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:31,440
if you're not familiar with kuan yin you can imagine the buddha

119
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,279
either kuan yin or the buddha

120
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:43,440
whichever whomever with you have a relationship

121
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,400
imagine them

122
00:19:53,679 --> 00:20:02,000
gazing upon you holding you as you sit in their presence

123
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:11,440
in your mind's eye they hold you with their gaze with a

124
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:20,280
compassionate gaze knowing your life knowing your history

125
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,399
knowing your sorrows sufferings

126
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:33,559
knowing your joys your goodness

127
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:42,880
the goodness within they see that more than even more than you see in yourself

128
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:49,158
they see all of you and so much

129
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:55,200
more than you can see yourself let yourself be seen

130
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:01,880
with eyes of compassion letting your body relax

131
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:08,559
continuing to be breathed through the earth being embodied

132
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,840
and maybe this is not visual maybe it's a feeling that you're being

133
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:20,000
held the energy of compassion by them

134
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:26,480
or maybe it's more felt sense you're sitting on their lap

135
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,039
being held maybe like a newborn

136
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,720
appreciating how their compassion

137
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,279
is stable it's powerful

138
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,760
it's a soothing balm they love

139
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:01,039
care hold all that you are

140
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:06,360
the ten thousand joys the ten thousand sorrows

141
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:18,320
expansively without being toppled into

142
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:26,919
your suffering they care and yet there's a stability

143
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,560
and now imagine that they so gently and lovingly set you down

144
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:08,600
[Music] and say to you let me show you how it's done

145
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:21,080
they invite you to see the world through their eyes

146
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:29,960
as if the buddha or the queen yen [Music]

147
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:38,000
you invite them to enter your heart enter your mind shining out

148
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,320
so it's your body but they're gazing out they're feeling

149
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,159
so you feel the sense of stability

150
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:59,760
looking through their eyes their gaze this unbounded compassion

151
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:05,640
for yourself and for the world

152
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,000
hearing the cries the cries of sorrow yourselves and

153
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,559
others included

154
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,679
others who are suffering and war zones

155
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,278
and you hear the joys also

156
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,880
being breathed through mother earth through your feet

157
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:53,120
the hard expenses looking through the eyes of ultimate

158
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,760
compassion

159
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:06,159
allowing yourself to be impacted of course impacted you feel

160
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:13,039
you feel of course

161
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:21,480
there is love there is caring and yet not toppled over

162
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:37,440
and holding the sorrows the suffering of the world

163
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,360
opens your heart more to compassion to the goodness of compassion

164
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:49,039
not empathic distress which is agony

165
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:54,799
but compassion which is soothing healing wishing well

166
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:02,000
for others for yourself there's care warmth

167
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,278
heart quivers with

168
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:16,240
feels with your heart feels with the sorrow the

169
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:23,399
suffering in the stability

170
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:55,720
the world is the veil of compassion-making

171
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:03,919
if at any point it feels as feels overwhelming as the badan kuan yin

172
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:11,120
is teaching you gently gently

173
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:17,600
let yourself be held in their compassion you don't have to push yourself

174
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:26,760
let yourself be held in the compassion in care and love

175
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:37,000
a gentle cultivation and training

176
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:47,360
and if there's any judgment arising i can't do this

177
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:53,120
this is hard my mind is wondering etc

178
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:59,200
it's okay it's okay you're doing your best let it

179
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:07,679

you're doing your best let the judgment be held

181
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:23,799
with compassion and care and love with non-judgment

182
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,880
and as we come to the end of this practice period

183

204
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,400
know why are we doing this earth thing you know i'm like whatever right you know i had nothing better to do so i

205
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:33,119
went with it you know and then you know funny neil i just want to say you're you're that constrained forward it's

206
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:39,200
classical i'll be playing here all week um you know and then you know and then you

207
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:45,359
know we started talking about difficult things you know and you know i found myself sort of flipping back and forth

208
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:50,800
in my head you know right when things got difficult you know i would like you know for a

209
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,880
breath or two i would like feel the ground inside of me you know and it was you know it was just

210
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:02,960
it was just you know it was a very strong stance if you will it was very nice

211
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:09,520
beautiful thank you neil strong stance lovely thank you i'm delighted yes

212
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:16,240
there is method to the madness aurora please

213
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:22,079
um i don't know if i'll be able to articulate this but i come from a

214
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:30,240
family of people who are always trying to save you know saviors right like and um

215
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:37,680
and i i feel like i could feel in this meditation like like embodying kuan yin or having kuan

216
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,720
yin embody me that like just how different it is to

217
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,920
be with versus to like jump in

218
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:55,040
you know and um and i think i understand that conceptually

219
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:01,920
but it was nice to feel it like in a bodily way it's a lot if there's like a coolness to

220
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:07,920
it that i was really appreciating

221
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,599
um and i feel like i could i could use more of this like

222
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:19,440
i don't know if you have recommendations for like my dear it's available to you it's your

223
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:28,240
inner kwan yin your inner buddha is always available to you call them up and they show up and they embody you

224
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:34,560
any moment yeah there's something about like that and that embodiment that yeah you know

225
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,800
because when i do a meta practice i i can sometimes just get like caught in

226
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:48,000
the yeah yeah closeness of things you know right so this is this is a method right this is a

227
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:56,319
method this is and and as you ask okay how do i do this this is available to you anytime right this this

228
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:01,599
could be your practice this could be ah oh yes

229
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:09,200
there is an image of quantian oh beautiful what a gorgeous image thanks for sharing that on my desk oh my god

230
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:15,119
that is so perfect that is silver maybe at the very end when we before we close

231
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:21,200
maybe we'll spotlight you and you can put hold it up after we yeah yeah that's awesome thank you that'd be

232
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:28,319
lovely uh yeah so just to say yeah this is another way of practice so it's available if it's clicked for you

233
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:35,040
use it any time in white coin yen let let her enter you you and you know

234
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,079

235
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:47,200
great skillful means beautiful thank you thank you it's beautiful susan

236
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:54,319
please yeah um thank you for that practice um

237
00:41:54,319 --> 00:42:00,319
i guess i've been influenced mostly by the chinese version of kuan yin and um

238
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:07,040
you know she's sitting cross-legged and looking very serene and almost joyful while she's being compassionate

239
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:13,119
so i and then when i invited her to be in embody us to embody her and look out

240
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:18,800
through her eyes i remembered her one of the translations of her chinese name is

241
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:25,040
the one who listens with ease to the sounds of the world and i was i just felt that like she's

242
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:30,400
just like so rooted in you know the present moment of

243
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:36,720
you know just the wholeness of everything or you know the non what do you call it the emptiness side

244
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:43,599
of things right yes he's so rooted and joyful in that and that she's unperturbed and there's this room for

245
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:50,800
this big heart to just feel the compassion beautiful yeah thank you for bringing

246
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,319
that in and the embodiment the ease also that you felt and her listening joyfully

247
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:02,319
it's true the the depictions are so beautiful she's listening with ease and

248
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:07,520
and also the this invocation of emptiness because she sees the emptiness

249
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:13,119
and and yet she is moved it doesn't mean like oh i don't care it's all empty it's all it's it's there's there is the

250
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:18,240
chance of of just to say just to bring this in since

251
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:23,280
we i just brought we brought emptiness in emptiness it doesn't mean that it's

252
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:29,520
pointless or or empty the word shunyata the empty translation is empty is kind

253
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:34,560
of funny a little bit but it's it's full it's

254
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:39,680
full of possibility there's so much there's so much it's both

255
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:47,200
it's um gosh i feel like i need to give a hold on no i'm just going to leave it that i'll come back another time

256
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:52,800
thanks susan thanks for bringing ease to this i cannot pack it in just a couple of

257
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,920
minutes thanks susan a couple of reflections and then we'll

258
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:04,800
go into groups steve says this was a new visualization having the passionate

259
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,240
one inside us the compassionate one inside us and seeing through those eyes

260
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:16,079
where did this come from something to do more of and get better at yes yes

261
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:21,280
um so yeah where did the i mean there's so

262
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:26,319
many skillful means uh and i've learned to so you know these

263
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:31,680
practices some of them i come up with on my own or that or they come through

264
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:38,800
me i can't say i come up with they come through me and and and this one is inspired by

265
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,839
something i learned i think i see now

266
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:51,359
i think jack cornfield has some version of this maybe i think or someone else so

267
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:57,119
that to uh where that that maybe this is where it came from some version of it

268
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:03,599
and then um in a private reflection i appreciated the earthing

269
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:09,040
breathing us the earth breathing us from the feet up usually i begin meditation

270
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:14,720
beginning from the top of my head down yeah yeah all these different ways of

271
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:22,640
experiencing that open up so for the practice small groups i want to

272
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:28,400
spend some time as i did last time to really set them up because i think that helps

273
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:34,720
the community um practice uh more you know better

274
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,839
together so so as we come into groups

275
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:45,440
small groups i invite you to speak only from your own experience

276
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:51,760
not comment on somebody else's experience not ask them questions and not serve as a

277
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:59,040
facilitator so only speak from your own experience for your own benefit

278
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:06,240
and you share a nugget from your own experience if you wish or you hold silence you can say pass

279
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:12,720
or you can and then you pass it to the next person instead of a monologue long monologue you just

280
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:18,480
share one nugget you pass it to the next person the next person maybe says pass

281
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:25,680
hold or hold silence or shares one nugget from their experience and then passes it to the next so he goes around

282
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:33,040
and around and staying close to the integrity of your own experience speaking for your own benefit

283
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:40,079
not educating or impressing anyone just sacred space and entering the space with love with

284
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:47,040
care for yourself and others as if three kuan yen's are showing up listening to

285
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:52,240
each other holding each other with care with love

286
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:57,920
okay everyone the rooms are closed everyone is back and we seem to be out

287
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:04,640
of time we spent wonderful time earlier with questions and

288
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:11,920
comments so i'll finish by reading one reflection that came earlier and that is

289
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:18,960
i imagined i was a lotus flower emerging from the mud of the earth with kuan yin sending me

290
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:24,240
all of her compassion then i could let that compassion move through and out of

291
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:31,920
me what a beautiful way to practice as a lotus flower being the lotus flower whatever works for the

292
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:37,280
skillful means so thank you all thank you for your practice

293
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:43,359
for cultivating your own inner konyan inner buddha for the benefit of yourself

294
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:49,270
and all beings may all beings be well may all beings be free

295
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:55,920
