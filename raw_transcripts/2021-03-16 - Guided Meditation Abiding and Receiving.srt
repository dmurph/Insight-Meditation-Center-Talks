1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:09,200
so good day to everyone and good to be here with you

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:16,560
and the topic uh continues to be for this week samadhi

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,920
samadhi meaning usually translated as concentration

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:31,760
and one of the verbs associated with samadhi is abiding

5
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:39,440
to dwell or abide in these different good qualities of samadhi

6
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,559
and learning to abide is uh

7
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:51,360
you know is lingering is due is result residing in these states

8
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:58,960
as opposed to being in these states and striving or pushing or trying to have more

9
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,840
and the tremendous value of when we get settled have landed here in the present moment

10
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,280
feel settled here to learn how to abide in those states

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,000
and the biting is not a passive thing exactly though there's very little doing and

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
it's very consequential which i'll talk about later so to abide also is to be

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,920
receptive to abide and allow the goodness of a particular state to

14
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,920
nourish us to penetrate into us so and a lot of samadhi has to do with

15
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,200
letting go and so we could understand it a little bit as

16
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:52,000
abiding in the goodness of letting go abiding in the nourishment

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,920
that happens when we let go so we'll start this meditation

18
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:06,000
and and we'll do this abiding and receiving of

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,720
this nourishment or goodness of letting go of relaxing

20
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:23,280
so to assume a beneficial meditation posture

21
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:30,080
with some care to take a posture that will allow you

22
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:38,879
kind of a maximum amount of relaxation without falling asleep a balance between

23
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:46,239
remaining alert but allowing for deep in a sense deep body work to happen

24
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:53,360
as meditation kind of begins penetrating into all the different corners of our muscles

25
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:00,000
and allowing for deeper and more thorough letting go

26
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:11,360
and to gently close your eyes and without breathing deeply this time

27
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:18,159
just simply sitting here i'll direct you to relax different parts

28
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:24,319
of your body and as those parts relax linger a bit

29
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:31,440
with whatever good feelings are there with having relaxed kind of let yourself

30
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,680
take in even if the good feeling is a real kind of relief a local relief

31
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,000
of not being tense or maybe there's a pleasure

32
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:51,440
allow yourself to abide and receive the good feelings that might come

33
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:58,080
with relaxing so on the exhale then

34
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,480
relaxing the shoulders

35
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:15,840
releasing the shoulders and

36
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:29,840
perhaps there's a way to also release and relax the arms and the hands

37
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,159
so from the shoulders all the way down to the fingers

38
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:44,880
relaxing releasing and then receiving whatever lingering good feelings are there with

39
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:57,840
that however mild or small

40
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,400
relaxing the muscles of the face

41
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:14,320
and even if there's also uncomfortable sensations for now receive the comfortable ones the

42
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:25,840
pleasant ones as you relax your face

43
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,840
as you exhale relax the belly

44
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,479
sometimes harder to feel good feelings with a relaxed belly but maybe there are

45
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,840
some that linger

46
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,280
also in the legs the thighs and the calves all the way

47
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,680
down to the feet is there some the muscles there be released

48
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:24,639
and feel some good some nice pleasant feeling of vitality or

49
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,840
relief

50
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,880
and then bring your attention to your

51
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:53,360
breathing and as you breathe as you exhale

52
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,639
see if you can relax your whole body on the exhale

53
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:05,680
and feel whatever goodness comes from that relaxing

54
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:17,840
an opening a softening a settling

55
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:31,840
perhaps more of a sense of flow and vibration in the body

56
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,840
and the exhale itself is a kind of letting go

57
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,080
allow for the full letting go of the exhale

58
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:00,960
and not always easy to feel but maybe you can feel some parts of the exhale

59
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,800
the release the letting go

60
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:13,840
as a nourishment as a good feeling

61
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:27,840
the exhale part of the goodness of the exhale is letting go of thoughts

62
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:41,839
as you exhale

63
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:55,839
letting go of thoughts and letting go into the body breathing

64
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,320
and whatever openness receptivity there might be there at the end of the

65
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:23,839
exhale receive the inhale

66
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:36,480

67

and allow yourself to feel how that might be good feel good or

68
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,560

70
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,839

71
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,360
of awareness in your body

72
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,440
that remains when you let go of your

73
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
thoughts

74
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,519
and then as you inhale in the abiding with the breathing

75
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:47,839
there can be also a receptivity in allowing the inhale to arise

76
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:58,880
the inhale to arise in the vibrating

77
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:06,640
flowing tingling vibration of the body

78
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:29,839

letting go into receptive state receptive with your body to the

90
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:59,680
pulsing vibrating flowing dynamic sensations of the body

91

allowing them receiving them where part of the goodness

92
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:16,319

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:25,920
and to feel the goodness of abiding receiving

94
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,240
this body this body breathing

95
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,399
letting the thinking mind become quieter

96
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:51,839
so you can more fully abide and receive

97
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
so

98
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,559
to abide in whatever goodness

99
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:17,840
pleasantness enjoyability there is here now

100
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:24,158
and breathe within that breathe with that

101
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:31,840
quietly receptively

102
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:42,000
with an inner quietude that is sensitive available

103
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,159
receptive simply to abide

104
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,039
here and now

105
00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:01,440
with whatever is here trying to make anything happen

106
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,720
just abiding in whatever goodness is

107
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,840
available

108
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
so

109
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,840
so

110
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,840
so

111
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,000
and as we come to the end of the sitting

112
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,440
to abide here in the present moment

113
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:50,799
for these last minutes to abide

114
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,080
not to do anything or accomplish anything

115
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:06,320
but to be at rest or at ease in one own one's own skin and body

116
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:19,679
and whether you actually can do this well or not you might just imagine yourself

117
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:30,559
in a circumstance where you can just abide just be rather than do

118
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:36,559
some place where you feel comfortable and safe and settled

119
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:45,840
where you have all the time in the world and no pressure

120
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:52,960
and in this state in the privacy of your own mind and

121
00:28:52,960 --> 00:29:01,360
heart let others the presence of others

122
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,278
abide also here with you

123
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:14,960
so that others are abiding around you or with you without requiring anything of you

124
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,320
needing anything of you

125
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:31,278
and in this way perhaps you can open up a kindness a care

126
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:40,159
maybe even a love good will that it's almost not a doing

127
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:48,720
but more how the heart vibrates when nothing is needed you feel safe

128
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:55,840
and you take in the humanity of another person

129
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:06,080
and without requiring anything that you do or say to the person

130
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,840
to people

131
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:23,840
can you gaze upon them kindly gaze upon them with goodwill

132
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:40,000
and may they and all beings be happy

may the people you think of and all others be safe and peaceful

00:30:53,840 --> 00:31:04,640
may the people that you consider and all others be free

135
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:13,600
and may it be that the benefits of this meditation practice

136
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:21,519
in seeing in unseen ways intentional and unintentional ways may those benefits

137
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:26,880
spread out to benefit the people around you and the world
