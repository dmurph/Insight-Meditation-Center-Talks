1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,520
good morning

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:09,839
everyone have a good

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:19,080
day I appreciate very much the chats and I know that the people who

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:26,080
chat are a small percentage of the people who are attending right now and who

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:34,719
listen and watch this these teachings and I take those of you who uh chat uh

6
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:43,399
with wonderful good mornings and greetings as kind of representative of the good willll that uh exists in this

7
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:50,399
wider group of people who are part of this YouTube community so thank you and

8
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,920
also I Delight in seeing names that I recognize either because you

9
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:03,280
you you regularly do a greeting on to chat or because I know you from

10
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,200
earlier other places other Retreats and things and uh it's really really nice

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:17,040
thank you it makes it kind of come alive a little bit more for me to be doing this teaching um there was a time years ago

12
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:25,439
where I would have thought this was really strange and may be impossible to teach this way in a in an empty room um

13
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,560
but I feel I feel very connected and appreciative of all of you and this

14
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:38,079
chance to be able to communicate this way so thank you and and the chats make a big difference for

15
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:45,520
that so um so the topic is mindfulness of

16
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:53,240
thinking and today I want to uh connect thinking to our

17
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,479
emotions for some people there's almost no difference between the two and for

18
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,560
some people they are quite distinct but there's also a strong

19
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:11,879
Bridge a strong connection between the two and to find a way

20
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:19,640
of not identifying so strongly with our thoughts or our emotions so we can see

21
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:26,879
them more clearly gives a uh possibility for new things to arise new ways of processing

22
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,840
new discoveries of deep within ourselves and

23
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:39,800
so and one of those is uh we can discover that when

24
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,440
thinking is closely wedded to the emotions closely

25
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:52,519
connected um then if the emotions themselves are difficult emotions then the thinking themselves

26
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:58,760
are influenced by the that mood and if thinking them thinking is difficult and

27
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:05,799
challenging uh that undermines us or in some way or other then the

28
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:13,519
emotions that come from those thoughts can be difficult to be with and can continue to to undermine us or have a

29
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,080
kind of negative influence on us so I can go both directions and

30
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:25,480
sometimes thoughts influence thinking sometimes thinking influence thoughts and now sometimes they just seem to be

31
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:32,760
one big ball of things together what we're looking for in the Dharma is

32
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:39,760
not necessarily to stop thinking but to think from a deeper

33
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:48,519
place to think from a place where a lot of the difficult emotions um are not influencing how we

34
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:53,840
think or where thinking is not the place that are we're challenged

35
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,400
and angry or afraid or something there are so there's a source

36
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,920
of thinking that is deep within us and we've been talking this week about the

37
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:13,319
source from where we think are we thinking mostly from the head or some location in the

38
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:20,880
body as we relax more and more deeply and the thinking the source of

39
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,800
the thinking can be in a new place if it stays in the old place you

40
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,160
can't solve a problem with the problem sometimes but if we think from a new

41
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:40,240
place a place that's more free or less identified or feels like it has more of

42
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,680
a calm intimacy from deep within then it's a lot easier to track

43
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,880
and see the connection between thoughts and emotions so we're not necessarily

44
00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:00,199
getting rid of thoughts and thinking but we are learning to think in a different way a simpler way

45
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:07,039
a deeper way so we'll see in this guided meditation I'll try to keep it simple

46
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:16,000
but to do this so assuming an upright alert not

47
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,520
necessarily upright that's I use that as a metaphor doesn't have to be literally upright but a

48
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,400
aligned posture a posture that

49
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:37,360
maybe it's adjusted so there's a little bit of dignity in the

50
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:44,080
posture and

51
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,360
to gently close the

52
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,560
eyes and as you are right now before doing anything else

53
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,720
become aware of your

54
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,000
thinking how would you characterize your thinking at this

55
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,360
point is there a source from where your thinking is coming from

56
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,800
where it

57
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:49,919
appears is there any mood or emotion or state of mind that comes with the way

58
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:58,120
you're thinking how you're thinking what you're

59
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
thinking

60
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:31,319
and then gently as you exhale

61
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:34,759
relax in your

62
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:04,520
body almost as

63
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:10,120
if gravity is letting

64
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:18,280
water flow or melting butter flow downward let it almost as if gravity

65
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,720
lets your place from where you're aware your awareness

66
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:31,519
itself flow downwards into your torso make maybe into your

67
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:35,959
belly certainly out of the

68
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:47,080
head and so then being aware becomes closely associated

69
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,839
with the sensations in your

70
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
torso

71
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:40,480
and continue now with awareness of breathing the rhythm

72
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:47,800
of breathing the expanding and contraction contraction of breathing

73
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:54,839
the alternating sensations of inhale and

74
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:01,040
exhale ride those Sensations

75
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:07,200
especially on the exhale relax and settle

76
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,200
in a homecoming to deep

77
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
inside

78
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:46,120
and if you're thinking rather than letting go of your

79
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,240
thoughts don't don't give them any

80
00:10:53,360 --> 00:11:00,680
attention instead to tune into the breathing in

81
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:09,160
your body almost as maybe as if breathing is

82
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:17,959
music that's a as if music as if it's a music which is attractive to listen to

83
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:25,160
attractive to feel that there's very little

84
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,959
competition to stay with your thinking

85
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
for

86
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:35,040
a deep place of sensing of knowing feeling being

87
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:44,160
aware that doesn't require a lot of

88
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:50,360
thinking it's more of a quiet silent

89
00:12:52,600 --> 00:13:00,839
receptivity to Sensations and movements and

90
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:21,279
relaxing on the exhale without ambition just not trying

91
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,639
too

92
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
hard

93
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
e

94
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
for

95
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
for

96
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
for

97
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
e

98
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:15,399
and then finding deep inside is there some place that's

99
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:25,319
soft or calm or quiet somewhere within anywhere at

100
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:34,680
all and from that quiet or soft

101
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,800
place be aware of

102
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:47,920
thinking maybe almost as if you're happily peacefully

103
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:55,680
underwater snorkeling looking up at the surface seeing the moving waves

104
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,480
above but below it's peaceful

105
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:15,640
and if there are thoughts about what you're thinking see if those secondary thoughts

106
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:21,600
about the thinking can come from that soft quiet

107
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,640
place deep within very simple

108
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:33,080
thoughts not trying to Fig figure anything out or judge

109
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:39,559
anything mostly simple thoughts of

110
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,880
recognition maybe bordering on appreciation for what is

111
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,240
happening knowing that you're

112
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
thinking

113
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:33,280
e discursive thinking telling

114
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,440
stories analyzing commentary

115
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,039
planning is kind of like clothes we put

116
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:57,320
on that we can take off and put on new clothes we think one thing and then

117
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,840
another and those thoughts discursive thoughts

118
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:09,440
if they are occurring now are they connected to any

119
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:17,919
emotion and if so the emotion or mood it's like clothes that you wear

120
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:25,679
they come and they go we put them on and they take them off no need to identify them identify

121
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:34,000
with them know them from some place deep

122
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,679
inside watching what's happening on the

123
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
surface

124
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,039
knowing thinking that's just

125
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:30,158
thinking knowing emotions or moods just as emotions or moods

126
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,760
maybe seeing how they influence each

127
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
other

128
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
e

129
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
for

130
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
for

131
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
for

132
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:29,760
and now after these minutes of meditating

133
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:38,279
we'll go back to how we began become aware of your

134
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:46,960
thinking how you're thinking the source from where you're

135
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:56,360
thinking what you're thinking you're allowed to think just

136
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,880
see it clearly

137
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:09,600
and how might you be different now than at the

138
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,720
beginning how is thinking

139
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,799
different and how is awareness of thinking different now than the beginning

140
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:48,840
is the connection between thinking in emotions has it changed at

141
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
all

142
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:33,799
and might there be a place deep inside where thinking is characterized by

143
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:37,519
Peace Quiet

144
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,720
calm maybe an

145
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:52,840
intimacy that's below the surface of the usual thoughts and

146
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:59,679
emotions that come and go

147
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:14,360
and what is it like to be aware of thoughts thinking and

148
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,799
emotions from this deep peaceful

149
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
place

150
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
e

151
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,520
for

152
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,519
for

153
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
for

154
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,600
and then as we come to the end of this

155
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:46,360
sitting is there a way of now turning your attention outward into the

156
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:52,600
world where you don't get caught in the world or reactive to

157
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:58,799
it because being caught and being reactive that comes and goes

158
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:05,679
that's part of the surface experience of life even though it might feel deep but

159
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:12,559
is there a deeper place a quieter place a place of safety

160
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:20,720
within or Refuge within from which you can gaze upon the

161
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,720
world

162
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:33,278
kindly be still and gaze upon the world

163
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:42,640
kindly so in that gaze in that orientation to the world around

164
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:52,159
you there is conveyed Good Will

165
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:59,320
kindness love maybe peace

166
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:05,720
may all beings be

167
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:12,639
happy may all beings be

168
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:20,320
safe may all beings be

169
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:29,240
peaceful may all beings be free

170
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,360
a freedom that begins in their own

171
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:46,600
Hearts may we care for everyone's

172
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,880
[Music]

173
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:03,659
heart [Music]

174
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:12,559
thank

175
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,159
you

176
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:10,200
so hello and we come to the third talk on mindfulness of

177
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,679
thinking and um kind of stepping back and overview of

178
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:21,000
this mindfulness practice one of the things that I have

179
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:27,159
important I've learned many important things by teaching this practice and one of them I Learned was

180
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:34,279
was that when I started teaching the only reference point I had for the practice was really my own

181
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:40,679
experience so I thought that was what everyone was experiencing and then as I started to

182
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:47,519
teach and talk to more and more people about their practice I realized how what a wide

183
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,720
range of ways people practice what a wide range of ways in which people's

184
00:32:52,720 --> 00:33:01,919
kind of minds work or processing work or how they organize and understand their inner processes and

185
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:08,919
and what they call emotions what they call thoughts what they call awareness itself and so now as a teacher it isn't

186
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:15,000
that I am hopefully I mean it's maybe this is more aspirational

187
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:22,679
than what I actually do but it isn't that I have a clear idea this is what you're supposed to do but

188
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:28,320
rather I'm trying to offer you you different elements different pieces

189
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:35,120
um uh different different ways of practicing um in different circumstances

190
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:40,679
to see um if some of it then you can adapt for yourself some of it fits into

191
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:45,880
how your mind and body work how your experience of Life Works and your inner

192
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:53,360
landscape because I think uh eventually all of us become our own teachers all of us have to become familiar enough to our

193
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,559
own mind and heart and body to know what what supports us to find peace what

194
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:08,079
supports us to find Freedom and wisdom and um and uh

195
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:15,280
so you know a lot of this practice that I'm teaching is to get you present enough attented to know so you can learn

196
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:22,000
how it works for you and this is true for the world of thinking uh many people

197
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,118
think a lot they might know what they think about and but very few people step

198
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:35,560
back and really are aware and familiar and and investigate what is thinking

199
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:41,280
what's going on while we think and I like to think of thinking as

200
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,599
a ecosystem of many factors that come

201
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:54,440
together and the simple word thinking uh implies a known and unknown ecosystem

202
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:59,480
that contributes to whatever it is you think that thinking is and it's possible

203
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:06,079
that many of us have slightly or very different ideas of what thinking is for example thinking in words or thinking in

204
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:11,920
image images some people the primary processing way is through their emotions

205
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:20,920
or somatically and uh and somehow that is where the deep understanding and and uh

206
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:27,040
and recognition of what this world is about and uh less so than in words or

207
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,920
less so in images so um to to really kind of stop

208
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:39,960
and see and this is how it is for me now given this is how my processing is can I

209
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:45,960
settle can I find some way to not be reacted to that not be judgmental to

210
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:51,240
that not be caught in it um not be pushed around by it but find some

211
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:58,440
balance some grounding some stability with how it is and um so one of the

212
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:05,680
things we uh some people will learn I can't say everyone that that's how it it should be this way but we'll see that

213
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:13,960
there's a strong connection between thinking and emotions and uh if uh if you and

214
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:20,000
sometimes it's the emotion which is the factory for the

215
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,720
thoughts and uh and I think of it sometimes as if the thinking is just a

216
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:32,640
messenger and we might be thinking a lot and caught in our thoughts but it's I think of it more as a messenger for that

217
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:38,880
factory for that deeper source of emotions that are really uh uh uh

218
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:46,640
producing these these thoughts and if we don't understand the factory then um the factory will keep

219
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:54,160
working over time just keep producing producing producing these thoughts you can let go of the thoughts forever but

220
00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:00,280
new thoughts similar thoughts will just keep being produc produc because the factory is working you know

221
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:08,800
non-stop but if thinking is kind of like the messenger for something deeper going on sometimes that deeper is the emotions

222
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:14,400
so for example thinking about the future a lot um for it's a high percentage of

223
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,880
time I think for people there's some kind of apprehension some kind of worry or fear

224
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:27,440
operating that is what needs the attention that's that's the me that's what the messenger is pointing to

225
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:34,040
and uh so then learn how to practice mindfulness of emotions like we talked about last week and then we don't have

226
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:40,839
to think so much we're not caught in the grip as much because we're now attending to what's really going on and what's

227
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:49,319
driving the thinking and giving it power even so if there's anger uh uh a angry

228
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:54,480
thoughts if there's then uh feel the anger underneath it the emotion the

229
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,880
factory that it's coming out of and as we feel the anger maybe then we can drop

230
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:06,079
even deeper maybe the anger comes from fear or from hurt or from feeling

231
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:13,440
somehow um threatened so to to notice the emotion

232
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:21,079
that comes along with thinking uh and is very useful because maybe that's what needs our attention

233
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:30,319
and sometimes it's good emotions there might be the future thinking might be U uh Happy anticipation for something and

234
00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:38,240
why why not continue doing it it makes me happy it's a good thing so that's okay um and sometimes in meditation we

235
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:46,520
have a deeper purpose something more valuable to do which is to drop in more and more deeply into some deeper Source

236
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:53,640
within and there is a source within us of Peace where things that come out of

237
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:59,079
that peace or out of that groundedness or out out of that calm or out of that

238
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:07,040
uh deep intimacy within that uh something emerges from there and here we have a distinction

239
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:15,560
that uh I think comes from more or less from the Buddha is there are thoughts which

240
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:22,800
are constructing things making things up a lot of thinking is making things

241
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:30,079
up and um and then there are thoughts that arise from deeper place inside

242
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:35,319
that's not constructing and making stories making plans making judgments

243
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:41,640
but rather something deeper inside has a feeling of emerging uh there's an emergence of

244
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:46,680
certain thoughts that do not seem like they're creating something they're

245
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:51,880
expressing something wisdom care love

246
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:58,920
kindness um wisdom something deeper so this this ability to notice we're

247
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:05,480
thinking being mindful of it enough that we can start asking questions what is this how is this how is this being

248
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:13,319
experienced is a way of stepping away from being in the grip of thoughts and to use a capacity we have

249
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:20,480
for observation reflection to to not be in the grip of the thoughts they lost in

250
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,560
them and then to ask ourselves what is the emotion that's connected to it um

251
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:33,920
and uh and then do mindfulness of emotion or as we did yesterday to ask um

252
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:40,079
how's this thinking uh expressed physically what's am I tight or tense or

253
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:47,720
activated someplace in my body and is that possible to relax that so these are

254
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:53,160
kind of ways of reflection of think of kind of like thinking but maybe from a

255
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:59,960
deeper place or from a place that's more independent thinking that's not caught in the

256
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:06,240
discursive thinking in the story making mind and the scared mind or the angry

257
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:13,880
mind or the discouraged mind but steps back and in a kind way in

258
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:21,880
a relaxed way in a independent way uh is able now to engage what's happening here

259
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:27,040
what's going on here where that engagement and those questions are done

260
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:33,440
very calmly peacefully with very little at stake not trying to fix anything not trying to be

261
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:41,720
in a hurry to make something go away it's almost like as we step back and reflect and aware from a Freer

262
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:46,760
place um it isn't we're trying to solve the thinking we're trying to

263
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:52,160
almost um uh grow this place

264
00:41:52,160 --> 00:42:00,119
of of of liberated awareness free awareness deep into deep awareness of

265
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:07,640
our life so it doesn't matter so much what the consequences of that practice is as

266
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:15,960
it is as much as it is how that grows that practice that ability to see clearly and openly but we do it by

267
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:23,760
looking at thoughts and um I think it's very very powerful a lot of the problems that we

268
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:31,319
run into for ourselves chances are they have thinking has some role to them and thinking might

269
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:38,480
not be the deepest Source maybe there's an emotion that's deeper than that's feeding the thoughts an attitude that's

270
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:44,680
feeding them but um the way we think can have a very deleterious effect on our

271
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:52,640
mood our emotional life our experience of ourselves a lot of people they're thinking is it's undermining their own

272
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:58,720
well-being we believe the stories we believe the judgments that there's something wrong with us

273
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:07,440
that we're somehow not quite right or something that there's shame or blame or

274
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:13,920
or um that uh lack of fame or you know all kinds of things that go

275
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:20,319
on and um and uh so to start not being

276
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:28,000
influenced by those thoughts not being caught by them not perpetuating them is part of the power of mindfulness so just

277
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,760
step back and see and uh H how are you thinking from where are you

278
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,839
thinking what is the emotional Source what's the factory for it what happens

279
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:43,880
if you bring loving attention to anger or fear

280
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:50,720
that's producing those thoughts or fueling them what happens if you relax the body

281
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,920
that's activated that's prod that's connected to those thoughts and what

282
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:03,520
with over time what happens if you can observe or recognize or know or even

283
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:09,559
with very calm thoughts uh recognize what's happening

284
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:14,680
from this deeper emerging place this deeper place of Refuge that can exist

285
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:21,880
deep within so what happens so uh maybe that was a lot of

286
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:27,520
ideas for 15 minutes um and Hope hopefully some of it

287
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:35,760
uh supports you and for if you'd like to continue this exploration uh for today

288
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:42,839
next until we meet tomorrow you might um uh become more cognizant of the

289
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:48,040
relationship between thinking and emotions emotions and thinking do they

290
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:55,280
come together are they completely wetted are they slightly two different things and as you consider that both by simple

291
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:04,720
thoughts asking what is this how is this but as you sit back and relax and just observe this can you feel some freedom

292
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:11,359
from that that uh complex of emotions and

293
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:18,920
thoughts so thank you very much and I'll continue

294
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,920
tomorrow
