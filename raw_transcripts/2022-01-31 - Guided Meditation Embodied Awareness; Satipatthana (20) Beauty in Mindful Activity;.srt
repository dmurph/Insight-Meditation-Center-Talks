00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,839
hello everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,639
beginning of our week week of meditation

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,359
discussion of the buddha's teachings on the

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:31,400
four foundations for mindfulness for awareness

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,880
and i want to begin with a little story

6
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,960
there was a once a novice who

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:51,680
entered the monastery and was being introduced to the teachings of mindfulness sati patana

8
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,000
and asked the question of the abbess

9
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,840
when should we be mindful

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,159
maybe the novice hadn't really heard about mindfulness before and seems like a reasonable reasonable

11
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:16,960
question when should one be mindful and the abbess replied

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,000
when it is better than the alternative

13
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:29,759
when it is better than the alternative and i think that uh certainly in my

14
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:37,520
experience as i've followed this path of mindfulness for now several decades

15
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,880
that it becomes clearer and clearer that

16
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,040
mindfulness somehow is the best alternative is the best option

17
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,280
and so rather than mindfulness being

18
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,560
rather than struggling wondering where i should be and what seems important

19
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,600
to have to have mindfulness in the middle of

20
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,920
our experience whatever we're doing is really

21
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,239
a delight it's really a wonderful thing

22
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:27,120
because it's a mindfulness when it becomes comes to its simplest

23
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:36,599
potential simplest form

24
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,599
it's also its most profound form it's a

25
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:52,160
clarity and a freedom of awareness that in and of itself

26
00:02:52,160 --> 00:03:00,080
is not diminished not being hurt not being undermined or deflated

27
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,519
that's not being eclipsed that's not being

28
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,720
coming under the influence of some of the

29
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,360
challenging states of mind that we might have

30
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:24,080
and all too easily when mindfulness is not present when this kind of clear awareness is not present

31
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:29,599
the mind come gets can easily get under the influence of stress

32
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,480
of tension of one form of another

33
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:48,720
so what is it about awareness being aware the practice of awareness practice of mindfulness

34
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:56,560
that makes it one of the best alternatives for what to do at any given moment

35
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:05,599
and now here we are to meditate to practice mindfulness

36
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
so gently closing your eyes

37
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,840
and and perhaps

38
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:28,400
without trying to meditate see if you can have a very simple

39
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,440
awareness of your body

40
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:42,560
maybe exploring your body re-familiarizing yourself with your body

41
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:50,199
as if the two of you haven't connected for a while

42
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:13,840
and without the idea of meditating on the breathing familiarize yourself with your breathing

43
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:26,800
familiarize yourself with the body's experience of breathing

44
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,600
the sensations in your body that come into play as you breathe

45
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,039
and when there is awareness especially awareness that

46
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:53,680
almost arises together or out of

47
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,320
the body

48
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:10,080
the breathing can feel like the experience the sensations of breathing can feel almost as if they

49
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:18,240
are infused with awareness itself

50
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,400
at the minimum the awareness that has to be present to feel

51
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,400
sensations

52
00:06:51,840 --> 00:07:00,560
and perhaps as if you're filling your breathing your body with awareness

53
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:08,280
gently take some deeper breaths and longer exhales

54
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:28,039
gently relax your body as you exhale

55
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,919
letting your breathing return to normal continue a few more rounds of breathing

56
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:11,520
to relax on the exhale as you relax

57
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:18,240
some of the muscles of your body perhaps it's a relaxation into more

58
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:24,520
awareness in that part of your body

59
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,880
and then letting go of relaxation

60
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:00,160
in favor of a simple awareness of breathing in and breathing

61
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:08,160
out the simpler that awareness is

62
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,879
the more profound it is

63
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:30,640
letting awareness grow in the breathing with the breathing

64
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,519
and if you wander off away into the mind thoughts

65
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:43,760
consider whether mindfulness coming back to mindfulness

66
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,399
might be the better alternative than what you're doing

67
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,559
as we come to the end of this sitting

68
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:00,000
let there be an awakening of awareness throughout

69
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,240
your body

70
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:15,799
becoming more sensitive to your embodied existence

71
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:26,080
and it's with your body that you'll move and

72
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,000
walk and stand or

73
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:38,080
move your arms to eat whatever

74
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,760
movements you make with your body

75
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:51,039
imagine that you'll do that with an embodied awareness

76
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:58,320
so you're living in your body aware through your body

77
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,679
of the activities of your day

78
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,360
and that those activities

79
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,720
might also be the means for conveying

80
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:45,679
care and kindness for yourself

81
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:53,278
and for others if you're alone

82
00:28:53,360 --> 00:29:01,840
your actions of your body can be done attentive to how they care for yourself

83
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:08,000
when with others you can be attentive

84
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,679
to how in some way or other

85
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,840
they convey your care and kindness for others

86
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:31,039
on this day may we explore how our activities what we actually do

87
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:36,559
in our actions might be

88
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:44,399
done with a greater dedication to kindness

89
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:49,919
good will love

90
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,360
appreciation

91
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:03,279
of self of others and this whole world that we make direct

92
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:11,200
contact with with our bodies on this day may we have midas as touch

93
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,760
that everything we touch we touch with kindness

94
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:25,760
may all beings be happy may all beings

95
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,039
be safe may all beings

96
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:38,880
be healthy may all beings be peaceful

97
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:48,160
may all beings be free [Music]

98
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:57,869
[Music]

99
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:03,759
so hello everyone and we're continuing now with um

100
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:11,919
going through the discourse on the four foundations for mindfulness for awareness

101
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:17,360
and uh it's the ways of developing a heightened sense of attention

102
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:24,960
attentiveness awareness and it's in these four different domains four different areas of our life

103
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,799
that we bring attention to sort of different kinds of attention so that our capacity to be awake and

104
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:37,440
aware becomes stronger and stronger clearer and clearer simpler and simpler this all at the same

105
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:44,320
time and we're doing the third exercise in the 13 exercises

106
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:50,640
and it goes like this a practitioner is one who acts in full

107
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:56,720
awareness when going forward and returning who acts in full awareness when looking

108
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,880
ahead and looking away who acts in full awareness when flexing

109
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:09,039
and extending the limbs who acts in full awareness when

110
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:15,360
wearing one's robes or carrying one's outer robe and bowl for monastics maybe

111
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,720
for lay people a full awareness and wearing our clothes

112
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:26,880
and carrying our plates and silverware and

113
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:36,799
when we're eating who acts in full awareness when eating drinking consuming food and tasting

114
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:44,159
who acts in full awareness when defecating and urinating who acts in full awareness when walking

115
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,279
standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking

116
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:55,840
and keeping silent so this is mindfulness in activities

117
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:02,480
when i was first studying this uh i was probably under with this

118
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,638
coming with a strong influence in the zen training i'd done and i

119
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,839
read the text selectively and i read it selectively for the

120
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:19,679
passages that emphasized not doing anything but rather

121
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:26,398
more than just being aware that just being aware was enough just be present for what is without any attempt

122
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:33,520
to change it or do anything with it or judge it just to be aware and so is a kind of receptive or

123
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,240
somewhat passive awareness in a sense

124
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,919
but as i study this text more and more and as i studied the teachings of the

125
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:49,520
buddha more and more i see that the buddha's teachings are very centrally

126
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,878
rooted or grounded in action in act in

127
00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:00,000
action of body speech and mind and that without understanding the role

128
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,280
in place for action in this practice we might not really find our way to

129
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,320
freedom find the full potential of this and

130
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,440
and so it turns out that this first three exercises of the text

131
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,560
has a lot of action as part of it it begins

132
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:29,440
with um breathing it says breathing in i know i am breathing in

133
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,480
it's not saying i know breathing is happening kind of a passive

134
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,520
kind of breathing just a passive thing that's uh going on

135
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,880
it's um it says uh i know i am breathing

136
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,160
and then it says

137
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:57,520
experiencing one's whole body and that's a kind of little bit receptive and open but it is a choice an

138
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:03,440
activity in the mind to receive and experience the body to really feel the full body

139
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:10,000
and then it says to relax the body that clearly is an activity the second exercise

140
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,680
begins with focusing on walking knowing you're walking when you're walking standing when you're standing sitting

141
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:22,560
when sitting and lying down laying down they're called postures but they're also these are all

142
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:27,838
certain kinds of activity we put ourselves in these postures

143
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,960
in the third foundation it's all about activities it's all about what we're doing

144
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:43,280
and one of the reasons i like to think that it begins with this way is that we're starting to get a hang of

145
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:50,480
how to pay attention to the way that we are we act the actions we do

146
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,160
and so it's not just mindfulness sitting quietly in meditation with the eyes closed

147
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:02,079
and then later we learn how to practice in daily life this is it begins right there with

148
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:07,280
activities and with our daily life all the things we do in our daily life

149
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:13,040
and infusing it with mindfulness infusing it with attention

150
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:19,440
and and it's not that is now it's certainly a distraction to do

151
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:25,839
this it distracts us from our distractions if you prefer to be distracted

152
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:30,880
then don't practice mindfulness but in a kind of

153
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,400
funny way to practice mindfulness is to do something different than being distracted

154
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,160
and it and so to be present for the activities we do when we're doing them

155
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:47,440
and to be present from the kind of the inside out so there's not just simply a knowing

156
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,800
we're doing them knowing that i'm reaching for something but there's also

157
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:59,119
um we're infusing like if i reach for if i reach for something like i'm going to grab the

158
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:04,400
bell that's here next to me if i reach for it i can do it

159
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,320
mindlessly i could do it while i'm talking and not really pay attention to what i'm doing

160
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:17,200
or i can really slow down and really put my attention in my arm

161
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:24,240
feel stretching out feel the weight of the bell feel my hand gripping it and then feeling what it's like to lift

162
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,040
it up and just infuse with sensations

163
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:35,040
this kind of attention if you do it initially it might seem like a distraction from living your life

164
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:41,599
but over time it we can live our life but we're infused with this kind of attention we're

165
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:47,440
infusing ourselves with an embodied awareness which gives us access

166
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:54,800
to a much wider range of who we are wider range of intelligence a receptive

167
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:01,839
perception of sensitivity of wisdom then if we're only in our heads thinking

168
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:07,359
and planning ahead and reacting to things with our reviewing things in the mind

169
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:13,520
when we start dropping down and having the body be the foundation from which we engage

170
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:19,359
it becomes more holistic our whole being with all the different capacities and

171
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:28,359
functions we have can start to be marshalled together for this purpose of being present and for being wise

172
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:35,040
so um the text talks about being of practicing full awareness and i like this

173
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:41,200
expression quite a bit but uh i think the pali word itself samphajana

174
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:46,400
means more something like with a clear recognition

175
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:52,079
to really recognize what we're doing when we're doing it but what do we recognize

176
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:58,720
certainly the activity in and of itself but the full recognition includes our intentions and purpose in

177
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,319
which we're doing something the context which we're in and so this wider intelligence this

178
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:11,119
wider sensitivity that can arise from the body because we're really present for our experience

179
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:17,680
as we do it not at the exclusion of everything else but because we're more here and we're

180
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:25,280
more attentive and sensitive to what goes on around us and so we also pay attention

181
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,319
in this full awareness full clear recognition the

182
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:37,680
effect the influence our actions have on us so if i grab my bell

183
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:43,440
out of out of greed and just kind of quickly grab it and hold it in tight this is mine

184
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:50,400
this kind of tension and tightness of holding it and grabbing it if i pay attention to how the influence

185
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,640
it has on me it's not very good it's kind of off it brings more tension

186
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:03,839
and but if i reach to grab the bell in a relaxed way

187
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:08,880
respecting the bell feeling the bell when i first touched it not grabbing it right away

188
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,480
and then holding it with just enough tight grip that just enough to hold it

189
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:22,720
lifted without gripping it just holding it and lifting it up and feeling it i feel the coolness

190
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:29,359
of the metal against my hand and it feels kind of nice to do that action

191
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:36,560
there's a simple pleasure in reaching for it and having it

192
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:43,280
and this is a hugely important part of this mindfulness practice is we can become mindful of the of

193
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:49,760
influence the effect our actions have on ourselves and the world but in ourselves

194
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:57,520
and is what i'm doing nourishing me is it benefiting me is it is it pleasant is it enjoyable

195
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:03,440
and the word that the concept that's most important is it wholesome is it

196
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:09,920
helpful for us part of the buddha's teachings on action

197
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:18,000
is encouraging us to do things actions which are beautiful

198
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,280
and so this idea of infusing attention into all our activities

199
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:29,599
can also go along with doing the activities in a way that is beautiful

200
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:36,240
and what the beauty is for any any individual is very individualistic but what is a what would you do how

201
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:42,240
would you reach for something if there you would do the reaching in a beautiful way

202
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:48,640
if you eat and chew and taste both in a beautiful way in order to

203
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,760
experience as beauty or as kind of a wholesome pleasure

204
00:42:53,760 --> 00:43:01,599
a kind of beauty which is i love the word beauty because it's different than pleasure which many people will associate with

205
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:09,200
physical pleasure that just kind of you know skin deep because you know it tastes good or feels good physically

206
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:15,040
but beauty is a pleasure which is a deeper it's kind of like a dharmic pleasure

207
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:20,400
that's a deep feeling of residence with what feels right and good and wonderful

208
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:27,520
clean and ethical within ourselves the word for beauty here is kaliana

209
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:34,079
which uh some of you will know is kalyan amita is often translated as good spiritual friend

210
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:39,839
but kaliana that's first definition is beautiful so

211
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:45,200
literally kalyanamita literally is beautiful friend and so

212
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,400
to have actions one does to infuse it with awareness with

213
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,839
attention but there's even a more wonderful potential

214
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:01,599
possibility not only being present for our experience so we're really present knowing it

215
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:08,720
but do it in a way be sensitive to the influence it has on us be sensitive to the quality that comes

216
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,839
with doing the activity and it's possible to do things beautifully

217
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:16,839
so

218
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:29,920
one acts in full awareness when going forward beautifully

219
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:36,000
when returning beautifully looking ahead beautifully

220
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,400
looking away beautifully flexing and extending one's limbs

221
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:49,040
beautifully wearing one's clothes beautifully

222
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:56,960
eating drinking consuming food and tasting beautifully defecating and urinating beautifully

223
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:03,839
walking standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking and keeping silent beautifully

224
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:08,960
exactly what beauty is is personal but something which has a feeling of

225
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,720
goodness or pleasure deep deep pleasure dharmic pleasure something that

226
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:21,599
feels like this is worthwhile to do with my being this is a healthy thing to do

227
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:27,920
it requires being attention to the present moment and

228
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:34,160
the kind of attention i hope that you'll see your life begins flower around flower flower around blossom

229
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:40,480
around it doesn't take you away from your life but it infuses it with a great sense of

230
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:47,839
purpose and value and it lays the foundation for living a full life in the world

231
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:55,440
in a way that is beautiful in a way that is peaceful and moves us towards awakening and appreciation

232
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:03,119
beauty as a foundation for the path to awakening the buddhist teachings on action

233
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,720
has an emphasis on beauty on beauty and kalyana

234
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:14,960
so may you explore your activities you engage in your everyday things

235
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:22,400
may you take a heightened interest in them today and see what you can learn about

236
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:29,280
a heightened awareness in activities but more so is it possible to do them in a way that

237
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:37,520
has a positive influence on you that the very doing them is done in a way that feels good maybe is beautiful

238
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:43,160
so thank you very much
