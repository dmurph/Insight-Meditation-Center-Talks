00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,840
sorrow pain dukkha doesn't become the entire measure of

15
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:37,200
all that we see it doesn't just take the suck the air out of the room it doesn't become all there is but we notice that

16
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,280

sit or even lie down

31
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,640

38
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,680
we feel the easier we can sit upright

39
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,040
tall like a mountain that is well connected well rooted to

40
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,840
the earth

41
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:00,479

42
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:10,039
pull aligning us aligning our heart connecting our heart

43
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:18,080

verticality needs more energy if you're feeling a little too

55
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:14,400
flighty or unsettled scattered and bring more attention to the lower part of this

56
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,400

198
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:27,359
deborah says i appreciated the opportunity to reflect on the simple joys i experienced today i don't think i

199
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:34,480
realized them until i looked back at the day oh that's lovely yay

200
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:40,480
that's wonderful oh and i missed this from bill bill says could you review what you said

201
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,920
earlier about focusing on the lower or upper body depending on whether you are

202
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,520
tired or scattered not sure i understood oh okay so

203
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,280
when i was inviting you there is this

204
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:04,480
one way we can envision our body or or is is a work with

205
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:11,440
what can be termed as the energy body energetically energy body and there's so many different ways to to work with the

206
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:16,720
energy body and and don't stop listening thinking wow energy body that's advanced no no

207
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:24,079
it's it's very simple let me explain it so what was what i was bringing forth inviting you to just have the sense of

208
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:29,200
verticality you know as if there was a in in your body there's this pull and if

209
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:34,319
you're feeling kind of scattered and everywhere then bring more attention to

210
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:40,319
the lower part of it just feel grounded like oh yes and if you're feeling heavy

211
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:46,560
and tired and sleepy oh then bring more attention awareness to the upper end of

212
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:53,200
this energy body the uplift so that's that thanks for asking bill

213
00:42:53,200 --> 00:43:00,480
um aaron says i just feel more peaceful a deep quieter joy oh beautiful

214
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:08,160
beautiful deep quieter joy i love it vicky asks when darkness arises does one

215
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:14,000
replace heavier reminders with lighter sensibility

216
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:20,720
that's an ex excellent question so so it depends if darkness or say if

217
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:26,480
you're doing a mudita practice which is what we just did vicarious joy

218
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:33,760
and if darkness if heaviness if sadness arises you have two options one option is to

219
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:39,040
turn towards the darkness with with kindness so

220
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:44,880
then your practice will become compassion because you're holding

221
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:50,880
suffering darkness with mental with kindness and it becomes compassion and it's fine

222
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:57,920
mudita vicarious joy and compassion and meta they're all related they keep transitioning to one another so that's

223
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:04,240
one option you can you can if it feels appropriate you can do it

224
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:12,319
bad that way another option is you can say hello darkness my old friend i see you i

225
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:19,839
see you it's okay you can be here i'm not gonna push you away you don't have to go away but can you sit here and

226
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:26,640
and still be and hold witness as i acknowledge the light and if it says yeah okay i can hang out

227
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:32,400
for a few minutes let you acknowledge the light then you can continue with the modita practice with the

228
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:38,000
joy practice and if it says no take care of me then you can turn to

229
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,960
compassion so those are a couple ways you can go

230
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:50,880
oh it's so sweet and here's a reflection from yuka thank you

231
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:57,119
for reminding me i have everything i just need to to remember it more oh that is so sweet

232
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:04,640
it just makes me happy to no end the sense of reminding ourselves of the abundance oh

233
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:10,560

236
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:31,040

237
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:39,359
spend so we're going to do it this is the format we'll go it's going to be round robin so one person will say what

238
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:45,839
brings them joy what they're grateful for and the next person says what they're grateful for and the third

239
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:52,960
person says what what brings them joy so you just go around and round and listen to each other and feel mudita feel

240
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:59,200
vicarious joy for each other's goodness and this is such a happy making practice
