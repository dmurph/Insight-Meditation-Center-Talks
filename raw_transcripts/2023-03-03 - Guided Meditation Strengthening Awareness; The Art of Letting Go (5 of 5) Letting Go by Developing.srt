1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:09,000
all right so let's go ahead and get started as you're settling me in and

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,900
saying hello now finding a posture for meditation

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,400
just sitting

4
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:31,760
allowing yourself to feel the body and the sitting posture

5
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,719
feeling the contact where you're sitting

6
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,300
your seed against the chair or the cushion

7
00:00:53,039 --> 00:01:00,680
or what you're lying on just having a sense of being here

8
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,900
sometimes meditation is called taking the one seat

9
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,840
you take your seat in the middle of experience

10
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,740
okay in a sense is to stay there

11
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,939
not get drawn away by things that come and knock on the door

12
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:46,340
or wave at you through the window you're just sitting in your seat

13
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,659
resting

14
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,800
and yet you're aware of all of experience so

15
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:18,120
we'll expand our awareness piece by piece so beginning first

16
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,500
with this sense of the body sitting in the room where you are

17
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,739
can feel the space around you

18
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,060
and then opening further to other aspects of

19
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:04,140
physical experience so you can sense the sounds

20
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:11,159
there's the sound of my voice there may be other sounds around you

21
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:17,120
from the household or from nature or outside

22
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:31,579
or maybe you are outside sitting in nature opening to The Sounds

23
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:41,360
and also the silence in which those sounds are occurring

24
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:31,100
and then we become aware of the inner experiences in the body

25
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:39,080
so allowing awareness to include the sensations of grieving

26
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,220
the inner sensations of the body

27
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,280
feelings like the clothing against the skin

28
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,419
the natural strength and straightness of the spine

29
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,979
pressure where you're sitting

30
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,340
the various movements of energy through the body

31
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:39,419
allowing all of these to enter into awareness

32
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,960
now beginning to include also the mind

33
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,840
different aspects so noticing if there are any

34
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:46,639
emotions presence in your experience

35
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:55,319
that may be very clear or maybe not maybe there's just a general mood

36
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:03,000
or maybe the mind is quite neutral and they're just emotional shifts now and then

37
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,539
just see how it is and include those in awareness

38
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:20,060
all while sitting in the one seat not getting drawn in

39
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,419
and opening awareness further to include thoughts

40
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:49,399
if there's any thinking or thoughts going on in the mind

41
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,440
we just open the space of the mind so that those come in and out

42
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,459
the way clouds come in and out in the sky

43
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:07,740
forming out of nothing drifting around sometimes dissipating in

44
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,100
the Wind

45
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,339
so the space of the Mind

46
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:25,100
holds the thoughts that come and go

47
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:04,320
now letting the mind be so large and vast that

48
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,640
can even hold our background assumptions and views

49
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:17,920
ways that we see the world just one more aspect of the Mind actually

50
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,110
[Music]

51
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:31,320
these things too or phenomena that can be seen and held in the

52
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:37,579
vast Stillness of the Mind

53
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,139
foreign

54
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:10,040
foreign

55
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:45,839
all of experience space around us the sounds

56
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:53,279
bodily Sensations [Music] emotions thoughts

57
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,779
I use

58
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:04,339
these are all things that we can be aware of

59
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:13,100
within a large sky like or ocean-like mind

60
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:27,139
all of experience can come and go and it's multitude of varied forms

61
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:51,440
we can also ask what knows this

62
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,480
times there's a shift in experience

63
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:09,320
when we turn to include even the knowing

64
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:16,100
in the realm of what we can be aware of

65
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:33,920
so just resting foreign

66
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,820
totality of experience

67
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:04,320
even allowing the sense of practicing or observing

68
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,279
to Fall Away

69
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,839
that too is extra

70
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,260
just this

71
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:20,579
foreign

72
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,940
foreign

73
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:17,539
attention gets drawn into something

74
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:27,000
when you notice that gather what energy is available

75
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,280
and put it back into awareness

76
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:39,440
re-strengthen awareness and rest there

77
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,360
foreign

78
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,179
foreign

79
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,159
foreign

80
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,200
foreign

81
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:29,400
sensing the great peace that is available

82
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,539
in awareness

83
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:47,419
feeling how it can fill and pervade experience

84
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:55,700
such that everything that comes and goes just feels like part of nature

85
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:09,020
and what a valuable way of being this is to bring to the world

86
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:18,659
there's so much struggle in the world trying to get this or that trying to

87
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:22,039
stop this or that

88
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:31,760
it's not that we would never make any movements or choose any actions

89
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:38,220
but doing so from a place of vastness where it can all be

90
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,778
held and seen

91
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:52,880
means that our actions come from wisdom and compassion

92
00:28:54,120 --> 00:29:01,500
they actually do real benefit in the world help to align things balance things

93
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,960
rather than contributing to the lurching around and imbalance

94
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,039
that so much characterizes

95
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,519
our unaware life

96
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:23,820
so let it be that we contribute to the awareness of the world

97
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:30,720
trusting that our cultivation of that quality extends out

98
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,380
from us into others into the world

99
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:44,760
since awareness is not something that we just hold for ourselves

100
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:52,140
it's more like something that's available we increase its availability

101
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:57,919
eye opening to it and that's a gift to the world

102
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,400
[Music]

103
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:27,530
[Music]

104
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:51,539
so we've made it to the last item in our list of seven methods for letting go

105
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:58,140
but first there was a question in the chat yesterday for the pseudo-reference

106
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:05,700
we are broadly following the teaching found in mn2 the savasa vasuta

107
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:11,299
but I've I've brought in other teachings as needed

108
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:19,200
so we've talked about letting go or abandoning by seeing by restraining by

109
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:25,440
using by avoiding by enduring and by removing

110
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:32,700
and many of the earlier ones were about somehow getting free of unwholesome

111
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:38,880
states of mind and that is great and necessary but it's not the whole story

112
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:45,779
we also have to develop wholesome States and we're in a position to do that very

113
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:51,360
effectively once the unwholesome ones are not dragging us down

114
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:57,299
so today we have Letting Go by developing and there will also be a kind

115
00:31:57,299 --> 00:32:04,980
of a reprise of Letting Go by seeing so to be clear it is wholesome to let go

116
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:11,340
of the unwholesome of course but imagine now that you've cut away a hundred

117
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:18,539
pounds of weight that you were dragging behind your bicycle now you can really Cruise you can go

118
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:24,120
around corners more smoothly you can do tricks you can ride up steep hills

119
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:29,700
you know it's one kind of development to develop the skills to abandon what is

120
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:35,520
unskillful and it's a different kind of development to actively pursue what is

121
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:41,820
skillful the Buddha differentiated different types of wise effort and half of them

122
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:47,460
are about handling what is problematic and half of them are about fostering

123
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:53,419
what is beautiful so what are we developing

124
00:32:53,419 --> 00:33:00,419
broadly speaking we're developing the Eightfold Path so that's right or we

125
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:07,080
could also say wise or appropriate Right View intention speech action

126
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:14,519
livelihood effort mindfulness and concentration and when they're appropriate and right

127
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:19,679
all of these are wholesome and skillful and they pervade all aspects of our life

128
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:25,019
they touch into all different um aspects of our being

129
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:30,480
and then in meditation specifically there are

130
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,960
also many important qualities to develop and they're developed more in meditation but then they also bleed out into our

131
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:45,480
daily life also and in particular the the suta and then two names the seven factors of Awakening

132
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:52,500
as appropriate things to develop so the first of those is something that

133
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:59,519
we're all familiar with which is mindfulness that's the first of the factors of Awakening and it's said to be

134
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:08,158
always useful you know like you can't kind of can't have too much so awareness ends up being our greatest

135
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:16,158
resource on the path something that we continually develop and strengthen

136
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,500
and also which supports the whole process of the path

137
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:27,599
by helping us to see where we're starting to go off track or what else we

138
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:33,540
might need to bring in it's a it's a balancing factor in the mind also foreign

139
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:39,480
and then the other six factors of Awakening are divided into two different

140
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:46,618
uh two different types let's say the first type is the energizing three of them are

141
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:53,580
energizing qualities and those are investigation and energy and joy

142
00:34:53,580 --> 00:35:01,560
and note in particular the last one that Joy is a factor of Awakening so we're

143
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:07,740
moving toward having a deep sense of inner well-being and happiness that's

144
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:15,079
regardless of conditions you know we can think about Joy because the sunrise is beautiful this morning or

145
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:21,119
Joy because of our family or our material circumstances in some way

146
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,880
but those conditions are quite unreliable and there are other forms of

147
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,280
joy that go very deep that are more about the quality of our heart

148
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:38,640
and you know it takes a while to really cultivate this and bring it to the fore and of course it's fine to have other

149
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:44,820
kinds of Joy but you know we're just aware of the role that that can play and

150
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:50,040
it is energizing it brings in aliveness to our being

151
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:57,780
and then the investigation is the you know the continual checking into experiences they're suffering here or

152
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:04,380
not is this skillful or not am I aware or not

153
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:10,079
and that that brings Natural Energy spiritual energy to our being so we have

154
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:16,200
ways of enlivening ourselves and we can see this in very Advanced Spiritual

155
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:23,520
Beings teachers and others that are um you know they always

156
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:29,640
have an aliveness to them their eyes are bright faculties are fresh even when they're very old

157
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:36,359
so that's these these factors and then in addition the other three

158
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:42,240
Awakening factors are calming factors and those are Tranquility concentration

159
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:47,640
and equanimity so we there's a supreme balance and

160
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:54,720
calmness that comes and it comes from what for knowing from knowing how things actually work from knowing that

161
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,760
everything's going to change and so I don't need to grasp on to things

162
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,040
and from also just knowing that that kind of peace is better than the piece

163
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:10,680
of sensual stimulation say or the Joy or the happiness from that

164
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:18,599
that the the calmness is such a needed quality not only for us but for others

165
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:27,180
so these seven factors together mindfulness investigation energy Joy Tranquility

166
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:34,859
concentration and Equanimity uh form a very beautiful set in the mind and they

167
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:42,000
sometimes if you look at them carefully they include seeming opposite movements energizing and calming and so we're

168
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,119
asked to consider maybe how the mind can expand to hold all of these how can we

169
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:53,579
be highly energized and joyful and also tranquil and the corners

170
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:58,680
in fact the mind can be energized and calm at the same time when those are

171
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:06,060
spiritual qualities so is it strange that developing can

172
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:12,680
lead to letting go no actually it's not strange it is one of it's one of several different fruits

173
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:18,119
that can come from developing but let me name first one of the initial

174
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:23,579
fruits of doing some development of Olson States and that is that the Mind

175
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:30,720
gains genuine protection so there's a story of a king who wanted

176
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:36,540
to make his kingdom safe for people to walk in by covering everything in

177
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:43,740
Leather so there wouldn't be any Thorns or sharp stones or you know things to trip on so we wanted to cover the whole

178
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:49,440
Kingdom in leather and his wise advisor pointed out that it would be much better

179
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,839
to give everyone shoes and so it's like that in our practice

180
00:38:54,839 --> 00:39:01,800
you know we can look out at the world and see all kinds of dangers and problems we might be afraid to go out

181
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:10,079
and walk or we can put on shoes and go so if our heart is strong it's okay to

182
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:18,060
go out and walk among the thorns and the rough patches that could literally be outside in the world or it could be the

183
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:25,320
thorny patches in our own mind and heart where we haven't ventured yet part of this practice is to keep

184
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:30,780
uncovering more and more in our heart and we do that by getting stronger in

185
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:36,540
one area and then using that strength to go into new areas

186
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:43,260
and that's just the initial benefit and what further fruit is that when our mind is fortified with mindfulness and

187
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:49,859
Clarity and calm we will begin to naturally release more subtle forms of

188
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:55,380
dukkha so development does lead to letting go we're not always just working

189
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:00,960
with blatantly on wholesale landscape mind States and unskillful behaviors we

190
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,119
also have you know we have these more subtle forms of Duca that we need to let

191
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:13,020
go of also we have various ways of subtly identifying with experience you know

192
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:18,359
thinking that it's about me maybe we are genuinely kind and generous

193
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:23,460
much of the time and that in itself is a great accomplishment if we can get

194
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:29,040
ourselves to that state but in the background we might subtly believe that

195
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:35,880
I am a generous person that's who I am and once you know once we start having

196
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:41,520
these more refined qualities of heart mindfulness energy Joy Equanimity the

197
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:48,119
things that I named we start to feel a little bit of tension or wind drag as

198
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:53,400
Gil would say when the mind is enacting these more subtle patterns of eye making

199
00:40:53,400 --> 00:41:01,320
in my making and those can be released by noticing how they cast a shadow on the wholesome

200
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:06,540
mind you know the Buddha says very clearly that we should be virtuous but not

201
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:12,660
identify with our virtue and then there's this teaching from the

202
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:18,839
samyuta mikhaya it says whatever our haunts perfectly Enlighten

203
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:24,720
ones arose in the past all those blessed ones had first abandoned the five

204
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:30,540
hindrances the Corruptions of mine that weakened wisdom and then with their

205
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:38,460
minds well established in four ways of establishing awareness they had developed correctly the seven

206
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:46,140
factors of Enlightenment and thereby they had awakened to the unsurpassed perfect Enlightenment and similarly for

207
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:51,480
our haunts of the future and and the present so

208
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:58,859
the that the language is a little bit uh complex and characteristic of the sutas but it says

209
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:05,880
every Buddha has abandoned the five hindrances established the four foundations of mindfulness and developed

210
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:13,619
the seven factors of Awakening and that's what makes a Buddha I think it will be the same for us

211
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:21,000
so then we can have a reprise of seeing if

212
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,520
you will so recall from Monday that seeing is the most fundamental way of

213
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:33,540
letting go we talked about it then in terms of seeing clearly whether the trend in the mind is toward unwholesome

214
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:40,920
or wholesome and making sure we're going in the right direction and you know once we've engaged in the

215
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:46,680
development of wholesome states which becomes easy when the unholesome ones are at Bay

216
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:51,839
then we get to a deeper level of seeing where it's even more effective as a way

217
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:59,400
of letting go so the most basic and skillful way that we can attend to experience is to see in

218
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:05,460
terms of the Four Noble Truths so we see this is suffering this is the

219
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:12,240
arising of suffering or the the conditions that are leading to suffering this is the cessation of suffering and

220
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:17,460
this is somehow part of the path that's going to lead to the cessation of suffering

221
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:24,420
we can see what aspects of experience are part of the first Noble Truth No Duco what is Duca

222
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:32,160
and then we know that those are to be fully comprehended and we can see which parts our experience are the conditions

223
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:38,700
for Duca where where's the grasping and the clinging that are conditioning this Duca and we can abandon that

224
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:46,319
and then we can see which parts relate to the path that's toward the ending of duga and we can know that ah developing

225
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:51,599
this is going to be good for my mind and we actually do see moments of Duke

226
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:56,640
of ceasing and we acknowledge and realize those so that they will

227
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:02,280
strengthen so that they will create momentum for us to continue on the path

228
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:10,800
and when we start to see in terms of these four noble truths these four lenses of seeing things instead of in

229
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:17,700
Terms of me and what I like and I don't like whole new Direction can open up and we

230
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:24,839
can find the path of letting go so our job is to do the practices to see

231
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:32,099
in the terms of the four noble truths and to cultivate the means of letting go and then the Letting Go will take care

232
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:38,819
of itself at some point was once criticized for telling one

233
00:44:38,819 --> 00:44:44,400
person one thing and another person another thing you know the student basically said you're inconsistent in

234
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:50,339
what you tell people how is that correct and he laughed and said I'm like someone

235
00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:57,780
who's watching people walk down a road and if they're going off to the right then I call out go left and if they're

236
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:04,800
going off to the left then I call out go right so you know those would sound like contradictory instructions if they're

237
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,900
taken out of context but they're each correct for that person's situation

238
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:16,680
so it's like that with our practice too sometimes we're going left or right sometimes we avoid sometimes we use

239
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:22,079
sometimes we restrain sometimes we cultivate it's good to develop the skill

240
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:28,319
of knowing how to nudge ourselves in the right direction in a given case and of course sometimes everything is

241
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:33,960
fine and you don't need to change anything just live just live your life

242
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:40,500
and it might be that these seven different methods we talked about this week are not always so distinct you know

243
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:45,960
which one exactly am I doing that don't worry about it just be aware that there

244
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:54,300
are different aspects of how we can move toward letting go so next time you ask how can I let go of

245
00:45:54,300 --> 00:46:01,440
my anger consider that there are a variety of practices to engage in that could lead

246
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:08,700
to that letting go and we just have to do them with diligence with Good Will without grasping to the result

247
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:15,720
and then someday the Dharma will surprise you with a release Letting Go does happen

248
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:22,079
so I hope this week of teaching says giving you some sense of The Art of

249
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:29,640
Letting Go and that it will continue to fill and nourish and enrich your life

250
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:33,980
thank you be well
