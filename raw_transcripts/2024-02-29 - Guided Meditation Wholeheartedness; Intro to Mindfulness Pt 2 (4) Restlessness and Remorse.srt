1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:08,920
so hello and welcome and as an introduction to this

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,080
meditation uh I'm going to be addressing in the meditation through the

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,519
meditation the issue of restlessness or agitation as that's the fourth of the

4
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:26,920
five hindrances and it's valuable to

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:34,680
understand that um the tradition says that unless you're fully

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,960
enlightened human beings will always carry with them a degree of agitation or

7
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,640
restlessness so if you should feel that way uh it just part of The Human

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,120
Experience Being Human comes along with that there can be varying degrees of it

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:00,680
of course and sometimes it can take over and sometimes it's subtle but one of the

10
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:07,159
uh triggers for agit there number of triggers for this agitation that's so

11
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:14,280
fundamental but one of them has to do with the other uh kind of

12
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:21,159
hindrances which uh especially the first two uh desire avariciousness sensual

13
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:26,439
desire and avariciousness and uh ill will or

14
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:33,439
aversion and these are also considered to be part and parcel of most human beings we're kind of born

15
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:40,640
with them this tendency so if we have any of the hindrances there's no need to take them personally personally like

16
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,680
you're the only one who has it and therefore you're terrible uh we all all

17
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,799
human beings contend with them they're part of being a human being and then learning to be wise about them is part

18
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:59,079
of the and uh part of the task and how to hold them without any further

19
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:04,119
reactivity uh hold them without shooting second

20
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:09,239
arrows so but the first two uh desire and

21
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:15,280
aversion uh they contribute to agitation if you have too many desires

22
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,519
and we're jumping around chasing them that's an agitated state if our desires

23
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:27,280
are frustrated or if somehow we have desires but we can't act on it and we but we

24
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,440
feel the the strong desire to do something even healthy desires appropriate desires if we're held in

25
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:40,400
check by Society family work anything uh that energy of the desire that we want

26
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,599
to do um is held in check and then it in check it kind of vibrates it kind of

27
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:52,239
it's there with pressure that agitates same thing with aversion that uh we can have a lot of

28
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,840
things we're aversive to and we're kind of jumping around and searching for it and just everything is wrong and so

29
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:05,799
agitation itself uh aversion itself is agitating but also uh kind of frustrated

30
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:13,440
uh aversion aversion which doesn't seem to be able to do anything or accomplish anything that's held in check or held

31
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,720
back or just kind of you know um

32
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,879
unempowered or something not that we should Empower our ill will but still

33
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:30,760
it's held in check uh and so there's something agitating there just it vibrating and

34
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,280
the pressure there um and also uh the the human being

35
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:42,879
I think needs one of the basic needs is the need to be able to have agency to be

36
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:49,519
engaged in something in a healthy way um we're not only supposed to be quiet and

37
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:56,040
peaceful sitting serenely doing nothing um that doesn't really work for the

38
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:04,560
depth of our psychology and who we are and so uh when desires and aversions

39
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,079
create agitation when they um the frustration of them adds to

40
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:19,120
frustration um what we call upon what can really support us is to do

41
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:26,479
something wholeheartedly that we value maybe that we love that that do something which

42
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:32,400
really we can put oursel into so the whole psychophysical system can have the

43
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:39,639
experience of yes we have some agency we can do something here we can settle some

44
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:46,680
of this maybe inherent agitation by doing one thing really well or

45
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:53,240
thoroughly and in terms of this doing meditation practice that one thing is

46
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:59,320
the meditation it is just for example just

47
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,560
you of wholeheartedly immerse ourselves in the practice of present moment

48
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:13,080
awareness increase the degree of motivation increase the degree of commitment increase the degree of

49
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:19,720
wholeheartedness without strain without adding some kind of Desire that will just make you more

50
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:26,400
agitated uh without aversion but there is a form of love there is a form of

51
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,720
Faith or trust yes let's give ourselves just here to the

52
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,759
breathing and um and then the breathing is boring it isn't that the that the

53
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:44,960
breathing is the source of our life it's the

54
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:52,680
engagement it's the IM immersion with the breath immersion with your present moment experience that puts us into it

55
00:05:52,680 --> 00:06:00,639
gathers together and some people talk about then uh uh as we do this

56
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:07,479
wholeheartedly that it puts us in a flow state but for the purpose of today it

57
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:14,319
puts it begins to settle us it begins to reassure some part of our deep mind that

58
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:23,400
oh we have something valuable to do here important to do something trustworthy to do and we can do it and then some of the

59
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:29,160
other causes of agitation can begin to settle down so that's the premise for

60
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,800
this meditation so assuming a meditation

61
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,440
posture and closing your

62
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:50,880
eyes and to feel yourself sitting

63
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:58,160
here feel here you get to experience a human

64
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,879
being from the inside out you get to do something that no one

65
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:10,520
else can do is you get to have for this

66
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:17,919
person that you are you get to really have a closeness to and really sense and

67
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:27,198
feel more than anyone else can what it's like to be alive right now

68
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
breathing

69
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,199
any Sensation that you experience Pleasant or unpleasant any feeling that

70
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:49,400
you have is a symptom that you're experiencing

71
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:55,680
life as it's being lived inside from the inside

72
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,520
out and it's your task to care for this

73
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:10,840
life it's your task to participate in this life

74
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:20,759
wholeheartedly and to do so Beginning by taking a few long

75
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:28,520
slow deep breaths not too big not too fast not too

76
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,560
slow but in a

77
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:41,240
full engaged way immersing yourself in the experience of breathing

78
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,000
deeply

79
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:54,360
fully expanding chest as you lifting shoulders

80
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,560
maybe sometimes the front of the rib cage it opens and expands lifts

81
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,000
sometimes the sides of the rib cage

82
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:15,760
expand sometimes is the movements of the belly or all of the

83
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:24,320
above relaxing as you exhale not relaxing

84
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:31,040
mechanically but relaxing with a care and kindness a

85
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:39,440
love a gentle appreciation for you and this

86
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:47,839
body letting your breathing return to

87
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:02,160
normal for some thousands of years years human beings have

88
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:08,320
meditated following their breathing following the sensations in the body of

89
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:15,480
breathing in and breathing out people have entered the world of

90
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:21,000
breathing wholeheartedly they've trusted

91
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,839
it they found it it be a

92
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:36,320
doorway to engage ING with life in a full immersive way with something very

93
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:45,519
simple trusting breathing trusting the process of opening and

94
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,120
receiving of

95
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:05,160
intimacy so we'll continue in

96
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,959
silence and with breathing or any other way you practice

97
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:24,200
mindfulness Let It Be an act of devotion or trust or love or whole

98
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:31,560
heartedness to give yourself to the meditation without

99
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:46,399
strain as if by giving yourself wholeheartedly to

100
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:54,079
this more than anything else more than your thoughts other

101
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:00,959
wishes you're providing food nourishment

102
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:06,160
satisfaction for a very deep

103
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,639
need the need for being fully

104
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,079

is and how good it is

145
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:28,919
to acknowledge oneself one C circumstances

146
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:35,720
and to just be still and quiet for a little bit in the middle of it

147
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:56,519
all and out of the Stillness or out of the sweetness or out of the Care

are considered to be some of the primary obstacles to mindfulness and to

167
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:18,799
concentration really being present here in some way and at the same time they're almost

168
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:26,000
Universal in human experience and it's often emphasized that uh no need to take them personally

169
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:33,159
like their personal failure ings they're just part and parcel of what we're born with or come into into our life

170
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:39,120
with and rather than taking it as enemies or as some personal faults we

171
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:46,720
take them as subjects for mindfulness for practice for

172
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,840
contemplation and even even for a certain degree of respect that these are

173
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:57,880
part of the human condition and part of respecting ourselves is to respect their presence

174
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:02,960
and then learn how to overcome the hindering

175
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:10,240
quality so there can be desire that is a hindrance and the same desire can be

176
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:18,320
there and not be a hindrance same thing with aversion and sloth and torper all of them and the

177
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:24,840
difference is that when their hindrance were involved with them in some way we've succumbed to them we've given

178
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:33,679
ourselves over to them we' have somehow you know become them and the task of mindfulness is to

179
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:40,080
step away enough so we they we're not involved with them we're not caught in

180
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:46,720
their grip we're not gripping onto them and so they can be there but they're not

181
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,440
interfering so it's not all or nothing uh for these qualities It's All

182
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:58,480
or Nothing with in their hindering qualities we uh in the sense that we can

183
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,720
either have them as a hindrance or we can see them well enough and clearly

184
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:10,960
enough that they no longer are a hindrance they're just phenomena one more thing that we're aware of and in

185
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:16,000
that way we're beginning to take refuge or put our faith

186
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,840
into um our life energy into the process of being

187
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:28,120
Mindful and learning how to be present and aware mindful clearly recognizing what's happening

188
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:33,240
without identifying with it without reacting to it without being bothered by

189
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:42,600
it and learning how to be free from it so uh so today the topic is uh

190
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:48,320
restlessness and regret or agitation and regret or

191
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:54,039
remorse and um and these are agitated energies agitated ways in which the

192
00:33:54,039 --> 00:34:00,320
heart and mind can be and uh and that can be quite strong you know we can feel like we want a bolt we feel like we

193
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:08,520
can't sit still um and I've sat in meditation with so much restlessness that um because I

194
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:14,240
had such strong faith in the mindfulness I made the restlessness the object of my

195
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:20,440
meditation and it was so much fun because what I did was uh I felt the

196
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:27,240
Restless energy in my body as a pingpong ball that was just bouncing off the sides of the wall my body just kind like

197
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:32,679
boom boom boom boom and it was kind of so much fun to um to just kind of be

198
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:38,358
with it and feel it and and uh and um

199
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:43,638
and rather than identify with it rather than being bothered by it or reacting to

200
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:49,200
it even having aversion to something like restlessness is being caught in its

201
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:55,000
grip it's kind of being involved the idea is to just see it and be with it

202
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:04,160
and the and feeling it physically however it's also helpful to understand some of the Dynamics that evoke it so

203
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,480
first this idea the universal quality of the hindrances the Buddha said that only

204
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:16,640
someone who is fully enlightened at the final and fourth stage of Awakening um do they no longer have

205
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:23,480
restlessness or agitation so even if you're partially enlightened you can expect that the mind

206
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:30,079
will have some restlessness and part of their reason for this is that um any kind of

207
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:35,640
attachment we have so for example attachment to desire or attachment to

208
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:40,960
ill will aversion means that um uh if

209
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,599
that is that that attachment that desire to do desire is wanting something

210
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:52,440
aversion is wanting something go away if that's frustrated if we can't act on it

211
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:58,480
in a sane way we can't act on it in a ethical way we can't you know then

212
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:07,640
something inside of us is held in check and even when there's no attachment involved uh necessarily or uh

213
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:13,760
if there's healthy desire and healthy averting or saying no but social

214
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:21,319
conditions World conditions uh uh means that we're not allowed to speak up we can't speak up we can't do what we want

215
00:36:21,319 --> 00:36:29,240
to do and so that desire and and and and know this Di and healthier version is

216
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:34,720
bottled up is held in check and that uh then you know you can

217
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:41,560
either either go to sleep shut down get dull or the opposite strategy is to get

218
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:49,280
all worked up and agitated and you feel this you know like sometimes in extreme way like the water is boiling inside um

219
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:56,480
but um and um and so that's with agitation with regret this is when we've

220
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:03,359
done something that we have remorse about and and I like the word remorse

221
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:09,440
because um maybe regret can be healthy but remorse in the Latin roots of it

222
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:15,119
means we're chewing something over a morsal we remsing it we're chewing and

223
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:20,480
chewing and chewing the same thing and uh and usually remorse uh is a kind of

224
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,880
problematic when we're just kind of reviewing and reviewing and beating ourselves up and being critical and not

225
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:35,359
knowing what to do and feeling we should do something about it and um and uh and so

226
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:42,680
there again there's an agitated uh energy that gets caught we're caught in the grip of it and

227
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:47,920
so you know if it's it's it's kind of a a time when our

228
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:54,280
action doing something is frustrated held in check it doesn't mean that we

229
00:37:54,280 --> 00:38:01,800
necessarily should be acting on the desires acting on the aversions um but maybe we had should

230
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:07,880
think about yes there is action needed here and what is that

231
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:14,319
action uh regrets sometimes what's needed is apology sometimes what's needed is to go

232
00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:19,560
make amends to go talk to someone something in the world is needed to do

233
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:25,839
it's not enough just to sit and try to be mindful and let go and find our Peace by ourselves that actually does a kind

234
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:33,720
of harm to ourselves to not take care of what really needs to be taken care of in this world I've known people friends of

235
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:39,599
mine who were sitting on Retreat and they knew like one friend of mine was in

236
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:48,160
India and he knew he he had some problems an issue that came up he went to his teacher and his teacher said um

237
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:54,040
um go home go home to America and address this issue and then come back so

238
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:59,760
my friend did and uh and and um because some things need to be addressed and

239
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:07,920
otherwise the agitation will stay the restlessness will stay uh sometimes what's needed is that

240
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:15,560
the human our human heart our human psyche needs to know that we can take

241
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:23,079
certain degree of I was going to say control and arvas the circles that's kind of a taboo topic to be controlling

242
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:30,560
or to control try to control your experience so maybe I should try to avoid it but we need our system needs to

243
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:37,040
know that we will act we will do something we're not just going to sit there passively and let things just

244
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:44,200
occur and happen and uh and and when it's a hindrances when it's like desires which

245
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:49,800
are just fantasies or unhealthy or aversions which have more

246
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:55,400
to do with attachments or hatred or something we don't want to act on

247
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:01,839
those but the our heart our mind needs to know that we can act we're

248
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:07,240
not holding ourselves in check and engaging in the process of

249
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:14,359
mindfulness being mindful of avariciousness greed being mindful of Av

250
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:19,400
verion and having faith and confidence this is the practice this is a valuable

251
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:26,560
thing to do there's no doubt that better action is to be mindful of these than to

252
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:31,880
them to still kind of boil over or the better action is to be clearly present

253
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:37,839
for them rather than giving into them something in our system appreciates that

254
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:44,880
we're doing we're engaged and how to engage so that it's

255
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,319
the engagement of mindfulness is not itself

256
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:57,160
um um agitating is the art that the engagement itself is settling

257
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:02,920
makes us more peaceful and the reference point I want to make is some an athlete like you know

258
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:10,560
someone who runs um you know who goes running as a sport and and um and

259
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:16,400
they takes a lot of physical energy to do a long run but some people get into a

260
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,960
flow State uh they get absorbed in it and certainly and the everything comes

261
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:27,800
into harmony gets unified and it get really a sense of flow and quiet maybe

262
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:35,839
even something in the mind gets really still and they're really present there's a way of expending energy that is har

263
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:42,280
completely harmonious and promotes calm and peace so if meditation is only about

264
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:48,319
trying to find peace trying to relax and settle and not do and not do and not do

265
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:56,400
um we're actually do might be doing a disservice to that part of our inner life that needs to feel like we can do

266
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:02,760
something we can act we can move forward we're not always held in

267
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:09,839
check and um and uh and then there's a combination of these something like

268
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:17,680
anger sometimes needs to be given its freedom but not freedom for us to act on

269
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:24,599
it but if if it doesn't give its freedom to be in process then again there's

270
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:30,559
agitation and so the Marvel about this medit in meditation and some other

271
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:36,640
situations in life where it's safe to let the anger flow through us but we

272
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:44,160
know how to do it without participating in it without getting involved in it or reactive to it and sitting in meditation

273
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:49,200
learning how to have a good upright posture or doesn't have to be upright

274
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:57,440
but uh an intentional posture where we're not going to collapse into something or get involved in it by

275
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:04,480
um and then staying mindful the best we can and like giving freedom to these

276
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:10,160
movements even of Desire sometimes so we can see it clearly so we can make space

277
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:16,200
for it so that something can begin to shift in the freedom of letting it

278
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:24,599
flow we don't want to feed it but we don't want to repress it and that also then begins overcoming

279
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:31,079
the restlessness of things being held in check so I think what I'm saying today

280
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:37,200
is not necessarily easy to understand and practice but um

281
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,520
because the the the lesson that sometimes we have to act

282
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:48,200
engage um is uh can lend itself to somehow being more agitated and more

283
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:53,800
tense but I'm trying to point to some another possibility and one of the way to

284
00:43:53,800 --> 00:44:00,160
understand it is that one of the most valuable things we can actions that we can give ourselves to and it is an

285
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:06,280
activity is kind of an action is the action of being aware aware action of

286
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:14,680
being Mindful and being mindful in a way that's relaxed at ease unbothered by

287
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:20,319
what we know we're knowing is fully something we trust we immerse ourselves

288
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:27,920
in this mindfulness practice immerse ourselves in being really here but in such a way that there's no

289
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:35,599
tension in the knowing and in the end we discover that

290
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:43,640
uh we can know while being free of what is being

291
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:51,440
known and that knowing is can becomes really nurturing nourishing for that

292
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,800
part of our heart or inner life that needs to know that we're here and

293
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:03,400
engaged in doing something very important and as meditation goes deeper

294
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:10,359
and deeper the act of simple simple clear knowing clear knowing Lucid

295
00:45:10,359 --> 00:45:18,599
knowing uh is more and more valuable more and more sweet more and more

296
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:25,599
clarifying and it just feels like one of them like a flow State almost almost like one of the best things to put our

297
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:31,280
life energy into and it's so satisfying and gratifying and yes there's purpose

298
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,480
here there's value here there's meaning here there's agency here there is um

299
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:43,079
Faith here um and so when you find yourself in the

300
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:49,160
grip of the fourth hindrance agitation and

301
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:59,240
remorse maybe it's a sign that's there's 's a really deep need for

302
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:04,400
Action so that some kind of desire to

303
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:11,119
act that's frustrated that's causing the agitation something needs to be done

304
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:17,640
there to meet it that's in in the realm of activity not giving into it and doing

305
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:23,280
what it wants but some other activity that's healthy and

306
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:30,760
important and exactly what that activity is I can't tell you but at least

307
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:37,200
mindfulness the practice of mindfulness the meditation on it is one of the most meaningful things we can do and if we

308
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:42,520
can really immerse ourselves with faith and wholeheartedness it does something

309
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:48,640
really good for our heart so may it bring you

310
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,960
