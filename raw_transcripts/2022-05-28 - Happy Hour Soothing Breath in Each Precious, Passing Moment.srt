1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:07,759
so hello and welcome to happier everyone yeah it's lovely to be with you it's

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:16,560
happy making to be with you in this moment in time wherever you are in the world so

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,760
ah so for today's practice i'd like to invite us to explore

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:31,439
a couple of themes one is um yeah i want to bring two themes together

5
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,600
the the theme of meta kindness

6
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,360
together with the theme of peace peace

7
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,920
especially given that it's a friday or saturday depending on your time zone so a sense of bringing in a sense of peace

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,840
and peacefulness this this um you know meta can show up in so many

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,160
different ways meta kindness this practice can be very energetic and warm

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,320
and it can also be very quiet very gentle very comforting soothing very stilling

11
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,080
very stilling so that's one aspect that i want to

12
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,320
bring in and and invite us to really rest to relax into it there's not so

13
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:27,920
much doing that needs to be done but to rest but really to rest

14
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:36,320
and um the other theme i want to weave in today is um

15
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,079
is one of impermanence is one of

16
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,920
of brevity of time brevity of our time and the best

17
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,040
way to be with the brevity of our time um

18
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,719
that actually we are all dying we are dying every

19
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:04,799
moment and the best way to really appreciate that and open our heart to that is with

20
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:12,400
peace is with stillness with presence being fully present with care with love

21
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,840
with appreciation for whatever is in this moment in time

22
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,520
for ourselves for others i want to weave those in and even though maybe for some

23
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,879
it feels like wow awareness of our brevity of time awareness of mortality is not peaceful

24
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,640
but it can be you know that it can be and actually the appropriate response is peace

25
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,640
the appropriate response is peace so and and the invitation is

26
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:49,760
if um leaning into brevity of time really brings in more

27
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,440
sense of letting go peace love kindness lean into it but if it

28
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:03,280
brings um [Music] more agitation then don't lean into it

29
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,280
it's an invitation you don't have to lean into it at all you can stay with the yes

30
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,640
yes saying yes to the peace to the calm to the presence of the groundedness

31
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,680
in this moment so see what is more helpful for you

32
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,879
as i bring up the invitations and um yeah and

33
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,400
lean more or less into these invitations so

34
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:38,560
see what might work for you so okay well let's get formally started with our

35
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,120
with our practice so so moving your body perhaps

36
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,159
if you need to move shift find a comfortable position

37
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:56,159
where you can be sitting or lying down or even standing whatever

38
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:02,319
this body needs whatever this body needs

39
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:12,239
appropriate response to what is needed in this moment what does your heart need

40
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,319
your body need at this moment

41
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:28,800
ah letting go releasing

42
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,918
with the out breath

43
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,639
ah letting the in-breath be received in the abdomen

44
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,840
the in-breath received

45
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,080
the out-breath released released letting go

46
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:31,039
feeling sensing sensations of the feet

47
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,000
and the earth the hands on your lap

48
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
your sit bones on the cushion on the chair these contact points

49
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,840
releasing your weight onto these contact points

50
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:18,319
releasing releasing doesn't mean pushing away if

51
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:27,520
there is their emotions present might be sadness grief joy

52
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,840
disappointment whatever there might be it's okay

53
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,880
instead of holding them tight

54
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:49,039
as if you were carrying a load of bricks in your chest to release it's okay

55
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:54,639
let them gently drop on the floor proverbially

56
00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:02,479
with you ah don't have to hold them so tight

57
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:08,080
all them contained let them release

58
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:17,639
let the sack open ah no longer heavy being carried

59
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,440
i let the breath be spacious

60
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,680
through the body the whole body

61
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,680
around the body

62
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,280
and if your body was

63
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,919
the breathing breathing ball

64
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,479
maybe the edges are a little blurry

65
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:17,360
a little elastic the breath

66
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,960
being breathed inside outside including breathing through

67
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:38,640
the bricks that have fallen on the floor about you maybe softening maybe the

68
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,880
bricks as they're breathed into maybe they become a little softer

69
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,839
a little lighter

70
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,839
not effortful just happens on its own

71
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:31,920
maybe nothing more is needed in this moment but to just

72
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,560
be breathed let everything be breathed your joy your

73
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:45,080
sorrow your lightness your heaviness

74
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:13,640
your gladness your grief your gratitude your disappointment

75
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:26,079
your hopes and dreams for the future your fears all of them breathed

79
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:33,440

inviting the breath receiving the breath

95
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,319
it's also an expression of care for yourself

96
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:35,600
meta kindness distilling the mind and heart

97
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,160
listening to the breath

98
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,919
this caring lullaby

99
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:08,880
these precious days these precious moments

100
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:18,279
spent with yourself but this being who is you

101
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,880
this being who is me

102
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:49,480
expressing my care my love

103
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,960
simply by being present the precious breaths

104
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,960
here

105
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:22,120
intimate so intimate with oneself

106
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,120
this beloved we may have ignored all day

107
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,640
intimately attending listening feeling each breath each

108
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,120
precious breath

109
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:06,320
and if the mind wonders if there is distraction sleepiness

110
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,639
it's okay can it be greeted

111
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:19,279
and breathed through let the breath

112
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:27,279
the ease of the body let the breath breathe ease through the body and

113
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:33,840
thoughts in your heart your mind

114
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:41,640
in this moment and now in this moment

115
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:48,600
and now again this fresh moment of now-ness

116
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:54,320
keeps fleeting keeps fleeting

117
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,759
king's fleeting

118
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:27,760
even more precious as it slips comes and goes through our fingers

119
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,400
it's like this

120
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,240
spacious spacious

121
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:01,520
can the sense of care kindness be imbued in the breath

122
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:08,480
just being present for ourselves in this moment

123
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:16,080
this precious breath is an act of meta it doesn't have to become complicated

124
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:23,520
no phrase is needed just being present

125
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:30,320
holding spacious presence through ourselves

126
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,519
an act of care

127
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,120
i'm here for you sweetheart

128
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:52,520
just being being breathed

129
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,080
and whatever is present it's boredom sleepiness sadness

130
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:31,279
joy peace is welcome

131
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:38,639
breathed into breathed with body relaxed

132
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,200
with kindness

133
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:53,600
if your heart were smiling at all the comings and

134
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:59,559
goings in this impermanent moment

135
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:36,000
this practice this being present in this moment for myself

136
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,440
is both for me and so much bigger greater than me

137
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:54,800
seemingly holding witness space with the breath from myself

138
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:04,079
opens up to more dimensionality of what who

139
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:10,480
this person is a service

140
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:16,240
for all beings all beings our lives

141
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:23,350
each breath is an offering [Music]

142
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:33,119
to others to those we love

143
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:39,680
those we're connected to directly and everyone indirectly

144
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,559
may not understand all the dimensions all the meanings

145
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:56,000
but trusting that our breathing or being in the world

146
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,240
our actions

147
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,279
for good or bad

148
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:15,119
impact ourselves and so much beyond ourselves

149
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:22,480
to dedicate the goodness the grace of our practice

150
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:30,960
the beauty trusting in the goodness that has been created co-created

151
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:37,440
to all beings everywhere with gratitude with appreciation

152
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,359
that we live on this earth we're here to breathe to hold witness

153
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:49,839
together with all the joys and all the sorrows in these precious days

154
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:55,760
while we're alive may all beings be free

155
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,320
including ourselves

156
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:08,860

177
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:35,359
and see see simone i trust it's okay to say your

178
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:41,119
name because i think it's sent to everyone let's see it's a long so i'm

179
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:49,359
going to summarize and start reading the whole thing so let's see um [Music]

180
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,000
yeah let's see

181
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:06,720
right right right yeah great yeah so so i appreciate i think that

182
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:13,920
what i'm reading is that you appreciated the guided meditation my voice is calm and soothing and yet mentioning death

183
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:20,800
and dying is triggering for you especially as you're dealing with cancer at this time and it really deals really

184
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:27,280
hits home so how to i think the question that you have asked but i'm going to paraphrase it actually

185
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:34,160
what you've asked is how to continue to come because you want to come to happier and you want to do the practices and yet

186
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:39,680
the mention of death brings stress and anxiety so

187
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,680
keeping triggering so so uh i appreciate you saying that and

188
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:51,280
and also to um and to take care of yourself i mean the

189
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:58,400
invitation that i had at the beginning was to see what is helpful for you to lean into

190
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:05,200
what is helpful what is not helpful and and i would venture actually to say and

191
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:11,280
and you you may not know this but i love teaching about meta and love and i also

192
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:18,839
really appreciate teaching it's one of the other things that i teach a lot about which is mindfulness of mortality

193
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:24,079
um so that really it's so that we work

194
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:30,000
with the with the anxiety because the solution is not to avoid

195
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,920
um to to to turn away when any mention of

196
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:44,079
death arises because we're all dying and and yes i appreciate that

197
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:49,440
there's something that you're working with right now given the cancer and it's very um

198
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:56,160
uh present for you and um what i'm trying to say is that you know

199
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:04,240
and i can stay and we can have a conversation short conversation at the end can reach out to me and to say

200
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:09,520
it's actually let me share the intention the intention

201
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:16,800
that i do have with combining the mentioning of death and mortality with

202
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:23,280
a meditation that is about release letting go and calming

203
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:30,960
is actually to help us work with that anxiety death anxiety because you might

204
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:37,839
have heard of systematic desensitization which is a method in psychology so there are many

205
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:45,920
methods also in in in buddhist practice which is slowly slowly pairing this gentle letting go

206
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:52,960
calming soothing and bringing a little bit of the mention of what might be triggering or might be

207
00:42:52,960 --> 00:43:00,400
challenging or anxiety producing for some to pair it so that it can be held

208
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,520
in in ease we can lose our fear we can lose our

209
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:11,200
trepidation because it's the human condition of course we're all gonna die we all have a terminal condition we

210
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:17,200
don't know when with having a terminal illness perhaps and it may not be terminal so sorry i don't want to

211
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,240
be saying that but having illnesses uh as i do have a chronic illness myself

212
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,280
makes it more challenging to deal with these conditions but anyway i'm happy to

213
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:33,760
stay but there is a reason to this there is a there is actually um

214
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:40,880
quite a deliberate way of bringing these in and pairing and supporting with death

215
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:46,319
phobia especially in our culture so so um [Music]

216
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:53,520
that's what i would like to say about that and again i'm happy to stay later if you want to stay and and i can

217
00:43:53,520 --> 00:44:01,839
talk with you one on one about this any other reflections

218
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,640
questions

219
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,960
yeah so

220
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:24,079
we are approaching the time to

221
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:31,200
um yeah so it's actually both it's it's

222
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:38,160
the bringing mortality makes meta more more palpable there's so many ways in

223
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:44,800
there are so many ways in so i'd like to invite us all to practice

224
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:50,079
with uh in small groups and [Music]

225
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:55,839
as always the invitation is to only share from your own experience not

226
00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:02,839
managing not handling not not [Music] probing into other people's

227
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:07,920
experience and [Music]

228
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:14,240
the each person is invited to share one nugget from their own experience

229
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:20,079
and then the next person and the next person then you go around and round so

230
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:26,160
take care of yourselves take care of each other and if it comes to you your turn and you want to stay silent

231
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:34,400
silent and just say pass that's perfectly okay here we go great so we have just about a minute if
