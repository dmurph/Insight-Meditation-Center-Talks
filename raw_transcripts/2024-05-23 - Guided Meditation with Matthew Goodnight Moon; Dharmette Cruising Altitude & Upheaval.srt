1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:10,080
so welcome folks um happy to uh to be with you yeah it's sweet to see familiar

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,240
names um so what are we going to do we're going to

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:22,119
meditate as I was sitting just before this uh for a few

4
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:29,000
minutes what came to mind I don't know where from why maybe because I'm tired

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,360
but as a kid good night Moon that was like a bedtime ritual

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,600
situation and um uh yeah and I have not thought about

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,320
that book in a long time good night Moon and uh but it came up as I was

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,719
sitting and it was like okay good night

9
00:00:53,719 --> 00:01:02,320
memories good night pain good night thoughts it's good night

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,400
feelings good night

11
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:15,680
Matthew and uh maybe that's our uh those are our

12
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,680
meditation instructions it's just like okay blessing all these pieces of

13
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:29,119
experience with uh um that kind of Gentle Spirit I love

14
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:35,680
the rhythm of obviously the book is so famous because kids love it you know

15
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,840
it's like oh yeah there's something about rhythmically moving through

16
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:47,560
everything that needs to be put down everything we say good night to and

17
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:56,079
um and so maybe we just take our cues from that tonight and

18
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:02,960
uh look to all the things we might just bid good night

19
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:11,440
too so that unusual instructional note let us uh

20
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,480
yeah good night Dua let us uh let us sit

21
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,480
okay

22
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:52,200
so maybe we uh begin with a few deep breaths

23
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:13,799
the in breath enlivening awakening

24
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,239
us the out breath

25
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:28,159
soothing the energy of our body as if like running our hand over sand on the

26
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,920
beach just smoothing it now

27
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:23,320
and to say uh good night Moon not to brace

28
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,360
against or avoid or

29
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:39,520
it's just this um very gentle gesture of putting something

30
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,479
down and so we sort of like palpate our psychospiritual

31
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:09,840
body what uh needs to be put

32
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:20,120
down but lingered from the day or the week or this

33
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,680
life e

34
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:24,039
it's almost like when we've bid a good night to something when we fully actually blessed its presence

35
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:31,120
there's no more stickiness to it

36
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:38,800
and so becomes possible

37
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,960
to let it be in the

38
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,880
background for the kind of gravitational force

39
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:58,120
field of that Loop of thought or that memory that plan that sensation

40
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:07,840
to take its place Miss uh

41
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,599
much more open vast

42
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
field

43
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
e

44
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,479
e e

45
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:12,680
it can be painful to thoughts can be painful painful to

46
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,320
think but also can be painful not to

47
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:27,560
think somehow to renounce some of our preoccupations but

48
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:34,399
maybe maybe it feels okay to do this very

49
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,880
gently good night Moon

50
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,000
and one of the things we're left

51
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,040
with is the

52
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,519
uh effortlessness of our

53
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
breathing

54
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,279
e e

55
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:44,720
the awareness is uh very gentle with our

56
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,200
breathing e

57
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:37,959
sometimes it feels like the attention is inside the

58
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:48,839
breath and sometimes it's like the breath

59
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,880
arises amidst the vast

60
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
openness

61
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,079
e e

62
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:12,160
just gently bidding good night so

63
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,319
whatever can be put down

64
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:58,639
when we put something down we're not saying I'll never pay attention to you

65
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:12,920
just that uh phenomena need to be more patient

66
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,519
just placing all of your hope

67
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,600
into this

68
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
moment

69
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

70
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

71
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

72
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

73
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

74
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

75
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

76
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

77
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

78
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

79
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

80
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

81
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

82
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

83
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

84
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

85
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,360
e e

86
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:51,480
letting any uh fatigue the sweetness of uh

87
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:59,039
fatigue soothe uh everything

88
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:13,240
just leaving brightness awareness in its

89
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
wake

90
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

91
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

92
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,158
e e

93
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,080
e

94
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:35,200
okay um

95
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:44,200
so there are probably uh a lot of different different rhythms that run

96
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:52,279
through a practice life different phases and and some of those phases are

97
00:29:52,279 --> 00:30:00,039
really maybe not discernable we because we can only

98
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:08,120
perceive some small segment of our um existence we sort of go to what

99
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:13,440
naturally we can perceive what's conscious what awareness can

100
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,360
penetrate and so we we maybe uh

101
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:26,399
over read some of that some some aspects some fa kind of

102
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:32,000
phases of practice are Maybe not discernable but we kind of know

103
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,240
something is happening something's changing something the tectonic plates of my being are rumbling but I don't

104
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:46,919
know what is going on some phases are maybe discernable but

105
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:53,559
we can make sense of them but only after a long period of

106
00:30:53,559 --> 00:31:00,440
retrospection looking back you know and I I had a long

107
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:07,080
phase that I was not conscious of being in but it was like years years and it

108
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:12,919
was only when I kind of like woke up from it that there was like oh that was

109
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:19,159
there was some some kind of the Mind was tinged

110
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:26,760
with some measure of disillusionment maybe on the slightly nihilistic side

111
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:34,360
somehow and and uh and it wasn't it wasn't uh kind of you know an obvious

112
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:41,679
thing and so it only actually registered after the fact it's almost like you

113
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:47,880
can't see it until you have something new to contrast it

114
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:56,559
to and um a friend last last week um said um

115
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:02,000
she Dharma Dharma teacher you know close close

116
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,279
friend actually just before I went into to teach and she said she felt like I've

117
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:14,760
been been holding grief as a kind of fundamental Bedrock of the

118
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:21,399
universe and she said that in the the kind of attempts to Def kind of defend

119
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:28,480
grief from spiritual bypassing I had reified it my attempt to

120
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:36,000
defend it against you know the charge of being just another afflictive emotion I

121
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,559
had somehow reified grief as this kind of like non-negotiable Bedrock of the

122
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:48,679
universe which we could make the case for it that to actually look deeply is

123
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:54,600
to to appreciate uh the necessity of

124
00:32:54,679 --> 00:33:00,440
grief but she went on to say that um that

125
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:07,279
um suggests not that I use my kind of like vasana laser to dissolve it into

126
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:13,000
anich to dissolve the grief into just empty

127
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,880
phenomena but her suggestion was instead to appreciate what what is even bigger

128
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:27,120
than the grief and she didn't say what what but I

129
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:36,799
think she meant love awareness no okay it's a phase I've been

130
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:44,480
in it's hard to tell what phase we're in you know but um the Dharma does go in

131
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:51,159
phases and I think the last time I spoke two weeks ago I talked about um coming

132
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:58,399
home and leaving home the ways that Dharma is is a way of Reawakening old

133
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:05,960
loves you know dormant loves things we've loved before coming home and a way of learning

134
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:12,398
to love new things leaving home and there's

135
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:17,839
another kind of uh discernable rhythm in

136
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:24,280
practice that maybe we characterize as something like cruising altitude and

137
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:31,079
upheaval so

138
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:36,919
um we uh we come to to practice

139
00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:46,679
um with pains with questions with problems with some need and sometimes

140
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:52,960
somehow those things get resolved they actually do it's like practice fulfilled

141
00:34:52,960 --> 00:35:00,280
its promise it it it met the need and maybe we have an Insight or a

142
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:05,400
problem just kind of it dissolves or

143
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:12,119
it's still there but it doesn't have the same weight on the heart and there's some burden that gets

144
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:17,960
shed and um that's beautiful and then we kind of get comfortable in that

145
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:25,800
understanding and it feels so good and we kind of

146
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:32,359
maybe cruise at that altitude for a while and that's that's genuinely good

147
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:39,640
practice it's comfortable it feels good I'm not trying

148
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:46,760
to uh suggest there's something UNH wholesome about that right because it's

149
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:54,960
like that sense of like oh yeah we constantly have to be growing the urge to always be growing is

150
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:04,040
often just another case example of greed okay that my cruising altitude the

151
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:11,319
Dharma feels uh like home this understanding feels like

152
00:36:11,319 --> 00:36:19,520
home and I thought of there there some there a little bit of a strange parallel but some parallel with um if you're

153
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:26,920
familiar with the the philosophy of science and uh Coon's normal science

154
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:33,040
science the the kind of nature of scientific uh

155
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:40,680
Discovery um science is often at a kind of cruising altitude science is working

156
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:47,440
contentedly within a paradigm tinkering and making advant you know

157
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:54,040
advances and generally quite orderly but then in Coon's view

158
00:36:54,040 --> 00:37:00,800
something happens in science there's enough anomalous data enough

159
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:09,480
inconsistency enough uh um enough data that doesn't fit well into the old

160
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:16,760
Paradigm and then there's a kind of Scientific Revolution and the criteria by which one

161
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:22,079
might judge the old Paradigm doesn't really work for judging the new paradigm

162
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:29,079
there's no common standard of comparison and it's hard to know what's

163
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:36,800
true or how to compare the past with the present and that sense of being in a new

164
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:44,920
land a new land this is how practice is sometimes sometimes we're tinkering and

165
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:52,040
sometimes there's some kind of Revolution and it might be something

166
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:58,440
that's great and beautiful it might be painful and bewildering but there's

167
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:05,240
anomalous data and you have this sense of like the old Paradigm my old way of

168
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:11,960
framing the Dharma my old way of understanding my path it can't contain

169
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:19,520
this data anymore there's enough anomalous data

170
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:24,800
that there's some kind of break and you realize that the story

171
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:31,880
you've been living in feel obsolete the vision you had the Dharma

172
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:40,720
has to give way the rug the rug the Dharma rug gets pulled out from under

173
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:48,440
us and that happens with Insight that happens with grief or pain or some Shock

174
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:55,480
to the system and it's like ah the old Paradigm will not be able to accommodate

175
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:03,079
this and there's often a sense of um of

176
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:10,680
disorientation disorientation you kind of don't know well how to judge or assess this

177
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:16,760
new land I don't know who I am in this new realm I don't know what is left of

178
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:23,560
me after that Insight that love that loss that grief that

179
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:28,640
whatever the old standards don't really

180
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:35,599
work right and that sense of disorientation that can be really

181
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:42,119
dramatic or it can be more subtle it happens you know at a kind

182
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:48,200
of micro level anytime our model of who

183
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:54,280
we are gets challenged right we sort of

184
00:39:54,280 --> 00:40:00,760
like have to tolerate a measure of disorient orentation so when somebody says

185
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:09,119
that question you know that horrible question can I offer you some

186
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:18,280
feedback like oh no it's almost like the the cage of self

187
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:24,680
like starts rattling immediately you know and then okay you get some feedback

188
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:29,800
and this might literally be feedback from somebody but this may be just the

189
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:36,920
feedback of the world right and sometimes the attachment to self-

190
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:43,359
view is only apparent when that cage gets

191
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:50,760
shaken and so uh this can happen at the level of

192
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:56,480
practice more generally not just something being rattled but like the

193
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:02,319
whole of one being gets rattled the familiarity of the

194
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:09,200
view all of the familiar kind of reference points and the frames and the

195
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:17,040
language the connotations the stories we have used to um stabilize a sense of

196
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:27,279
identity a sense of what practice is sense of our life project that gets disrupted

197
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,920
and you can appreciate like how your

198
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:43,800
your yeah your prior understanding the prior story you would tell about the darma

199
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:49,599
about yourself somehow and I don't say it pejoratively

200
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:55,839
it's very tender but it's like somehow all of that the story was just a

201
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:02,319
little naive to wake up is to wake up to

202
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:09,560
more and so our previous understanding of myself of what I was doing here of

203
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:17,240
what the Buddha's offering is it somehow failed to fully appreciate the

204
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:22,880
complexity of Being Human you know maybe

205
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:29,559
we failed to fully appreciate just how deep suffering can

206
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:35,720
run or maybe we fail fail you know failed to appreciate just

207
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:46,160
how wide love can be and maybe it's interesting to

208
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:51,440
consider to use the C parallel with

209
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:57,800
just how much anomalous data is required in your life

210
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:03,240
to usher in the next

211
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:10,839
Revolution when can you feel like the Paradigm the story I tell of me my life

212
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:18,640
is just like can no longer quite contain that anomalous

213
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,920
data and then something breaks

214
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:32,160
open and this is not a way of saying we should

215
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:39,880
always be in periods of upheaval but to appreciate this

216
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:45,040
cycle normal normal science

217
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:51,319
Revolution normal life normal Dharma practice

218
00:43:51,319 --> 00:43:58,880
disruption that cycle just keeps going as far as I can tell just keeps

219
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:07,160
deepening each time we shed some measure of naive each time our heart

220
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:13,000
grows in uh subtlety and

221
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:18,319
sensitivity and then we rest we hit our cruising

222
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:23,760
altitude and know that um there will be

223
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:30,200
uh turbulence some other time and that will be an

224
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:37,160
opportunity so I offer this for your uh consideration and U wish you all a

225
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:45,440
lovely uh lovely week and we'll see you see you next time be back next week same

226
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,440
place okay
