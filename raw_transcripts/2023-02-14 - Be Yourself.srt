1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:07,740
now I'm Amplified yeah no yeah

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:17,000
so welcome warm welcome [Music] happy to see you all

3
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,420
I I imagine you're

4
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:30,359
here because well you all have your own reasons for

5
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:37,340
being here all of them good

6
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:45,960
all of them I'm assuming you come to a place like

7
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,538
this for out of goodness

8
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,559
you could say maybe out of love

9
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,280
that you love yourself you ever think of it that way you love

10
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:14,420
yourself and you think something is going to happen here in your meditation or

11
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,479
right being here maybe I'll say something that will help be helpful

12
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,460
just this be this place it's just so nice to be here it's it's a Sacred Space

13
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:40,200
so it's nice to be in a Sacred Space where you know we feel Maybe feel uh

14
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,979
held in love in this Sacred Space

15
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,799
this holy place that thousands thousands and thousands of

16
00:01:52,799 --> 00:02:00,439
people have come here too to be healed

17
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,920
who come here out of love for themselves

18
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,040
out of compassion they for themselves

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,360
we want to be free I want to be free

20
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,280
and I'm assuming you want to be free

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,500
so that's compassion right

22
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:47,120
like you see a dog that's you know maybe in pain and you feel you want to be free of that pain

23
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:55,260
or you have a loved one who's trapped in an affliction

24
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,459
you want her to be free

25
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,540
so I don't want to presume too much but I I

26
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,439
want you to be free

27
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:17,580
and I I'm assuming that you all are here because

28
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,680
in some way you want to be free you have compassion you have some essential

29
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,019
compassion there's something in US this basic

30
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:31,019
inclination

31
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:44,180
I had a cookie before I came here tonight

32
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:54,420
maybe it's made me happy I want to be happy you want to be happy

33
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:01,340
anybody here not want to be happy raise your hand if you don't want to be happy

34
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,980
you say well I'm a masochist well that makes you happy to be a masochist

35
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:16,939
it's so uh Beyond uh

36
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,579
psychology in a way it's so essential

37
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:31,280
it's just we we all day long from when we get up in the morning

38
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,060
I don't I didn't know what I was going to say tonight but here I'm saying something

39
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:49,860
makes me happy to say what I'm saying I love to talk about love I love yeah

40
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:56,660
makes me happy to talk about love makes me happy to talk about compassion

41
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:05,419
so think about how you went through your day-to-day and all the things you did

42
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,860
out of care even making your bed you know brushing

43
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,478
your teeth it's caring for yourself

44
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,740
going to the bathroom you know we always have this love in us

45
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,840
it's in it's all day long I just crossed my legs I'm a little more

46
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:43,380
comfortable that way you just moved here getting more comfortable it's okay it's

47
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,680
good

48
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,639
you should recognize we have this but maybe sometimes we think we're bad

49
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:02,060
huh

50
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,020
the Buddha said or somebody

51
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:30,180
like the Buddha said we have this love we're so strong in us

52
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:38,180
it's like the way a mother cares for an only child this love is so strong

53
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:12,000
so Buddhism and uh Buddha

54
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,919
and all the Masters all the Buddhist Masters

55
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:26,460
and I think all religious all mystical religious

56
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:34,520
Masters say that we are love

57
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:42,860
that we are compassion that we are awareness

58
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,199
that we are wisdom

59
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:06,860
think about who you are in essence Who You Are

60
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:17,520
we have all these thoughts all these identities that come through our mind

61
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,940
these boxes and we step into those boxes

62
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:27,740
and for a while that becomes me

63
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:37,820
as I was sitting here tonight with you

64
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:44,399
I wasn't trying to think about what I was going to say but different things all these you know

65
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:51,560
beautiful things came coming to my mind that's a good idea that's a good thought that's a good thought

66
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:03,740
been out of love I let them go I didn't want to get caught in a box

67
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:13,680
it was deeper than grabbing onto that box was it was a

68
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:21,480
more essential in me to let go of that box it was kinder to me a more compassionate

69
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:27,080
to me to let go of that and to allow

70
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:32,300
to allow the boxes to come and go

71
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:45,680
and then their silence can you hear the silence in the room

72
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,839
there's silence all there's always silence

73
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,300
there's space between the boxes

74
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:11,480
and sometimes the space lasts longer

75
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:22,260
and we I think we want to be really silent we want to we want that to be our

76
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:29,339
meditation to be as to exist in silence that's what we want

77
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:35,000
we strive for that we we meditators really love silence

78
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,779
but that's really grasping silence too

79
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:53,160
we don't have to grasp at the silence just you know the silence comes naturally in the silence

80
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:59,899
is between the thoughts and the silence is always here

81
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,920
so if we relax into our own kindness

82
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:20,820
essential kindness which is always here we can count on this essential kindness

83
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,680
we can count on this essential love

84
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,420
then we don't have to worry so much about the boxes

85
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:46,140
the boxes don't matter you could say who cares about these

86
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:53,660
boxes who cares rather than stepping into a box

87
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:01,680
letting it allowing it allowing every box

88
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,779
to free itself they will free them they do even if we grab hold of them they'll

89
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:13,140
free themselves eventually what box were you in an hour ago you

90
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:18,360
don't remember so it does free them it does free itself

91
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:25,320
it always frees itself we've been creating boxes for I don't remember I am 78 years old I've

92
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:31,140
been creating boxes for 78 years and they've always freed themselves

93
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,740
amazing

94
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,740
so what's not the Box

95
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,480
what's not the Box in you what isn't it what is it what is it in you that isn't

96
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,820
this little prison that you create that we create for

97
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:02,339
ourselves what's in you that isn't that

98
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:10,040
much bigger than that is it the silence

99
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:18,620
is it the love love is always here

100
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,740
is it the compassion the kindness that allows sounds

101
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,380
Sensations

102
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:47,360
allows the whole kitten caboodle

103
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,620
to arise

104
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:03,019
and cease and rise and cease and rise and cease

105
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:11,600
allowing allowing that flow

106
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:18,240
we can try to grasp and stop it on a me

107
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,620
that is particularly wonderful particularly praiseworthy

108
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,000
particularly I don't know

109
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:36,620
laughs

110
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:56,660
and these are all awareness kindness and love

111
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:03,060
all exist all exist they're all qualities of being

112
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:10,260
just being just relaxed

113
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:15,440
open aware being

114
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:36,180
we all want to come home we all want to be ourselves

115
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:40,699
we all want to come home and relax and just

116
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,800
really would not not worry about

117
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,720
all this stuff

118
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:02,240
but we do worry about all this stuff

119
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,940
we worry about the human value system what I'm talking about is not really

120
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:22,279
human I mean it's very human

121
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:35,779
but the human value system is what people think of us

122
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:43,639
stuff we worry about our reputation

123
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,420
our Glory

124
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:04,819
I think he's having fun out there he's happy he's having a good time

125
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:16,759
so who are we hear that and maybe you feel

126
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,740
we see

127
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:30,679
foreign

128
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,440
we sense

129
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:51,799
and we're aware of all these things that are going on we're aware of our feelings

130
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:59,039
we're aware of our thoughts we're aware of our hearing

131
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,220
we're aware of our sides we're aware of yeah

132
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,200
and all those things that I mentioned

133
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:19,860
are conditions that come and go and come and go and come and

134
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,880
go and come and go

135
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:29,960
but in this instant of time

136
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,940
there's this awareness this presence

137
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:45,900
that knows what we hear that knows can you see that in yourself

138
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:53,539
that knowing there's this knowing there's a wake awake quality

139
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,740
who are you aware are you aware right now

140
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,840
aware of sound

141
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:22,740
the Buddhism great Masters says we are this is what we are we are awareness

142
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:28,700
all those other things all those conditions keep all of our

143
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,940
so-called life

144
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:43,080
come and go come and go come and go Instant by Instant by instant

145
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,820
but awareness doesn't come and go

146
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,740
the Greeks called it neosis g-n-o-s-i-s everybody you know all these great

147
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:03,440
cultures religions they all know this in their own particular way

148
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:14,059
that fundamentally we are awareness

149
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:24,900
other than that we're nothing at all because it all comes and goes

150
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:31,880
you can't grab it anything you can't grab

151
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,360
that sound

152
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:45,720
my voice you can't grab what you see I think you think I'm think I'm seeing this but it's

153
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:52,880
really changing my focus is changing whatever is out there is changing

154
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:58,980
and I'll leave this place and that won't even I won't see that anymore anyhow

155
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,660
Sensations are changing

156
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:15,080
but my awareness in this instance isn't changing

157
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:27,559
the awareness is here The Knowing is here

158
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,960
What If instead of being devoted to

159
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:46,700
um things that are changing

160
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:54,679
like praise black reputation

161
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:04,700
like money like getting something material like a success

162
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,120
like some temporary Glory

163
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:24,960
and being so afraid of the opposite of criticism of disapproval of

164
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,140
being neglected being not recognized

165
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,740
so afraid of failure so afraid you know we have all these problems of low

166
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:47,480
self-esteem low self-worth anger at someone who says something we don't like

167
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,640
fear that somebody's going to say something we won't like or we're not going to get what we don't get all these

168
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,700
afflictions what if we weren't so devoted

169
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:03,440
to those things that come and go

170
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:11,179
and just were devoted to this

171
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,960
that doesn't come and go

172
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:24,539
this awareness like I said try it out

173
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:30,080
don't even don't even make any effort just be

174
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,059
what if we're devoted to that

175
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:48,240
which includes love because we're allowing it all just

176
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,158
allowing it all to freely flow

177
00:23:55,799 --> 00:24:00,980
and that's freedom when we're not grasping

178
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:10,158
onto one of those really painful boxes

179
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:16,640
I heard that these Devils these Devils create Hells for us

180
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:22,279
Hells of anger Hells of fear

181
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:29,640
but they become angels those Devils become Angels when we let

182
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:35,580
go and let be there

183
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:43,400
ushering in a bigger understanding for us your afflictions those devils

184
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,440
if we allow them they can be angels

185
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:59,600
do you have any questions or comments about any of this

186
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:18,500
I don't think there are any questions no

187
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,340
anybody feel like saying anything

188
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:36,620
well I cut clothes with a story

189
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:42,600
there was this rabbi whose name was zuzia

190
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:48,720
and everybody loved this Rabbi it was a very wise Rabbi he was very good really

191
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,820
good Rabbi good person completely renunciate

192
00:25:53,820 --> 00:26:01,020
he gave way people would give him money give him stuff and he'd give it away his family unfortunately well maybe I'm sure

193
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,720
it was fine they lived in kind of a poverty they lived

194
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,039
and he was very wise and and uh

195
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:22,399
good kind so it came time for him to die

196
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:29,360
and he was crying he was sobbing

197
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:36,000
and his his all beat these congregants that loved

198
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,419
him were around his bad zuzia why are you crying

199
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:50,580
and they they said are you crying because you weren't oh he says I'm I'm crying because I'm

200
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:56,279
afraid to face God and they say why were you would you if

201
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:00,679
all people be afraid to face God Zeus yeah

202
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:07,740
and he said because I don't know so they said are you are

203
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:16,200
you afraid that you weren't enough like Moses that you weren't wise enough like Moses

204
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:22,460
and Jesus shook his head no that's not it are you afraid that you weren't

205
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:29,100
so completely devoted and loving of God like like

206
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:34,980
Abraham or Isaac or Jacob any of those great prophets that we're doing

207
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:43,020
and so she said no that's that's not I'm not crying because I wasn't kind enough or I wasn't wise enough I'm not afraid

208
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:49,679
of God accusing me of that what are you afraid of zuzia

209
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:56,539
I'm afraid that God will accuse me of not being sousia

210
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:08,340
so what does it mean to be yourself to really come home

211
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:13,919
just to be yourself who cares what they think it doesn't

212
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:20,179
matter doesn't mean to not be caring

213
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:28,159
but not being so preoccupied with the human value system

214
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:36,260
whatever you're worried about whatever your problem is and recognize

215
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:45,179
your your innate goodness a nakedness Buddhism believes

216
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:51,779
that we are innately good innately pure not innately

217
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:57,299
laughs bad in so many ways no no we're all

218
00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:02,880
you're all perfect you're all innately good you're all have you have awareness

219
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,940
it's unmistakable you're awake you're alive you're not a rock

220
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:13,860
and you want to be happy Your Love

221
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:20,460
and you want your friends and your and really all beings

222
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:25,500
if we could we would we would love all beings to be happy I think

223
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,840
and we would love all beings to be we want ourselves to be free of afflictions right

224
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,820
compassion we have this compassion

225
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:44,700

226
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:49,580
and we have wisdom it's all here it's all available

227
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,600
