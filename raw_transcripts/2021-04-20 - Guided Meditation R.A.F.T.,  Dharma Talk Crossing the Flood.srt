1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,480
good evening good evening welcome

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:16,800
it's nice to be here to be practicing together and whether you're listening to

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:31,439
this live or in the future it's nice that to practice with others

4
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,559
so i'll do a little bit of a guided meditation here

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,840
settling into our seat

6
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,520
maybe feeling both the pressure of the chair or cushion

7
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,480
maybe like the gravity pulling us down as well as the uprightness kind of

8
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,159
pulling us up to both both movements

9
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:13,840
in balance

10
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,680
and feeling the body breathing

11
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,040
that is the movement of the abdomen the chest

12
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:55,840
or the air going in and out of the nose

13
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:23,840
just noticing how it feels to have an in-breath

14
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:37,840
and how it feels to have an out-breath

15
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,879
nothing in particular needs to be

16
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,040
happening we're just noticing the sensations of

17
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840
breathing

18
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,959
and when the mind wanders and just very

19
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:29,840
simply gently begin again

20
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:17,199
so again and again returning to the sensations of breathing

21
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:31,039
it turns out there is absolutely no limit none to how many times

22
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,520
we can return to the sensations of

23
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,840
breathing

24
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:35,840
and when we find that it's not so easy to stay with the

25
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:42,479
sensations of breathing or something compelling

26
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,520
maybe an emotional state

27
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,840
can be really helpful to just simply recognize what's happening

28
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,560
to name it

29
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:17,520
oh here's restlessness

30
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,960
here's drowsiness

31
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:31,840
here's impatience whatever it might be

32
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:59,840
so to just recognize what the experience is at this moment

33
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:17,199
and then as best we can to allow the experience to be there

34
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:27,840
after all it is there so to align ourselves with reality

35
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,599
can we allow whatever this experience is to be there

36
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,440
without trying to shove it away

37
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:55,839
or grab on tightly

38
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:29,200
one support for allowing a compelling

39
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:37,839
experience is to feel it in the body

40
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:47,040
feel the maybe energetic buzzing feeling with restlessness

41
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,839
or maybe there's feeling in the legs like wanting to jump up and run away

42
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,560
maybe drowsiness has some heaviness on the shoulders

43
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,839
the head

44
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:18,240
maybe frustration it's a furrowed brow and maybe collapsed shoulders

45
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:26,480
clap's chest whatever it might be for you to feel

46
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:33,839
the experience in the body

47
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:41,120
the body is more tangible it's easier for the mind to rest on

48
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,839
physical sensations

49
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:57,839
another support for allowing the experience to be there

50
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:07,120
is to tease apart the experience from our reaction to the

51
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,839
experience

52
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:22,880
we feel restless and then we have aversion to the restlessness

53
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:29,200
and then do we have aversion to the aversion to the restlessness

54
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,040
and then do we have aversion to the aversion to the aversion to the restlessness

55
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,639
it doesn't matter how many iterations

56
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:47,200
can you tease apart a sensation and experience from the

57
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:53,839
reaction to it

58
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:25,120
all of these approaches to recognize allow

59
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,240
feel in the body tease apart the experience from the

60
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:39,759
response reaction to the experience are ways to help the experience

61
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,480
move through us arise and pass away

62
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,199
take some of the compelling nature out of it

63
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:08,000
recognize allow feel in the body tease

64
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:17,839
apart the experience from the reaction to the experience

65
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:52,080
we can use the tools of recognize allow

66
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:58,400
feel in the body tease apart the react

67
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,400
the experience from the reaction

68
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:11,280
and just like all tools we only use them if it's helpful

69
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:20,640
if it's beneficial we don't carry around a crescent wrench

70
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:37,840
and try to use it on everything we use it when it's useful

71
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:36,799
recognize allow feel tease

72
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,919
r a f t

73
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,840
raft

74
00:24:51,520 --> 00:25:00,880
doesn't have to be used in that order or all four elements

75
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,919
but having a mnemonic

76
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:15,840
so we can bring so we can use this tool when it's needed

77
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,960
sometimes when it feels like we might be overwhelmed by an

78
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:36,240
experience or an experience is really compelling

79
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:42,799
it's difficult to not be caught up in it

80
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:51,120
it can be useful to use what skills with tools we have

81
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,760
available

82
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:04,080
as a way to lessen the compelling nature make it less strong

83
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,278
of the experience

84
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:19,519
so that then we are available we have the freedom the space

85
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,159
to be available for what else is happening

86
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,840
and to be available for others

87
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:42,640
so that we might be a support for others and so that we might not be

88
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:49,760
stuck and narrowed in on just one thing

89
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:58,640
r-a-f-t raft may it be for the benefit

90
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,360
of all beings everywhere

91
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,559
and i'm looking for the striker for the

92
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:27,989
bell [Music]

93
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:41,840
thank you

94
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,320
welcome welcome good evening

95
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,440
so in this tradition sometimes we talk about this idea of crossing the

96
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:29,039
flood perhaps you've heard that and it's not an uncommon idea and

97
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:36,880
i might say that floods represent that which keeps us submerged and suffering perhaps or

98
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:44,559
not able to rise up to a secure stable place

99
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:52,799
which we could say is nibana's awakening is the most secure we wouldn't call it a place but it's the

100
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,919
opposite of being submerged and overwhelmed

101
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:06,480
and classically i'm not going to talk about these i'll just mention them that classically um

102
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,919
there are said to be four floods in this in the theravada tradition in the pali

103
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:17,039
canon or maybe it's even in the commentaries i'm not sure

104
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:24,000
the flood of sensuality the flood of existence the flood of views and the

105
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,399
flood of ignorance so these four experiences are things

106
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:36,159
that if we grab on to them can really be overwhelming and

107
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:43,600
we can feel like we're submerged in them and not on steady ground but instead getting

108
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:49,440
swept away or pushed around or this can be terribly frightening of

109
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,960
course to be in the midst of a i'm thinking in my

110
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,960
mind a raging river or perhaps a flood

111
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,679
and a john suchito he writes about this um the whole metaphor of uh

112
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:16,000
crossing the flood in this tradition and he writes an interest in deep change

113
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,320
gets triggered by the feeling of being swept along by events by the sense of being

114
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:28,640
overwhelmed by and even going under a tide of worries duties and

115
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:36,480
pressures so that's the floods worries duties and pressures

116
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:43,039
and just in our daily lives may just feel like oh this is too much and there's like no end or they

117
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:50,960
just keep on coming and we can feel them and then john suchito

118
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,480
continues he writes and crossing them the floods is about

119
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:03,200
coming through all that to find some firm ground it takes some work

120
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:10,880
some skill but we can do it so some encouragement that we can cross

121
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,399
over these floods and that's part of what the practice of buddhism is about

122
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:21,360
is to get out to the other side

123
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:28,720
i remember a number of years ago i saw a movie

124
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,640
i think it was called into the wild but i'm not certain i don't remember a lot of the

125
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:40,399
particulars of this movie but my memory of it is that there's this

126
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:49,360
scene where the protagonist this young man who had gone into alaska

127
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,960
to live off the land be kind of like a survivalist i guess

128
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,799
and when he first went out into the wilderness

129
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:07,519
into the wild i guess he crossed a river

130
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:14,960
and then when he became sick and he wanted to go back now the river river was flooding

131
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:22,320
or was raging maybe and he couldn't cross so he couldn't go back and just that

132
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:31,200
scene has stayed in my mind this idea of okay you can see where you need to go

133
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:38,240
but that you can't get there this it's like maybe certain death

134
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,480
if you were to go into the water and

135
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:50,240
so maybe we don't in our daily lives don't have experiences like that

136
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:56,960
i do have to say sometimes i am struck by how effortlessly in my car

137
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:03,760
or even walking that um just to cross over bodies of water or

138
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,960
ravines or valleys or something like this

139
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:16,160
like how often we have uh we've solved this problem of

140
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:22,880
crossing an expanse of water in modern times but of course that

141
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:30,400
wasn't the case in ancient india especially when the buddha was

142
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,520
in the gangetic plains near the ganges river

143
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:42,839
it flooded right during the monsoon season so this idea to cross the flood was a real

144
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:48,720
issue even though we might today not be able to relate to it as much i

145
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,920
was thinking that you know for them and this time of ancient india this would have been a

146
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,119
real concern it might it might have even been okay we can only cross

147
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:04,880
certain times of the year we just simply can't cross on other times of the year

148
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:13,280
so with this is kind of a setting there's uh i'd like to talk a little bit

149
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:20,400
about the simile of the raft probably most of you are familiar with this

150
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:26,800
this um i'll read uh here here's a little bit

151
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:33,359
different translation but it goes like this the simile of the raft

152
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:40,400
and this is the buddha speaking as part of his teaching imagine a person in the course of a

153
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:48,480
journey arrives at a great expanse of water whose near bank is dangerous and whose

154
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:55,200
far bank offers safety but there is no fairy boat or bridge to

155
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:01,200
take them across the water so the person thinks what if i collected

156
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,960
grass twigs branches and leaves and bound them together as a raft

157
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,640
and supported by the raft and by paddling with my hands and feet i should then be able to get

158
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:20,160
to the far bank the person does this and succeeds in getting across

159
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:27,599
on arriving at the far bank it might occur to this person this raft has been very helpful indeed

160
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:35,200
what if i were to hoist it on my head or load it on to my shoulders and proceed on my journey you know just

161
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:42,079
put it up on here and to carry and just keep on going so the buddha continues and he says the

162
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:49,119
buddha says now what do you think by carrying the raft with them would that person be doing what should

163
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:55,040
be done with a raft no sir replied his audience

164
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:00,960
so what should the person do with a raft having arrived at the far bank the

165
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:09,200
person might think yes this raft has been very useful but now i should just haul it onto dry

166
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,560
land or release it and set it adrift in the water

167
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,839
and then go wherever i want

168
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,040
those of us that often are familiar with this uh maybe i should just speak for myself

169
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:33,760
when i heard this simile of the raft i thought oh okay so it's all about just dropping those

170
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:39,920
things that aren't useful because we're not going to carry a raft around

171
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,320
on dry land unless of course we need to portage because we know there's another large expense of water or

172
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:53,119
maybe we don't know what's next and we think it might be useful but for the purpose of this simile the

173
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:59,200
emphasis is on putting down the raft but i'd like to unpack this a little bit

174
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:07,440
more because i think the there's some real richness here and sometimes it's easier to

175
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:14,960
at least for me i think for many of us it's easier to remember things to feel inspired by them

176
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:21,440
if they're kind of fleshed out and part of a story in some kind of way

177
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:29,040
so the story of this for this simile of the raft is that a person is on a bank

178
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:34,160
on the bank of a large expense of water which we're assuming is like a flood

179
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:39,200
or it could be a river maybe it's a large lake i actually don't

180
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:45,920
know but and this the wanting to get to the other

181
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:54,320
side because this side is not safe there's dukkha here

182
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,440
so the simile begins with noticing dukkha

183
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:06,640
and for so many of us this is the beginning of our spiritual practice our buddhist practice

184
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:12,079
and certainly it's the first noble truth there is dukkha

185
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:18,319
so just noticing that oh where i am here is not safe

186
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:25,760
i don't need to i need to go somewhere else and what's in front that is the flood that's

187
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,880
not safe either it's going too fast maybe it's a trench

188
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:37,119
torrent maybe it's raging rapids we don't know but for some reason they

189
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:44,480
can't just wade across or swim across so sometimes we feel like this

190
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:50,960
here's not safe there's not safe this feeling of what am i going to do in fact it's

191
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,160
probably not until we feel this feeling stuck

192
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:04,160
in some kind of way that we're really able to maybe try something new or do something

193
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:12,240
different and so maybe i'll say that that the buddha he spent a lot of his teachings talking

194
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:19,440
about this actually about kind of the about dukkha in general but in

195
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:27,359
particular pointing to the dukkha of sensual pleasures not because they are inherently bad but

196
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:32,480
because we are often turning to them to try to

197
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:41,280
find maybe a little confused about pleasure and happiness and we're trying to find happiness and instead going we're going

198
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:48,560
for pleasure and then we discover again and again and again that things that are pleasurable are not

199
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,319
lasting sources of happiness

200
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:01,920
and some and the buddha he gave quite a few similes

201
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:11,200
talking about some of the dangers of sensual pleasure and maybe i'll just offer one here

202
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:20,240
so the buddha says suppose a person took a blazing grass torch and went against the wind so that

203
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:26,079
is you know holding something that is a flame

204
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:32,319
now in modern times we just get a flashlight if it's dark and we want to see right

205
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:38,079
and there aren't dangers usually associated with with using a flashlight

206
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:44,240
but in ancient times right of course they don't have flashlights if you need to see at night you have a

207
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:51,040
torch and if there aren't trees around or something it might be a grass torch

208
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:58,319
so suppose a person took a blazing grass torch and went against the wind what do you

209
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:04,480
think if that person does not quickly let go of that blazing grass torch wouldn't that

210
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:10,160
bleazing grass torch burn their hand or their arm or some other part of their body

211
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:16,800
so that they might incur death or deadly suffering because of it i think it will relate to that if you're

212
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:22,079
holding something that's a flame and the wind comes towards you you're going to drop it it's just a

213
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:27,839
natural thing to do so of course he asks wouldn't they drop

214
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:34,560
it and they say yes venerable sir and then he continues the buddha continues so too

215
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:40,640
a noble disciple considers thus sensual pleasures have been compared to a grass torch by

216
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:46,560
the blessed one sensual pleasures provide great disappointment great trouble and

217
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:53,839
the danger in them is still greater so in the same way there are some things

218
00:43:53,839 --> 00:44:00,800
that for us that can be really useful helpful enjoyable i'm using the simile of using a

219
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:06,480
flashlight but there's so many different things that

220
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:13,280
even though they may be helpful they uh lead to trouble it can be a slippery

221
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,720
slope using a flashlight isn't one of them but maybe

222
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:25,599
watching all kinds of tv or youtube videos or something like this can feel how it

223
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:30,800
kind of accepts your energy or kind of warps your influences your mind

224
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:37,280
maybe in a way that isn't the best thing for your mind or maybe gossiping

225
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:44,079
saying something not so helpful about another person

226
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:49,119
some of these things the buddha is using the word sensual pleasures

227
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:55,440
maybe i could just use the word distractions or things that we do for entertainment

228
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:01,280
turn out to not be so helpful and it so sometimes the duke is really obvious

229
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:07,280
we have a terrible diagnosis or some really untenable situation

230
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:13,920
or maybe it's not so obvious watching too many youtube videos

231
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:21,760
but this idea that there is dukkha all around on this shore and in the water

232
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:27,920
so we want to go the other side and so part of the practice is also to

233
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:34,000
notice that there is another side there is an alternative

234
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,880
there is a place that has some safety

235
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:45,680
and this of course is the third noble truth the cessation of dukkha

236
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:50,880
can consider it as nibana's awakening but even if it's not a complete sensation of

237
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:58,160
all dukkha think of it as a diminishment of whatever duca we're having it's safer

238
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:05,200
even if it's not completely safe we can also think of the other shore as being safer

239
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:12,839
so this encouragement for us to notice okay when is it experiences that are

240
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:19,200
neutral where are experiences that feel like can be a foundation

241
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:28,319
a ground for a source of lasting happiness something that's we can build on or

242
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:32,160
create a firm foundation with

243
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:39,760
and then so in this simile of the raft the person is standing there on the near shore sees

244
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:45,280
dukkha all around sees that there isn't duca on the other side and then

245
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:52,240
in the assembly of the raft they weave together a raft using grass twigs

246
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:58,240
branches and leaves that is they just look what's there what's

247
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:04,560
available right there and they work with what's there to make a raft

248
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:11,119
this is how i'm interpreting it they just are using things that are in nature

249
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:18,079
and one might find in the expanse of a river or something like this and i like this word that they get woven

250
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:24,079
together to make the raft so we might consider

251
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:29,520
that sila samadhi panya are things that we could weave together

252
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:35,440
to make a raft that is the teachings and practices of ethics

253
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:41,839
mental development meditation and wisdom these three practices we can

254
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:47,839
weave together it's just part of our daily life

255
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:55,599
the grass twigs leaves and branches are part of our daily life and we can

256
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:02,319
approach them and engage in it in a way that has ethics mental development and wisdom

257
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:09,839
so we create a wrath with our practice with the teachings with what's what we encounter

258
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:15,440
in our life and this of course is the fourth noble

259
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:24,000
truth about the eightfold path see the samadhi and panya

260
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:30,319
and then so once the raft is created in the assembly of the raft says the um

261
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:37,839
the person paddles with their hands and feet to get conveyed across to the other bank

262
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:43,440
so they don't just create the raft and then just sit on it

263
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:50,400
no they build it and then they use it as a support but of course they

264
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:57,200
have to do some of the effort they have to do some of the paddling they still have to engage with the water

265
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:03,760
they still have to maybe navigate or steer or just

266
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:12,000
using i think it says literally in this using their hands and feet so using parts of their body

267
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:19,280
doing some effort so there's a plenty of teachings also about using the

268
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:24,960
right kind of effort of course that's even one of the elements in the eightfold path

269
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:31,839
that is essentially to cultivate the wholesome and not to cultivate the unwholesome

270
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:41,680
but also is specifically about this idea of crossing a flood here's a another excerpt from the buddha

271
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:48,800
and where somebody asks him how dear sir did you cross the flood

272
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:55,760
so again using this uh metaphor of crossing the flood in this setting and then the buddha

273
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:02,480
responds how he crossed the flood by not halting and by not straining

274
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:08,240
i crossed the flood but how is it that by not halting and by not

275
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:15,280
straining you crossed the flood when i came to a standstill i sank

276
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:23,200
when i struggled i got swept away it is in this way by not halting and not straining

277
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:29,839
i crossed the flood so not only does it need to be some

278
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:37,440
effort but maybe a kind that doesn't have too much struggle or straining or by complete stopping but this

279
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:43,040
recognition that that there's maybe there's building the raft

280
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:48,880
and allowing what we created to support us but to find our way with wholesome and

281
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:55,599
unwholesome and to convey us in the direction that we want to go

282
00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:03,520
so then the assembly of the raft continues that when they get to the other side

283
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:09,680
is this inquiry like wow this raft has been really helpful suppose i hoist it on my head or load it

284
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:15,520
onto my shoulders in some cases as i said maybe that makes

285
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:24,000
sense to portage a raft across some dry land if we know that we're going to go to some water elsewhere but also

286
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,520
there was this uh um this when the buddha was saying well

287
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:36,559
what should a person do with the raft is this inquiry to say

288
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:43,760
well rather than just hoisting it on one's head there should be an inquiry should i hold

289
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:50,720
it onto dry land or should i set it adrift in the water

290
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:55,838
hold it on to dry land maybe we need it later

291
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:05,839
set it at drift on the water just release just let go

292
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:11,839
so then once one has the simile continues once one has hold

293
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:17,359
it on to joyland or to let it go the simile says then the person can

294
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:24,559
go wherever they want have complete freedom no obstructions no

295
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:31,359
limits so with this foundation this raft that

296
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:36,480
we've created and some effort got to the other side to a place where there's even greater

297
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:41,599
freedom and whether we understand the other

298
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:47,920
shore as nibbana as awakening or just as a place that has more safety

299
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:54,559
than where we currently are this idea of release letting go

300
00:52:54,559 --> 00:53:00,960
is part of this path so one way maybe taking the bird's eye

301
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:08,640
view of the simile of the raft and we might even say the ark of uh somebody's buddhist practice

302
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:14,960
could be first noticing noticing that there is suffering there's difficulty there's

303
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:22,720
dukkha there's unsatisfactoriness here and when i look over there like

304
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:29,599
all kinds of places and to also notice it seems that there's more safety on the

305
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:35,280
other bank further over there

306
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:42,800
if this isn't a perfect uh simile but just to notice that there are places of dukkha and

307
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:47,920
places without dukkha maybe that's the first step to notice

308
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:54,960
the dangers on this the dangers on this shore the floods and the safety on the other shore and

309
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:00,480
then there's some doing there's some cultivation some

310
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:08,000
development this building the rafts uh paddling and maybe heaving the raft up onto the

311
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,599
dry land and even having this inquiry is this helpful

312
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:22,800
this instead of saying oh this raft has been helpful therefore i have to carry it to have the inquiry is this helpful

313
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:31,119
and then to release happens the raft is left behind

314
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:35,680
so that the person has the freedom to go where they want

315
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:43,040
and it's important maybe to say that this release is natural it just when you realize

316
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:50,160
oh there's no more water i'm safe here there's no obstructions you don't have to

317
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:56,400
convince yourself to release the raft this isn't a perfect simile

318
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:03,280
because well there's different ways we could say what is this this it's not saying that we

319
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:11,359
should release ethics and mental development and wisdom so facility isn't perfect

320
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:17,040
if we're considering that the raft is the eightfold path we don't completely release the

321
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:24,880
eightfold path when we get to the other war there's it's more that we release practicing it for an awakened

322
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:30,720
person the eightfold path is just how they are in the world they show up

323
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:37,839
with right view right intention right speech right action right livelihood

324
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:42,240
effort mindfulness and concentration

325
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:51,440
so the simile of the raft

326
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:59,119
is somehow it can help us in particular moments is it we can think is it helpful to

327
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:06,720
notice where is there suffering and to help but to also notice where is there less suffering

328
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:13,920
and then just using what we have with us branches twigs leaves

329
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:19,119
and grass whatever our daily life is offering us

330
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:26,480
we can weave them together in the same way that we weave ethics meditation and

331
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:34,079
wisdom to support us to get to the other side and

332
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:39,520
when we get there then we can embody the eightfold path in some kind of way not

333
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:45,838
that we have to carry it but we just embody it

334
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:53,359
and that to recognize that releasing happens naturally this letting go and it's an integral

335
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:58,720
part of the path it's not just accumulating and building and

336
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:03,839
cultivating creating there's also a lot of letting go that happens

337
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:10,880
so in some ways maybe there's this simile of the raft works in small situations

338
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:16,640
as well as it might be the whole arc of practice

339
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:24,559
so i'm wishing you that you might find different ways all kinds of different ways in which we

340
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:29,520
might build a raft including with bubble gum and

341
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:37,760
toothpicks and i pick it up macgyver right whatever this tv character used to solve problems

342
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:44,799
with uh whatever they found so may you whatever difficulties you may

343
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:51,839
find yourself in may you also be able to build a raft so that you may cross over

344
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:58,160
the flood and be able to let go of those things that aren't helpful

345
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:03,280
maybe you build the raft and you help others across the flood

346
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:08,640
maybe you vary back and forth helping others

347
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:15,119
this way may our practice be for the benefit of all beings everywhere

348
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:21,599
thank you
