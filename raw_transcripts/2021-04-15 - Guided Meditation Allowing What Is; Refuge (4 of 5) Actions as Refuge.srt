1
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,960
so greetings welcome to the meditation

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,760
and

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,920
it's a happy sight to see the stream of uh good mornings here on the chat it's just kind of a

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,039
wonderful kind of river of goodwill and

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:33,760
i love seeing the familiar names and i love seeing new names and very nice

6
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:41,680
so one of the hallmarks of buddhism and buddhist practice

7
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:49,280
is the his freedom and freedom is a little complicated to

8
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:58,160
appreciate because it's very easy to feel that

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:05,280
freedom is unfettered unlimited uh

10
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:12,479
ability to act on our desires to act on our

11
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:19,680
compulsions to give room to whatever we're feeling wanting

12
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:26,000
disliking just just our feelings just kind of to flow freely and fully

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,240
and and then act on them and that's not quite what the freedom of

14
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,680
buddhism the freedom of buddhism is the freedom that

15
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,720
is not ego based or conceit based it's not the not the freedom that allows

16
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,479
unfettered expression of our desires and our

17
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:57,680
animosities and our fears but rather

18
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,880
it's uh it is a freedom that's deeper than that that allows for

19
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,000
something in their depths that's independent

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,480
of greed and hatred and delusion independent of the

21
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,840
whole complex of emotions and impulses that come out of what could be called conceit

22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,120
and to allow that to be free free of us in a sense but it is coming

23
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,800
from our depths it is a hugely you know integral part of who we are the dharma

24
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,400
the dharma that we are a dharma that flows through us

25
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,959
so in in uh and that's one of the reasons why provisionally mindfulness can be

26
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,800
understood as getting out of the way or as

27
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:57,360
giving a pause of just allowing things to be

28
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,840
and seeing them being aware of them making room for whatever is here and a progressive process of just

29
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,080
getting out of the way and allowing our inner experience to flow

30
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:17,280
and that allowing is not acting on our impulses or compulsions but it is

31
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,760
listening and sensing and feeling in to what's what's deeper what what can we

32
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:31,040
what freedom can we give to what's deeper and more integral more intimate um

33
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:38,720
that which lays at the kind of the foundation of our life or that which comes from someplace within

34
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:45,120
that is more wholesome maybe deeper than the place of unwholesomeness or

35
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,599
unskillfulness things that are based on compulsion

36
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,239
and uh and to have the trust to allow ourselves not to act on compulsion but

37
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:05,120
to make room for something else then what comes from fear or

38
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:12,239
compulsive desire or compulsive animosity resentment or what kind of swirls around and gets

39
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,759
trapped in the cycles of fear that might exist

40
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:24,560
so to pause to allow to get out of the way of one's

41
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:31,520
own experience so to begin this process

42
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,040
we take a pause in our daily activities to meditate

43
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:46,800
and to not so much to make something happen but to discover what is here for us

44
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,400
and have that discovery keep it be equivalent to keep opening

45
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,560
doors to what is here so

46
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:09,199
taking a posture assuming a posture that allows you your body to pause

47
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,479
from usual activities

48
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:22,160
for most of you it's probably a stationary posture so the body is still

49
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:30,080
and that allows us to tune into be aware of the sensations of the body

50
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,680
that are maybe more subtle than what would be

51
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,840
the case if we're doing a lot of movement

52
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:53,840
and one of the things that we don't pay much attention to in daily life can be the ongoing rhythm of breathing

53
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:06,160
and so to maybe take a few long slow deep

54
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,639
breaths

55
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:20,560
perhaps not aggressive breaths not too forceful but some deep

56
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,520
gentle breaths full breaths three quarters full

57
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:35,520
in a long exhale a long release

58
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:49,840
and as we exhale the end of the exhale to relax the belly baby relax the chest

59
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:02,160
and then

60
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,160
letting your breathing return to normal with no special effort to breathe in

61
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,880
special ways in this process of beginning to get out

62
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,840
of the way and allow

63
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:30,319
what is in a sense the natural processes of the body

64
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:36,319
to do to uh to be free of our in interference or wanting or trying to make something

65
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,639
happen

66
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:47,520
and allowing the breathing to breathe itself

67
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:59,840
and if that's not possible don't worry about it allow that

68
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:13,840
and perhaps as a way of continuing to settle in on the exhale relax the body more fully

69
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,520
wherever in your body your attention lands as you exhale

70
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:27,840
soften and relax

71
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:49,920
the idea of releasing can also be helpful here releasing the place in the body that are

72
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
contracted

73
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:07,279
and then letting letting go of the effort to relax or

74
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:14,880
release and to really just allow what's here

75
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,959
hello and

76
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:28,399
discover what your experience is now

77
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,080
seeing if that discovery that noticing

78
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,880
can be spacious or allowing or

79
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,880
maybe even gentle

80
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:56,480
and noticing that gives room for your experience to be what it is

81
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:05,839
without being involved in it judging it thinking about it analyzing it

82
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:19,839
coming in close so it's the direct experience

83
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,200
the experience as it manifests in the body

84
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,160
the physicality of whatever is happening for you emotions and a lot of thinking

85
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:47,839
discover and make space for the physical way it feels and senses in the body

86
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:04,800
perhaps quieting your thinking so there's more room in attention

87
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:15,839
to discover to feel to sense

88
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,160
and at the center of what

89
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:10,399
is arising appearing is the comparing of the inhales and the

90
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,120
exhales

91
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:26,240
and to allow those experiences to arise in freedom

92
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:36,839
from ourselves our desires our wantings expectations

93
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,480
judgments however the breathing is

94
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:52,399
let it be

95
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:59,200
and whatever your experience is let it be but let it be

96
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,480
in a as clear an awareness as you can

97
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,839
with knowing ah this is how it is

98
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:24,160
and as we go along new experiences will arise things will

99
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:30,240
get strong and loud just keep getting out of the way to

100
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:37,199
allow each thing to be known

101
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,920
just known for what it is

102
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:48,240
in a sense granting freedom to

103
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:56,639
every thing that the mind can know as it's known in

104
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:03,839
the present moment

105
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:21,159
knowing what's happening and allowing it getting out of the way so we're not

106
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:31,840
participating in it just aware of it

107
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:31,440
and then to come to the end of this

108
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,200
sitting the ability to

109
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:46,960
be sensitive and aware in a deep way or

110
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:54,880
sensitive to the deeper what's happening within us that's deeper

111
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:03,840
than the ways we might feel overwhelmed by life or frustrated by life

112
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:15,200
deeper than the contractions of fear the compulsions of desire

113
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,398
the fever of animosity

114
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:31,840
to feel our way deep inside to where there is

115
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:40,559
a kind of space and ease and peace from which flows

116
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:46,799
are good will from which friendliness has a chance

117
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:51,840
simple ordinary kindness

118
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:03,600
these simple ordinary feelings of good will that so easily get

119
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:10,720
eclipsed by all the preoccupations of the mind and

120
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,840
her life

121
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:23,120
and to have some sense some intuition

122
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:33,279
of a place of kindness and good will and

123
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:40,000
care and love compassion

124
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:47,039
that is not an obligation but rather something that also

125
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:55,840
lives in us something also that flows and arises

126
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:05,600
and it's something that's wholesome and good that's beneficial for us

127
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:12,240
to give expression to some of the wholesome aspects of who we

128
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,760
are grow when we give them expression

129
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:25,600
and so at the end of a sitting to give expression to our appreciation

130
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,000
our respect our care for others

131
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,840
by uh by wishing them well

132
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,120
and by wishing that our meditation practice

133
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:50,240
supports us in our care for the world

134
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,960
may it be that this practice we've done today

135
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:07,518
may it be for the welfare and happiness and support of all beings everywhere

136
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,159
may all beings be happy

137
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,840
may all beings be safe

138
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:26,080
may all beings be peaceful

139
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:33,840
and may all beings everywhere be free

140
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:48,059
[Music]

141
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:02,880
to continue this topic of refuge refuge is uh

142
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:09,120
arises in us when we understand that there is

143
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:16,640
a profound support for our lives that there is a way of being

144
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,760
that provides a sense of safety that provides a sense of

145
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:28,159
purpose a direction and orientation for our lives when we understand that some understand

146
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:34,320
that understandings that some kind of clear insight that um that we have

147
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:40,320
this is can be this basis or the support for how we live our lives

148
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:47,679
so refuge is considered to be really valuable in buddhism and as i've been saying that

149
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:53,679
in the early buddhism and teachings of the buddha there are different things that are highlighted as

150
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:59,919
worthy refuge and certainly what we most commonly know about is the buddha

151
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:05,200
dharma the sangha yesterday i talked about having oneself

152
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:13,279
as a refuge and today talk about action the activities

153
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:18,320
the buddha also said that we have our actions as our refuge

154
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,760
so it's not just a matter of you know passively allowing and

155
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:30,320
being present and and being the recipient of some deep inner

156
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,960
or outer kind of support for us and then trusting that we don't have to

157
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:43,440
do anything dharma practice is an active practice there is there is doing

158
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:50,960
that's part of it but hopefully what we're doing is learning how to do how to act in ways that are wise and

159
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:58,720
healthy and nourishing and that are free of strain

160
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:06,799
obligation pushing being busy and free of kind of conceit or self

161
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:12,240
kind of consciousness that is the self-conscious kind of

162
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:17,599
self-consciousness is that's equivalent of being self-preoccupied

163
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:23,200
and so action is very important in the teachings of the buddha so much so

164
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:30,800
that a few different locations uh the buddha is referred to in this ancient text as a teacher of

165
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:36,960
action and um the i guess there were people at the time of

166
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:43,200
the buddha teacher spiritual teachers at his time who felt that actions were inconsequential

167
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,800
that no matter what you did it didn't really have any long-term benefit or effect or

168
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:56,158
repercussions and some people interpret that to be that you can just do whatever you wish it

169
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:03,760
doesn't matter how immoral and ethical it is it doesn't matter other teachers at the time of the buddha

170
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:11,200
said nothing matters so you shouldn't do anything actually not doing nothing just non-doing radical non-doing

171
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:18,880
is the way forward the buddha had a teaching that some actions are

172
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:26,640
worth doing and some are not worth doing and over and over again you see in his teaching sometimes very emphatically

173
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:34,800
when people ask them a question like do you believe in restraint do you believe in

174
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:41,200
non-action do you believe in this or that he would answer the question

175
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:50,400
by saying i teach the doing of what is wholesome

176
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,079
and the not doing of what is not wholesome so in terms of restraint i teach the

177
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:01,760
teachings of restraint then it's a wholesome restraint not the restraint that is an unwholesome

178
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:07,440
restraint do you teach non-doing i teach the

179
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:14,320
non-doing of what is unwholesome but not the non-doing of what is wholesome

180
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:20,560
do you teach you know that we should always do x

181
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:26,800
he says no i teach you should always do x that is wholesome but you should avoid

182
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:33,599
that which is unwholesome or unskillful and i like to use the word helpful or unhelpful or healthy and

183
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:39,680
not healthy for this kind of distinction the puteri makes repeatedly between the wholesome and the

184
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:49,119
unwholesome and and when we do wholesome things in a wholesome way

185
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:57,599
when we do the beautiful things in a beautiful way when we do

186
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:04,800
ethical things in a way that doesn't harm ourselves or harm others so that doing an ethical

187
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,838
thing is actually a nourishing thing beneficial

188
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:17,440
that that is how actions can be our refuge now one of the actions that puts

189
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:24,240
is emphasized in in buddhism is the action of straight strong

190
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:31,040
simple mindfulness something that i call i consider synonymous with awareness to be

191
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:36,160
consciously lucidly aware of our experience

192
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:41,359
and mindfulness has a quality whatever almost all ways that mindfulness is

193
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:47,040
taught that it is an awareness and knowing a recognition of what's happening

194
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:52,160
that is not interfering with what's happening that is allowing each thing to be seen

195
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,200
clearly without be us being entangled with it without being

196
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:04,720
caught in compulsions of desires or aversion for or against it so that one of the

197
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:09,760
synonyms of mindfulness or close synonyms or characteristics of mindfulness

198
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,800
is letting things be just letting things be

199
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:21,040
and so some people like to talk about a pause even a sacred pause of mindfulness

200
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:26,640
that we don't kind of hurtle into the future into the next

201
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,760
moment in a speeding along

202
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:37,760
going from one desire to the other reaching out doing uh being so busy that we the mind

203
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:44,000
becomes claustrophobic or spinning or you know it's hard to notice um

204
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,920
even what we're doing because we're we we do we act we talk even before we know what we're going to

205
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,920
say or do and it can feel great that way because it can feel like we're free just to say

206
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,599
whatever we want we're free just to do whatever we want and so there's kind of no limitations no

207
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:07,040
frustration but in buddhist language that's not real freedom

208
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:12,160
and so by pausing from the incessant activities of the mind the excessive

209
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:18,000
activities that we do to pause for a moment provisionally so

210
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:25,200
we really see what's happening here and let things be and really have a clear deep

211
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:32,079
or full way of recognizing that what i'm thinking what i'm about to

212
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:39,760
say what i'm about to do is not really so wise is not really so

213
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:48,640
healthy is not really so wholesome or skillful helpful

214
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:55,040
maybe i could not do it or we're sensitive enough to feel and

215
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:03,599
know oh this is a wholesome thing this is beneficial this is nourishing so the mindfulness

216
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,200
practice has a passivity to it if we're allowed to use that word

217
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:15,760
of making space and allowing and learning to feel what's moving through us

218
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:24,160
and then as we live our lives when we have to act that uh then we're informed by a clear

219
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:31,839
understanding of what is wholesome and unwholesome and the sacred pause of mindfulness the

220
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:37,440
space that we give to know a tear it gives us the opportunity

221
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:44,240
to choose between those two the sacred choice and that buddhist

222
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:52,319
practice is definitely invo involves a degree of living a life of choice

223
00:40:52,319 --> 00:41:00,160
not because we're always busy and always having to analyze and figure out but because we are deeply in touch and

224
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:06,480
feel and sense and connected to ourselves to recognize what is wholesome and

225
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,599
unwholesome what is helpful and not helpful healthy and not healthy

226
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:18,480
and it becomes easier and easier more natural and easeful to go in the direction of

227
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:24,640
health to go in the direction of the wholesome that which is nourishing for us

228
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:31,760
it's almost like with time it's like a ball let loose on a hill will roll

229
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:37,920
downhill over time we will keep moving into what's wholesome

230
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:46,240
because that's what our heart our inner system that's the directionality that's the way it's leaning so it's not like being

231
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,599
really busy and making all these choices all the time but it's placing us and

232
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:58,000
putting us in the place of cho where choice can happen and sometimes we make a conscious choice

233
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,800
and sometimes we can feel the wholesomeness within us is choosing this is what's good this is

234
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,880
what's helpful and and that becomes our refuge

235
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:19,280
because when we do what's wholesome what is uh kind of synonyms in buddhism

236
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,640
for wholesome is what's beautiful another synonym is the dharma

237
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:31,119
what is dharmic and the the word dharma here in this context means that which if you look in the

238
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:36,400
dictionaries english diction english poly dictionaries the english definition is what is

239
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:42,319
morally good and uh what has what is connected to a good

240
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:48,079
quality a good way of inner way of being a goodness to it

241
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:54,400
and so to when we choose that when we go in that

242
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,760
direction of the good of the of the healthy of the beautiful

243
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:06,319
that has a that supports us that leads us ten leads us to a grow

244
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:11,440
inner growth of what's healthy and wholesome it creates conditions that support the

245
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,560
best in us to come forward and to live it creates conditions for discovering

246
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:21,599
greater and greater freedom and peace and love and compassion and it

247
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:27,839
tends to support uh reciprocity reproductive

248
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:35,040
okay i can't say it today a way in which uh the world reciprocates

249
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:40,400
and uh the um not that automatically or absolutely

250
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:46,240
reciprocates but the world tends to respond to wholesomeness and goodness

251
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:51,440
with the same we become the world becomes more and more of a refuge in a

252
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,880
place of goodness for us when we enter the world in that way

253
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:02,640
so the buddha said our actions are our refuge that they're so important to pay

254
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,839
attention to and as i said the buddha was in addition to being a

255
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:13,040
teacher of freedom he was a teacher of action and for the

256
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:18,720
buddha those two are closely connected that the actions which are wholesome and

257
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:26,720
nourishing are also the ones that create that lead us to the freedom that he was talking about

258
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:34,640
that support it so we have actions as our refuge as well

259
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:41,920
so one of the deep principles of buddhism early buddhism is

260
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:50,000
be a caretaker of your actions be a carer a lover of your actions in

261
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,119
the sense that if you really love something you want to do it the best possible way

262
00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:02,400
and so you might consider for these next

263
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:09,839
24 hours how is it that action how do you know how do you recognize how

264
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:15,359
actions your behavior what you do can be a refuge for you a support for

265
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:21,440
you a protection for you a guide for you a place of insight and

266
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:28,960
deep understanding you have actions as your refuge

267
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,838
thank you
