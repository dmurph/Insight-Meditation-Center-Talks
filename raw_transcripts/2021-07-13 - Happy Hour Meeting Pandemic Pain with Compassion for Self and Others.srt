49
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:10,479
you are in this moment as part of the sangha practicing together

50
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:18,240
so the theme for today's practice as i was um referring to earlier

51
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:25,840
as marie christine was saying how challenging it is right now uh with the delta variant

52
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:32,960
in sydney australia with the lockdown ah the theme for today's practice

53
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:39,520
is is compassion for compassion for how difficult this

54
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:47,039
year has been for ourselves for people we care about

55
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:55,919
for all beings everywhere to acknowledge that to um note

56
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:02,400
to note the pain to note the ouch with compassion bringing

57
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,199
care warmth love to hold

58
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,599
the pain the suffering for ourselves and for our loved ones for all beings

59
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:22,639
on this planet for this year so

60
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,000
so i'll say a couple of words about the practice of compassion and how we're going to

61
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:36,479
do it tonight so as you may know and as a refresher when meta when loving

62
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:43,680
kindness when friendliness good will meets pain holds

63
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:50,879
when it meets sorrow when it meets suffering it expresses itself as compassion

64
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:57,199
so meta plus suffering equals compassion another way

65
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:05,840
that has been said is that compassion is the love child of suffering and meta

66
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,680
and the practice of compassion isn't one that will make us depressed or more

67
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:20,160
morose but it lifts the heart because we bring care we bring love we bring affection

68
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:27,039
warmth to the pain to the difficulty so it's a soothing self

69
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:35,919
practice of compassion as a healing as a healing venture and the way we will

70
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:43,120
do it together tonight is first we will bring up someone we care about who's had a tough

71
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,120
time in this past year and the pandemic and practice meta for them

72
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,800
and then turn to ourselves because often we don't see our own suffering and pain

73
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,959
sometimes we do sometimes we don't and what if we treated ourselves

74
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:08,240
as our own best friend the same way that we see our good friend and

75
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,519
hold them with care compassion hold ourselves with the same compassion

76
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:19,440
and care and then we turn it outwards for all beings for all human beings and then

77
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,200
for all beings in our connection in our connection in

78
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:32,399
this world we're we've all been going through this together through this challenging year with

79
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,560
different challenges for everyone different levels different amounts it's not a time to compare to

80
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:45,200
say oh better or worse we're going to bow to comparison say thank you comparison you're not

81
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,120
needed right now we're just going to tune into the challenge

82
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:59,440
and with compassion and care without comparing and judging so so with that

83
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:08,240
i'd like to invite this to settle to settle and arrive in our seat

84
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:18,800
to start right here right now

85
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,959
landing in our bodies and as always we start this practice together

86
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:32,399
with some minutes of settling arriving with mindfulness

87
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:42,480
with gathering and collecting our hearts and minds before we turn to mental and compassion

88
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,040
so landing in the body

89
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,399
reading the feet sit bones

90
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:04,880
or hands our spine

91
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,640
our face

92
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:18,639
our breath moving through this body

93
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,399
the breath moving

94
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,839
in breath and that breath

95
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,920
calming soothing

96
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:46,399
settling the heart with each out breath

97
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,160
settling the body with each out breath

98
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:08,480
in fact for the next few breaths let's

99
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:18,000
elongate the out breath a little bit to release to relax to really settle

100
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:31,759
ah maybe even vocalizing it's okay

101
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,839
ah

102
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,600
one more time localizing together

103
00:12:51,200 --> 00:13:00,160
ah in your own time in rhythm

104
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:10,800
letting a few breaths be slower than usual the outer breath specially elongated

105
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
settled

106
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,360
just settling and landing

107
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,040
with the soothing calming nourishing

108
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,839
breath

109
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:31,199
as if the breath is an expression of meta of care compassion

110
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:37,600
nourishing wrapping us enlivening us

111
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,079
wrapping us as if we're the blanket of goodness

112
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:59,839
soothing calming

113
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,839
and now i'd like to invite you

114
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,079
if you would bring to mind

115
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:39,920
a dear friend a good friend maybe a relative a benefactor

116
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:51,839
someone for whom your care your friendliness comes easily

117
00:16:52,079 --> 00:17:04,640
could be someone you know well or someone you don't know that well it's okay

118
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:11,280
as long as your care flows with ease and there isn't too much complication in

119
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:18,000
your relationship bringing this being to mind and it could

120
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,839
also be a child or a pet as always

121
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,880
this person this being imagining them

122
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:38,240
and how challenging this past year has been for them in different ways

123
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:47,360
bringing their image their felt sense near and dear to your heart

124
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,039
as if they were sitting with you

125
00:17:53,919 --> 00:18:01,840
acknowledging this has been a hard year

126
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,080
this has been a hard year

127
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:19,600
as you acknowledge the difficulty the challenge for them some ways you may know some of which you

128
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,480
may not know

129
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,600
as if you were wrapping them

130
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:43,840
the blanket of goodwill the same way one would cuddle a little baby

131
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,840
a blanket of care of affection

132
00:18:52,640 --> 00:19:00,799
or if another image comes up for you that signifies your care

133
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,320
your compassion your desire to soothe

134
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,840
to calm to care

135
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:25,840
for this being

136
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,720
being in touch with the challenge with the ouch

137
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:40,640
of the sorrow with the heaviness and yet

138
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:49,440

[Music]

250
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:20,400
thank you all thank you for the grace of your practice

251
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:30,880
compassion compassion for ourselves for others for all beings

252
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:38,160
this difficult year of the pandemic all the pain and sorrow

253
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:47,920
so we have time we have space for reflections

254
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:54,400
for what you discovered what you noticed to share it with sangha for your own

255
00:45:54,400 --> 00:46:01,520
benefit and the benefit of others or questions

256
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:06,720
all welcome you can type them in chat if you wish

257
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:12,400
if they're typed just to me i will only read the reflection not your name

258
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:19,760
if it's typed to everyone i'll read your name also you can also raise your hand your zoom

259
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,000
hand your physical hand i may not see

260
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:29,839
and uh would love to hear from you

261
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:37,040
one reflection question coming in do you have suggestions for how to

262
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:42,560
address sleepiness i seem today like i was it seemed today

263
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:49,520
like i was practicing napping no worries maybe you're tired

264
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:57,359
maybe you're sleep deprived if that is the case then maybe that needs self-care needs to be

265
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:03,599
primary and if that's not the case so if you're sleep-deprived then

266
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:09,440
it's okay it's all right trust that this practice worked in ways

267
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:14,480
that were needed for you as self-care as self-compassion but

268
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:21,920
sometimes napping could be an avoidance we don't want to go to compassion place it's too big so if

269
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:30,559
you're not sleep deprived then then many things you can do

270
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:36,720
one is to open your eyes bring more energy in the visual field just not staring at

271
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:41,920
anything in particular but kind of diffuse eyes another

272
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:47,359
option is to breathe a little more deeply

273
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:52,960
just to bring up the invigoration of the breath another one is to sit up a little

274
00:47:52,960 --> 00:48:00,240
straighter another one is to stand do standing meditation don't do sitting

275
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:06,800
so all of these are options that you can do and please play around

276
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:14,240
with them another reflection lots of tears lots of physical rocking grateful for

277
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:19,440
your voice inviting me back again and again thank you for that

278
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:25,040
reflection yeah can be quite quite overwhelming

279
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:31,440
taking it all in reflection on youtube pearl says i realize that i shy away

280
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,640
from how i relate with suffering as it seems enormous

281
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:44,640
i wonder how to transform that so maybe

282
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,920
start with a small you know you don't want to take the hundred pound weight

283
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:56,880
suffering and and your question i'm not sure whether this and please feel free to

284
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:02,880
expand if it came up this enormity of suffering came up when you

285
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:09,280
turned it toward the whole world or was it also the same for you when you were doing it with your friend

286
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,960
um and yourself i'm going to assume room maybe it came up when you were meeting

287
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:20,720
the suffering of the whole world and in that case the thing to do is to

288
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:28,720
again acknowledge that it is enormous as i was saying it's an aspiration it's not that we're

289
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:36,079
going to fix it all but it's an aspiration it's it's as if we're praying as if we're

290
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:42,000
putting our our wishes our compassion putting it on the altar of humanity as

291
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,440
an offering so that's the invitation

292
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:54,079
to work with it that way and if you want to type more on youtube there's a 30 second delay but but i can

293
00:49:54,079 --> 00:50:00,960
see what might come back one more reflection i felt waves of

294
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:09,200
validation compassion and peace for a recent difficulty oh lovely thank you for sharing that

295
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:16,400
one more reflection here is a very very sweet meditation

296
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:26,480
glad it was supported for you yeah and abraham please

297
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:33,680
thank you um i you're so very emotional

298
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:40,559
and it washes over me and sometimes it distracts me

299
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:46,640
i know i'm also very emotional but i sometimes have a hard time coming

300
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:52,960
to meet you and so what i found was that i repeated the phrase that you used

301
00:50:52,960 --> 00:51:01,040
for myself and that way i make it for myself and and uh it was like i was embodying

302
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:06,319
what your cue was and and that i found was was much better

303
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:13,119
so i don't know if anybody else is like that but that was what worked for me yeah great

304
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:20,720
