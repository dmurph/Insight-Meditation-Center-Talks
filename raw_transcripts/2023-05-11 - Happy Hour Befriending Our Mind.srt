1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:07,919
so hi everyone hello and welcome to happy hour lovely to see you to be with you in this

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:15,240
moment in time whatever your time zone might be so for the theme for today I'd like to

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:23,460
invite us to explore um befriending our mind befriending our mind and

4
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:30,560
and when I say our mind it's a mind Dash heart

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,300
it's um you know befriending ourselves befriending our mind befriending our

6
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,579
mind heart the word chitta from Pali we often translate it just to mind but it's

7
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:47,820
really mind heart to befriend ourselves this practice of befriending ourselves

8
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,180
and in some ways we can think of

9
00:00:53,180 --> 00:01:00,600
this practice as training ourselves in befriending and

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:07,200
befriending our minds befriending ourselves befriending others it's a practice of befriending and especially

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,340
when we bring the practice of insight or vipassana which is mindfulness

12
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,880
is a way of seeing seeing our thoughts seeing or what's arising in our mind in

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,700
our body in our heart and befriending befriending

14
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,159
so the whole of this practice perhaps could be summarized as befriending our

15
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,860
minds befriending our hearts befriending ourselves and others um

16
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:44,579
and in order to befriend in order to notice what's happening there needs to

17
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:52,500
be at first some stability in our attention in our awareness there

18
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:58,920
needs to be some stability to even know to even notice what is

19
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,380
going on to notice if there are thoughts that are

20
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:10,039
not helpful to notice if there are thoughts that are

21
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:15,260
downright judgmental and berating

22
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:21,120
and don't believe them instead of just believing them and going with them

23
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:29,280
so there's some stability in our awareness that is needed in order

24
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,739
to befriend in order to have enough wisdom enough

25
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:40,640
know how but oh yeah this is happening this is not really helpful

26
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:47,040
so with that the invitation for tonight's prac today's practice whatever

27
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:55,980
your time zone is is to start with um building with start with stabilizing

28
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,080
with the breath in the body the breath in the framework

29
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,739
of the body and then turning opening to this process

30
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:13,080
of befriending befriending ourselves befriending what it rises so that's what

31
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,780
we'll be doing so with that let's uh

32
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,239
let's begin let's arriving if you need to move or

33
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,239
shift so that you are comfortable

34
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:35,180
arriving in this moment in time arriving

35
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,860
arriving in this party

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,099
not letting there be sensitive presence stability with the breath

37
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,940
awareness connecting with just this in-breath

38
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:13,519
intending to be with this in-breath the entirety of Libra

39
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:20,400
and then intending to know to feel feel the entirety of

40
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,460
this out breath then reconnecting again with the renewed

41
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:32,240
intention through this ingra feel the whole thing

42
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:40,520
connect with the intention to fear the entire out breath

43
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:58,340
retraining retraining our minds to pay attention

44
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:03,500
it doesn't take so much effort

45
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:12,740
we will notice if we gently reconnect with this intention

46
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:19,620
for just this in-breath it's a light reconnection steady but

47
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,919
light

48
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:32,479
steady but light reconnection with intention

49
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,680
okay

50
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:05,940
reconnecting gently With Our intention to feel the entire in-breath the entire

51
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:11,120
out breath at the beginning of each

52
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:21,120
not heavy doesn't have to last very long this intention

53
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:28,099
it's gentle a persistent

54
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,340
foreign

55
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:48,120
if we notice that the mind is resting on a thought or a memory it's okay

56
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:56,060
let there be no judgment no berating but gladness

57
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:04,160
for the moment of awareness celebrating delighting the moment of

58
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,800
reconnecting with intention you have a choice you can berate yourself you've been gone where you can

59
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:18,620
delight at your path equal choose what's helpful

60
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,279
just the same breath Justice our breath

61
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,660
foreign

62
00:10:27,019 --> 00:10:32,160
calming nourishing knowing it

63
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,100
as if it's a friend a breath as a friend

64
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,560
foreign

65
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,820
our awareness or attention

66
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,639
with knowing the breath the feeling of the breath in the body

67
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:04,100
feeling this in-breath feeling this out breath the entirety of it

68
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:14,839
let this fear of awareness become a little wider including the body

69
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,639
including sounds not the sensations of the breath still

70
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:26,540
be the anchor

71
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:43,339
but let the sphere of awareness be wider more spacious

72
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:57,180
including thoughts thoughts can arise and pass not to be entangled in them

73
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:04,760
but to recognize them and can we be friendly can we be friendly

74
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,440
towards sounds towards Sensations in the body

75
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:16,920
towards thoughts befriending our mind and heart and befriending being friendly doesn't

76
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:24,380
mean that we entertain them indulge in them but it means that if

77
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:30,899
they are not supportive and entanglement and thinking while

78
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:38,540
meditating is not supportive we release

79
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:45,680
we don't believe them if there are doubts you can do this

80
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:53,660
you're confused or you're bad or whatever judgment it might be

81
00:15:53,760 --> 00:16:00,600
thoughts of the past and future thank you thoughts you're trying to be

82
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:08,880
supportive and helpful to protect me it can release you can let go it's okay

83
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:16,459
it's really okay dear thought the way you would relate to a friend

84
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:24,839
befriending our thoughts befriending our mind befriending our body our heart

85
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:30,740
so again let the breath in the body be the anger

86
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,980
it's fear of friendly awareness be wider

87
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,980
thank you

88
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,940
sitting studying the awareness

89
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:42,019
with the breath

90
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:03,440
the wide sphere of friendliness with whatever arises

91
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,559
thank you

92
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:39,860
our heart relax get our heart relax

93
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:44,899
into friendliness for ourselves

94
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,700
Good Will kindness and compassion if needed

95
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:03,240
if it's hard right now to soften

96
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:10,039
solve it into friendliness care

97
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,240
thank you

98
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:51,059
foreign

99
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:54,559
what needs to be held what needs to be held with friendliness with kindness

100
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:01,820
with compassion in this sphere of awareness right now

101
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,419
maybe just an acknowledgment that this is hard

102
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:24,080
befriending our mind befriending ourselves

103
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:14,960
and as we bring this sit to a close together

104
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:23,700
consider what was one way that you explored befriending your mind

105
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,658
in this practice

106
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:36,539
maybe it was not believing judgmental thought not getting entangled maybe having more

107
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:43,919
kindness compassion for yourself maybe trying to steady

108
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,380
your awareness with the breath or something else

109
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:56,580
acknowledging appreciating your own goodness your own wholeheartedness in

110
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:00,260
this practice in this exploration

111
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:10,400
together sharing this goodness the planting of these seeds

112
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:16,440
not just to ourselves for our own Awakening for our own well-being but to

113
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:23,399
all beings everywhere may my goodness may my

114
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:30,600
cultivation and friendliness stability may you serve

115
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:36,779
be of service in ways I can't fathom all beings everywhere

116
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:42,980
may all beings be well may all beings be free including myself

117
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,779
thanks everyone thank you for your practice

118
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:10,799
so the theme we explored together was the theme of befriending befriending

119
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:16,620
our minds befriending our minds our hearts ourselves

120
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:25,260
and first we established some stability of the mind

121
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:31,919
of attention with the breath in the body and I invited you to try to

122
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:37,140
connect with your intention at the beginning of each in-breath beginning of

123
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:45,240
each out breath because that can be very helpful helpful approach to steady the attention steady

124
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:51,360
the awareness especially if you find your minds going every which way that to reconnection with intention can be

125
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,580
helpful and then we opened the sphere of

126
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:03,179
awareness to kindness Goodwill friendliness relaxing into it

127
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:09,899
wherever it was needed the thought space heart space body space

128
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:17,039
so as we turn the invitation as we turn to practicing

129
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:24,659
in small groups and exploring the Dharma together the invitation is at the end I asked you

130
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:29,720
what was one way what was one way that you [Music] um

131
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:37,320
explored what was one way where you befriended was helpful today

132
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:42,480
to befriend your mind one way so

133
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,840
if you'd like when we come into into small groups together again showing up

134
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:54,600
the first thing is really showing up with befriending befriending yourself befriending befriending each other

135
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:00,000
befriending yourself befriending each other the space of friendliness space of

136
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,779
kindness maybe you don't say anything maybe you just show up with silence but sense of friendliness

137
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:12,299
foreign [Music] comes to speak if you want to say

138
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:17,820
something about your practice what you discovered today about one way to

139
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:24,659
befriend your mind one way to befriend your mind you're welcome to share that one nugget and then the next person and

140
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:32,039
then the next person and please feel free to share from your own experience but not asking questions not

141
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:37,679
directing the conversation just just show up either with silence or what you

142
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:45,360
want to share just a nugget make sure everybody has the chance to speak it will come to you again if you share one

143
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:54,200
nugget so you'll go around and round a few times and let's go in alphabetical order

144
00:32:54,200 --> 00:33:00,539
according to first name and again be kind befriending your mind and if your

145
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:06,360
mind in the middle of talking says you're talking too much okay thank you

146
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:13,260

147
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:18,779

148
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:25,919
breakout rooms it'll take me a quick moment okay and

149
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:31,279

153
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:58,140
um your reflection at the end of the guided meditation from discussing with one

158
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:31,638
why did you discover befriending your mind so many tools

159
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:40,138

annoyed yay oh that is so much more skillful that is so great Bill humor is

so it's terrific I see the hearts showing up in Zoom this is so great so

162
00:34:52,679 --> 00:35:00,180
happy for you build it this is a transformation really this is a huge transformation not to be annoyed but to

163
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:07,619
be amused okay here here goes this mind and not giving it so much power the

164
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:13,800
um that not getting not giving being annoyed this aversion being you know it

165
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:19,020
is a type of evolution not giving it power and the mindset okay being amused

166
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:24,480
it's much easier to actually steady it so much easier to study when we don't

167
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:35,540
get annoyed we get amused delighted for your practice build this is exciting great I see Fred and Barbara

168
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:42,599
hi Nikki thank you hi um I just found your suggestion to

169
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:48,480
focus on the positive to to note that it's that I'm happy to return to the

170
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:55,079
breath I found that really helpful and and as I was saying in our smaller group

171
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:03,320
maybe it's just because I eliminated by half or more all the

172
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:09,780
well by 100 I guess if I just focused on glad to be here

173
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:16,320
um all of that muted not quite articulated articulated

174
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:22,140
negative impulse around oh I've drifted off again you know and I mean how many

175
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:27,660
times can that negative pulse be there in the course of 30 minutes just uh so

176
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:36,000
much and to to then experience the positive um was really booing and I was able to

177
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,720
more happily be present in in the very simple breath

178
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:52,500
so thank you thank you Fred I am dancing with joy as you're sharing your Insight

179
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:58,440
um I'm truly dancing with joy um this is a significant Insight what

180
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,599
you just discovered in your own practice and and

181
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:10,320
um it's it's it's easy to lean into it's it's not it's natural it's natural

182
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:16,079
unfortunately right as as humans for us to lean into ah I wondered again oh mine

183
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:22,980
wandered again oh you know that ah that ouch instead of well we have a choice we can lean into that or we can we can lean

184
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:28,980
into yay wow I'm aware I I'm awake I'm gonna learn this moment you know it's

185
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:35,040
it's 50 50 just as you pointed out right it's 50 50 so and when we lean into the

186
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:43,560
then it just kind of sags the energy and I can't do this but when we lean into the celebration it it completely shifts

187
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:49,320
our practice it just completely shifts so so I'm both dancing with joy for you

188
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:54,839
and for you having articulated it so powerfully for the community

189
00:37:54,839 --> 00:38:01,560
um that that yes when we lean into that so thank you Fred that's just lovely yay

190
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,040
thanks

191
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:14,339
so and send me a note assume you know that your suggestion is practiced by

192
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:19,380
therapists we use a form of therapy called cognitive emotional therapy I'm

193
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:24,900
not surprised Claire there are so many practices from the cognitive emotional

194
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:30,960
therapy which are taken from Buddhism and you know this is all we're interweaving intermission I didn't know

195
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,599
this was used there but hey I'm a Buddhist so I'm just claiming uh but who

196
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:42,359
knows maybe maybe the this has been infused in into the Dharma teachers

197
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:47,460
lingo from cognitive emotional therapy I don't know it's all good it's all wisdom

198
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:53,400
it's all wisdom that that works Christine please

199
