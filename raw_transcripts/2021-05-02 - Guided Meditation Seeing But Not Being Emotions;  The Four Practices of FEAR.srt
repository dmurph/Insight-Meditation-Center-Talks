1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:07,440
warm greetings from redwood city in imc and

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,920
and delights me to be able to spread these greetings to around the globe to people so many

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,680
different places so welcome everyone

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,039
and now start with the meditation and i want to mention first that one of

5
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,720
the advantages that can come from sitting meditating a lot

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:38,000
you know meaning perhaps meditating every day day in and day out through whatever

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,960
ups and downs that happen in our lives just there's a constant thread the constancy through it all kind of like a

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,440
ballast perhaps of a boat that keeps everything balanced is meditation just kind of

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:58,559
that's what we're doing and no question about it and we're literally learned to be with

10
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:06,640
be mindful of meditate with whatever circumstance of our life that our life might have and slowly

11
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,560
as we are meditating like this regularly through all the ups and downs

12
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,600
there's a very interesting shift that can happen and that is that instead of

13
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:26,320
at being identified with whatever mood or emotional state that we have

14
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:33,600
for example to identify with it is to is to say you know i'm afraid or i'm angry

15
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,000
or i'm happy and i've had all those and then not only have i had them and

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,759
identified myself with it but uh various times have thought i'll always be this way

17
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:53,920
i'll always be afraid i'll always be angry and there were once in my life where i thought oh wow i haven't made i'll always be happy

18
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:01,920
and that didn't last long but i remember having it and uh the um so this identifying like

19
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,360
so being i'm afraid at some point that shifts

20
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,040
and with the regularity of meditation sitting in stability of meditation just sitting there day in and day out

21
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,360
and just kind of watching it all come through at some point instead of identifying

22
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,360
with these emotions and moods we recognize we have these states

23
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:32,160
so oh there is fear fear is here my old friend fear has returned there is

24
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,280
here is fear or anger is here or

25
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:44,959
happiness is here or sadness is here there is sadness there is joy

26
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:52,480
and and there can be a huge difference between being somehow identified defined by the mood

27
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:59,840
and state somehow it casts it says something about who we are

28
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,480
versus not making it as a definition of who we are our identity or

29
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,319
even our worth maybe it just it's a phenomenon it's here it's

30
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,319
happening to me it's here and and now and that gives a whole different possibility of relating

31
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,400
it to a different way we can then relate to it i think a little bit more respectfully

32
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:31,440
that's a little hard to do when we're kind of glued to it or enmeshed in it you can kind of step back

33
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,159
away from it and say oh i see you my dear friend i know you're there and i'll spend some

34
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,519
time breathing with you or accompanying you or you're welcome to accompany me

35
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:49,440
as i as i ride then inhales and exhales

36
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:57,840
and and we can start to study it or see it we can befriend

37
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:05,120
our emotions we can explore them we can

38
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,680
allow them in a certain kind of way because they're not us we're not in danger of being influenced

39
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,600
by them and saying and doing things that they were caught in their grip

40
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:28,320
and maybe we can even release them and they're releasable because they're not us so

41
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,639
as we do this meditation maybe something will come through maybe not

42
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:43,199
some emotion that's common for you and maybe you'll try out viewing it as

43
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:51,440
there's the emotion there it is it's present as opposed to i am this way

44
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,840
so taking a comfortable alert posture

45
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,879
and gently closing your eyes

46
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,520
and taking uh just a few moments now to feel your body here

47
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:23,280
if you felt your body from the inside out what stands out as being predominant

48
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,360
sensations feelings in your body

49
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:39,919
and then to take a few long deep breaths maybe loving breaths

50
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,840
tender breaths maybe three quarters full

51
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:54,479
and then a lot maybe longer than the inhale long slow exhale

52
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:07,840
maybe three quarters complete the exhale not so far that it's a strain

53
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and it's a little ritual of

54
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:25,680
having your body and mind connect together here they are partners in being present

55
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:32,240
in the here and now taking these deep breaths

56
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,759
and then letting your breathings return to normal

57
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,440
and also to help you arrive here and be present it can be helpful to relax different

58
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:57,360
parts of the body we might relax the muscles of the face

59
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,840
soften around the forehead and the temple

60
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:17,840
letting the eyes rest in their sockets

61
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:31,840
perhaps softening relaxing the shoulders

62
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,639
perhaps adjusting the position of your hands to make it a little easier for the

63
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:45,840
shoulders to relax

64
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:13,840
and then to soften the chest

65
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:27,840
and soften the belly

66
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,959
and then become aware of the rhythm the natural rhythm of your body

67
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:55,839
breathing in and breathing out

68
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:06,160
the rhythm of expansion of the torso as you inhale

69
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,000
the contraction of the torso as you

70
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,839
exhale

71
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:57,200
taking a few moments to feel whatever stillness or quiet there is

72
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,880
here in your body and mind

73
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:09,600
even if you're agitated maybe there is still somewhere in the corner of your being

74
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:19,839
some quiet and stillness

75
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:29,920
and maybe you can breathe with that sit quietly and still

76
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:40,480
and if as you're sitting here something occurs in emotion or mood

77
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,640
or sensations of your body comfort and discomfort

78
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:54,160
or even thoughts perhaps rather than identifying with

79
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:01,839
them and see them as visitors

80
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:12,800
there is here now there's this emotion for now there's this since these

81
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:20,639
sensations for now these thoughts these visitors

82
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,839
that soon enough will change and not be here

83
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:40,320
but the breathing remains always the breathing

84
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:48,480
breathing in and breathing out a kind of constancy

85
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:57,839
running through all things

86
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,840
so

87
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,399
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

88
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:57,840
perhaps to appreciate that when you're sitting

89
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:06,399
with some stillness and meditation your posture is not changing so much

90
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:11,760
that whatever emotion or mood that you have that comes through

91
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:21,440
is not being expressed in your posture in your body it's allowed to be there

92
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:27,760
but it doesn't we're not engaged or involved with it

93
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,720
with our body the body just sits upright and still

94
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,799
there's a stability that can arise

95
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:46,320
that's able to stay stable regardless of what we're feeling

96
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:54,559
and it's from such a stability where we're not identified with our emotions

97
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,240
involved with our feelings

98
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:11,840
that all the different flavors of kindness and goodwill and care

99
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:18,639
can flow and there can be a stability

100
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:28,559
in which we turn our kind gaze out into the world

101
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:40,559
we look upon the world kindly we look upon the world in a friendly way

102
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:53,919
we look upon the world with appreciation at the wonder in the beauty

103
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:58,158
and the preciousness of all life

104
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:10,720
from our stability we can look upon the world with care

105
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:24,158
with good will that's wishing for the welfare and happiness of all

106
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:31,599
beings maybe even having a vision

107
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:42,320
of how people would be and how beings would be if they were safe and free and happy

108
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:55,760
and to wish people well to wish life on this planet well

109
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:05,760
is a form of generosity and respect and love to wish the best for all beings

110
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:16,880
may we as we end this sitting gaze upon the world beyond our meditation

111
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:23,440
with well-wishing may all beings

112
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:30,640
be happy may all beings be

113
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:38,240
safe may all beings

114
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:46,800
be peaceful and may all beings everywhere

115
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:59,839
be free

116
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:07,799
[Music]

117
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:27,839
do

118
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:17,119
so good day and

119
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:26,960
welcome to this dharma talk and today i would like to talk about

120
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,079
fear and part of the motivation to talk about it

121
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:38,960
is that it's a very common state for many people for everyone's some point or

122
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,800
other and also because um i'm finishing up a

123
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:52,880
year-long program that i'm co-teaching which in experimental is kind of like an experimental program that just

124
00:37:52,880 --> 00:38:00,560
that will probably offer some more in the future some point that's called a path of fearlessness

125
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:08,079
where we spent uh seven months or so looking at fear and considering it practicing with it and it

126
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:15,760
comes to a conclusion this week and so it's this bringing this topic for this program to a conclusion

127
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:22,160
uh has it on my mind and it's what i so this is what i have to talk about

128
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:27,839
today and

129
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:36,160
so one thing to it's very important to

130
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:46,320
i'll say it this way that that as for people who meditate

131
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:52,320
regularly and uh really familiar with their

132
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,359
of meditating being present for experience and they're familiar with themselves so that

133
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:03,280
all kinds of things their life comes along when they meditate so

134
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,320
when they're upset they sit down to meditate and they feel the upsetness when they're afraid they sit down to

135
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:14,000
meditate and their fears there when they're angry they sit down they get to experience the anger when they're

136
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,560
happy or joyful or peaceful or calm they sit down to be with that and

137
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:27,760
sometimes as we sit some of these things shift and maybe become calmer more settled more stable

138
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:34,079
and then we might be sitting there quietly and then something suddenly appears out of nowhere and a

139
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:39,119
thought and memory comes up and there's anger memory comes up and we're

140
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:44,800
we're remembering what's going to happen tomorrow and there's anxiety that comes up

141
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,880
and so over time it's not a surprise when an emotion appears while we're

142
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:56,079
meditating and and there can be a

143
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:01,920
phenomenal shift that happens when we shift from identifying with the

144
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:07,920
emotion to just recognizing that it's part of what's happening

145
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:14,720
so to identify means to define oneself by it so if one's angry to assume i'm an

146
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:20,160
angry person people now are going to relate to me and as if i'm an angry person that defines

147
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:25,440
who i am and how people will judge me and um

148
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:32,480
the same thing with fear when becomes one feels like i am afraid boy am i afraid and uh and

149
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,319
when it's kind of leaning into the fear or or being captivated by the fear so

150
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:43,599
thoroughly so fully it we're kind of assuming it's all of who we are

151
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:49,760
same thing with happiness and joy but a shift happens in meditation that

152
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:56,240
at some point that rather than saying oh i'm afraid now

153
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:03,200
the meditator will say there is fear now there is anger now there is happiness

154
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:10,800
now and there's not anything there's no inclination to define oneself by it as if it's a

155
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:17,760
it's a well-worn coat that we're putting on for another time and uh it's just a phenomena just a part

156
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,280
and parcel of what's happening it might be strong and it might be coursing through the

157
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:29,040
body even but there is a stability of mind that recognizes

158
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:37,520
there is joy there is sadness there is happiness there is fear

159
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:43,520
and uh and this ability then to to just see it as a phenomenon

160
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:48,640
gives rise to a that's present gives rise to a very important

161
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:53,680
possibilities and this is really when the mindfulness work

162
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,800
can really kind of begin becoming stronger deeper more penetrating

163
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:04,640
it's a little bit hard to penetrate phenomena if we identify it if we define ourselves by it

164
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:10,560
because it's almost like we've so fully defined by it it's like we can't normally without a

165
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:17,520
mirror we can't see the eyes that see we see through the eyes but we don't

166
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:24,400
turn back and look at the eyes and see them and if we're really defined by something by an emotional state

167
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:30,720
we might know it's there we might recognize that i'm angry or sad or happy or afraid

168
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:37,359
but it's kind of like it's the filter through which we see so it's not really quite accessible for

169
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:44,480
clearly seeing and really recognizing there it is but when it comes to time when we can

170
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,880
say oh fear is here this gives birth to new possibilities

171
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:57,119
and um and so i'd like to talk about four categories of

172
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:03,520
possibilities with how we can be with fear once we can just see it that it's present

173
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:11,520
and not not defined by it or identified by it and and i you know

174
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:18,560
i thought it was fun maybe to come up with an acronym with the letters for fear and

175
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:25,359
and so the first thing we can do is now that it's become a verb

176
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:33,680
thanks to facebook i think we can friend our fear we can befriend it and

177
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:40,240
and this idea of becoming a friend for our fear is a really powerful thing to

178
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:46,960
do it's the opposite of being afraid of fear it's the opposite of being a versus it's

179
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,960
very radically different being aversive to fear and angry at fear or ashamed of fear or

180
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:59,839
trying to fix fear or attacking fear or trying to analyze it or

181
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:06,000
or figure out what's going on it's um it's kind of like if you're with a

182
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:12,240
friend you don't want to do all those things with your friend you want to be present for your friend

183
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:18,000
and hear what's going on with a friend you haven't seen the friend for a while you want to hear what's happening what's going on and

184
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,440
and be with them in a way that's respectful and caring for them

185
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:30,880
and it's possible to do that with fear it's harder to do it when we are defined by it but it's easier to do

186
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:36,720
if we recognize it that it's just there in a kind of way i'm here and fear is there

187
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:42,160
fear fear is part of me and but it's not quite me so i can look at

188
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:48,640
it without it kind of being a filter through which i see

189
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:56,319
and the value of becoming a friend to it is uh similar to um it's not quite just i'm jumping

190
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:01,520
around a little bit but if um you know if a young child is

191
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:09,040
afraid we don't get angry at it we don't run away from it we don't get all flustered and confused

192
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:14,400
and running around in circles when the kids sitting on the floor being afraid

193
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,680
you don't berate the kid you sit down with the kid and maybe put this

194
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:26,078
kid is small enough you put the kid on your lap or you hold it and you're there with it

195
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:32,319
so there's all these ways we say that when once we kind of kind of identify recognize that fear is there

196
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:38,240
we want to first friend the fear and one of the great values of friending

197
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:43,599
it is that the fear feels safe

198
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:50,880
the fear doesn't feel like it's being shamed or pushed away or denied or unwanted

199
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:56,720
and which is hard just like would be hard for a little child and it's one of the fascinating and

200
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:03,920
wonderful tasks of mindfulness is to help our fear feel safe

201
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:12,240
and now it's a little counter-intuitive you know some people never thought about helping their fear feel safe and

202
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,440
and if we are afraid if they were defined by like then it's hard to offer anything to the

203
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:22,560
fear but when we come to that point in practice when we can recognize

204
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:29,200
fear is present and we're not so inclined to say i am afraid

205
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:36,000
then we have something we can offer the fear and we become the one who offers

206
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:42,480
safety offers stability who offers kindness who makes space for it to be there and uh

207
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:48,319
and and start to listen and look more deeply what's here

208
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:54,960
and that's the e of fear and that's to explore the fear so rather than recoil from the

209
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:01,680
fear it's to step in a sense towards it to explore it to be with it to feel it

210
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:06,960
more fully and and one of the first things we can do

211
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:14,720
in exploring it is we can try to assess whether the fear is appropriate or not

212
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:22,400
we can try to see is this a appropriate fear to have or is it not is it a real fear or is it

213
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:28,079
not is it a healthy fear to have or is it not healthy

214
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:35,920
or my favorite pairing is it helpful fear or is it not helpful

215
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:43,280
and some fear clearly is helpful to have it protects us and and sometimes we need

216
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:48,480
protection if we there are

217
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:56,720
times when i'm driving my car or walking on a street where i feel a little bit afraid

218
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:02,720
there's a little bit of fear there that's kind of kind of inseparable inside of me from a

219
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:08,960
sense of caution and the you know it's something sometimes it is a little bit

220
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:14,559
scary maybe if i was different than who i who i am i wouldn't be afraid of certain kind of

221
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:22,240
traffic situations but i don't think it's necessarily wrong because they're it's uh death can be instantaneous in

222
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:31,040
some of these crossing some sidewalks some some crosswalks uh the way some drivers drive and and um

223
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:37,760
so the fear protects us is look before you walk across the crosswalk or something

224
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:45,839
and and so and so in buddhism one of the appropriate fears is the fear

225
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:53,280
of doing something of oneself doing something that injures one's own

226
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:59,920
integrity that injures one's own sensitivity to

227
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:05,119
compassion to kindness to honesty

228
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:12,319
once to harms one's sensitivity or one's orientation to live a life that doesn't cause harm

229
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:17,520
to anyone else and um and to into when we feel like

230
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,720
we're in the danger of saying something to someone that's very unkind and hurtful

231
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:30,240
to feel that fear no this is dangerous i don't think i should say this i should be careful here the mood that

232
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:36,000
i'm in right now is not a this is a little dangerous mood i'm in

233
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,680
i could easily snap at someone and later regret what i've done what i would have said

234
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:47,599
so i'm afraid of myself a little bit because of this mood i see what i've done before

235
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:54,079
and so i'm going to be cautious maybe i'm going to learn to hold my tongue or maybe i'm even going to avoid certain

236
00:49:54,079 --> 00:50:01,599
stressful situations when i'm in this mood if i can avoid them so the idea of

237
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:08,800
we have something to protect here also we're afraid to hurt people and they

238
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:16,240
if the simple fear of not wanting to hurt others is a very healthy i think

239
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:22,960
fear to have and um and uh and so this kind of

240
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:30,480
and they say in the ancient world in the teachings of the buddha that people or practitioners have fear

241
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:36,960
for causing the slightest fault slightest harm

242
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:45,680
and and hopefully this is not seen as a debilitating fear a fear which diminishes who we are

243
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:52,079
but actually it's a fear that protects what's the best in us and allows it to grow

244
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:59,119
so buddhism recognizes healthy fear but there's also unhelpful fear the fear that is

245
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:06,800
debilitating the fear that does uh freeze us in the way or or inhibits us

246
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:13,920
or keeps us from living a full life or engaged properly in the world sometimes it's fear that causes us to

247
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:21,359
harm others sometimes it's fear that causes us to harm ourselves because it's we're so afraid of

248
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:29,440
the alternative and so we we keep ourselves in check and close down because of it or collapse

249
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:34,800
so as we explore fear we can recognize when it seems helpful and when it

250
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:41,599
seems not helpful we can uh and even when it's principle fear can be

251
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:49,680
helpful the strength of the fear or the way that we engage in the fear or take in the fear

252
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:55,680
can be debilitating can be limiting and so to this idea of exploring the

253
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:02,960
fear what's going on here what's happening here for me is a wonderful stance wonderful

254
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:10,079
kind of sense of inner strength that begins to operate from the stability of practice

255
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:15,359
of mindfulness what is this what's going on here

256
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:21,920
and one of the things we can ask is what we're afraid of so this question of

257
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:28,000
the study of exploring fear i see it as a movement of respect

258
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:34,800
that we respect the fear we're not belittling fear or or deleting ourselves because we are

259
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:42,720
fear and i like to think that all every fear that we have should be respected because it's a

260
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:48,480
messenger sometimes it's a messenger that there is in fact the danger

261
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:56,319
but sometimes it's a messenger that something inside of us feels threatened and it's possible to

262
00:52:56,319 --> 00:53:02,800
feel and so so sometimes it's important to look and see what's the real danger

263
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:09,359
explore is there a danger right now and sometimes in the here and now what we're afraid of

264
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:14,480
is not present and that's a fascinating thing to realize

265
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:19,920
that what we're afraid of is partly a product of our imagination

266
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:27,119
and some people have said that anxiety is completely an issue of imagination

267
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:34,640
it might be a real imagination but it's imagining what's going to happen in the future it's predicting something sometimes it's

268
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:40,800
a it's a wise prediction but um then it has a kind of anxiety it kind of lives in and

269
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,119
simmers inside that

270
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:52,079
but some people have chronic anxiety that it just kind of almost stands

271
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:59,760
they've learned there's been so much pain and so much danger for them in their life that it becomes kind of habitual and to

272
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:05,599
be expected there's always a threat always something's going to happen that's dangerous and we don't know what

273
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:12,559
it is there's nothing concrete right here and now but in that sense it's imaginary it's a potentially

274
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:18,240
something here so to

275
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:26,000
so we can see clearly you know that and to see that is not present maybe can give a breathing room that

276
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:32,720
here and now maybe it's not as if not as dangerous as we thought and there could be some relaxation

277
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:38,400
also we can look at um so we can look at what's what we're

278
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,520
afraid of but for dharma practice a very significant

279
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:50,319
exploration of fear is to look and see what's being threatened

280
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:57,680
what is it that's really going on here with inside of me and that i'm afraid that's going to be

281
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:03,200
hurt or damaged or what's what is it that feels threatened and

282
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:10,160
and sometimes what's being threatened is real enough integrity is kind of real enough important enough to protect

283
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:16,880
but sometimes what's being protected doesn't really have

284
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:23,599
such a strong real basis sometimes what's being protected what's

285
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:30,880
being threatened are the constructs that we live under uh the constructs of self the ideas the

286
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:36,400
what we had how we've identified us how we've constructed our idea of who we are

287
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:41,520
so for example if a person that constructs the idea of themselves

288
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:48,000
as they need to be wise and funny all the time then

289
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:55,280
anything that uh that uh if they feel fear maybe it's because they're with their how other people see

290
00:55:55,280 --> 00:56:01,440
them is being threatened that their idea their identity as being a wise and funny

291
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:07,440
person is threatened but that the idea being there's no need to be a wise and funny person

292
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:14,000
that's a constructed particular notion idea without that idea there's that can't be

293
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,760
threatened the idea that we have to be someone that everyone likes

294
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:25,200
that we have to be someone who we we are someone or with what's being threatened is that

295
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:31,280
um we're we're somehow an undesirable person and so we're constantly being

296
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:37,760
threatened by everyone because we're afraid we're going to be pushed away by people or rejected by people

297
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:44,000
and so it gets a little more complicated when when the what's being threatened is

298
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:49,839
a little bit of a imagination a concept an idea

299
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:57,200
a construct and it maybe doesn't quite exactly have to be there

300
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:03,119
maybe we're stuck on some idea that it doesn't have to be there like i know

301
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:08,160
when i was younger i thought it was a life and death matter

302
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:15,040
almost you know whether uh someone liked me or didn't like me

303
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:21,520
and so uh i was had a lot of fear about social fear about then you know i was

304
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:27,520
constantly assessing and wondering and hoping that people would like me and and

305
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:32,720
it was a big revelation to me they realized that um everyone everyone doesn't have to like

306
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:38,160
me it's okay if some people don't like me and and i don't have to constantly be

307
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:44,720
concerned about it and to see that begin to kind of shed and drop away create a lot more peace inside of me

308
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:49,760
social peace and ease and in fact sometimes people don't like me

309
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:57,280
and that's okay they're they're allowed to do that and and sometimes people do and that's nice

310
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:02,319
too so this idea of exploring there's a

311
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:08,000
whole series of things that can be explored around fear but but the important principle is

312
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,920
um to not be caught by the fear uh so that we can't and one way not to be

313
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:20,559
caught by it is to explore it take the initiative okay let's let's discover what's going on here and

314
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:26,960
there's all these different ways of discovery and you can have your own way and but just keep looking and feeling and getting to

315
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:33,440
know the a of fear is um

316
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:39,920
is to really allow it to be there the more we can discover it more we can

317
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:46,960
explore it and then we really allow it and but not allow it to run us and tell

318
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:52,079
us what to do and how to see things but this is really now a continuation of this

319
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:58,480
there is fear here i'm not the fear but there is fear here

320
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:04,960
with me in me and so and then to discover how it experi how

321
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:11,920
to know and discover it how it appears physically what's the physical manifestation of fear

322
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:17,359
and then allow that physicality of fear to be there almost as if you get out of the way from

323
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:24,240
it and sometimes it's best to do this in short bouts especially when there's a

324
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:30,160
terror or very strong a very strong fear that is connected to all this it's better not

325
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:35,200
to explore it and be with it for very long but just to touch into it for a while

326
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:41,920
and then pull away and come back to another day and slowly slowly kind of befriend it slowly

327
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:47,839
get to know it but at some point the beautiful art of mindfulness

328
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:53,359
is to really allow it to be there and allow it without our reactivity

329
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:58,400
around it without our needing it to be different so it's just a little bit an extension of

330
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:03,440
befriending the fear and allowing it and part of the value of that

331
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:09,040
is that our inner life knows how to take care of itself knows

332
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:17,839
how to unwind knows how to release knows how to morph into what needs to happen next and so if we learn to learn the art

333
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:23,839
of just allowing the fear to be there it's impressive what can happen and

334
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:29,280
that's also a hard skill to learn when we when the habit is we have to

335
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:36,799
analyze it or we have to engineer a change or we have to fix it or something like that

336
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:43,440
and to learn how to allow it in meditation is a wonderful skill because some fears

337
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:49,920
maybe we maybe we can't get rid of it or it will always be with us but with the art of allowing it

338
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:55,119
befriending it knowing it's there exploring it and allowing it can mean

339
01:00:55,119 --> 01:01:00,640
that we might be able to have the fear be present but not

340
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:05,839
be inhibited or limited by it we bring it along it sits on our left shoulder

341
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:13,680
and it's there with us we know it's there but we're not going to stop what we're doing it's not going to get us to cower or

342
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:20,160
shut down or not live the life our life as we want to live it but we allow that the fear comes along

343
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:26,079
and accompanies us and it's there we recognize it's present

344
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:33,200
but we know how to allow it so that it does it can just be there and not interfere

345
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:41,280
and then they are of fear is to is to release as that's the freedom part

346
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:47,680
of fear and and that has different com different sides of release

347
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:53,359
sometimes the fear is released and it's no longer there that especially if the underlying thing

348
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:59,680
that was threatened i know no longer is there or they realize that what was threatened doesn't

349
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:05,359
really exist it doesn't has no real kind of substantial existence

350
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:11,200
and and so the constructs of self and the self definitions we have

351
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:16,799
when we learn to be at peace without a self definition be at peace without a self construct

352
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:24,240
we're trying to build up or defend or protect or hide from people then

353
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:31,680
that fear that that thing that there's nothing there threatened around self-identity

354
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:38,640
and so people all kinds of things people can do they might you know they can't hurt that identity

355
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:44,720
because we're not holding on to that identity we're not defining ourselves by that and it just

356
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:51,280
goes right through um and so we're free of it and sometimes

357
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:56,960
what's being released is not the fear but rather is uh

358
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:03,359
the um our pre our clinging or attachment or selfing or

359
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:09,039
identification with the fear and we release ourself from the fear

360
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:14,079
the fear is still there but we are released from it and then it's much easier to have the

361
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:19,200
fear be present and then just live our life as we want to or as

362
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:29,039
is appropriate so to friend the fear to explore the fear

363
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:34,799
to allow the fear and to release in relationship to the

364
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:40,160
fear these are four things to explore but

365
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:47,359
the emphasis for this talk is this is meant for people who have

366
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:55,920
capable of having some disidentification from fear not disassociation from it

367
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:02,960
but this identification the sense that they don't define themselves by their fear but they're able to sit be quiet and

368
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:08,480
breathe easily perhaps and recognize oh there is fear

369
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:15,839
fear is present i'm not the fear but boy is there fear present that fear

370
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:24,839
is strong but you know i'm not the fear and then that allows for this interesting

371
01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:32,319
phenomena interesting practice of friend the fear explore the fear

372
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:40,799
allow the fear and release the fear and then fear has become

373
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:47,680
a four-fold practice that we engage in so next time you feel fear you might

374
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:52,880
remember that fear is an acronym for a practice

375
01:04:52,880 --> 01:05:00,319
that we look fear where we respect the fear by getting to know it well

376
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:05,440
it's a messenger do we understand what the message is

377
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:14,240
so thank you very much and may you explore your fear

378
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:22,880
and discover the wonderful place inside where there is no fear because

379
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:32,640
it's a place that cannot be threatened so thank you
