1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,000
welcome everyone today we'll take a little look at the the

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,480
middle faculty of these five faculties Sati or mindfulness and as I promised yesterday

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,840
because this is familiar to so many people I'm going to sort of try not to

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,000
say the uh some of the same things that we might usually say particularly to a

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,200
group like this with some some experience and some familiarity with

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,559
mindfulness Gil sometimes talks about mindfulness Sati in the context of these

7
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:43,520
five faculties as complete presence complete presence and uh to sort of take

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:50,399
that as a theme for the daret and also for this guided meditation complete

9
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,640
presence seems to me to be a gift a gift we receive kind of a patrimony or an

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,039
inheritance something like the other faculties deep with in that we can

11
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:07,640
access that we can cultivate without reaching outside without accomplishing

12
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:15,719
something um but rather something we can cultivate by bringing our attention to

13
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:23,320
it our ability to our capacity to be here now our capacity for complete

14
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:29,119
presence is a gift that we in addition to receiving that we can give in the

15
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:36,640
first instance we can give the gift of attention as I like to think of it to ourselves or to our experience really

16
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:45,200
paying attention to our experience showing up for ourselves in this fundamental way and the more we cultivate it the

17
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,040
more we feel comfortable giving our gift giving the same gift of attention to

18
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,798
others so that's our theme for the guided the gift of

19
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,039
attention so let's get comfortable in meditation

20
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,399
posture for me that always means kind of resetting the body this is part of the settling into the meditation we talked

21
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:17,560
about yesterday bringing some attention to the energy that we bring to practice and seeking a balance of

22
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:23,959
energy we might notice that when we seek to calibrate our energy to the present

23
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:32,080
moment that the mind sometimes doesn't have a clue what that means and so we look we look to the body to help us

24
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:39,640
understand what's the appropriate balance what does what does self-care mean right now oh it means letting the

25
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:47,800
shoulders relax a bit noticing any tension around the eyes bringing attention to the jaw each of us holds

26
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:56,760
tension in different places and yet many of us hold the weight of the world on our shoulders and the cares of the day

27
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:03,920
in our faces our eyes our Jaws in our heads so just softening around these

28
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,319
areas wherever we are aware of tension in the body our objective isn't to make it go

29
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:16,560
away but to show up give the gift of attention to our bodily

30
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,879
experience and we can do this throughout the meditation

31
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:31,159
practice think of giving a gift to our experience this gift this precious gift

32
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:37,799
of attention this ability to direct our attention to hold our attention

33
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:44,840
to um provide places where our attention can come to

34
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,799
rest is a wonderful and unique gift that comes along with human

35
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:01,360
birth so maybe resting our attention in the breathing

36
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,640
and how in the breathing well just in the sensations of breathing we don't even have to think of it as the breath

37
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:15,239
which is adding a concept to our experience but just noticing the rise

38
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:22,560
and fall of the abdomen the expansion and easing off of the

39
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,960
chest the gentle rise and fall of the

40
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:34,240
shoulders just noticing the sensations of the in breath just this breath in

41
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,638
here and then the out

42
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:49,919
breath this gift of attention is one we give to our experience without adding

43
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,600
anything on to it just being with the first the primary experience that comes

44
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,240
up to us

45
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:09,919
we rest giving the gift of attention to the body just as it is just these sensations

46
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:15,320
of bodily movement perhaps of tension or holding

47
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:22,280
or bracing in the body tingling throbbing alertness

48
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:28,319
potential whatever we feel in the body just

49
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,039
accepting body his

50
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,880
body and accepting is part of the gift doesn't mean we like it doesn't mean

51
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,080
it's Pleasant maybe accepting it is really

52
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:51,199
just acknowledging as it is what's what's coming

53
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:00,800
up and today in giving this gift of attention

54
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,280
we can make use of the fact that the mind will get caught up in things snagged in things get kind of

55
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,520
concentrated or wrapped around things usually thoughts of the future

56
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:19,280
thoughts of the past thoughts of other people thoughts of ourselves the usual courses of the

57
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,199
mind and before we feel that we've gotten lost or

58
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:33,080
wandered off or doing it wrong we could just notice some of the maybe bodily Sensations or emotional

59
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:40,160
currents that are related to those thoughts bringing our attention slowly gently

60
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,639
back to the present these things that come up in

61
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:54,400
meditation they want our attention the body's Sensations the

62
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:01,520
feelings of whatever they happen to be today inadequacy

63
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:10,080
Joy loss

64
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,520
exhilaration we can just notice these things and give them that little touch of

65
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,160
attention we don't have to think about them we can just sort of go oh that's

66
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:29,240
what's here now so instead of feeling when we find

67
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,520
that the the mind's wandered off into the day coming toward us or the day past

68
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:42,400
these creations of mind can bring our attention tug it back to the center of things but also along

69
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:49,319
the way give attention to how it feels to be here

70
00:07:53,479 --> 00:08:01,080
now one way we can give this gift of attention is by when we notice the mind's caught up in things are wandered

71
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:06,720
off is to not hurry we're going to do this a lot in

72
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,800
this sit and in our future sitting we don't have to hurry we don't have to jerk the Mind

73
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:21,840
back to here and now in fact we can notice what it feels like to

74
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,800
come back to Here and

75
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:36,159
Now feel the balance and ease and simplicity and slowness of being here now in contrast to being there

76
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:42,200
then and today we can think of this as giving a gift of attention to ourselves

77
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:51,440
to our experience just noticing what's it like to be here

78
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
now

79

e e

112
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,360
so as we near the end of this

113
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:17,640
sit let's reflect a little on this giftgiving

114
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:25,799
capacity and one gift we can provide ourselves is a gift that's an absence of

115
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:32,360
judgment if we didn't get lost in thought we

116
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:39,399
wouldn't have the opportunity to come back here and each time we return to

117
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:45,360
give ourselves give our experience the gift of our

118
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:51,600
attention the capacity to give to ourselves and to others it needs

119
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:58,000
exercise it needs to be strengthened and this is how we do it

120
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:07,760
we give ourselves an important gift when each time we return we don't kick ourselves for

121
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:14,360
having found a need to return from wherever the mind got tangled up no it's

122
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:22,720
an opportunity to give and it's an opportunity to strengthen the capacity to

123
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:31,039
give may we benefit from this growing capacity to give in our

124
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:38,159
lives and may other beings also benefit not just from the gifts but from our

125
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,960
capacity to

126
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,960
give may all beings be safe

127
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,039
secure may all beings receive the gift of

128
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:10,760
presence may all beings be free from suffering

129
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:26,079
[Music]

130
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:50,039
good day and welcome again to everyone turning now from a guided

131
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:59,000
meditation focused on the gift of attention the gift we give ourselves and

132
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:07,000
the strengthening of our capacity to give we can take a look at the third

133
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,080
faculty of these five faculties that which is frequently characterized as

134
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:19,000
mindfulness Sati and a faculty that Gil sometimes

135
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:26,600
refers to in this context of the five faculties as complete presence

136
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:39,158
the uh what might complete presence be and how might it be related to this idea of

137
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:46,039
giving in the classic instructions that that support this practice many of you

138
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:53,480
probably know mindfulness is never defined rather we are given instructions

139
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,519
on how to cultivate and strengthen this attention to be this Capac capacity to

140
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:05,279
be present so it's not something we acquire

141
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:11,360
it's something we do it's not something that we achieve and hold and make our

142
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:16,600
own it's a way we meet experience over and over

143
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:22,200
again and this I tried to point to even in the guided you know the return to

144
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:27,559
here and now the return to presence it's the return that's

145
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:33,080
important and the returning I said yesterday it's not like we hang on with our

146
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:39,760
fingernails as much as we celebrate this ability to keep returning and in part

147
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:47,360
the I don't know if celebration is the right word but maybe just the enjoyment of the ability to return is that each

148
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,640
time we return and each time we enjoy it enjoy its balance enjoy the

149
00:30:52,640 --> 00:31:01,000
Simplicity enjoy the um slow pace of it the lack of entanglement the absence of

150
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,639
attachment each time we enjoy that we strengthen

151
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:13,480
it so um we should enjoy it fully and the instructions we get the encouragement we have uh from the from

152
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:20,600
the tradition is to enjoy it fully to cultivate that enjoyment of being here being

153
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:25,679
present so in the instructions that undergird the practice

154
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:32,240
of mindfulness the cultivation of mind mindful attention or complete presence is the idea that we meet the experience

155
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,600
of the body as body that we meet the experience of bodily Sensations and

156
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:43,880
mental Sensations as bodily and mental Sensations that we meet the mind and

157
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:49,080
mind States as mind States and finally in the fourth

158
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:55,639
Foundation that we meet patterns of experience as they are as as patterns of

159
00:31:55,639 --> 00:32:00,799
experience what does that mean exactly body as body Veta as Veta or feeling

160
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:07,519
tone as feeling tone mind as mind dumus as dumus or patterns of thought patterns

161
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:13,720
of Mind as patterns of mind it means that we're not adding

162
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:18,840
anything we're just aware of for example and this is why we come back again and

163
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:27,559
again to the breathing we're not even labeling it is breathing we're just noticing oh this this movement of the

164
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:34,559
body this in and out this up and down this expansion and contraction as it

165
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:41,000
is without adding opinions about it being different or what it's going to be

166
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,360
like in two breaths from now regretting the way we took those

167
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:53,080
breaths three breaths ago they weren't as good as they should have been all of that is adding to our experience and the

168
00:32:53,080 --> 00:33:00,159
reason we begin with the breath in the body is it's easier there to not get all all entangled in what it means or how it

169
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:05,720
might be better or different because it's just easier to accept as it

170
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:13,399
is each time we move forward gets a little bit more challenging to take the feeling tone

171
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:18,679
Veta we could say the quality of Sensations in body and mind whether

172
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:25,120
they're Pleasant or unpleasant that's a little harder to take without adding something if something we feel hurts or

173
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:31,760
something feels good the Mind tends to add extra add more like oh I want more

174
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:40,720
of that and oh I don't want as much of that and the uh the the being completely

175
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:47,760
present with that means being there without without going down those roads but just noticing oh this is Pleasant

176
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:54,120
this isn't Pleasant this is in the first instance that is as we first as experience first

177
00:33:54,120 --> 00:34:00,919
arises and we beat it with attention we just notice observe feel

178
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:08,800
know with that effortless knowing that's free what's going on similarly with mind States we notice

179
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:15,480
oh the mind seems foggy or the mind seems clear we don't add anything to it it's

180
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:21,079
not that it shouldn't be foggy or it shouldn't be clear or shouldn't be foggy and it's nice that it's clear we just

181
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:26,280
notice oh it's like this now and this is a gift that we give ourselves the gift

182
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:31,679
to just be here without without adding a bunch of stuff onto it

183
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,599
yet I say yet because we have a choice about what to add on to it we can meet

184
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:43,800
experience with a mind that's open or we can meet experience with a mind that's

185
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:49,638
already judging how things should be should have been might be might have been

186
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:56,040
Etc and finally with patterns of experience as patterns of experience we can

187
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:02,320
um we can meet our experience noticing oh is there a lot of self-doubt creeping

188
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:09,839
in here that would be the fifth the fifth hindrance to name it is there a lot of

189
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:15,040
Doubt happening is that part of the attitude with which experience is being

190
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:25,240
met or is there oh confidence and some energy and some presence and maybe some

191
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:32,839
um some um Stillness or collectedness with which

192
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:38,480
experience is being met just noticing neither's neither's has to be labeled

193
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,440
good or bad just the gift of saying oh it's like this

194
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:52,880
now that's what we mean and by complete presence and why it's useful to

195
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:59,720
characterize Sati as complete presence it's a way of saying maybe getting beyond the label of

196
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:07,160
mindfulness which has become almost universally excuse me used to

197
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:14,079
characterize a wide range of experience and to and to be very specific about

198
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:19,960
that it's a gift of attention that in fact or in part is a gift because it

199
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:28,520
doesn't add anything so

200
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:34,040
having said this I also want to add this which is it's maybe when we hear the

201
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:39,800
phrase complete presence we might we might understandably think that what's

202
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:46,000
being referred to is perfect presence maybe that's just the way our minds go I

203
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:54,040
don't know about you all uh 206 of you so I can only speak for myself but um

204
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:59,560
there's a perfectionist streak that runs through um a fair amount of my

205
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:04,599
life if not focused on Perfection certainly on accomplishment achievement

206
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:10,119
and all that has been useful actually in certain Realms of life doesn't need to

207
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:16,480
be pushed away or excluded but there can be a recognition of that this is a path that moves in a

208
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,079
different direction this path of practice where perfect isn't the

209
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:29,280
goal um maybe maybe complete presence can be a useful aspiration in fact I

210
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:35,680
think it is and yet that doesn't mean that we need to uh achieve accomplish

211
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:42,359
strive for perfect perfect or perfect a perfect

212
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:52,480
presence instead what we what we seek to cultivate is sufficient presence

213
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,680
sufficient mindfulness sufficient for what

214
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:03,160
sufficient to develop a mind that's free enough of all that extra that we it can

215
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:08,760
see clearly so this can help ratchet down

216
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:15,079
from complete presence as a as a unattainable goal to something that we can do right here right now in this

217
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:22,240
moment which is be sufficiently present you may have some distractions going on there may be kids I saw somebody with

218
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:28,920
canines and kitties uh there may be other things going on there may be a meeting coming

219
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:38,000
up in uh 21 minutes there um so presence may not be complete

220
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:45,839
or perfect but it can be sufficient to be here now with enough absence of extra

221
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:51,119
being added on that it can help us see

222
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:58,160
clearly and um a phrase I love that I I think I may

223
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,200
be made up so going to trade market I'm kidding

224
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:09,640
it's freely given take it and use it I hope it can help serve your practice um

225
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:16,880
came up in a conversation with an old friend yet another perfectionist I know I've known

226
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,079
many um many just like me that um this

227
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:27,680
person said for this person they said for me

228
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:33,720
only perfect is good enough and I said well what if good

229
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:41,480
enough is perfect so you might keep that in mind and this practice it's not about getting

230
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:47,880
perfect it's about developing sufficient mindfulness sub sufficient collectiveness of Mind as we'll talk

231
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:53,680
about tomorrow sufficient samade so that we can see sufficiently

232
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:59,319
clearly anyway this helps reduce the striving

233
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:07,119
the orientation toward accomplishment the the orientation toward making achievements that are mine uh it frees

234
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:13,920
us up a little bit to just be here now without all that stuff added in and on that I think we have time for

235
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,400
a story I was going to try to leave a few minutes for a story I think this is a

236
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:28,200
story from Gil's book a monastery within just came to me in the meditation may not be um it may be

237
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:33,839
and maybe another story but I'm going to put it I'm going to put in the framework of Gil's book a monastery within and if

238
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:42,839
you don't know the book it's a book of very short stories that all work with the idea of creating within ourselves um

239
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:48,200
these capacities among others that we've been talking about this week creating a

240
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:53,760
space of seclusion and safety and refuge from which we can um or in which we can

241
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:01,680
cultivate the Mind states that allow us to meet the world's SK skillfully the world of experience the world around

242
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:07,640
us um so the story goes something like this if I remember it well which is one

243
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:14,319
day a person a practitioner like ourselves shows up at the monastery and has a meeting with the

244
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:21,480
abbis and uh they say to the abbis the person who leads the monastery and and

245
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:27,359
uh provides counsel to the to the practitioners in the monastery

246
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:33,200
this person says to the abbis so if I practice really diligently if I practice

247
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:39,440
hard um if I sit daily if I read all the right books and if I how long will it

248
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:45,040
take me to awaken and the Abbot says probably about 10

249
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:51,319
years and the person says 10 years I don't have 10 years I I I'm used to accomplishing things and you know

250
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:57,359
getting ahead what if what if my practice is perfect what if I make my practice perfect I have perfect

251
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:04,800
mindfulness perfect Sade perfect wisdom um you know I think I can really I

252
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,839
really can make that happen um because I'm good at that kind of thing making things

253
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:15,040
perfect then how long will it take me to awaken and the abbis says in that case

254
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:21,640
it'll take you 20 years and the person says wait wait why what if I really

255
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:27,599
redouble my efforts like I've done in other Realms of life and I work really hard and I don't just sit one once a day

256
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:34,760
I sit twice a day and I go on Long Retreats and I I read even more and I find all the best teachers and then how

257
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:40,480
long will it take me and the Abba says in that case it'll take you 30

258
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:46,040
years you probably knew that was coming that punchline the point

259
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:51,119
here um is that we

260
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:57,400
um the point is that uh we don't need to develop a perfect practice in fact that

261
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:03,240
orientation towards perfect is counterproductive you know and who knows

262
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:09,160
if it will take longer because the practice eventually teaches us this it teaches us that we don't have to be

263
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:15,359
perfect it teaches us that one way we can be with ourselves in complete presence one way we can provide this

264
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:20,559
gift of attention this mindful attention to ourselves so let go of all that that

265
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:27,200
gets in our way whatever it is for others it's different things but for many of us this kind of striving of

266
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:34,839
approach can really hamper our efforts to develop a practice that supports Us in life can really diminish our ability

267
00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:42,960
to give um because it diminishes our ability to cultivate this capacity to to

268
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:49,480
give this gift of attention to ourselves to our experience

269
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:56,160
um and with just a minute remaining on the clock I want to point out that in the text sorry in the uh what do we call

270
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:03,240
this the chat feed that's scrolling along somebody it's a few minutes ago makes mention

271
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:09,960
of the concept of good enough parenting uh that was developed by Donald winnott

272
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:15,760
and uh this is a sort of obscure reference to many of of us although wot's work if you know anything about

273
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,839
him it it it it it absolutely um is universally referred to in many ways the

274
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:28,400
importance of play in childhood development for example is something that develops with Donald wot's work I just mention it because this idea of

275
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:34,359
good enough parenting is very closely related to this and it's one of many ways that psychotherapeutic approaches

276
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:40,200
can support our practice and vice versa because the same idea is that um

277
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:47,160
striving for perfection in parenting is can be counterproductive not only for the parent but also for the child that

278
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:53,640
in our practice we need imperfection we need the road to be bumpy we need the

279
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:59,079
mind to wander off that it needs so that it can be drawn back we learn something really important about this practice

280
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:04,800
that it's not about perfection it's about um it's about

281
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:11,520
being meeting meeting our experience with sufficient wisdom so that we can be

282
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:17,520
free so enough said for today appreciate everybody being here uh I hope the rest

283
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:22,920
of your day goes well and um we'll meet again tomorrow

284
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:30,400
let's meet again tomorrow same time same place where we'll take up the fourth of these faculties which Gil characterizes

285
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,839
as wholeness others say unification or

286
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:42,480
collectiveness and this is particularly true in the meditation practice but I think it's a quality of experience and a

287
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:48,599
capacity that uh really helps us in meeting meeting the world we live in so

288
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:54,240
take care everyone uh till tomorrow bye
