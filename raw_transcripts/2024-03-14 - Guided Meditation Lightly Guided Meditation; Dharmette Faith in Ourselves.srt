1
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:13,480
okay so uh so welcome

2
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:21,720
um yeah nice to see the names and um we uh we'll set

3
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,960
set

4
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,879
just finding a posture in which you can

5
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,920
be receptive to the

6
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:01,920
Dharma re receive your own wisdom

7
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:55,560
Ain suito said something like uh what we don't listen to We

8
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,759
Become what's not received in

9
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,880
Awareness we become identified

10
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:17,680
with what's pushed to the side

11
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:24,519
disavowed the uh in our resistance we

12
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:31,840
paradoxically become it

13
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,920
and so just as we begin we just

14
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:46,879
listen

15
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:59,239
deeply so that we don't become our resistant don't become identified with

16
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:02,599
it it's

17
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,760
received

18
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,720
e

19
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
e

20
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,639
e

21
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,639
e

22
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,360
the awareness keeps backing up keeps

23
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:03,240
noticing the attention that uh Creeps in around the project of meditation the

24
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,918
project of

25
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,680
me notices the subtle transactional

26
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,039
mode making something

27
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:34,639
happen a subtle demand we issue to the

28
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:58,520
moment we notice all of this bit by bit some of the static melts

29
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
away

30
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:25,520
me come into the the spaciousness that

31
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:34,360
uh involves uh

32
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
frictionless

33
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
e

34
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
e

35
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
e

36
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
e

37
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:16,279
unless we notice what we want the kind of background agendas of

38
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:26,959
wanting uh our knowing is um suffused with the

39
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
wanting

40
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:52,440
and so we we notice some of these agendas this tightness this tension this

41
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,399
transaction this bargaining we do with the

42
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:04,000
moment the way we leverage the present for some

43
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:12,680
future we notice all of this and in this

44
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:19,800
way the The Knowing becomes less [Music]

45
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,160
entangled those

46
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:33,880
agendas The Knowing of the breathing body sound

47
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
feeling

48
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

49
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

50
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

51
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:03,360
e and faith in

52
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,680
Awareness it's a kind of confidence that

53
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:17,720
uh after all my doing all my

54
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,440
effort all my

55
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:31,040
strategies after all of that dissolved

56
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,720
we can trust what's

57
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:55,759
left we can trust the awareness that doesn't depend

58
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:01,040
on me

59
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

60
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

61
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

62
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

63
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

64
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

65
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

66
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

67
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

68
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

69
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:22,240
the L we grasp the more self-evident the Dharma

70
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
becomes

71
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

72
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:23,720
Michelle McDonald asked the question is the the agenda to

73
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:30,520
uh to connect or to control

74
00:21:54,120 --> 00:22:00,520
maybe one aspect of faith in

75
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,480
Dharma is that

76
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:17,720
uh okay to let go of

77
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:35,480
control something will uh hold us even on the other side of our

78
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
control

79
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

80
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

81
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

82
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

83
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,600
to clearly know clinging

84
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,600
control is to want to release

85
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
it

86
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

87
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

88
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
e

89
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
e

90
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,039
e

91
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,039
e

92
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,039
e

93
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:30,519
okay that's good to uh good to sit with you

94
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:37,640
um yeah I hope uh YouTube is okay it's it started um there's a default that Set

95
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:43,440
Set uh it as a private video and had to stop the feed this was before we began

96
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:50,279
but uh it may have been an ex the explanation for couple people having

97
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:56,760
issues sorry about that okay so

98
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,919
um uh

99
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:07,919
uh Faith

100
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,399
um there was um there was a period in

101
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:25,880
uh uh yeah last couple decades when the sort of like uh the educational system

102
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:31,159
was was um aggressively supporting the development

103
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:38,760
of self-esteem and is very understandable in a lot of

104
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:46,000
ways like if you have a more positive view of um of the self it'll

105
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,279
support academic and uh Social

106
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:58,919
Development but um as it turned out it didn't really work out that way and

107
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:06,080
the uh improvements in self-esteem when they could be made it's not so easy to make

108
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:14,919
but when they could be made they didn't translate to that much and to really make changes the kind

109
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:22,480
of the deep models of self they've been reiterated so

110
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:28,080
compulsively that it's it's like a song we've been hunging humming you know to

111
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,960
ourselves for many years Non-Stop and so it takes something of

112
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:41,399
kind of industrial strength to actually uh change that at a deep

113
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:50,039
level and so this week we've been uh we've been exploring uh faith faith and what does

114
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:56,840
it mean to have faith in in oneself faith in

115
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:03,080
oneself does it mean that um we have a kind of rigid

116
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:08,159
model of what we are and that model's positive positively

117
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:13,760
balanced I don't think so it's more like

118
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:19,120
when you know what you're

119
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:25,600
not is it possible to have faith in

120
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:33,440
oneself when you know what you're not not then we can actually have faith in oursel when you are no longer kind of

121
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,960
taking refuge in the stories of self you can have faith in

122
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:50,039
yourself because the the story all the elaborate I making my making the egoic

123
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:58,240
story is a kind of static really that actually muddles our knowing m

124
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,399
our sensitivity to this moment it it like

125
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:10,440
the the the congealing of the sense of self actually is a kind of

126
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:17,000
static and it serves to um buffer our

127
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:25,480
connection from what's here and so so Faith um in oneself is

128
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:33,599
not a kind of inflated story about the self it's not grandiose stories it's not

129
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:40,398
that um I don't know why this came to mind

130
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:47,240
but um you know I am not a uh I'm not a musical person I have a terrible ear I

131
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:52,358
can't read music I don't play any instruments I took piano lessons when I

132
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:57,800
was a kid and I was I you know it's kind

133
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:04,520
of harsh to say it about a child but I was bad I know effectively nothing you

134
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:11,200
know but sometimes sometimes when I go to the

135
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:19,760
symphony and I see whatever uh dudamel or eseka

136
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:26,359
solonin sometimes I feel like maybe maybe I could be the

137
00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:32,119
conductor just maybe and I got my kind of like in my

138
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:41,079
head I have my my hand position you know shouldn't I just have faith in

139
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:51,359
myself no a not uh a not not self is uh the the

140
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:58,560
truest form of self-esteem the the the

141
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:06,319
impersonality of one's strengths and

142
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:14,599
weaknesses and so the this Insight is the end of trying to uh to prove to

143
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:21,440
prove oneself it's the the kind of dissolving of arrogance and shame which

144
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:31,040
is the the underbelly of self and then we we start to develop a a

145
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:38,240
different kind of um of confidence a different kind of faith in

146
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:43,599
oursel we're very grounded in where we are we come to

147
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:50,520
trust our our view we come to trust our body trust our mind not the kind of

148
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:55,920
story of self we relax into

149
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,960
anata and there's a lot of trust that emerges from that Insight a lot of trust

150
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:08,440
that emerges from an Insight at times may maybe the default

151
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:16,000
is is there there's a certain kind of deep wobble in the self and we don't trust our view we don't trust our

152
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,119
knowing we defer to others to understand what's what's

153
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:29,520
real we defer to others we sort of like checking checking looking to this person

154
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:35,480
that person to gauge what should I what should I think there's a a subtle way we

155
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:42,480
just keep pinging to others or the prevailing winds to

156
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,520
see what we ought to do

157
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:56,640
and faith faith in oneself as we become faithful in ourselves this changes we

158
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:03,599
start to have this um much deeper trust in our intuitive

159
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:10,640
knowing and maybe it's something like like int intuition you know intuition

160
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:18,640
some intuitive knowing and in intuitive knowing there's there's

161
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,960
very little doubt and there's very little

162
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:29,400
self-justification it's very clean very simple kind of uh

163
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:35,480
knowing you know we know those times where it's like ah should I is is it this is it that is it like a lot of

164
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:41,599
Doubt a lot of wobble a lot of uncertainty or the other side where it's like

165
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:47,200
we pick some view or something and then we spend a lot of time justifying it to

166
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,880
ourselves yeah yeah yeah yeah kind of rationalizing it making the case this

167
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:59,119
kind of intuitive knowing is much simpler much simpler and it it often for

168
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:06,119
me is just like yes or no this can work it's

169
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:13,480
whome no this is not going to work out you know and we just become more and

170
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:21,800
more attuned to that and we become more and more sensitive to the kind of mechanisms of

171
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:26,920
self-deception the trail of self-deception we we can't we can of

172
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:34,720
course we still pull a fast one on ourselves you know but much

173
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:41,400
less and less costly we've become so sensitive to like

174
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:49,720
how we've deceived ourselves in the past that it's harder to be taken in by the

175
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:55,079
kind of mechanisms of rationalization self-justification we sort of we're

176
00:39:55,079 --> 00:40:01,960
clearing out some static we're listening more deeply as we listen more deeply we

177
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:08,240
become um better uh we refine our our

178
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:13,800
philosophy of Happiness of what it is to be happy what it is to have a good

179
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:21,720
life uh we become better at predicting what will make us happy what will make

180
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,839
others happy it's very important in this kind of path of

181
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:31,920
intuitive of knowing actually you know we say be present be present yeah but

182
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:39,160
it's actually also about making better predictions about uh what completes the

183
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:44,400
heart what doesn't and so okay given the totality

184
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,560
of conditions given my strengths and limitations uh

185
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:58,160
what what can work what can work and this is uh

186
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:04,480
this is a a kind of incredible intimacy with oneself of

187
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:12,760
of really kind of receiving the totality of data from our own system of listening

188
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:20,400
more and more subtly taking more and more um kind of subtle cues and for for

189
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:26,000
me it's a lot in the kind of like subtle

190
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,920
affective you know know feeling cues yeah

191
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,160
what you know how how is this going to be how is

192
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:42,280
that going to be and I sort of like listen in it may be very quick

193
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:48,560
process but there's like yeah I actually can feel something relaxes opens or

194
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,640
maybe something gets tense and that's good data we have to learn that's good

195
00:41:53,640 --> 00:42:00,760
data faith in our s is is uh is not

196
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:07,319
discounting that knowing it's learning to distinguish between

197
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:16,359
the the commands of our defilements and the kind of uh Clarity of our

198
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:22,599
knowing and so we we cut through more and more of the static the static that

199
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:28,520
is the story of self and and then we begin to actually

200
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:36,839
establish some faith in ourselves faith in in our view in our

201
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:46,200
view and as um as Phil up uh Philip Moffet says we

202
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:52,240
become uh we become accountable accountable to what we

203
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:58,359
know we come into uh

204
00:42:58,359 --> 00:43:06,119
deeper alignment with what we know and so what what do you what do you

205
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:14,559
already know what do you already know the knowing that's that's free from

206
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:22,880
doubt and self justification can we stay true to

207
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:31,440
that this to my mind is is how we uh we nurture

208
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,680
faith in our in

209
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:43,280
ourselves okay so I offer this for your uh your consideration and uh as always

210
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:52,318

211
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:58,440
