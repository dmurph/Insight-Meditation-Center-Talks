this Earth um both internally and externally and

11
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:15,060
internally of course there are the three poisonous Roots they're called The Roots

12
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:23,460
the um greed hatred confusion and uh it's

13
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,500
clinging to things that don't make us happy aversion that comes up even when

14
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,080
we don't want it to and and confusion about not knowing not really knowing any

15
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,780
better not in our heads but I mean our heads we might know that oh yes Lee what

16
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,840
might lead to happiness but but this this from our hearts not knowing any

27
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:07,860

72
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,980
of being alive

73
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:07,220
let there be the ocean of the breath

74
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:15,740

75
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,860

making your heart your mind your body a safe place

84
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,100
place of Refuge

85
00:13:54,899 --> 00:14:03,380

86
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:09,800
all the beauty too all the goodness that is your life

87
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:15,139

foreign

89
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:48,180
all these comings and goings in this heart and mind

90
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:54,740
this manifestation of The Human Condition can we hold it with care with good will

91
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,500
have a sense of perspective maybe a smile

92
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:20,720
especially what's happening in this moment whatever it is

93
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:34,620
noticing if there's any resistance to what's happening right now can we loosen

94
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:40,579
the resistance just a little bit soften it

95
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:49,259
and if needed re-enter our experience completely

96
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:25,760
blessings of all these experiences in this moment the breath the body

97
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:32,940
awareness even challenging experiences there might

98
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,880
be showing up

99
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:49,400
oh to be human oh to be human to be alive

100
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:59,400
to experience this moment of this passing show called our life

101
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,460
best moment fully completely

102
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:10,100
like a comment passing through the sky

103
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:15,299
daringly brightly

104
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:22,460
burning up

105
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,340
in the night sky

106
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,860
loving it fully

107
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:46,140
we don't have to like it like every aspect of it but we can love it

108
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,940
by fully opening to it

109
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,620
this opening can feel quite radical

110
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:19,100
let it feel like a radical opening embracing

111
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:30,020
the doors of the heart so wide so wide wider than usual lean into

112
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:37,200
a wider opening more than usual that's what I'd like to invite you to

113
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,799
feel into

114
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:48,299
opening more wide wider to this Human Condition In This

115
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:50,600
Moment

116
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:04,559
perhaps the same way that sometimes a cold shower at first there's

117
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:11,120
resistance ah Pleasant but then when we actually

118
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:19,940
embrace it fully open to it take the cold shower feel the coolness

119
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:28,220
on our skin really embrace it it feels refreshing

120
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,179
we feel enlivened by the energy of life

121
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:41,520
the fullness of it even if the water is really cold

122
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,600
freezing really

123
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:54,900
that kind of openness opening wide

124
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,299
The Human Condition In This Moment

125
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,440
maybe even pain if there isn't in the body can feel electrifying

126
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:30,419
I'm alive this body is alive it can feel wow

127
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:35,240
or pain in the heart I'm alive I feel

128
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:44,100
this is being alive being fully embraced

129
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,840
fully embracing The Human Condition

130
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,500

132
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,200

it's full Embraces an act of love his loving what is

135
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,039
it's a radical meta

136
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:38,039
it's loving what is with abandon it's not perfect it's

137

privilege of Being Human knowing being cognizant loving loving fiercely not turning away

166
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:35,419
even if your heart feels and meets the injustices of the world

167
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,380
loving all the sides

168
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:58,100
the humans the beings that are hurt and those who hurt all of them

169
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,140
completely

170
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:11,358

loving this tender Human Condition this planet

173
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,859
ten thousand Choice ten thousand sorrows

174
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:31,980
may we all all of us all humans and our beings wake up to

175
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,220
love

176
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:56,839
the Love's so radical so brilliant

177
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:04,040
that that it is enlivening all-encompassing

178
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:21,859
and it's who we really are may we all wake up to who we really are

179

and love completely

180
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:01,099
thank you all thank you for your practice

181
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:12,180
we have some time for reflections questions

182
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:20,700
or reports from the field especially if you haven't spoken recently I invite you first you can type in chat

183
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:25,859
you can raise your Zoom hand what did you discover what what was this like for

184
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:31,040
you offering your

185
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:37,700
insights to serve to support others your questions too

186
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:54,260
Gina says was hard to really welcome the pain but I kept trying yeah

187
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:59,579
yeah sometimes what it helps is to relax

188
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:07,260
is to relax because if we tightened and try to welcome pain as if trying is a

189
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:13,020
fist trying so hard sometimes it helps to just relax and welcome welcome that

190
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:18,119
way and I appreciate Gina that you stayed

191
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:25,200
it's there's it can transform back as I was leading the practice tonight I have

192
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,900
a lot of pain in my body and just opening up to it opening up to it and

193
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:38,420
the relationship gets quite transformed to challenges pain difficulty

194
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:44,119
this amazing Human Condition pain included

195
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:50,960
red please

196
00:38:52,500 --> 00:39:00,000
I'm wondering how to open up to fatigue without just falling down the hole and

197
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:07,440
falling asleep or being just um completely scattered in the fatigue

198
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:13,079
thought process yeah yeah yeah good question so

199
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:20,520
so there's a difference between opening up to it and falling into it so

200
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:25,859
so let me uh try to to describe what I mean

201
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:31,200
so so when I just when I talk about opening up to it it's more of a spacious

202
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:36,420
perspective so there's fatigue ah there's fatigue in the mind there's

203
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:43,280
heaviness there's dullness in the mind and the body like ah can I

204
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:53,760
or put it open up and and be be bigger than it instead of being reduced to it

205
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,040
because falling into it is kind of being reduced to it like oh so heavy so heavy

206
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:04,260
it's like uh whereas not being reduced to it there's a sense of opening to it

207
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:09,599
it's like holding it there's much more here there's much more here there yeah

208
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:17,160
the fatigues there but there's a lot else happening too does that pointer help Fred what I mean yeah I I think I

209
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:22,320
understand I'll try okay yeah it's hard but I'll give it a try thank you yeah

210
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:30,900
yeah you're welcome and and one other thing that can also help is to to help let your breath be supportive a few

211
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:36,300
deeper breaths to make space because the breath can get a little tight and tinny

212
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:43,380
sometimes in fatigue and falling into it whereas let the breath be more spacious because if you're not opening space a

213
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:48,500
little bit great thank you thank you

214
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:57,359
one of you sent a reflection privately Randy Newman describes this in a song

215
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:04,619
titled it's the rest of your life so live it well yes that was one of the aspects I

216
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:10,320
was bringing in into this practice one aspect of it there was a lot more in the

217
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:14,720
practice but yeah that was definitely one aspect of it

218
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:22,200
thank you another reflection thank you for this meditation yes there can be openness

219
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:28,020
until I come into the picture yeah yeah that's right

220
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:34,440
that's right there can be a lot of weapons and it's okay the self it's fine

221
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:39,839
to bring the self into the picture actually I want to say that not to deny

222
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:45,300
your Humanity your particularities and I think that's really important I want to

223
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:50,880
make that distinction so the idea here is not to deny

224
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,940
that we have a personhood in fact this practice really works to open up to our

225
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:02,640
particularities we are human beings we have sufferings of course of course we

226
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:09,780
do and it's okay for the self to bring please bring the self into the picture bring the eye into the picture with this

227
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:16,440
practice so that it can be loved um this expression you need to love the

228
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:23,540
self before you let go of the self so really fully loving it

229
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:29,940
Jerry says the precious the precious of the life left for all

230
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:36,000
the preciousness of the life left for all of us was emphasized yes

231
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,800
yes indeed indeed

232
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:49,260
so if any other reflections and if not let's turn

233
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:57,900
I'm gonna make the practice rooms but if there are any other Reflections feel free to raise your hand

234
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:03,680
have time and um

235
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:11,880
yeah and and you know what tell you what let's let's make some time for when we come back from the room so I'll ask you

236
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:18,420
what your relationship was when you opened up to to loving the whole

237
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:26,579
whole of humanity with all maybe I'll ask you now if anybody has a reflection about that with all of its Joys and

238
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:33,180
sorrows and the heartbreaks anything arose for you

239
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:40,800
you like to share maybe what I'll share is with this

240
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:47,040
practice again it may or may not work or maybe might just work for one Split Second something might open up there's

241
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:54,180
this tenderness of loving it all loving both the

242
00:43:54,180 --> 00:44:00,540
in all sides of conflicts EV everyone that it's it's a sense of loving and

243
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:06,060
grieving at the same time that can be so precious with this complete opening up

244
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:12,599
to humanity loving and grieving but love feels bigger can hold the grief it can hold

245
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:18,540
the so I see two hands so so now it's Jerry

246
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:26,280
and Mary and then we'll we'll go into the groups quickly Jerry thanks and thanks for correcting my grammar when

247
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:31,560
I'm just typing it it feeds in what I felt was actually

248
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:39,000
um uh following up on what you just said was this enormity of what's left uh uh

249
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:47,460
how precious it is for every one of us and who knows what's coming and so there was a sort of excitement uh about both

reminded it's part of the human condition that for me is an Incredible

256
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:32,880
Gift to just know it's not my suffering all by myself it's part of the human condition and and

257
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,819
to be present to that in to myself but with others which is what is being
