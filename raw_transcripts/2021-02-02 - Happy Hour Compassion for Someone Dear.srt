1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,799
all right so so a warm hello or a cool hello wherever you are

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,400
whatever is appropriate for your weather conditions in this moment in time

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,720
um greetings greetings and welcome to happy hour

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:25,439
so for today's happy hour um i'd like to continue as from the

5
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,800
beginning of the year we've been planning to go through the brahmavihara

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,920
and through the different categories systematically so we went through the different

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:44,160
categories of of meta loving kindness and i wanted to start with

8
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,960
the next brahmavihara the next cultivation which is compassion cultivating

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,360
compassion so compassion what

10
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,680
is compassion how is it different from from menta what's the difference between

11
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:10,720
karuna in pali and metta in bali compassion and loving

12
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:19,600
kindness what is the difference between the two the idea is that when meta when kindness

13
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:27,680
when good will when friendliness just a sense of good will and kindness

14
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,720
it meets suffering then it gets expressed as compassion

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:43,119
so compassion is if you if you like formulas compassion is metta

16
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:50,399
which is loving kindness kindness good will warmth friendliness plus suffering

17
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:57,600
so suffering that is held with worms is compassion there's so many different

18
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,880
ways to hold suffering not very helpful ways one is to kick ourselves well get it together why are you upset where

19
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,319
are you sad why are you hurting or the same way to others well why or whereas

20
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:17,680
ah when it's held with care oh sweetie this is hard this is hard acknowledging first and

21
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:24,879
foremost that something is challenging and also bringing kindness bringing warmth and

22
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,959
care to it another way that we can think about

23
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,040
compassion is that um this is a more poetic way to

24
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:45,840
think of compassion is that compassion is the love child is the love child of loving kindness and

25
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,160
suffering is the love child of loving kindness metta and suffering so the two of them again

26
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:59,040
when they come together it gets expressed in our hearts as compassion so compassion this practice of

27
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:06,400
compassion karuna is one of the brahmaviharas heavenly abodes there are four heavenly

28
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,879
abodes first metta second one being karuna compassion third one sympathetic

29
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:19,920
joy and the fourth one equanimity and we'll get to them in the next weeks and months

30
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:28,159
and these hard practices when you practice them they feel good they they

31
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,360
are relieving they are softening they're tenderizing

32
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:41,280
so compassion isn't supposed to feel painful or bad or tough or or

33
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,319
um or heavy if we veer into heaviness into sadness

34
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:56,159
we might have veered off from compassion into overwhelm into grief

35
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:04,959
into what's called empathic distress where meta where the kindness is not

36
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,400
balanced with suffering there's too much emphasis on the suffering

37
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,439
so when we practice compassion

38
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,639
we want there ideally to be there there to be a balance between how much we're

39
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,919
tapping into the suffering and how much kindness we're holding it with

40
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:32,080
so that there is this sense of holding and if there's too much feeling into the

41
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,520
suffering without enough kindness to hold it then it can feel heavy but that's okay

42
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,560
that that will happen don't judge yourself it's perfectly fine

43
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:50,560
it will happen it might happen simply they really turn towards the suffering that's coming up and hold

44
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,039
it with care with men with warmth

45
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,960
so so much to say about this topic but i'll just leave it at this brief short

46
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,880
dormant and let's practice together let's do it together

47
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,400
so so i would like to invite you invite us all to get into our

48
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,680
meditation posture and see what is appropriate for you in

49
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,919

51
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:36,479

89
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:51,199
a good friend might be having some challenges right now so when you

90
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:59,680
care about who's experiencing some challenging

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:06,839
aspect in their life could be a friend could be family member

92

so when you care about is experiencing a challenge right now

95
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,480
taking some time [Music] to connect with their felt sense with

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,839
their image

97
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:01,279
using all the senses to really connect with this person with this being

98
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:07,520
could also be a pet that's fine if they're having challenging time right now

99
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,839
or a child

100
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:30,319
bringing them to your mind's eye as clearly as possible

101
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:39,280

maybe their smell how they move how they speak

104
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,720
whereas if you were as if they were in front of you or maybe

105
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,799
easier to imagine if you're having a zoom conversation with them or facetime

106
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:14,320
or phone call just bringing them to mind as clearly as you can

now

109
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,520
and as you connect with the pain sorrow the suffering they're experiencing to meet it

110
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:04,960

147
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,240
some more so you decide what's needed in each moment

and for the last moments minutes of this

175
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:08,560
practice letting you be the recipient of your own compassion

176
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:17,838
if there is any challenge or difficulty happening for you right now

177
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,039

178
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:35,359

183
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:45,200
expanding this circle of compassion to all beings

184
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:52,480
or practicing with you right now knowing that they all have something

185
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:59,599
some challenge in their life some stress some difficulty and they have friends

186
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:06,240
loved ones they care about or going through a challenging time perhaps

187
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:13,119
wishing all of them ease all of them all of us

188
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,640
it's the human condition none of us are immune

189
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:37,200
none of us are immune from challenge and difficulty

190
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:50,800
and expanding the circle further all beings everywhere

191
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,320
may they all be free from sorrow and challenge

192
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:04,000
whatever challenge they're facing and their lives may

193
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,240
they have peace and needs may all beings be free may all things be

194
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:19,839
happy including ourselves

195
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:28,709
[Music]

196
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,799
thank you all thank you for your practice

197
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,839
so

198
00:38:53,280 --> 00:39:01,440
if you'd like to share reflections on what you noticed what came up for you what which was challenging what was

199
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:09,920
interesting what you discovered susan i'll ask you to unmute

200
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:18,000
yes hi hi i was noticing how

201
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,400
the phrase that caressing care just really touched me deeply and i

202
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:34,000
noticed how i was having some difficulty giving this person i love my sister-in-law this caressing care

203
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:41,119
and i noticed it was difficult because i needed to give it to myself first so

204
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:46,880
i started giving it to myself and then it just flowed very naturally to her before i

205
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:53,040
was feeling that resistance and i felt that happiness that i was able to

206
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,960
realize that maybe i needed it first and then it could just flow naturally to

207
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,079
her and and it felt very lovely then

208
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:11,839
beautiful thank you susan what a beautiful insightful discovery

209
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:19,119
that when your heart was soothed that that was needed then it was more

210
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:26,400
resourced to care for another being beautiful discovery thank you for sharing that yeah and

211
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,440
these practices we start wherever it's easy so if you discover it's easy

212
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,839
to turn the compassion to yourself by all means please do that

213
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:44,480
um and just to share with you since you brought this up susan i was actually going to tonight i had pl

214
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:50,960
i'd been planning to start with compassion for ourselves and then i thought well maybe i'll do it

215
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:57,680
more in the the canonical order which is first the compassion you do with with a being

216
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:05,119
who has a challenge and then yourself like okay i'll do it canonically but it's fine to start anywhere that it's

217
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:11,280
easy for you and if yourself so there's no right or wrong really at all so i really appreciate you

218
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:17,680
bringing that in susan lovely any other reflections especially if you

219
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:23,119
haven't spoken or shared in a long time in a while or

220
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,160

223
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:55,119
bill says i had difficulty focusing until i came upon the phrase may you be comforted for some reason

224
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:04,000
that made it work great great beautiful i love your self-discovery

225
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,720
here and sharing it that's great wonderful this practice is often you

226
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:17,839
know we try things we try this like oh yes and something connects yay we know we experiment see what

227
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:24,400
connects for us and what i bring are just invitations

228
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:30,480
for it says i realize that some part of me thinks that there is something wrong with suffering

229
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:37,680
ah that's a great realization that's a fantastic realization forest

230
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:44,880
um and great to see that like wow check that out and

231
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:51,599
to perhaps perhaps as i'm kind of seeing that in in your

232
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:58,319
in what you shared is that suffering dukkha is a part of the human

233
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:04,800
condition is a part is a mark is is in buddhism is called one of the three

234
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,000
marks of existence one of the three characteristics of existence

235
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,800
is dukkha's suffering it's just part of life just part of life so

236
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:22,960
and by the way i'm teaching a retreat on the three characteristics in a couple of weeks it's on my website if anyone is

237
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:30,960
interested in exploring this dukkha this suffering as a as a characteristic of

238
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,000
of of you being human jerry says i noticed a calming effect of

239
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:43,280
just letting it be at the level of amount of comfort that i was capable of tonight great great yeah

240
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:49,520
glad to hear that not pushing it clark says i often find it difficult to get a felt sense of the other person's

241
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:56,480
suffering and then it just seems like i'm doing plain meta how important do you think it is to

242
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:03,680
really connect to the person suffering should i try to imagine

243
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:09,838
them upset in as many ways as i can

244
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:17,920
that's a good question to how to support um well it's

245
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,760
so here's something you can try again without pushing but one thing you can try

246
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,440
clark is is to put yourself in their shoes like what they're going

247
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:36,079
through right now imagine oh if i were them in this moment and if i were going through this

248
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:42,800
right now how would i feel how how would that be and again not you with

249
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,920
your practice but if you were them with their background with their upbringing with their resources

250
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:55,760
right now how would i feel right now oh it'd be really hard so that's one way perhaps to find a way into it

251
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:01,680
knob says how do i cultivate more empathy for people i feel distant towards we'll get into that in a few

252
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:07,359
days now hang on to that question that we're just doing the concentric circles hang on

253
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:13,200
come back uh kyla clark italia i was wondering if i

254
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:19,040
connected too much to the person suffering and as a result ended up in the grief realm

255
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:25,599
yeah it's it's kind it's a balance right it's it's quite a balance between the two another reflection i

256
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:32,480
appreciate your words of leaning into the compassion if the suffering is difficult a friend of mine just started chemo for

257
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:38,880
cancer oh this was so very helpful tonight nikki for the framing how i can be with her suffering and mine

258
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:46,000
in not wanting her to die thank you thank you so much for sharing that yeah thank you and that was a direct

259
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,520
message so i'm choosing not to say the names if it seems like it's just directed to me but

260
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:57,680
if you want it to be public you can send it to everyone violet related to force comment

261
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:03,440
sometimes i feel like my suffering is evidence i'm not meditating enough oh

262
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:10,079
that's fascinating yeah yeah yeah suffering is is is part of life

263
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:17,119
so it's um yeah this is an interesting complex area

264
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:22,960
and i want to talk more about this there is a difference between pain suffering

265
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:28,880
personalizing it but realizing that actually dukkha is a characteristic of being

266
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:37,520
human and how do we respond to it is it first arrow first arrow is just the way life is second third fourth

267
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:44,160
arrow is what we add so have the wisdom to see if is it the first error if it's the first layer it's just life

268
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:49,680
it's disease it's illness it's what or is the second or third or fourth so

269
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:55,280
and even if it's second or third or fourth still meet it with compassion uh meet it with

270
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:01,040
compassion that's why this compassion practice is here right otherwise it wouldn't be part of the the

271
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:06,960
canon right otherwise you'll be just perfect we'll just have the first arrow and none of the other errors and all be okay

272
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:12,720
just that's why we're practicing cultivating compassion for our suffering yeah

273
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:18,800
wishing everyone on this call peace at times of suffering thank you pete lovely so there's so much more to say

274
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:24,800
but then hey guess what we have many many sessions on compassion in the coming days so i'm

275
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:30,720
not going to try to cover it all let's let's transition into practice into small group practice and

276
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:36,480
this is the invitation i have tonight as we get into groups don't start talking spend

277
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:42,720
30 seconds in silence just wishing well trusting that those

278
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:48,079

295
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:43,599

296
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:49,040
the little breakout room and i didn't know you were going to do that to us so at first i panicked and i

297
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:54,720

298

301
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:21,119
ways i discovered your podcast after a retreat so it's nice to be here

307
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:58,720
it is 701 and let's see a couple more reflections

308
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:05,440
elizabeth says a feeling of being held oh by the community the windows in the groups that's sweet and jerry says

309
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:11,680
i noticed that in the silent period that i found suffering more authentic when someone says

310
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:18,880
they are suffering rather than when they say happy ah

311
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:25,039
interesting yeah the profoundness of the silence

312
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:30,960
is nice so yeah and then asked does nikki have a podcast

313
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:37,760
well i've been i've been interviewed and different podcast which is on my website

314
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:43,839
but also audiodharma is a podcast for so yeah that's what julianne was
