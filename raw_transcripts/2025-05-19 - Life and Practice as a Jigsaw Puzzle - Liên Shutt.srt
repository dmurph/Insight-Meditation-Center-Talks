1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
uh thank you to all of you for being here um so my name is Lean Shut my

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:14,000
pronouns are she and they anyone new today tmc all right special welcome to

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,840
both of you all right i don't know about you all but um

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:30,320
I've been really tired lately and uh yesterday I took a nap it was a

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:37,760
little late it was like after 3:00 so my girlfriend and I thought okay we take what we like to call a nano nap just a

6
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,680
short nap you know because we want we don't sleep that well but we we know we shouldn't nap so we could sleep better

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,960
but we were so tired um and I will say that um when I

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:56,160
lived at the monastery I trained myself to take nano naps um uh because we didn't have a lot of

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:03,680
time um but it was very hot and tiring so I uh lie on my back when I want to

10
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,760
take a nano nap and then when I hear myself have a little snore then I wake

11
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:16,880
up and usually it's like 8 to 10 minutes and um I noticed yesterday I was so

12
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:25,000
tired that I did it three times and each time I woke up I realized I had so much

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,840
anxiety so much anxiety in my chest and uh a real pressure

14
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,799
and just tightness and I know that um you know

15
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:46,640
for the conditions of the world and uh to me and the and the nation and I

16
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,840
would say to me having lived in Egypt the stuff in

17
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,759
the Middle East is especially hard right now and um so

18
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:05,840
um I've done my share also of um destruction distraction to from the

19
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,319
unease from the worry from the anxiety and

20
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:16,400
um I like to do jigsaw puzzles

21
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,720
um as a wholesome way of distraction so I'm going to talk to you

22
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,040
about jigsaw puzzles uh this could be found in suta

23
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:38,879
number No I'm [Laughter] kidding no uh a very thick uh tome in my

24
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:47,840
life but uh not not this who does um so you know my my um I I'm adopted and my

25
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:57,280
father used to love to do puzzles so we we did it kind of was the only family thing that we did that um in retrospect

26
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:04,080
didn't have a lot of um right and wrong good or bad and uh

27
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:13,000
it's we you know we do have a form though right and um I love doing puzzles and um when I go to do a puzzle I get

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,159
actually I love doing puzzles during the pandemic it was so great right do you

29
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:25,760
guys have exchange of puzzles during the pandemic your family knowing other people yeah so whenever I get a box I'm

30
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:33,040
really very excited and um you know you you dump out the boxes the pieces and

31
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:42,680
it's a little tedious that part where you turn it all you know up so that you can see the the picture um and then

32
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:49,280
um you want that because you need to see what the picture is right um and then um

33
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:56,560
there's a lot of sorting and evaluating a lot of discriminating and discerning that's

34
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:04,000
needed right uh in my family we gather the edge pieces separately and you put

35
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,280
that together first right that's that's how we go about it and um and

36
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:17,519
um there's a certain amount of um excitement and then confidence because

37
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:25,360
you start to see pieces right that you're like "Oh I know where that one's going to go." and um and and I really

38
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:32,400
have a sense of I'm going to be able to do this a lot of confidence this is going to be so easy it's going to be so

39
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:40,360
fun and um so for me it's a really

40
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:48,160
uh exciting and fun time and I actually even because I like

41
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,479
it so much and uh I even start to imagine when it's finished when I even

42
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:02,479
when I'm opening it up I'm like in that last piece is always so satisfying isn't it so already that's there and uh so I'm

43
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:09,520
working towards that satisfaction now um as I just shared in

44
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:16,320
in my family we mostly just sort the edge pieces and then the other pieces and then we put together the edge right

45
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,680
away and um this um puzzle that I got um

46
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:29,039
which I got at Goodwill um was a puzzle of birds with birch

47
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:36,800
branches um and some you know branches coming out i'm

48
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,400
not I don't know birds or trees very well so there were six birds and I'll

49
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,520
just say there was a cardinal i could identify a cardinal um and then a a blue

50
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,680
J um and then I don't know what the other four

51
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,240
birds were but there were some black ones with stripes and uh yellow ones

52
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,280
right um so uh someone was also doing the puzzle

53
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:15,199
with me and I'll just say their name is Jane just to use a name and uh uh she

54
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:22,240
was saying that her family you know when they sorted after they finished they also then put it into bags so then you

55
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:29,840
don't have to go searching for the edge pieces again and I thought "Oh that's a good idea right that's a good idea." Um

56
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:40,160
and so uh as I sorted them into categories um I put the red ones in a pile right

57
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,759
the yellow ones in a pile what looks like maybe you see little eyes or you

58
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:55,280
see the beak and you start to put them into piles like that and that's that's how we do it and um so as we go we need

59
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:01,680
to differentiate and and actually we start to see more and more of the complexity

60
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:11,199
of what just you know is a cardo or a j or yellow bird um or birds um and um

61
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,240
sometimes some of the pieces seem very clear and some of the pieces are really

62
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:24,319
um blurry and you also start to see the subtlety of what makes up you know the

63
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:33,759
feathers like a a yellow bird can also have some ochre some uh darker color

64
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:39,840
brighter colors right so and at first that's kind of the fun

65
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,199
part and then as you start to put together it's some point it becomes anx

66
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:51,280
it's so fun at the beginning when you're doing it and then two you see two pieces and you just know you just know they go

67
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:57,759
together and you click them together and it's so satisfying and so you start to put the

68
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:05,840
bird together um but then at a certain point it isn't so easy

69
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,800
and as we're looking for different ways to um put the picture together

70
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:18,960
um we have different ways right at one point Jane said to me "I need a piece

71
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,800
with two heads and three arms you know and I give her a piece."

72
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:31,440
And she said "No no I want you know the two heads to be this way and the two

73
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,680
arms to be like this." and you gave me you know two heads this way and you know so that's not the right one and I said

74
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,839
well I you know I like to go by color more than you know the shape of it but I

75
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:51,600
thought okay all right that's different way now also started to realize um how

76
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,920
is it that we go looking for the pieces uh do we go looking for the

77
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:04,040
missing piece so here's this cardinal and I go looking for the piece piece that I think is

78
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:11,440
missing is it from a sense of the the energy that goes to look for that

79
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:18,959
because I could get really obsessive like I have to find this piece do you do that with a puzzle or not yeah you just

80
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:24,720
get obsessed in this one little corner or one image and so is there a sense

81
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:33,560
then that is there a sense of lack until that missing piece is found

82
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:42,920
is a way to go looking for the piece that fits about that click the

83
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:50,640
connection that happens is it going to look for the

84
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:57,279
right piece that's the wrong piece which is the right piece which is

85
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:04,880
the perfect piece so you start to I start to realize that

86
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,920
there's an attitude to what I'm doing it's not just

87
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,839
a matter of the task or the doing itself i mean besides the excitement obviously

88
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:22,000
that one was easy is a attitude of doing this puzzle

89
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,440
one of sharing is it competitive

90
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:37,720
is it taking over or is it being too helpful oh here's a piece here's a piece

91
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:43,839
right am I offering too many pieces to someone because often time you know you

92
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,519
say "Okay I'll take this bird and you take that bird i'll do this corner."

93
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:56,160
Right and then there's also you know I like to do like a thousand pieces right

94
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,000
so it takes more than one day i I have to admit that sometimes I've been I give

95
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,279
myself a whole day and I can do a puzzle a thousand pieces in a day those are such great days for me um

96
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:16,640
but in general uh they take several days you know and when you do it with other people

97
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:24,240
um you know people start to say I'm doing this one and I'm doing that one and um uh someone was doing the cardinal

98
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,600
and um they weren't there some of the time so I found a piece and I put it in

99
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,720
there and then I found another piece and I put it in there and I thought "Oh wait

100
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:42,720
wait maybe I shouldn't be working on this because again is this being too helpful is this doing something to the

101
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,759
point in which um I'm taking

102
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:55,920
over?" And then there's also um you know when you start to think it goes to one

103
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:01,040
bird but you realize that it starts to go with other birds especially when a

104
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:08,560
lot of puzzles they you know for the most part unless you choose like a 100 piece or 300 piece they they want to

105
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:16,079
make it a my idea I am not a puzzle maker I they want to make it kind of hard for you so right so even though you

106
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:22,800
think you can tell the distinction they start to blend so oftent time you have in this case like I had three birds

107
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,000
working at once and um uh the other person was

108
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:36,079
doing a bird that of a similar color and uh so I offered them one and they were like no no that's your puzzle there you

109
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:42,560
should keep on doing that right and so where's the sense of who's whose whose

110
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,000
part is which so how is it that we're engaging

111
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,320
with this um and and then when they said your puzzle they they walked away and I

112
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,920
thought well what what happened what happened here um where is it that when

113
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,279
we're engaging with something and it starts to be not so easy the pieces

114
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:14,800
aren't clicking together what you think is this bird is in this bird um when is

115
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,600
it or how is it that we um stop

116
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:28,720
engaging in the activity or is it that sometimes you

117
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:35,200
know you think oh especially on days in which it's um you know you're spending

118
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,320
time with someone and of course my my girlfriend and I are very busy these

119
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,760
days and um we're both essentially gig workers right we go where we're offer

120
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,680
work uh or you know teachings in my case and so we have very little time but

121
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,279
sometimes when we have time together you know it's very hard to go what do you want to do you know what do you want to

122
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,320
do what do you want to do and so sometimes you know she'll do a puzzle

123
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,560
because she knows I want to but then at some point it feels like is she engaging

124
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:15,120
just to like you know give in and So sometimes when she

125
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,160
starts to go off I have a feeling like oh maybe maybe I'm kind of not forcing

126
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,880
her by any mean but am I is there a way in

127
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:34,399
which the interest in doing this is you know not being um that's not hers

128
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:42,160
and so what at what point does it become um staying against not really against

129
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:48,399
your will you know we're talking about jigsaw puzzle but when is it that it isn't feel so smooth right and so what

130
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:55,680
is it that um when is it that we walk away and start to do something right maybe to go get something to eat maybe

131
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,279
to um you know some of it's just maybe you're hungry but but also that

132
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:08,000
awareness of when is it that I need to I divert my attention

133
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
from what's here we're moving

134
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:19,760
away sometimes though the moving is to get a different perspective you know I

135
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:26,240
generally like to do my puzzle from you know if the picture is of trees going

136
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:33,680
this way I want to be here so I see the whole picture but sometimes it helpful to go from a different angle isn't it to

137
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:41,680
look at the picture so that you can have a different sense of what might might go there what pieces might

138
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,880
fit from a different perspective

139
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,920
and then there's the um you know the way in which sometimes I'm so frustrated

140
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:00,320
that I will walk away for sure and then of course again if a puzzle is quite

141
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:07,519
quite many pieces we we're not doing it the whole time so um a lot of time we uh

142
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:15,440
you know go away and we come back and then I find myself just looking at the puzzle and uh looking and finding a

143
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:22,079
piece that's been missing you know oftent time when we do the edge we can't find all the edge pieces and you just

144
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:28,240
keep looking but you just cannot see them and then you go away and then you come back and you find one and you're

145
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:35,519
like ah that's it and when you find one then you have that energy or I have that energy in which I go okay I found that

146
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:43,320
one so there are more here I will find more and then again you find yourself

147
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:50,000
obsessive so I go away and then it becomes this this sense of ooh maybe

148
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,600
it's lucky to like go away and then come back so this sense of when is it that

149
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:03,199
I'm this is my doing and when is it that I let go in

150
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:09,839
some sense you know it became kind of a joke like it's lucky we we should just go away and then we come back it is it

151
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:17,120
just fresh eyes I don't know do you know but and we I know my girlfriend and I sometime we impute the sense of luck is

152
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,438
it really luck I don't know but it feels that

153
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,360
way then there's also you know when I uh doing this blue

154
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:36,000
J i had all the blue pieces in front of me and I'm putting together and they

155
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,080
don't fit you know keep on doing then they're pretty limited number of pieces

156
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:51,360
and so then I go to the you know those piles where you're not quite sure where any what what is and I keep looking for

157
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:58,320
pieces that I know go to the blue jay so I just keep looking and keep looking

158
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,720
and yet all the pieces are in front of

159
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:10,480
me all the pieces are in front of me

160
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,760
right so maybe you already got it but what I'm

161
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,720
trying to point here is that there are

162
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:35,440
patterns of thinking and perceiving

163
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:45,320
uh condition ways of processing and being with information and being with situations

164
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:58,799
i mostly think I go to do a a jigsaw puzzle because of the content right

165
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:06,880
there's a picture you get it you know jigsaw puzzle has a picture it's a very clear what the end result is and so and

166
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:13,679
it's about putting it together it's a task and yet the process of how that

167
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:19,160
picture comes together how you engage with it

168
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:27,080
is shows itself in the doing now I want to be really

169
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:34,120
clear right what did I list some is it looking for a missing piece a sense of

170
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:41,480
lack is it about being competitive is it about being you know mine and

171
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:50,000
yours right now I want to be very clear that um noticing these habitual patterns of

172
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,720
either perceiving or thinking um one is not better than the

173
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:06,520
other right noticing them is the key right

174
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:12,520
there is something in Buddhism called uh personality view right

175
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:18,400
sakayai so how is it that when you you make contact with something and

176
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,480
then all your habitual thinking around it

177
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:29,039
your poncha you could say your grouping of stories that go with it and then you

178
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:35,320
solidify it into a sense of identity and sometimes when we

179
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:45,240
recognize a habitual pattern then we go I'm a competitive person oh no I'm

180
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:51,200
greedy right oh no I'm so right and wrong or of course you're doing it to

181
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,919
the other people that you're doing the puzzle with

182
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:07,280
so I would like to say that practice isn't so much of figuring out whether

183
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:14,440
I'm a greedy person or a competitive person it isn't so much um to

184
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:22,679
solidify against a sense of self right uh it's more about being

185
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:30,120
aware and open in that moment of perceiving a

186
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:36,360
pattern and maybe not rush so much to interpret what it

187
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:41,880
means can we stay there and see and

188
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:50,600
investigate what what is right there what happens right there do I

189
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:56,120
contract do I shame be it self or

190
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:05,480
other do I um what is the movement of both heart and mind at that moment

191
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:16,039
you know I know that um with practice I think that

192
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:23,799
um a dharmic moment a time in which I am practicing well is when I'm

193
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:30,840
compassionate and open very classically we could say without hate greed or

194
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:41,080
delusion um and yet mostly in practice I find I hate greed and delude a

195
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:47,640
lot right and so to me that's a dharmic

196
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,760
moment that's the opportunity

197
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,080
that's the fun

198
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:07,880
really in some ways our practice isn't actually it's great it's great to

199
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:13,720
come to a dharma talk or a meditation or a

200
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:21,080
chant or service but a dharmic moment is when

201
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:27,200
we wake up Right we have a sense of what is

202
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:34,880
happening a clarity of knowing and we we rush to figure out

203
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,320
what we should do about

204
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:47,200
that and I'm not even telling you that this is what you should do i'm suggesting I'm suggesting that that

205
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:55,799
moment is a moment can you just stay open and noticing what happens right

206
00:23:55,799 --> 00:24:02,520
then very much in sensation very much in the quality of

207
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:08,679
feelings by that I mean emotions very much in the quality

208
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:12,000
of thinking

209
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,400
And there is also a sense of a choice in

210
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,559
that moment it isn't purely a moment of

211
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:38,400
awareness it's important and in that moment you have a choice of how you

212
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,960
interact with what you're aware of and how do you keep on interact with

213
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,080
what you're aware of right even I know when I think well what

214
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,440
happens right then I think of a whole process right I need to figure out the

215
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:03,200
pattern I need to go need to go like this right and sometimes we see that as we practice but the and the practice

216
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:11,600
isn't to necessarily look for that all the time right so it's actually what is here then

217
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:17,200
what is here then what is here then what is

218
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:23,200
here i don't know about you but in the meditation obviously I'm giving a dharma

219
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,840
talk so I think about the dharma talk then I go what is

220
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,919
here i think about you know I'm having lunch with someone afterwards so I

221
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:41,240
brought lunch but it's in the fridge and lunch I want to remember the lunch you

222
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,679
know so I worry about that and then I go oh what's

223
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:52,159
here what's this moment of you know there's a practice of

224
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:58,480
going ah anxiety when I go lunch right certainly and in some ways I'm saying

225
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,159
that that you know is part of this puzzle thing and there's Also what is

226
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:09,039
right here what is right here what is right

227
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:16,919
here so it's the same heart and it's the same

228
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:24,120
mind doing a cross word puzzle sorry a jigsaw puzzle and the sitting

229
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:30,960
down to do the jigsaw puzzle and the doing of the jigsaw puzzle and the

230
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,360
getting up from the jigsaw puzzle and the

231
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:41,919
interaction about what you do with the cross jigsaw puzzle obviously I have

232
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,000
crossword puzzle in my mind so every

233
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,360
moment is an opportunity to be

234
00:26:52,360 --> 00:27:00,000
aware and not a task there's no having to finish in some

235
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,360
way the puzzle i mean in some ways you know it's a

236
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:19,120
um it's a way I you know I'm also aware that doing a jigsaw puzzle is a way of

237
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,159
not really control i haven't maybe I'm just waking up to that part of myself

238
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:31,600
around a jigsaw puzzle that is about control well I'm just noticing that right now because I was going to say you

239
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:39,200
know to do a jigsaw puzzle um you buy the picture you already know you already

240
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:45,320
know what's what's the end result maybe it's also about what which ones you find

241
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:52,240
interesting to put together you know my father loved those ones that are like

242
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:59,039
this in the 80s so remember all right there was one of the stairs going to he liked those kind

243
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:04,720
enough and then also people like to give him puzzle you know you know how dads are the very limited things you feel you

244
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:11,520
can give them so you know one time we got you know a black cat with two yellow eyes was big

245
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:17,039
square one so much black so much black

246
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:22,799
I've just I do not like those kind of puzzles I I'll confess actually I wasn't

247
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:29,000
I was going to add this part but I'll confess because you my favorite kind of

248
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,200
puzzles are so busy so busy like a yard sale puzzle you know those yard sale

249
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,799
puzzles or the garage that's just filled with things and I know I like it because

250
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:45,919
hey there are many little things I can put together and then they're done right

251
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:53,760
and so that's fun to me to go from thing to things right so obviously my mind is inclined towards

252
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:00,640
certain ways of being with conditions right and

253
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:06,039
that's okay when I'm doing a jigsaw puzzle at least when I do it's for fun it's it's

254
00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:14,559
not it's not a challenge in the sense of you know I have to do something

255
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:24,640
hard and is it is it that wanting to know what is going to be the end result

256
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,120
again that last piece is so

257
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:36,640
satisfying so how we do a jigsaw puzzle or how I do a jigsaw puzzle is really

258
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,440
about engaging in the

259
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:51,240
pieces in the heart and the mind as I am doing that and with others

260
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,640
the thing is also puzzles come to you even if you go to buy one unless you you

261
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,720
know buy the wrapped one like you go to Goodwill and even it has tape around it

262
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:20,760
or saran wrap you can get home and there are pieces

263
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:28,679
missing what happens then so maybe maybe we

264
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:35,919
think maybe you already have a jigsaw picture of your rest of your day

265
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:42,039
that you're going to go and find the pieces to put in and who you're going to do it

266
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:47,480
with and maybe you have a jigsaw puzzle view of the

267
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:53,919
world and how the image that you would like it to

268
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:00,440
be and that's okay you already have

269
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,559
it might as well be okay with it

270
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:11,159
and how it comes together

271
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:19,320
is and how you respond as you interpret how it comes

272
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:27,480
together to me is practice which actually isn't

273
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,880
different from living

274
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:41,240
maybe the difference as a practitioner is there is there an

275
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:47,559
awareness of what is here what is the hearts and mind

276
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:54,279
response what is the hearts and mind allowing

277
00:31:54,279 --> 00:32:01,840
for input and what is the heart and mind as it

278
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:08,760
negotiates the view we have

279
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:15,480
chosen and the mirrored things that come forth and reveal themselves to

280
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,039
us thank you for

281
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:26,030
listening all right are there any pieces you'd like to share with

282
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:33,760
[Music] me and I always invite people maybe a

283
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:40,080
little shy maybe you wouldn't be the first one to talk to so give it a try but it's not

284
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,960
it's a it's a choice

285
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:51,440
actually Lean um your talk really moved me um particularly because um my brother

286
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:59,360
got Alzheimer's and he at the beginning of Alzheimer's he was very very good at jigsaw puzzles he could do ones that I

287
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,640
couldn't do and then of course as the disease progressed he had to do simpler

288
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,080
and simpler ones and eventually he couldn't do them at all in fact I

289
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:16,080
remember a moment when we had the edge pieces there and he took one out and put

290
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,760
it in the middle and I thought "Oh dear." Okay it's not about

291
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:27,760
completing the puzzle it's about being together and um eventually he got to a

292
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:36,960
point where he couldn't put uh words together in a sentence but he would say the pieces the pieces and uh so it's

293
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,159
just your your talk is making me think of my brother in very fond ways and

294
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:49,480
thank you thank you Martha i feel it in my heart that story thank you

295
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,919
hi um tell me your name please oh I'm my name is Ken hi Ken and uh thank you for

296
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:06,600
the talk you know in in part of your talk you'd mentioned the decisions or making a

297
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:12,440
choice can you expand on that in in terms

298
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:20,638
of like you know you're you're going through and doing the jigsaw puzzle and

299
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:27,839
uh you you find a piece and you decide what you're going to do with it

300
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:33,520
and how that relates to the dharma talk and

301
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:40,919
well that's a lot to be said about choice um let let me see if I can frame it in a way that

302
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:48,440
maybe resonates for what what your question is in some ways I

303
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:53,919
know that um I see the world as like a

304
00:34:53,919 --> 00:35:01,119
jigsaw puzzle sure sometimes I think oh I choose an image

305
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:07,920
And um and then I say "Oh I've made a choice to work in this section." And I

306
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:15,680
think it's useful because there's so much here right especially when um in some ways I go to do a jigsaw

307
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:23,040
puzzle because things feel overwhelming maybe now now I'm getting my control thing in a little bit here

308
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:29,599
right because this is something I can do something about right and I actually can

309
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:34,720
for myself can have fun doing it but noticing when it doesn't become fun as

310
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:41,119
part of a moment of choice but it so at first we approach things by saying do I

311
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:49,359
have a choice or not and then for many of us we think oh I don't have a choice here right even

312
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:54,560
though we've picked the p the picture and we say I'm going to work on this

313
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:01,760
section part of practice is realizing when does that section that you made the

314
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:10,720
choice when does it that you think you don't have a choice anymore it doesn't work it doesn't fit i

315
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:20,160
can't put this together and then you start to What do you do then right do you go off to do

316
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,839
another piece and you know that's not bad like in a jigsaw puzzle we can say oh that's just I'm going off to do over

317
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:32,359
here and in some way our practice is that we say there's certain things that you focus on

318
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:38,640
right in my family we focus on the border right first so there are some

319
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:44,560
parameters of how we can view and certainly you know Buddhism will give

320
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:50,560
you a view the the fornable truth is the view of Buddhism right they're suffering

321
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,839
their origins are suffering uffering there or causes right and then there's the end of suffering and then the

322
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:04,400
eightful path so in some ways we're we can be given a view but Buddhism isn't actually um that's just the map but the

323
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:13,800
ter the and the the the doing the traveling is where you start to see

324
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:20,760
oh how do I relate to the view of the world right and with

325
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:29,079
practice there's there's several ways of talking about you could say I need to keep on until I understand if I have

326
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:36,000
chosen this view of the world right i keep on meeting it with

327
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,960
the teaching of how to view buddhism gives you a teaching of how to view

328
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:51,280
right but the and the practice is not that there there's skillful ways and

329
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:59,359
unskillful ways for sure and hopefully it has less greed hate and delusion that would

330
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:05,079
be the main thing in Buddhism right if when we have a choice we go

331
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:13,280
towards non- greed or renunciation uh I hate greed um so greed

332
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:19,599
is renunciation hate is um meta right so towards goodwill instead of ill will and

333
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:27,920
then towards karuna or compassion instead of cruelty right so yes in some way that's it but the the

334
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:36,359
doing or the understanding that you always have a choice right because what

335
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:42,800
is renunciation i could I could tell you what the sut says with some notes you

336
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:50,320
know like what is what is renunciation but until you go and practice it and

337
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:55,520
realize what kind of choice you make and pay attention to what might be the

338
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:02,560
result that might be the other thing so don't forget the first no truth is really the the eight-fold path to

339
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:08,320
understand sorry the the way to understand the first of the eight-fold

340
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:14,079
path is skillful understanding or skillful view of the world which is what

341
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:20,359
the four noble truths and and this is the part that people forget

342
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:28,040
karma karma is the big view the big big

343
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:36,839
big view and the big big view that's dependent upon causes and

344
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:42,200
conditions right so and causes and

345
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:50,480
condition is dependent upon choice volion karma means action

346
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:57,440
volitional action actually so it's not just passive action we might think that things come to us and we're we're

347
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:04,720
passively receive them but in each moment we have a choice about what we do about it hatred certainly can come our

348
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,640
way and we can be taught hatred without a doubt we're all taught hatred we're

349
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:16,640
all taught hatred i have not met a person who has not been taught hatred

350
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:23,839
whether they become enlightened from that something else but we're all taught hatred what do we do at that moment what

351
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:29,760
do we do sure there's teaching to help us but and in that moment we have a

352
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:38,240
choice and yes we have teachings to help us know how to make better choices or

353
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:45,680
the choices towards nonharming and some of that has to do with really having a sense of what is the motivation

354
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:51,440
which is a second part of the eight-fold path right skillful thinking which is

355
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:58,319
act the wisdom part which is actually thinking is not passive in Buddhism thinking is always purposive because our

356
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:03,359
thinking becomes beliefs which then goes into the sila section of the A-fold path

357
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:11,680
which is the interactive skillful speech skillful action and skillful livelihood or living I like to say so that our

358
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:19,520
thinking is really more um per um I like to say motivation because it your

359
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:26,000
thinking drives you that's why I like the word motivation it gives you both the aspiration and it gives you both the

360
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,440
drive to do it gil likes attitude attitude to me I like attitude but to me

361
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:38,400
that feels a little bit more big you know I have an you know I have a attitude which which I can become

362
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:45,520
certainly i like motivation because I feel like oh there's a little bit more wiggle room right uh attitude feels a

363
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:52,079
little bit like a little tight you know but then it can get that for sure does that answer your question i'm

364
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:57,440
I'm in in many ways yes okay yeah it was very you know choice is so big right

365
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,760
