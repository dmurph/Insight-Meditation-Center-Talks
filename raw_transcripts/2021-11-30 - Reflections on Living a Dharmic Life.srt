1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,440
wow nice to see you here and um jamie and jane on youtube

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,200
thank you for your note glad you're with us

3
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,800
um so um i've been

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:30,720
contemplating uh the living a reflective life right a

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,079
dharmic life and uh

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,000
oh yeah yeah please so i've been contemplating what it means

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,480
to live a reflective life a dharmic life and

8
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,840
you know in simple terms right it's uh it's not

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:03,120
dharma to cause harm and it it is dharma to refrain from causing harm

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,080
and the discourse

11
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,640
advice to rahula and majima nikaya 61 is a a really great

12
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,720
set of instructions for living a reflective life

13
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,560
so i'm going to talk some about that and i'm also going to talk about how

14
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:35,680
much sila ethics non-harming are a part of that and

15
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,360
and how maybe some ways that we can

16
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,439
engage with reflection that on some layers that maybe we don't normally

17
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:55,200
do um and some of the personal like and uh biopsychos

18
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,640
bio psychological aspects of our minds and beings that can impact

19
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,520
and complicate our connection with our experience and our reflection process

20
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,200
so um

21
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,680
yeah so you know um

22
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,440
you know the dharma is a manifestation of non-harming it's the embodiment of non-harming right and this becomes

23
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,280
possible as we live a life that's reflective

24
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,720
and you know sila and our ethical actions and this

25
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,080
non-harming is incredibly important aspect of that but also

26
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,200
is deeply connected to how well we can settle how we can be mindful and

27
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:57,920
concentrate and and that leads to our capacity to connect with wisdom

28
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,800
so they're separate but deeply intertwined and connected

29
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,400
so in the discourse on advice to rahula

30
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:19,519
the way the buddha teaches it is often kind of considered just a foundational

31
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,720
kind of teaching for how to live a dharmic life right

32
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,799
and so rahula is the buddhist son and

33
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:37,280
the buddha is said to have left his home the night that his son was born

34
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,280
to go and and to seek happiness a different way of living

35
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,200
and he came back to his village when rahula was about seven

36
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,840
and um one of the ways i've heard the story is that um

37
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,680
his mom probably wasn't so happy with the buddha for his splitting

38
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,080
leaving her and his son told her son to go find the buddha and

39
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,599
to tell his father that he was there to

40
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:19,440
collect his inheritance his birthright and to ask for it

41
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:26,400
and so rahula comes to meet the buddha and

42
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:32,960
relays this message and what the buddha does is uh instructs

43
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:41,280
sarah putta to welcome rahula into the monastic tradition to become a monk

44
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:49,199
samana and training not probably what he expected nor his mom expected right but um

45
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,720
so he was about seven and this teaching is the first teaching

46
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,360
there were three teachings that are that i'm really aware of that are big teachings to rahula in the sutras and

47
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,039
this was the first of the three and i don't know how old exactly rahula was

48
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,160
i've heard seven i've heard nine um but young

49
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,000
and um so you know the setting is that rahul has

50
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,840
you know been meditating in his little spot and he sees that the buddha's so he prepares a seat for the buddha and gets

51
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,440
water for his feet so the buddha can wash his feet when he arrives and

52
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,400
comes and you know the buddha comes and sits down and uh

53
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,120
talks to rahula and

54
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:50,800
kind of the sounds like sort of the first thing he says to him is that those who are not embarrassed and

55
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,120
knowingly telling a lie have thrown away their life as a samara

56
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,960
so it's implied it's not said in the story that rahula lied but it's a

57
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,319
pretty clear implication and buddha takes the bowl of water for

58
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:14,560
washing his feet and says something like see how little water there is in here is like throwing this water out and

59
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,880
wasting it and then it's like whatever little water is here turning the bowl upside down and wasting

60
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,800
it and then um and then he goes on

61
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:34,199
and he says to the rahul he says what is the purpose of a mirror

62
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,479
and when his son answers he says for reflection

63
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,400
and then the buddha proceeds to give him teachings on how he is to use his

64
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,759
actions as a mirror for reflecting on the consequences of

65
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:58,400
what he does and the pali word for reflection has the

66
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:05,360
same dual meaning as it does in english right so it can refer to the reflection in the

67
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:12,240
mirror as well as when we're reflecting in our mind when we're contemplating when reflecting on

68
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:20,319
things giving it time yeah the consequences so both

69
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,720
are here right watching what what we do seeing that seeing the consequences of that and

70
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,319
contemplating in advance and afterwards

71
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,800
so in this lesson he is

72
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,520
you know speaking to rahula about reflecting on all actions body speech and mind

73
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,759
so our thoughts included and not just

74
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:58,319
on our actions but their consequences on ourselves

75
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:04,000
on others and both self and other

76
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,840
and to help him and guide him on what he should reflect

77
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,919
on to help him with this task the buddha instructs rahula to consider three

78
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:21,199
questions so

79
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:28,400
if he is anticipating whatever this action is will cause harm

80
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:35,680
he should not initiate it he should stop not proceed

81
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,919
so that's before right during an action

82
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:49,200
so we assume let's say he thinks it's not going to cause a problem but if he's reflecting and he notices harm

83
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,839
is occurring while in the middle of an action he should stop

84
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,080
sounds really simple doesn't it is it always this simple i don't think

85
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,440
so right it's not always sometimes it's so clear but you know

86
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,000
yeah and um and then afterwards

87
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,959
if rahula realizes that the activity has led to harm of any kind

88
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:27,360
that he should first tell this to his teacher or to a wise spiritual companion

89
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,600
and then practice restraint in the future

90
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,839
now if rahula understands his actions are wholesome

91
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,600
skillful not causing harm and leading to happy consequences

92
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,800
he can engage in them freely says the buddha yeah

93
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,760
so he also

94
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:06,079
kind of talks about um these these there's this three pairing in here harm and non-harming

95
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:13,120
wholesome and unwholesome which also could be thought of as skillful and unskillful and suffering and happiness dukkha and

96
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:19,040
sukkah so we have reflecting before during and after

97
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,880
and we have reflecting on the impact for self other and both

98
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,959
and then we have reflecting on these three potential ways to evaluate

99
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:36,639
what's been what we're contemplating doing or have done

100
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:44,320
so the buddha gives him this guidance and it he doesn't say okay

101
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,640
don't do these things he says reflect right so this is so much about the practice

102
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,000
the art of our practice is you know we it's

103
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,440
no it's impossible for us to have it be about just what we do and

104
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,120
don't do right it's a complicated life complicated relationships

105
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:13,200
so many possibilities of things that can and can happen it's so interesting how

106
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:20,560
much the buddha pointed not to these you know mandates but rather to staying aware staying present

107
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,839
and connected and and reflective about what's happening what's

108
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:33,200
happening and in this in these instructions [Music]

109
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,440
you know he is really really enforcing reinforcing the idea of impact

110
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:46,720
over intention so often we get caught right if we've done something

111
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:54,839
maybe i should just speak for myself if i've done something and my intention was not consciously to cause

112
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,320
harm but i have you know some some way

113
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,560
triggered something in somebody or caused some harm it's uh

114
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,160
can be a little bit automatic to want to respond by clarifying what my intention

115
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:19,200
was instead of just staying with what the impact was

116
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,600
just really honoring that because that's the consequence right and it may not be that i did anything

117
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:33,600
horrible but if the consequence of an interaction is to cause some distress

118
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,519
i want to attend to that first right not not try and protect my ego or

119
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:45,600
my my goodness right my my image or whatever it is

120
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,639
but it gets tricky it can be sticky in this space right

121
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:59,920
so i really appreciate this focus on noticing the impact having that feedback

122
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,200
be what we pay attention to that we honor that more than

123
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:12,959
what we were thinking we were doing or trying to do i also think it's incredibly inclusive

124
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:19,120
to really spell out that we don't want to harm ourselves we don't want to harm anybody else

125
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,959
and we don't want to harm both right so it's not like um

126
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:31,120
well i can i can harm myself but not harm you right or harm you but not myself it's like no

127
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,839
no no we don't want to harm anybody

128
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:43,600
the other thing that um really stands out to me that seems quite um

129
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:51,519
i don't know really important and social you know it's uh relational is that the

130
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:57,839
buddha tells us to go talk to somebody when we reflect and we've seen that what

131
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:04,480
we've done is causing harm he encourages us to to to share it

132
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,560
to not keep it quiet and hidden

133
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:17,519
to make amends potentially even right to make it to bring it into the world and not not just let it

134
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,720
sort of be quiet inside so

135
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,480
all of this says to me you know we're living a life of caring

136
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:35,360
to care we need to care about what our experience has been what things

137
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:41,040
have been going on and um and to do that

138
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:48,560
means we need to to look to listen to re-look

139
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:56,399
and i think that for me another area that

140
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:03,360
where this is uh invites a deepening is you know how do we really know when

141
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,680
we're causing harm or not causing harm

142
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:16,800
how often you know are we actually paying attention to the subtle suffering

143
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,800
that we're experiencing or asking others around us if we've

144
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,920
harmed them in some way how often are we just sort of assuming

145
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:34,560
that what we're doing is the norm and it's fine or whatever right there's it would be

146
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:41,480
impossible to do this constantly but um but it's also

147
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:47,360
well maybe it's not impossible right but it's a challenge

148
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,639
and um again this is where i come back to sort

149
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:01,920
of the incredibly important part of being connected with our direct experience and sila

150
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:08,639
to me uh i think this zela points to experiential

151
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,560
very much experiential and what's happening in our bodies and our

152
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:20,560
hearts and our minds and noticing contraction you know noticing

153
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:27,439
dukkha reactivity in our lives

154
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:38,320
and noticing also the opposite right when we feel ease at ease and we feel happy and

155
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,240
we feel like we've been skillful i was uh reflecting

156
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:54,399
i you know had this question huh did i avoid causing harm today

157
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:00,880
do you know did you can you think of anything this is just an invitation for reflection

158
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:08,720
but can you think about a moment in your day where you avoided causing harm

159
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:24,000
i was kind of thinking well you know some some days i will accidentally kill an insect

160
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
like i didn't that didn't happen today that i know of right and i don't often sit there and

161
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,440
think at the end of the day i might think about it if i killed an insect right

162
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,480
well that will come up for me but i don't often just say oh well did i

163
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,799
avoid causing harm today i think so

164
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:52,240
i think so um

165
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:58,880
and then was there a time today where you reflected before

166
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:05,200
you were choosing to act was there a time today where you

167
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,720
thought about what you were going to do and decided yeah i can do this this is this is wholesome this is skillful

168
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,200
you know this will bring happiness

169
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,360
did you stop an activity because you noticed that it wasn't

170
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:30,160
continue because you noticed it still was did you reflect afterwards

171
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,919
so one of the reasons i think that it can be a little

172
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:47,440
tricky or that we might be able to look a little bit more deeply

173
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,960
is that we actually have

174
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,480
there's you know the felt sense of our experience right we have a nervous

175
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:04,000
system and we have something called interiorception and exteriorception

176
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,760
and so we have all these processes happening that are kind of

177
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,360
hap you know taking in interior what are the sensations happening in my body

178
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:22,160
inside what am i receiving from the world what's the external sensations that are

179
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:29,600
coming in and and then we have a mind that is

180
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,120
based on per you know it predicts it's a prediction organ

181
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,400
and it predicts based on past experience

182
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:47,039
so you know that's means that when we're experiencing something

183
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:53,760
internally or externally and the brain is associating with what past experiences

184
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,799
it may or may not be getting it right right it may or may not be getting it

185
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:04,080
right so this idea again of how important it is

186
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:10,240
to continually reflect right because the brain will catch up things will

187
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,840
catch up as our experience continues to unfold we will be taking in more data

188
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:21,520
right we'll be getting more feedback if we're open to it and continuing to attend

189
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:27,840
but it requires this sort of a constant attunement and re-attunement

190
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:34,720
so there's that process happening there's the vedna response right the

191
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:41,440
sen the sort of feeling tone of our experience i've had people um

192
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:48,880
say to me that they they think that they're feeling anxiety and then later upon further reflection

193
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:55,440
they realize they're actually excited right so this is an example of when they think

194
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,679
it's anxiety they have a it's an unpleasant response

195
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:09,600
when they recognize its excitement then it feels more like a a pleasant

196
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,960
response either one of those interpretations

197
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,240
creates a different behavioral movement

198
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:26,400
right so if something feels good then we're tending to be more open and

199
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,799
to follow it if something doesn't feel good we tend to pull back and shut down from it

200
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:38,159
but sometimes the information the somatic information and the story or the

201
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,760
historical data don't all match up so

202
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:49,280
in one of the ways that um one of the ways one of the strengths

203
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:55,840
that the dharma speaks about is uh these we have this something called hirian of

204
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:03,360
tapa shame and remorse and they're said to be the guardians of the world right

205
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:09,360
and and what is the treasure of conscience there is the case where a disciple of

206
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,960
the noble one feels shame at the thought of engaging in bodily misconduct verbal

207
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:22,000
misconduct mental misconduct this is called the treasure of conscience

208
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,679
but i know for me that shame right

209
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,799
is complicated this is an example of sort of historical

210
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:38,080
you know the brain's history of experience with shame that how

211
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,200
you know i can see in my own mind that that um

212
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,320
there are times when i can feel that little nudge of shame like oh no this is

213
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:55,440
probably not a good action to take and i feel like there are times that i don't i just don't want to feel

214
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:02,159
like it feels there's something about not wanting to feel shame i don't want to feel the sense of shame so i think that

215
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:11,120
there's this way that we can especially when we've been really shamed and humiliated or

216
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,480
feel a lot of just we just generally tend that way

217
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:24,000
i think we can shut ourselves off from some of our inner wisdom right if we're we're aren't clearly

218
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,600
noticing our reactivity to something like the more pure form maybe of shame which

219
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,360
might be and i think about the western perspective of shame brene brown who's a

220
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:43,520
shame researcher she says shame is i'm bad

221
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:50,720
guilt is i've done something bad right and that's an identification i am right

222
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:57,440
and from a buddhist perspective we have the opportunity to really say okay i'm not my actions right

223
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,720
so if if i can if i can make that shift and not identify

224
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:10,159
i think we don't have to have shame become toxic we can actually use it to support ourselves

225
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:18,320
so there's some interesting research you know around shame um

226
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:26,720
that uh it's there's some people who hypothesize it is our primary social emotion

227
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:34,480
you know it's an interesting thought um it's shame informs us right of an

228
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,799
internal state of inadequacy and unworthiness dishonor regret or disconnection

229
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:47,440
is another person's view another way to say it is shame is a clear signal that our positive feelings

230
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:54,559
have been interrupted that's kind of a simple simple way with less reactivity in it

231
00:24:54,559 --> 00:25:02,240
right sort of oh there's something here the positivity the flow has kind of halted here

232
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:10,159
and you know when i'm thinking about trying to live a life where i'm not causing

233
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:17,039
harm and i uh if i get too caught up in trying to

234
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:22,720
never cause harm it's uh i can make myself feel very you know

235
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:29,520
unworthy and bad but i really uh have to think and focus that it's not

236
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:36,320
really about being perfect that it's much more about staying connected that it's never too late to

237
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:43,919
reflect that we can reflect before during after and after and after and after

238
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:49,600
right that we don't it's never over we don't have to you know in a way if we

239
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:56,960
if we uh think it's done we cut ourselves off from the opportunity for kind of letting

240
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:03,840
something free itself i guess is the way i put it

241
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:11,039
and one of the things i found when i was looking into all this research on shame

242
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:16,320
i got kind of fascinated with it in japan

243
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:24,559
in the the teaching and the teaching style from what i read in the research is actually to utilize mistakes as

244
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:32,080
for learning in the classroom so they actually are students are directed to find their own way through difficult problems

245
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:40,640
and then the teachers lead discussions about the common errors and why they might seem plausible

246
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,760
and so in this way they're they're really bringing

247
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,200
sort of uh that opportunity to struggle and to make a mistake

248
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:57,919
into the environment as a place for sharing and learning

249
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:05,120
whereas in america the students are you know taught how to avoid making stakes

250
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:11,360
mistakes that's the real emphasis and the teaching in general from the research i was reading

251
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:17,039
and so students are rewarded and praised when they don't make mistakes right

252
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:22,080
and in general here if we make mistakes they equate to some sense of failure

253
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,120
and hence shame there's a great quote from [Music]

254
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,320
eleanor roosevelt it's learn from the mistakes of others you

255
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:39,919
can't live long enough to make them all yourself right i love that it's so great

256
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,039
so you know dharma practices uh

257
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:52,799
you know it's not an escape right it's an intimate meeting with the discomfort of reactivity which is stress and

258
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:58,320
suffering the first noble truth and it's incredibly important to turn

259
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,640
toward that when it happens so

260
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,799
one of the this is just a very small example

261
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:18,559
of my personal experience but i picked my daughter up from the airport last night

262
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:25,360
and i had dropped my son off at 4 am and i was picking her up at 10 pm

263
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,960
last night and i had sent her a text during the day just letting you know i'd been up since

264
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:38,320
four so i was just you know hoping i'd be there to pick her up and when she got in the car

265
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:45,039
she made this comment about um it was kind of this sarcastic karma

266
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:50,080
comment about you know oh i'm glad you know thanks for going

267
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:55,200
through all the trouble to come and pick me up right and there's just this like

268
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:03,200
little edge in her sassy voice and and i just you know i was like

269
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,799
i reacted i i definitely reacted and i

270
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:14,240
um instead of kind of looking at the impact i was

271
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:21,440
there defending my intent no i said i'd pick you up i'm just letting you know i'd been up and

272
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,640
um and so it was kind of this like you know my

273
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:33,600
charlie brown sounds um and and then this morning

274
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:40,720
right um i was reflecting on it had a little bit of sleep and i thought about and i thought you know i kind of i think

275
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:47,840
i hurt her feelings and that's i i think you know i think that i didn't i couldn't see that or say

276
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,679
that because i was reacting and so i just sent her a text this morning and saying you know i'm sorry if i hurt your

277
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:58,960
feelings yesterday you know and she didn't respond to that text but

278
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:05,279
she did to several others right so i knew that it was okay right

279
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:11,279
and uh so that's an example for me of you know

280
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:18,159
reflecting afterwards right and not just right after the right after but the next morning after and maybe even after i had

281
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,840
come up a few times for me in my mind it had come up

282
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:31,039
there's this there's this really beautiful inspiring idea and attachment

283
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:38,880
therapy and theory which is that you know there's rupture and repair

284
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:45,279
and we don't need to avoid rupture it's just we just need to pair it with

285
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:51,279
repair so here's a quote from bonnie badenock who wrote a book called the

286
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:56,480
heart of trauma healing the embodied brain in the context of relationships and

287
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:03,679
she says when we experience a break in connection followed by repeated attempts at repair

288
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:09,760
until the bond is restored we build implicit pathways of resilience

289
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,039
right so when we have a break in connection followed by

290
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:22,000
restoring that bond right we build an implicit pathway of resilience bouncing

291
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,279
back and we come to know in a visceral way and so this is coming back to that idea

292
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:32,559
of the body the somatic knowing that when things break down

293
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:38,639
interpersonally someone will return to help us come back into relationship

294
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:45,760
and this wired in optimism and expectation makes it much more likely that we will form lasting relationships

295
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:52,960
that have this quality as we accept and then rejoice in our humanness and we offer this vital gift

296
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:59,200
of rupture and repair to those around us and i think this teaching that the buddha offers is

297
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,679
isn't is you know sort of supporting our ability to repair

298
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,720
if we don't think it's too late and we think you know don't expect ourselves to

299
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:18,279
have to be perfect maybe the perfection is in recognition and reconnection

300
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,399
yeah so

301
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:43,120
this other part of connection around this teaching of going and telling your teacher right if you've

302
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:49,360
done something that you think caused harm gill says he wrote confessing to someone

303
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:55,360
else and exercising restraint in the future are characterized as growth

304
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:02,000
in the path right this is you know it's if you make a mistake you harm somebody

305
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,480
and you go and you talk to your spiritual friend it's not considered that you've regressed

306
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,398
it's actually considered growth right

307
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:23,120
yeah and um back to the well let's see here yeah

308
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:28,880
um so well speaking of gil so um i'll say

309
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,320
you know one one of the things that happened a couple things happened for me when i was early

310
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:40,320
and my relationship with gil one was that i was

311
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:46,240
helping pack boxes to book book boxes to ship off to the prisons

312
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,880
and i was in this room and there's this beautiful table this conference room table

313
00:33:52,880 --> 00:34:00,080
and uh i had this big heavy tape gun very heavy tape gun and i pulled it off the package and you

314
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:05,440
know how they have those ridge ends so i break the tape and boom

315
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,358
take a big chunk out of the table right i was just mortified and he wasn't there at the time right

316
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:17,200
and i just remember being like oh my god oh my god oh my god what am i going to say i felt so you

317
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:23,599
know non-mindful and you know talk about shame and wow well i couldn't you know and i'm like i

318
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:30,480
gotta tell him right so i tell him and he was so kind right he was so kind

319
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:38,000
and there was another situation where i was managing in that bell i hit the bell

320
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,118
so loud everybody jumped at the end of the meditation right it was just like oh my god

321
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:49,200
and uh you know one of the things that he said i don't know both times one of the times was you know there are no

322
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:56,800
mistakes here there are no mistakes here like it's all okay it's all included

323
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:04,000
so this to me this is such an important balancing point to um our intention to

324
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,520
practice a harmless harmless life right is to really hold all of this and we

325
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:17,839
don't have to be perfect right we just need to stay connected we need to stay aware and open

326
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:24,800
um and mistakes you know like we learn a lot from them

327
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:30,720
most people i talk to have learned more from their mistakes if they're willing to open up and and

328
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,320
sort of process them and share them not keep them in secrecy

329
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:42,560
most people feel like they've learned a lot more from those things than just a simple success mostly probably because

330
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:48,560
we didn't have to try so hard when something's successful right

331
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:55,760
so here's another another quote on

332
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:01,599
mistakes failures are not just inevitable

333
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:09,200
excuse me failures are not just inevitable but are a necessary part of the process

334
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:15,040
a good mother is not one whose baby never cries but one who knows how to respond and

335
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,880
soothe her crying baby and we learned that to be part of the

336
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:27,800
solution we must be willing to be experienced as part of the problem

337
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,480
so

338
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:42,240
i think i'll just one more quote and i'll i'll wrap up and if anybody has any

339
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:47,839
comments anything they want to share i'd be delighted to hear anything at all from

340
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:55,440
you but this is a quote by sue johnson who

341
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:03,359
does a lot of attachment and couples work she says love is a constant process of tuning in

342
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:08,640
connecting missing and misreading cues

343
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:14,880
disconnecting repairing and finding deeper connection

344
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,880
it's a dance of meeting and partying and finding each other again

345
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,279
minute to minute and day to day

346
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:34,240
so any any responses to these reflections

347
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:40,320
should they connect with you in some way and feel relevant to the

348
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,760
teachings that buddha gave to rahula or how you engage

349
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,839
let's um bill get him the microphone

350
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:08,720
no i don't think you need to stop tanya during your um

351
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:15,680
talk i was got me to thinking about something i i like to think of my body as an early

352
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:23,200
warning system yeah so if i'm about to say or do something yeah harmful

353
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,559
you know the anger results in all kinds of

354
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:35,440
events in the body contractions you know yeah in heart or stomach or

355
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:42,240
quench jaw clench fingers quench hand yeah and then i what i got to

356
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:48,720
what i thought for understood for the first time is if if you're about to do

357
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:54,000
a physical harm those early warning systems in your body

358
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:01,040
are real obvious like you know like you know let's just say a raised fist boy

359
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,240
that's obvious that's easy to notice yeah comparatively yeah

360
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,800
speech

361
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:18,800
it's harder to notice the early warning systems the chain of events

362
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:24,800
is so fast you get ticked off and then

363
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:31,200
it's really i mean they're there and then i like to think that

364
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:38,000
um if you meditate a lot time kind of slows down and you have more time

365
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,079
it seems like to notice all that stuff and to maybe oh i won't go there

366
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:49,760
and then if you're having thoughts that are harmful those go by

367
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:55,280
too fast yeah yeah so um i mean my example with my

368
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:01,599
daughter is a great example of speech that you know not like i said anything horrible i didn't swear i didn't say

369
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:07,920
anything mean but the reactivity was there right and i think we just start to try and tune more and

370
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,359
more into just that that reactivity that feeling right there's still a feeling in the

371
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:20,240
body of clenching or tightening or you know for me it often feels like

372
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:26,720
a pulling back like there's something that feels like it's pulling back so

373
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:34,240
i agree it's harder and that the practice you know the more we slow down

374
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:40,720
and also there's you know mindful listening practices right where we can really

375
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:47,760
pay attention purposefully pay attention to our body as we're speaking

376
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,200
purposefully slow our speech down

377
00:40:53,200 --> 00:41:00,400
and these things help you know i don't think i've done that

378
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:09,200
practice it sounds like it sounds great thank you yeah thank you bill i appreciate your sharing

379
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:26,240
i am found this very timely coming after a

380
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,440
a holiday that usually is spent with many family members

381
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:37,920
and um we had a little family drama

382
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:45,280
as many people do i guess around these holidays and so i was reflecting a lot about what you

383
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:51,520
were saying um in regard to those circumstances

384
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:58,240
itself and trying to re remain out of the fray and not get activated and

385
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:04,480
um wildly failing at that

386
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:10,000
and trying to recoup but what bill was saying about you know using your body as

387
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:17,480
an early warning system i don't know if it is

388
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:25,920
not sure what it is but it seems the more i've practiced that when

389
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:32,640
i get activated or when i do something where i feel like i've caused harm

390
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:38,079
is i actually feel the pain of it more and i don't know if it's because i'm

391
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:44,640
finally noticing it how badly it feels or because i've become more sensitized

392
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:52,319
to it i'm not sure what that is but um maybe both yeah yeah anyway it's a great subject

393
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:57,520
for timely yeah and let me just say um i think

394
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:03,760
another complicating factor is um if we're really tuned in to that

395
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:11,039
uh oh i'm you know feeling harm and there's some degree of that

396
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:17,040
slight shame response i'll call it a clean chain response a non-toxic response

397
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:22,880
this the the nervous system is still likely moving into actually shame

398
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:28,800
physiology which means that our capacity to think and reflect

399
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:35,040
uh diminish are diminished and we move more into a frozen state

400
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:40,480
so it makes it harder it makes it harder to like

401
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:46,560
to have access to full access right to our capacity to

402
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:52,079
connect and relax and all of that so i think it's just it's just it's a challenge

403
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:58,640
because we're dealing with a physiology that wants us to do the opposite of what we're going to try and do

404
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:08,960
i also just wanted to say the trains are unbelievably active tonight nice to hear

405
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:15,040
him again [Laughter] thank you all so much for being here and

406
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:23,119
may the time together be of benefit to you and all those you meet and everybody and the

407
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:29,200
whole world all beings so be well thank you
