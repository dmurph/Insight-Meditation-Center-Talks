00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,960
Hello everyone and welcome to this guided meditation session that's part of

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:14,160
a larger series of exploration of what the insight of insight meditation

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:21,680
uh points to and um surprisingly the topic for now I think about seven

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:29,039
seven sessions has been the second uh insight not that we're not surprising

5
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,480
that we're doing it. But surprising that we would spend seven days, seven

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,079
sessions talking about suffering, insight into suffering,

7
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:46,559
the bu the ability to recognize something profoundly important about how

8
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,399
we suffer, how we feel distress, how we get

9
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:59,440
caught in stress, how we get caught in emotional unnecessary emotional pain.

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,000
unnecessary emotional reactivity, unnecessary

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,560
uh attachments, clinging, resistance in our life.

12
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,119
So maybe this will be the last uh time on suffering before we move to the third

13
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:26,960
insight. And um and so but uh one of the very

14
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,560
significant approaches to insight meditation is when

15
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,720
we're able to see our suffering, understand, recognize our suffering

16
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:46,320
in um highlight or in contrast or together with seeing the first

17
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:56,000
insight, seeing change, seeing inconstancy and uh non-ontinuity and and

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,079
impermanence of the experience. all the ways in which change happens

19
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:12,000
and one way or the other suffering what Buddhism is calling duka

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,599
the very the thing that the kind of suffering the kind of emotional pain

21
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:25,040
that that Buddhism is addressing one way or the other

22
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,480
involves A a

23
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:38,080
freezing of the mind involves a tightening of the

24
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,400
mind. Involves a holding the mind tight and steady, tight and caught in

25
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:51,440
something where that caughtness feels like there's continuity of attachment,

26
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,200
continuity of pressure. And it's kind of a solidification in the

27
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:06,319
mind, a kind of a stopping of the mind. It's a kind of um preoccupation of the

28
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:14,560
mental activity that's gotten glombmed on, stuck into some concern, some

29
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,599
preoccupation, some thought, some idea, some emotion that we have.

30
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:29,760
And in doing that uh there's a semblance feeling that we're now no longer moving

31
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,239
along letting things flow in the river of change. that we've somehow

32
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,920
picked up a bucket of water and we think the river is the the water

33
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:49,840
in the bucket and it's a really heavy to carry that bucket and if you have to carry that bucket all the time uh the

34
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,680
the burden of that the suffering of that the tiredness of that

35
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,799
uh will gets more and stronger and stronger until we return the water to the river

36
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:09,439
where it belongs. And then the water flows. Then we can float in the river. We don't have to

37
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:17,120
carry the water. The water carries us. And so to begin recognizing where the

38
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,880
mind has stopped around thinking, stopped around some preoccupation.

39
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:30,160
Of course, it hasn't stopped completely. is maybe chewing, ruminating on our concern, but there's something has kind

40
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:38,320
of gotten solidified. Some people like the idea that it's gotten frozen because then it can thaw.

41
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:45,840
Some people the idea of being it's now become um there's a kind of a permanence

42
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:52,560
a kind of a continuity just like if you held your fist tight

43
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,880
all the time in a certain way the continuity of that tightness

44
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,880
is more prominent than a a hand that's fluid and changing

45
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,400
and moving and being with things as they are.

46
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:18,198
So to begin appreciating how the mind seizes up,

47
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,039
it could be very very mild with the lightest of thoughts that we

48
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:32,080
just kind of get get involved in. We can feel this little kind of

49
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,000
tightening or it can be quite strong.

50
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,560
And then to allow the mind,

51
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:51,280
the concerns, the attention, the the the to set it free, to make it loose,

52
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:58,479
to flow, to not hold on to anything, not reject anything.

53
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:04,639
Oddly enough, not accept anything or reject anything.

54
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,560
Finding that a third option, neither accepting

55
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:18,240
nor rejecting, but flowing with all things

56
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,280
without having to believe anything or not believe anything,

57
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:30,240
without needing to act on whatever arises.

58
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,759
and maybe also not needing to not act unless it's going to cause harm, unless

59
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:42,960
it's going to it's going to continue the way we get locked in.

60
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:50,479
So to assume a meditation posture and to

61
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:58,080
maybe kind of sway back and forth a little bit, you know, shake, move

62
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,000
the shoulders, rotate the shoulders. Kind of sitting down to meditate and

63
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,360
maybe rotating your head.

64
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,680
kind of letting there be movement and flow and that kind of loosens things up

65
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,759
a little bit in your body. Flapping your should your elbows.

66
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:34,919
Kind of tapping your fingers so that shaking your fingers so they loosen up. The hand loosens up.

67
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:50,520
And then gently closing your eyes

68
00:07:53,039 --> 00:08:01,639
and feeling whatever feels loose

69
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:11,319
in your body. Whatever feels kind of light

70
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,000
in your body.

71
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:28,560
Wherever there's a sense of ease in your body, even if it's just a little

72
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:36,120
square centimeter somewhere in your body, feel the ease.

73
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,440
Maybe feeling the pleasure of

74
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,640
maybe the lips touching.

75
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:58,920
Maybe a small half half smile in the lips

76
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,080
and feeling into your body

77
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,399
deep within where the breathing begins

78
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,880
to Feel a place of stillness

79
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:32,959
and ease. A stillness where nothing is held.

80
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:39,399
A stillness that's more like the still quiet air

81
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:49,240
of a dawn above a still lake.

82
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:11,720
And there arises from within an inhale.

83
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:22,200
Maybe the inhales come quickly, forcefully. Maybe they come slowly, gently.

84
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:44,160
Maybe you can have a feeling of receiving the sensations

85
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:53,079
of breathing in, allowing them to appear.

86
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,040
Receiving the inhales

87
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:18,440
and allowing the release of the exhales. Close.

88
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:49,240
And as you exhale in an easy way

89
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:56,279
with the kind of ease that where there doesn't have to be success.

90
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:02,360
As you exhale, relax your body.

91
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,240
Soften different parts of your body.

92
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:53,279
And as you inhale, feel any way that your mind, your brain

93
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:59,959
is tense, solid.

94
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,399
Maybe locked in in some way

95
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,760
tight in a fisted fist in the mind,

96
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,880
caught in anything at all, even the slightest thoughts.

97
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,720
Feel that pressure, tension,

98
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
stress.

99
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:40,519
And as you exhale, soften the mind.

100
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:58,480
Soften the tension, pressure.

101
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,560
And as you're aware of the rhythm of breathing,

102
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:13,639
let that rhythm carry to your mind a gentle massage.

103
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,279
carry up to the mind

104
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,519
kind of

105
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:35,120
flow of awareness. That's like water

106
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,600
softening, dissolving

107
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:48,360
whatever is hard in the thinking mind.

108
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:59,399
Whatever is tight in our preoccupations.

109
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:24,920
Feel the fixations of the mind. no matter how light small they are

110
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:33,600
but don't become fixated on it. And that's the role of breathing

111
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:41,360
to keep us help us be aware gently softly

112
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,600
neither accepting or rejecting anything.

113
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,360
Just holding the fixation in the flow of

114
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,680
awareness, massaging it,

115
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,319
softening it,

116
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,240
melting

117
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,679
If you have a concern that you're

118
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:38,799
caught in preoccupied with, you don't have to let go of the concern.

119
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,960
Let go of the tension, the pressure.

120
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:49,080
behind having the concern.

121
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,280
Feel that tension. Feel that pressure.

122
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:09,399
And notice how it creates a solidity or a hardness.

123
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:26,120
That keeps you from flowing

124
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,799
in the changing river of now.

125
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,600
And then as we come to the end of this sitting

126
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,000
to notice now

127
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:19,158
is there any way that you are calmer than you were at the beginning.

128
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,000
Is there any way that there's a deeper place of ease

129
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,480
or stillness

130
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,039
that is a bomb is a medicine

131
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,200
for any way in which the mind might still be tight,

132
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:59,080
hard, Tense

133
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,399
under pressure.

134
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,919
And with whatever calm you have,

135
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,279
see if you can not be troubled.

136
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:28,480
by any mental tension, pressure,

137
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,760
preoccupation you have.

138
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,520
Let the calm.

139
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,200
Appreciate the changing

140
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:53,158
nature of tension and pressure. mental

141
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,600
hardness and solidity.

142
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,960
Hold it all lightly.

143
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,640
And in doing so,

144
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:19,279
identify more with the calm and the lightness

145
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:25,640
than with the heaviness or tension or pressure.

146
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:33,200
Be the calm. Be the lightness

147
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:39,720
that knows what is not calm.

148
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:07,360
And then without accepting or rejecting any part of

149
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:13,760
yourself, can you gaze upon the world

150
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:21,799
kindly? Can you gaze upon the world calmly?

151
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:38,279
Gaze upon the world with generosity, wishing well for everyone.

152
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:47,440
As you would wish well for yourself, wish well for others.

153
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,158
May all beings be happy.

154
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:59,480
May all beings be safe.

155
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:08,200
May all beings be peaceful.

156
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,919
May all beings be free.

157
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:30,089
[Music]

158
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,278
Thank you.

159
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:46,080
So hello and welcome to this

160
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:52,720
series of talks on insight. The core recognitions

161
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:58,720
that uh arise from doing mindfulness practice. the core recognitions that

162
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:06,480
help set us free, loosen us, liberate us from clinging and suffering.

163
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:15,039
And one of those deep recognitions, deep seeings, deep revelations is a deeper

164
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:21,760
understanding of suffering. And it's a big word. We've been talking about it now for a number of days.

165
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:28,960
And um and but one important aspect of it is to

166
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,240
appreciate that uh whatever it is that Buddhists are talking about when they

167
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:40,799
talk about suffering that it comes with tension. It comes

168
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:49,360
with a holding on tight. It comes with a sol a solidification of some inner parts

169
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:56,480
of ourselves. The mind, the heart, the inner life gets frozen, gets stuck, gets

170
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,080
uh locked into something. So there's a whole series of words that can be used

171
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:07,519
that are near synonyms. Maybe some of these words work better for others.

172
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:16,320
But um uh if um if I am angry with something

173
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:22,480
and I need to express that anger to other people or believe I have to and so

174
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:29,519
I make a fist in order to express myself and I pound my fist into my other hand

175
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:34,720
and um and um you know insisting that

176
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:41,600
the English language has too many letters to keep track of. It's too many letters. We should have fewer letters.

177
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,960
And um and uh yes, I can be in a campaign to

178
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,080
change the English language. Uh and but I could be suffering if I'm

179
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:58,640
trying to do that and trying to get everyone on the bandwagon and insist how right I am and how important this is.

180
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,960
And there might be good reasons for this kind of idea.

181
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:11,679
uh but I'm suffering because of it. So I could be looking at my suffering and

182
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:18,079
trying to understand why I have this idea. What's the philosophy behind it? What's the linguistic elements of it?

183
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:23,919
what's the real right count for letters and maybe you know just caught up in the

184
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:32,358
ideas of it and I don't notice that I have my hand in a fist

185
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:38,398
independent of whether I solve the issues of the number of letters in the English language

186
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:45,200
I be I just relax my hand life becomes so much easier without that

187
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:54,720
fisted hand without that tightness and contraction and eventually spasming of the hand. It I can separate out the

188
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:00,800
concern about letters with from the tension in which my hand

189
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:08,160
is in. So in the same way we might have very good concerns we have

190
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:14,800
much more important than number of letters things that we're attached to things that are really precious and important

191
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:21,119
for us and we're suffering because of it we're stressed because of it we are

192
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:30,720
burdened by it we feel sometimes oppressed by some things sometimes we feel fear and that's the um sometimes we

193
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:37,839
feel ambition sometimes we feel disappointment and uh hurt and many many

194
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:46,160
things that we feel. And if we're kind of concerned with the subject of the

195
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:53,440
suffering, then we might be caught in a maze of

196
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:59,520
concerns and he said, she said, they said preoccupations.

197
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:05,839
But instead go look and see where the tension is. Where's the pressure?

198
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:13,599
Where's the locked in? Where's the the the tent the the tightness?

199
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:20,880
Where's the uh agitation? Where's the

200
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,920
clinging, the craving? Where's the leaning forward? Where's the pulling

201
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:32,000
back? And um the deeper way to really address

202
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,800
the topic of suffering in this insight is not to stay with the details and

203
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:45,040
complexity of the subject of what we're concerned with, but rather to really

204
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:51,359
take responsibility for the relationship we have to that subject. But in doing

205
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:58,400
that, don't think even more. The art of mindfulness is to learn to feel, to

206
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:04,720
sense, to experience the sensations of

207
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:11,520
that come with suffering. the tightness, the tension, the pressure, the clinging,

208
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:17,760
the locked inness, the shutting down, the turning off, the

209
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,800
um the giving up, the all these different

210
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:30,240
kind of ways that can feel like, oh, there's where the holding is. There's where the dropping away, you know, kind

211
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:36,960
of pulling back and escaping is the desire to run away. Feel all that. So

212
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:43,280
that and that then you start feeling where we're resisting change, where

213
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:49,599
we're standing against changed, where we're kind of solidifying,

214
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:56,160
tightening up, making something more constant art artificially.

215
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:02,079
Artificially in the sense that it's an artifact of the mind,

216
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:09,040
of our attitudes. that are holding on tight.

217
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:14,480
So the art of mindfulness is to take a deep look at where the solidity is,

218
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:21,040
where the incon where the constancy is, where there's the continuity that comes

219
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:26,880
from holding on tight comes from a physical

220
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:33,280
uh a physical and even in the mind it can feel physical or almost physical.

221
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:41,760
the the pressure the the the tight constellation the narrowing of uh

222
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:47,440
happens in the awareness of the mind around some concern some preoccupation.

223
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:55,119
It can be that um that the weight of something we talk about the weight on our shoulders. The weight of a

224
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:00,880
responsibility is not in the responsibility.

225
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:07,359
It's in that you know the ways in which we have phys almost physically tightened

226
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:14,160
up solidified locked in gotten frozen around something.

227
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:20,720
There's a wonderful story of Ajang Cha, the famous uh Thai monk who was a

228
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:27,760
teacher for many of the early vipasa teachers, inside teachers

229
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:34,079
uh and uh who was going for a walk with someone and said pointed I guess to some

230
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:40,960
really big boulder and said to uh and asked is that boulder heavy and the

231
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,960
student said oh yes it's really heavy. And um and Ajan Sha said, "No, it's not

232
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,400
heavy. It's only heavy if you try to lift it."

233
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,760
And so what are we? So the burdens of the world, we're holding up the burdens

234
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,599
of the world because we're trying to lift it. Maybe it's not necessary to

235
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:10,640
lift anything, hold anything. And the benefit of this is that when we

236
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:17,040
tighten up, when we contract, when we get fixated,

237
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:25,119
when we cling to things and crave for things, we're actually narrowing

238
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:31,119
the our intelligence, narrowing the scope of our heart, our emotional,

239
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:38,000
mental sensitivity. We're losing touch with the wide range

240
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,760
and scope by which our understanding, our wisdom, our care, our love can

241
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:50,640
operate. And it's counterintuitive because the preoccupations we have can be so

242
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:55,839
important and we need this. We need to protect myself. I need to have this. I

243
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:02,720
need I have to take care of this. I have to criticize myself. I have to figure out something else.

244
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:10,599
And that insistence is part of that tightness. That insistence is part of that sense of physical pressure.

245
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,960
And so but it has so much authority.

246
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:26,800
But to learn over time that we are wiser, more caring, more open, more intelligent

247
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:32,720
when we don't get locked in, when we don't get caught.

248
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:40,720
and the and when we're free. And so this insight into suffering in

249
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,480
Buddhism is very much supported

250
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:53,359
by really being mindful, really seeing and recognizing

251
00:41:53,359 --> 00:42:00,400
the actual tension that's there with our suffering.

252
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:08,680
So, you might have some cause, like changing how many letters there are in the English alphabet,

253
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:14,319
but pay attention to how you're insisting that things should be different and how they have to be a

254
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:20,640
certain way and how you're going to, you know, really change the English language, change all the dictionaries in

255
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:26,720
some way. Pay attention to how you're making that fist.

256
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:33,280
Don't tighten up. You can still make effort to change the English language,

257
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:41,920
but at least don't compromise your hand. Don't compromise your compromise your heart. Don't compromise your mind. Don't

258
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:48,400
compromise the the quality of your inner life.

259
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:55,599
Your inner life is precious. Letting go of tension. letting go of

260
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:06,079
pressure to allow the inner life to to grow, mature, free, develop

261
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:13,119
um in beautiful ways. It is possible.

262
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:18,960
And um so this insight into suffering

263
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:24,920
is such an important part of not suffering.

264
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:30,720
So thank you very much and I believe that that's will be the end of the

265
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:37,760
discussions here about uh suffering. Maybe we've suffered enough now. Um but

266
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:43,359
there's one more area of suffering that uh that is so important that it is

267
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:51,520
considered the third important insight to have uh and that is um into this uh

268
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:57,920
perplexing topic for many people of not self

269
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:03,920
and um and that'll be the topic uh when I start up this up again unless some

270
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:10,319
reason there's revelation happens once is suffering some more.

271
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:16,960
So, uh I'll be away for two weeks. Uh next week, uh Ying Chen is coming and

272
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:23,119
she's a wonderful teacher. She's been here before on YouTube and I'm very happy that she'll be with you the

273
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:29,280
following week. um in the way things are working out. Um we're going to do a

274
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:35,599
replay of the of right near the the the beginning of the year when we were doing

275
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:41,359
samadei. Samadei is the foundation for insight and I thought it might be go

276
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:46,960
nice uh while I'm away to go back to the beginning. And so uh we're going to uh

277
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,480
do a rerun and play the third week in the samadei series that had a lot to do

278
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:59,599
with uh developing samadei around breathing. And uh hopefully that's a good foundation for when I return after

279
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:04,800
that to pick up the insight into not self.

280
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:11,200
And finally um uh maybe I've said this enough. I apologize. But uh for those of

281
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:17,520
you who would like to study more of the things that I I'm going to be offering in the fall, I have three programs in

282
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:22,960
the fall. Uh one is this call called Anua

283
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:28,400
which is uh a 11-month program on um

284
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:36,240
looking at one's uh practice life, dharma life, spiritual life through the lens of um the parameies, the

285
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:42,800
perfections and 10 spiritual themes that come out of the world of western world

286
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:48,319
of chapency, spiritual care. The other is uh the chapency program itself. It's

287
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:55,119
a beautiful wonderful program that we offer both online and in person and uh I

288
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:01,040
do the inerson part and uh this is for people who want to be involved in in uh

289
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:06,560
volunteer or professionally in the world of spiritual care

290
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:14,319
and then um uh the um third is through those are both through Sati center.

291
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:21,440
The third is uh offered through IMC and that is um called the equivalence of

292
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:27,440
ethics and enlightenment and it's a program it's a eight ninemonth program

293
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:33,520
uh looking at the foundational teachings of ethics in the teachings of the Buddha

294
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:40,800
and how it applies to our life um and appreciating that ethics and enlightenment at are not really two

295
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:48,480
different things and um and they are integrated deeply from the beginning and end of the path of practice.

296
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:53,520
So um u may you

297
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:59,040
uh be uh suffer wisely over these next

298
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:06,319
uh two weeks and uh when we come back we'll uh continue this series. Thank you

299
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:09,640
very much.
