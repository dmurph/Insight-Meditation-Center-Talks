1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,120
so my friends I think that uh we

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,359
have

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,480
sound and we

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,320
have

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,840
um so you have sound and you have a

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,519
picture and yeah so that took

7
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,320
uh a long time to figure it out so we

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,039
had various problems here there was uh

9
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,640
the LA turned out out that the laptop oh

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,920
I'm

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,360
echoing

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,559
um yeah so the problems were that

13
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,000
somehow someone was here yesterday and

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,680
disconnected the

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,360
laptop and so all kinds of things were

16
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,120
disconnected and then somehow the all

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,280
the settings for the broadcast uh

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,800
platform we have Were Somehow scrambled

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,280
and so to understand the broadcast

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,839
system and uh a new

21
00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:06,960
was uh you know I haven't gone that

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,479
deeply into it

23
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,600
before so um so here we

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,118
are and

25
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,759
uh U was trying to figure out what how

26
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,799
Gil got to choose an

27
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:24,840
osprey the Osprey is a

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,000
um is

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,560
a a bridge device

30
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,280
that connects the video camera from the

31
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,320
video camera to the

32
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,600
computer and um and

33
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,110
so

34
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,269
[Music]

35
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:47,439
so

36
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,159
so I don't think now in these next few

37
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,759
minutes I want to try to start up again

38
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,759
in the theme that I did last uh but I

39
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,240
think what I'll do is um finish this

40
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,320
five-part series on

41
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,240
Monday uh with the fourth Noble Truth

42
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,239
and then uh next week I was going to do

43
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,959
um the four the noble truths of

44
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:15,879
Happiness this is what we did this

45
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,840
week's the noble truths of

46
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,800
suffering and maybe that works really

47
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,040
well because then I don't won't won't do

48
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,879
an introductory uh Monday I would just

49
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,000
start on Tuesday with uh the

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,519
four noble truths of happiness which is

51
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,720
not a not a tech a um Buddhist concept I

52
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,159
just made it up but it's a building on

53
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,000
Buddhist teachings to offer the other

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,280
side of uh the four noble

55
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,800
truths because in fact as much as it's

56
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,920
important in Buddhism to study suffering

57
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,239
understand suffering enter through go

58
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:58,239
through suffering it's also it's equally

59
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,840
important to understand happiness

60
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,440
and to enter into happiness and even in

61
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,760
a certain way go through to the other

62
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,319
side of happiness and what would that be

63
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,560
the other side of Happiness it's not

64
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,000
suffering it's something even better

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,799
than suffering than than even happiness

66
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:17,360
so we'll do that next

67
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,560
week and uh and I'm very aware that uh

68
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,480
we

69
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,159
have

70
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,159
um the

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,680
international national and maybe local

72
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,799
challenges of all kinds and some of them

73
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,000
are very local to individual people of

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,959
you

75
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,760
all and um and uh in my own way I'm

76
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,879
trying

77
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,560
to uh address these things for all of us

78
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,640
offer support through these teachings

79
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,239
and it maybe not not uh in a direct way

80
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,760
but in an indirect

81
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,040
way and uh I'll continue to do that for

82
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,599
a while problem

83
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,159
so um thank you very much and I see that

84
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,079
there are you know I can read the chats

85
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:12,000
and you know maybe if there's a a single

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
question that someone wants to ask about

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,880
the the topic of this week or something

88
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,160
um I can try to uh say a few words for

89
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,639
you uh before we stop at

90
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,120
7:45 and

91
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,039
um so it was very nice to be with you in

92
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:35,880
this few minutes to finally get it

93
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,360
working and

94
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,600
um

95
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,479
so it's very nice to see your names

96
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,520
and I saw earlier I saw on the other

97
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,120
laptop I did see that the people were on

98
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,800
even though the camera wasn't working

99
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,120
and that's I was glad to see that the

100
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,199
YouTube channel at least was on and

101
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,919
um

102
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,160
so well what's the fourth the fourth

103
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,000
Noble Truth is the Noble Truth to the

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,319
end of suffering and it's a it's the U

105
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,919
it's the path of practice that uh has

106
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:26,039
this wonderful dual nature that it's

107
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:30,199
both the uh the path that uh that uh

108
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,720
leads to the end of suffering but it's

109
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,199
also the path that uh emerges with the

110
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,600
end of

111
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,039
suffering and so that this dual nature

112
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,240
is quite quite fascinating and uh so

113
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,720
I'll talk a little bit about that next

114
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,759
week and

115
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,120
uh some teachers say suffering is

116
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,000
unavoidable and sometimes they can be

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,759
ended are these two different types of

118
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,560
suffering that's a good question uh um

119
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,840
the

120
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,360
uh uh I think that in ordinary human

121
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,199
life um uh one way or the other people

122
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,280
are going to suffer and that it doesn't

123
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,360
mean non-stop but sooner or later we

124
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,560
have all kinds of things and the is the

125
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,840
the art of it or the the challenge of it

126
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,400
is uh to understand what is optional

127
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,319
suffering and what is the emotional pain

128
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,960
that just comes with being human being

129
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,720
that we can learn to not send any second

130
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,720
arrows

131
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,479
to that we can uh just uh see as um part

132
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,160
of human life that we have to accept um

133
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,680
sickness old age and death is inevitable

134
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,720
part of the world and it is a kind of

135
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,280
suffering uh perhaps or but um but it's

136
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,160
not uh the suffering that arises from

137
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,120
clinging and craving and so really the

138
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,759
formable truths is

139
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,479
addressing uh the optional Suffering The

140
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,000
Suffering that we contribute to the

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,759
second third fourth 100th arrows we add

142
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,160
to our

143
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,840
life and uh and so you have to always

144
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,840
kind of uh and and the idea that's this

145
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,080
word Dua suffering is uh means different

146
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,840
things in different contexts is uh goes

147
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,000
back to the time of the Buddha and uh so

148
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,840
we have to uh appreciate that that um

149
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,039
and they have that you know you know

150
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,319
which type of suffering are Dharma

151
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,400
teachers talking about when they say

152
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,240
that it's

153
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,720
unavoidable and which kind of suffering

154
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,840
are they talking about that is avoidable

155
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,280
that that can come to an end and um and

156
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,479
in the classic teachings and maybe I'll

157
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,520
talk about this next week uh in fact all

158
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,599
suffering can come to a phenomenal end

159
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:59,599
um uh with a uh um but that even that is

160
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,039
temporary because some of the

161
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,680
unavoidable sufferings of Being Human

162
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,520
will return later uh as our bodies get

163
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,000
older and creakier and

164
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,440
achier it's possible to go into these

165
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,159
deep states of meditation and have that

166
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:18,000
disappear and then returns when we come

167
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,159
out of those

168
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:22,879
States so but uh the emotional suffering

169
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,560
the emotional the optional emotional

170
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,720
pain that we are responsible for that

171
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,839
can come to a complete end and that

172
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:37,279
doesn't have to return um and so that's

173
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,279
why it's possible to go through life's

174
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:43,800
challenges with much more ease and peace

175
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,000
when our contributions to it don't cause

176
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,519
us to be
