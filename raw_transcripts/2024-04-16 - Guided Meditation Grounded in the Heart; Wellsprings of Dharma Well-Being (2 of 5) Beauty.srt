so welcome welcome welcome we are in the second of five day series this week

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,160
happy to be with all of you and the Fay series is on these Wellsprings of Dharma

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:23,800
well-being inner and interpersonal well-being so noticing the well-being of

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:31,679
being together with sa of sitting being here

5
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:41,760
and since we start with a sit I want you to start by noticing if

6
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,079
you're one of the folks who engages in chat notice how it feels to be engaged

7
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:53,600
notice how it feels to see greetings from old companions long-term companions

8
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,640
new companions on the path and take that into your heart

9
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:07,920
take that into your heart including

10
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,920
acknowledging the beauty of Love even love

11
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,200
lost so a warm warm heartfelt meta to

12
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,920
all of you especially anyone experiencing loss and

13
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:44,320
grief and noticing those of you who are tuning into the conversation the

14
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,960
feeling in your heart and letting that spread

15
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,759
through your actions through your thoughts through your body

16
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:10,640
and then when you're ready turning inward maybe taking that last sip of

17
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,280
tea finding a comfortable

18
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,200
posture softening or closing the eyes

19
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:38,160
and attuning to any sense of

20
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,040
care Beauty well-being

21
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,319
within if it's helpful noticing the way you feel

22
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:02,440
supported held by the chair hair or

23
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:08,200
cushion perhaps your feet in contact with the

24
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:17,560
floor held by Gravity by the boundless support of the

25
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,040
Earth by the presence of virtual

26
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,599
sa and taking a deep breath or two

27
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:34,400
longer slower gentle

28
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:48,239
breaths and allowing the exhale to soften your body heart and

29
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:56,400
mind into presence being here

30
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,480
and allowing the breathing to be

31
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:34,160
natural tuning into the felt sens ations of this life's

32
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:57,360
breath noticing the ambient temperature warmth or cool

33
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,440
weight or

34
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,280
lightness

35
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:31,638
spaciousness and inviting the body to relax may my body relax

36
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:43,360
may this heart and mind soften and relax

37
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:20,319
meeting whatever Rises with respect and

38
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:29,440
care simple acknowledgement is to

39
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:37,960

awareness to be your

41
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,840
compass allowing the moment to flow

92
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:23,799
then turning your inner gaze outwards to all of the others your life

93

outwards and letting go of them trusting they will reverberate

101
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:57,000
through your mind heart and life

102
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:09,480
and resting in the moment

103
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:16,039

thank you for your practice

105
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,080
e e

106
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:15,240
so dear online s today is the second of five days

107
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,440
dedicated to exploring Wells Springs of Dharma

108
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:27,159
well-being inner ones and how they flow from our hearts our minds Our

109
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:33,919
Lives excuse me out to the others in our

110
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:41,600
lives we'll mostly be talking about the internal part but to keep it in the back of your mind that the

111
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,799
benefits of practice in general and the benefits of what we're talking about

112
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:55,000
this week they naturally spill over flow into relationships into other

113
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:02,159
others lives as well to trust that so as I mentioned yesterday sometimes

114
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,600
the Buddha would tell stories about difficult times past

115
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,639
myths and um make recommendations to his

116
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:18,440
followers in particularly to his practitioners for practicing in a way

117
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:28,360
that created an inner home a sense of an inner Homeland or field of goodness

118
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:33,399
and um in this teaching that I'm teaching from he talked about the way

119
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:39,039
that practi practitioners can cultivate particular dharmic kinds of well-being

120
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:45,960
and even flourishing yesterday we talked about spiritual power or empowerment a

121
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:51,000
teaching known as the roads to power today we'll talk about true

122
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,960
beauty and then the rest of the week heart wealth happiness

123
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:07,519
and freedom so that's the road map and today as by way of introducing this

124
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:13,279
topic of true beauty inner beauty I'm going to continue a Buddhist myth of

125
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:22,440
fairy tale that I started actually at Insight Santa Cruz last Tuesday and um it's the story of a

126
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:29,880
humble beautiful Confident Woman Jasmine the daughter of flower Growers

127
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:35,200
who based on her confidence kindness and

128
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:42,799
generosity um meeting King pity he fell in love with her immediately and they

129
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:48,840
eventually became married and this story happens after that so she's traveling

130
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:55,039
back to visit her family and the King has a series of 16

131
00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:01,600
horrible nightmares all in one night those kind of nightmares where are

132
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:09,120
voices sort of yelling or groaning and and it's all kind of confusing and it's

133
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:15,679
very kind of tormented feeling and emotionally Laden and he wakes up that morning quite

134
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:22,600
Disturbed and his wife who he's become accustomed to relying on for why counsel

135
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:30,679
is out of town she's gone so he turns to some of the local soothsayers fortune

136
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:35,720
tellers um advice givers maybe they're in the court maybe

137
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:41,360
they're just in the town I don't know and they convince him that his

138
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:47,000
nightmares portend a terrible invasion of the country with mass amounts of

139
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:53,279
suffering and that the absolute only way only way for him to

140
00:33:53,279 --> 00:34:01,360
prevent this Invasion and all of this death and suff offering is to hold a big

141
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:08,079
sacrifice and this is back in the bronze ages this is ancient times

142
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:14,358
so the king resists this at first but he really really does not want greater harm

143
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:20,440
to befall his country so he sets his mind on it and he orders preparations to

144
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:26,079
start to be made so pits are being dug fire stations are being set up the um

145
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:32,480
animals are being gathered and it's to all this hubub that Jasmine

146
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:38,599
returns and she looks around and she ask what's going on and someone tells her oh

147
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:45,760
we're preparing for this Mass sacrifice and she's like oh no no no this is terrible and goes and finds the king and

148
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,679
she can see from how set in his mind he is and how

149
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:59,599
anxious he is that he's not going to listen to her immediately so she recommends that he go

150
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:05,880
to the Buddha who he has met before and on her recommendation he

151
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:14,520
agrees to seek counsel from the one more Sage this last Sage the Buddha and in conversation with the

152
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:21,119
Buddha the Buddha offers a different interpretation of the dreams one that

153
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,720
points to virtuous behavior and that suffering

154
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:34,040
result from killing and that that the suffering that he was experiencing may

155
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:40,680
have been a sense of the suffering others experience when they do horrible

156
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:48,480
wrongdoings and the Buddha encourages the king not to kill and the King takes his counsel

157
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:55,160
there's something about the Buddhist Clarity that cuts through his fear and his confusion his agitation and he

158
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:01,800
returns and he calls off the sacrifice and not not only that he bans the practice of animal

159
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:09,280
Sacrifice from then on so I tell this story because

160
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,680
Jasmine's role in it as well as the Buddhas are significant not only are

161
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:20,440
they committed to not killing they encouraged the king not to do this

162
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:26,480
horrible act and in the Buddhist teachings it's

163
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,720
beautiful very very beautiful to refrain from doing harm and

164
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:40,040
to do good but what's more beautiful than beautiful is to do good and Inspire

165
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:46,000
others to do good Inspire others not to

166
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:55,200
harm so that's the story and in this short talk this inner beauty as by now

167
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:00,800
you're hearing is about virtuous conduct walking through the world in a way that

168
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:07,079
is nonharming I won't go into the classic five precepts the guard rails on

169
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:12,200
Behavior I'll just name them briefly not killing not stealing not engaging in

170
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:19,400
sexual misconduct not lying and not engaging in harmful

171
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,680
intoxication as important as these conventions are these guard rails

172
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:31,640
are the focus today is the guiding principle the underlying

173
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:39,240
intention and that is that we can use a compass an internal compass for the path

174
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:47,680
of practice for navigating life in P it's the compass of cusa and

175
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:53,240
ausa skillful or not skillful harmful or not

176
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:59,520
harmful so wholesome or not wholesome sometimes are the words

177
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:07,560
used and this simple distinction can be a compass of care that guide behavior

178
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:12,960
and even decisions guide the journey the true

179
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:20,319
north of the compass is where wisdom and nonharming

180
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:28,319
meet so this Discerning factor of wholesome or UNH wholesome skillful or

181
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:34,440
unskillful is kind of a a form of contemplative analysis it's a

182
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:44,359
thinking through for a lot of people on certain levels and then as we begin to really take it in it

183
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:54,119
becomes more of a visceral heart-based gut-based guide for intention intention it's this

184
00:38:54,119 --> 00:39:02,599
way of embodying the great intelligence and wisdom of the Dharma in each

185
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:09,839
moment it can be a visceral feeling into a friend of mine recently talked about

186
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:15,599
how for her it's almost more of a feeling in her heart or her body a sense

187
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:21,720
of not quite right or contraction and that resonates for me as

188
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:27,760
well it's this kind of subtle not rightness in the

189
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:33,839
body in the heart that then checks us for a moment

190
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:41,520
stops oh what's happening here and that can cut through all kinds of confusion

191
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:49,720
ambivalence flurries of thought or worry or J justification even strong

192
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:54,760
ambivalence desire or fear it's a powerful form of strength and

193
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:00,160
discernment and if there's not a strong gut feeling

194
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,839
or heart feeling sometimes dropping in a simple question can be really

195
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:12,359
helpful will this lead to Greater benefit or greater harm for

196
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:18,760
myself for the other person for both of us or for everyone

197
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:24,079
concerned it's that simple that simple

198
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:32,319
question this kind of respect for non-harming right sizes your

199
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:39,480
relationship with reality it right sizes our relationship with ourselves with all other sensient

200
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:47,440
beings and the benefits can be significant the Buddha described ease of

201
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,680
concentration better relationships greater trust in oneself

202
00:40:52,680 --> 00:41:00,119
and greater trust from others a sense of integration inner

203
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:05,520
wholeness and integrity and finally the Bliss of

204
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:11,800
blamelessness the Bliss the happiness of not having to worry about having done

205
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:16,880
something wrong and I'll add because most of us have not lived perfect lives

206
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:22,960
up to this point that Bliss of blamelessness also spills over into a

207
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:30,839
sense of self forgiveness there's more and more subtle subtle

208
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:39,040
levels of mindfulness that come into being in when we start to focus on the inner

209
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:45,400
beauty of virtue it's a mark of development in the practice that's something that might be barely

210
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:52,079
noticeable at first like a human ha hair in the hand eventually becomes more like a hair

211
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:58,640
in the eye o so I'll close with a short Story

212
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:04,760
another myth ancient times I think ancient India and this is in fact I'm

213
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:10,000
certain it was ancient India this comes from the Jaa tales and it's about a king

214
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,400
who offered half The Treasure of his kingdom and the Hand of his daughter the

215
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:22,720
princess in marriage to any man who could steal something without anyone at all finding out about

216
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:28,800
it this announcement was proclaimed throughout the land and lots of young men started showing up with various

217
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,200
items of stolen perined treasure necklaces chariots the whole thing

218
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:39,640
saying no one saw me do this no one knows and each time the king would say

219
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:44,880
forget about it well thanks and people got quite

220
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:51,280
confused except one day a young man showed up with nothing and he said I

221
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:57,839
don't have anything and the King saidwell why not and the man saidwell it's not really possible to steal

222
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:04,920
something with absolutely no one knowing about it because I myself would know

223
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:10,319
about it and this was the right answer the

224
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:16,240
King was seeking an air with wisdom and an air with

225
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:22,800
Integrity so this little story points to the link between discernment

226
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,040
wisdom and the beauty of virtue

227
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:35,079
for a mature [Music] practitioner virtuous conduct becomes

228
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:41,920
more and more of a mindfulness practice a wisdom practice and as practice matures

229
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:48,359
completely it becomes a natural expression of Dharma of maturity and

230
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:55,520
that is what the Buddha considered the most profound beauty of all thank you so much for your kind

231
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:03,240
attention tomorrow we will talk about happiness so

232
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:10,720
stay tuned and thank you for your practice
