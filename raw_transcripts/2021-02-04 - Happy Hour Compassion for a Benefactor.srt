00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,319
so hello hello and formerly welcome to happy hour

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:14,160
so we are um diana and i

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,920
have been systematically going through the different practices since the

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,199
beginning of the year just to create the context and now we are going through we just started to

5
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:33,680
to go through compassion practices in the past month we went through different aspects different concentric

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,800
circles of meta loving-kindness and now we're moving to

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:47,120
the next brahmavihara heavenly abode practice which is compassion karuna

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:56,840
and as we're going through the concentric circles of this cultivation um tonight we'll turn our attention to

9
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,719
cultivating compassion care for

10
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:09,200
a benefactor of ours someone who has been there for

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,759
us who supported us maybe a teacher maybe a coach maybe a parent

12
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:22,560
um or maybe even a friend who's been there for us in some way they you know the person

13
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,360
we're going to consider today doesn't need to be our primary benefactor they could be but

14
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:37,600
someone who's been who's been in that role in some way um in some way supported us

15
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,799
and you you all know what i mean by the by benefactor if you don't type it in chat and i'll explain but

16
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,640
basically someone who's had a supporting role of some kind for us and with compassion it

17
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,360
will bring to mind um something that's it is challenging for them right now or

18
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,880
maybe one aspect of their life maybe their health maybe their relationship work

19
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,240
finance something one aspect that's a little challenging and we work in

20
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,400
cultivating compassion wishing them ease from this challenge from the

21
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:19,200
suffering in this way so to say a couple more things before we

22
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,560
get into the practice so the practice of compassion as i've

23
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:31,360
said it before and it burst repeating is when metta which is love and kindness which is just

24
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:39,120
kindness good will it meets suffering so when suffering is held

25
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:47,040
by kindness and care this combination is called compassion

26
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,760
so there are near enemies and far enemies in this practice

27
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:01,360
called um you know there could be sense of pity oh poor you this would never happen to me that's

28
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,280
when there is a sense of oh there is an uh lack of equality in the

29
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:14,640
perception whereas with compassion for it to stay compassion and not become pity we have the sense of oh this could

30
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:21,280
be me this could be me this is a common human condition this could be me

31
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:29,120
this could be me in the future it could make me in the past i could have been born into this so so not to have a sense of oh poor you

32
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,040
you're suffering or you've been suffering but a sense of common humanity and i'll

33
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:42,560
talk about the other um maybe i'll talk about one more what's called near enemy which is

34
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:50,159
empathic distress and pathetic distress when we in this equation of suffering

35
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:57,680
plus good will two of them together make compassion if we lean too heavily into the

36
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,519
suffering then there could be a sense of empathic distress and grief

37
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,280
there's not enough kindness to support it that's actually what a lot of people

38
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:16,639
mistake compassion for when they say oh compassion is sad it's heavy it's not supposed to be they're

39
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,000
mistaking this empathic distress for compassion

40
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,960
which is like oh you're just feeling the sadness here there's not enough goodwill care love

41
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,600
shining holding it that can really balance so so again if you veer into empathic

42
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,080
distress it's not a sin it's okay just notice it and bring more kindness bring more good

43
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:48,560
will bring more care to yourself in that moment because you're the one who's suffering in that moment trying to cultivate compassion

44
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:57,040
so as long as you bring kindness and care you're doing this practice right so

45
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:04,240
without further ado let's practice together so let's get into our meditation posture

46
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:11,840
ah landing landing

47
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:25,840

75
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:44,079
letting your heart relax and rest in this moment letting your body

and now if you wish to bring to mind

85
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:08,800
someone who served as a benefactor for you who supported you

86
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:16,240
in some way it could be a parent a relative

87
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,600
a teacher or maybe a good friend who's been there

88
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,360
for you in the role of a benefactor

89
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,920
and first to bring them to mind

90
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,560

and first let yourself feel a sense of warmth and care and support they've had for you

93
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:09,839

94
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,120

thank you so much for your practice everyone [Music]

198
00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:01,760
hmm so i changed the settings and chat

199
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:08,640
so you're welcome to share your reflections what you discovered your questions in

200
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:15,440
chat or you can raise your hand if you like to share

201
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:22,160
and and jesse yes please unmute yourself

202
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:30,720
hi hi thank you i um you mentioned

203
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:35,920
uh the p the image of the person you're thinking of and the voice

204
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:41,280
and felt sense and i see all those things i feel those things

205
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:48,960
um but but intermittently and um and i i just find it sort of like

206
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:55,440
to hold a person in my consciousness is a bit trickier than an anchor like the breath

207
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:02,079
or something it kind of and i wonder if what you could um recommend as far as

208
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:09,520
trying to like i i know somebody suffering but but still they kind of

209
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:15,599
come and go it's hard for me to just i want to but it's hard to hold on to it yeah

210
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:21,839
excellent question i really appreciate you bringing this up because this is so common it is um

211
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:28,480
it is more complex than the breath absolutely the breast is right here it's a sensation whereas

212
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:34,640
the image of the person or their felt sense or they sound or how they feel all of that is a little it takes a

213
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:40,000
little more energy so yes it is more complicated and yet

214
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,240
there's something about conjuring that up that sometimes when we connect then ah

215
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:52,240
it's um it brings the rest of the practice alive so what i would recommend if you're noticing

216
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:58,880
that it comes and goes see what um what is easiest for you if you're

217
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,480
visual it could be um a visual sense for some people they're not visual so maybe

218
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,520
hearing the person's voice is easier maybe they felt sense of what they feel like when

219
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:16,319
you're in their presence maybe you feel kind of giddy or giggly or maybe or or so so that's why i name all of

220
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:23,119
these too for you to feel what works best for you and sometimes it helps to remember

221
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:29,760
particular interaction or in last session i suggested you know imagine them having a facetime

222
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:35,760
conversation with you or or on video chat because that's like oh maybe you it's like oh yeah

223
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,680
there it is you have them you have this image of them and this tiny little square on your phone or something

224
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:47,920
so so be creative play around with it and and and it's also okay if it's not

225
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:53,839
constant all the time don't flagellate don't self-flagellate

226
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:59,839
it might come and go and it's okay and when you notice it's kind of kind of

227
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:06,720
gone then bring it back really spends a few minutes to conjure them up as clearly as you can

228
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,920
and then it'll probably fade again and it's okay then spend a little more time

229
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:18,720
and through practice it'll become easier it'll become more steady and it will become more steady

230
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:24,640
it's it's like a muscle and having done this practice uh for a long time after a while it becomes

231
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:32,079
easier it just it just becomes steadier it it does so i hope that helps

232
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:37,119
yeah yeah thank you you're welcome thank you

233
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:46,800
and any other questions reflections

234
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:54,319
nancy hi um this is such a beautiful practice

235
00:42:54,319 --> 00:43:02,319
i uh to wish well on a benefactor who you know is going through

236
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:07,359
a difficult time is um

237
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:16,160
not only a beautiful thing to do for somebody else but in a way is also a kindness to yourself

238
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:22,960
because there's a lot of feeling at least for me of powerlessness

239
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:32,960
in being able to help somebody going through a difficult time and this sort of addresses that for me

240
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:43,680
beautiful thank you nancy well said yeah there's so much that we can do

241
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:49,119
in cultivating our heart and being being there for them in our thoughts in our

242
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:57,040
hearts and it'll also translate for when if we have a chance to actually be for them

243
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:02,880
so yes an antidote to feeling powerless really reclaiming our power the power of our

244
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,960
heart recognizing how much goodness how much power here is to love this this is

245
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:17,280
this being here is so powerful so powerful yeah great thank you

246
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:26,480
so um so i'd like to invite us

247
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,839
and if at this time around this time you hop off like oh my god they're going to go into groups

248
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:38,160
wait just listen and and i invite you to actually see

249
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:45,359
if if you can if it's okay for you to stretch yourself just a little bit if you have to go if

250
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:52,000
you have obligations kids to take care of it's okay perfectly fine but if you're hopping off out of

251
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:59,760
fear of of being with others i invite you to stretch yourself just a tiny little bit

252
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:05,760
and see what it feels like and there are studies that people in this

253
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:11,280
situation they don't want to do a small group but then when they do it they're so

254
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:16,640
glad they did and their studies and i've done studies so many times with so many groups

255
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:23,520
believe me it's the case so if you kind of think if you're thinking ah i'm not so sure please stay and check it

256
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:32,560
out and and work with the sense of um [Music] fear anxiety unsureness i trust me this

257
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:37,760
is a really really nice sangha really kind sangha

258
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:44,400
so the invitation that i have is when you get into a small group with a couple of people

259
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:52,480
to spend again just 30 seconds or one minute um in silence but just

260
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,680
sharing meta just sharing good will for the other two people that you see on the screen

261
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:02,720
another two or three people you see on the screen just share good will for them and receive their

262
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:09,839
good will in silence this is such a powerful practice such a powerful practice with eyes open

263
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:17,040
with eyes open good will receiving good will knowing that they're doing the same for you may you be well dear friend dear

264
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:22,160
human being fellow human being and then after spending

265
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:29,680
30 seconds a minute with silence giving and receiving then imagine that

266
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:35,520
these two three people are your benefactors they're your benefits they're there to

267
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:40,640
support you they're there to support your practice and you can share as little or as much

268
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:48,319
as you like about your practice what happened or what didn't happen and it's all good and know that they're

269
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:53,359
seeing you as their benefactor so you're there to support other people

270
00:46:53,359 --> 00:47:00,480
you have a role you're powerful you're there offering support to other human beings in this boat

271
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,720
in this boat of suffering and joy plenty of that so that's the invitation

272
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:12,720
for the practice for tonight so about a minute of silence and then imagine you're each other's uh

273
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:18,000
benefactors so so i will create the birth and so

274
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,760
please give it a try don't don't i really invite you not to hop off

275
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:33,599
and see how powerful it could be and i'm about to open the rooms so here you go dear ones great

276
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:40,880
the rooms are closed everyone is back and we have a couple of minutes to

277
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:47,119
um yeah to share what uh what that was like for you practicing

278
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:53,359
in in small groups so yeah especially if you haven't shared before

279
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:59,119
we'd love to hear from you oops i think i i also want to unmute i tried

280
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:04,800
so mistakenly but uh yeah so please raise your hand or you can type in chat

281
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:12,000
what what was that like for you what did you notice either about the first part of the practice or the second part

282
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:22,400
kim please i was uh in the middle of a thought

283
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:30,240
trying to beat the coming back to the group and i didn't quite make it so i wanted to finish my

284
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:37,520
i thought i was saying that um i would have found the practice um

285
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:46,240
difficult the last few sessions um because i find i'm isolating myself

286
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:54,079
quite a bit and it was uh um practice was with a dear friend

287
00:48:54,079 --> 00:49:00,800
and uh so i have somebody that usually comes up for me that's a dear friend but

288
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:10,079
i i haven't heard from her for so long and i feel like i've lost her and so that wasn't working

289
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:17,200
um you know like having i don't have a best friend so that was the benefactor was it was very useful

290
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:24,000
because i had several benefactors thank you for letting me finish my thought

291
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,400
that's great thank you i'm delighted to hear that and yeah these first couple of categories

292
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:36,319
are supposed to be easy are supposed to be the easy category so just whatever is easiest

293
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:44,400
and um and starting tomorrow in the next couple of days we're gonna start moving into uh self

294
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:52,480
self compassion which is very important and can't have enough of and

295
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:58,720
um for some people it's challenge for many of us i have to say for many people is challenging to have compassion for

296
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:04,640
self it's easier to have compassion for others than for self so so

297
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:12,240
what you shared kim great i'm glad benefactor seemed easier yay hang out where it's easiest

298
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:17,359
because it's priming the heart it's priming the heart priming the heart where it's hanging out

299
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:23,520
where it's easy with compassion and then turning to the categories that are more challenging and difficult and

300
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:31,119
of course we'll later we'll get into neutral and then folks you're having challenges with and you know all of that so

301
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:38,319
uh yeah so so jamie types in chat how um

302
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:43,599
does the uh what we're offering here uh compared to kristen neff's mindful

303
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:50,960
self-compassion so so um christina it's a great program it's it's uh the book and the teachings uh

304
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:57,040
specifically about mindful self-compassion whereas what diana and i teach we teach

305
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:02,400
all the brahmaviharas we teach in and and it's in the buddhist

306
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:09,119
container it's we teach both meta which is loving-kindness as well as compassion as well as

307
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:15,680
vicarious joy we're going to get to that later equanimity and we share and we also teach

308
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:22,800
forgiveness practices and gratitude and all of this so the whole canon and

309
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:28,319
christine focuses on self compassion which we're going to get to

310
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:33,359
next here so so her program is fantastic i recommend her book to many people

311
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:39,920
so that's a difference we cover a lot more ground here jamie oh than than kristen neff's work does

312
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:45,520
and her work is fantastic thank you thank you i my question was specifically about

313
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:52,400
how you and diana are approaching self-compassion compared to her but it was kind of a silly question anyway i

314
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:58,240
just got hung up on her ideas and i i can just be open to yours

315
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:05,280
