1
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:14,960
so hello to everyone from redwood city here at the inside meditation center

2
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,199
and uh i would like to uh do this meditation beginning of this

3
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:30,800
meditation a little bit differently than usual and in that i would like to um

4
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,680
do a little guided imagery to begin using an analogy that i very i've used many times for some of

5
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,719
you and i'm very fond of and uh um

6
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:51,600
just to take a couple of minutes if you would just you know maybe you can be comfortable if you'd like maybe in meditation posture

7
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,160
and close your eyes and and maybe just to settle in just breathe

8
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:05,840
a few moments maybe breathe deeply a few moments relax your body

9
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,840
settle in a bit

10
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:25,520
and then to imagine yourself sitting

11
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,360
against the trunk of a tree maybe or some other comfortable place next to

12
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,200
a river and perhaps you've

13
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,280
have a day off maybe you've gone for a nice walk there's nothing you need to do and

14
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:50,799
things are taken care of well enough in your life that you just sit there in a

15
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:58,479
comfortable afternoon weather and maybe in the shade or

16
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,719
and uh watch the river watch the current and the flow of the

17
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:11,039
water the movements of little wavelets

18
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:22,800
you're watching the flow and ongoing and it's in some ways ever changing

19
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:33,120
and forever changing a constant constancy of inconstancy change the flow

20
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:41,519
sometimes some leaves are floating on the river and float down along

21
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:49,760
sometimes the twig sometimes a boat

22
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,319
sometimes a duck floats down the river

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,879
and you're just observing gazing at this just taking everything in but not really

24
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:12,640
studying anything not staring at anything just relaxed and

25
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:19,680
present and you let your thoughts do what they do there's no censoring yourself

26
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:27,280
but there's also no big involvement with your thoughts and particular interest in them and because

27
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,640
everything feels good and easy relaxed just as nice just nice to be

28
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,080
here gazing at the river

29
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,560
and this idea of just sitting observing watching gazing

30
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,599
gently relaxedly at some point in meditation

31
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,519
when we're established well enough

32
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:03,920
in the present moment we've kind of done what needs to be done

33
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:10,560
and we can just sit back and allow the practice to unfold

34
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:18,320
by by observing watching allowing

35
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,479
ourselves to be aware of all the changing phenomena in our

36
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:30,400
body the river of life that is a constantly

37
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:37,120
shifting and changing panorama of sensations

38
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:46,720
perceptions thoughts feelings even if something stays for a while

39
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:54,160
you might try um

40
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:03,120
to just stay and watching the flow

41
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:11,840
and one of the places to do that is in your breathing

42
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,720
the breathing there is kind of like a

43
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:25,840
kind of like in in the way the river is it's a constant

44
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:35,759
flow of inconstancy in that each in-breath comes and goes

45
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,560
flowing into the out breath

46
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,560
there's a beginning of the in-breath middle and an end

47
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,320
the beginning middle and end of the exhale

48
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:07,039
and all that can be felt as sensations in the body so it's not so much

49
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:12,479
observing the breath as it is observing

50
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,560
the kaleidoscope of changing sensations in your body as you breathe

51
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,919
settling back relaxing as if you're leaning against a tree

52
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:30,479
watching a river observing

53
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,840
how the sensations are breathing

54
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:48,400
go on and on they arise and they pass

55
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:56,639
some of them spark into existence for a moment and then vanish

56
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,000
like a little wavelet on a river that is there for a moment and then

57
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,199
returns to the river

58
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,638
and to settle further into this watching breathing

59
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:28,160
take a few moments to relax your body more softening all over

60
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:44,720
as if you're relaxing the whole body in towards the breathing

61
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:53,599
relaxing so that the body becomes a soft foundation

62
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,840
for a soft

63
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,360
river of changing sensations

64
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:15,440
and the more relaxed the body is the more the body's

65
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:23,599
flows and changes and things come and go arise and pass

66
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:33,758
the more tense we are we have the illusion of things being tight and constant continuous

67
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:43,360
relaxing softening the body settling in

68
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,839
and then again

69
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,519
gazing kindly on your breathing

70
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,080
being sensitive to the aspects of breathing that are

71
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:18,240
constantly changing the sensations of breath that come and go that one morphs into

72
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,839
the other

73
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,720
relaxing the mind the more relaxed the mind is the more it

74
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:19,120
can be part of the flow of the river

75
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:26,440
the more tense the mind is the more it tends to produce the illusion of

76
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:33,839
constancy of something of being unchanging

77
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:44,880
softening the thinking mind resting in the mind's ability

78
00:10:44,880 --> 00:11:01,839
to observe to perceive to sense experience

79
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:33,200
centered on your breathing all around it is also change

80
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,800
the changing fluxing sensations of your body

81
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,560
the changing experiences that come into awareness

82
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,839
sometimes this sometimes that

83
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,639
wherever there is change changing sensations experience

84
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,480
relax with it open with it

85
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,959
allow it as if you're allowing it

86
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,600
to relax you open you further

87
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,839
as if this anything that changes that comes and goes

88
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:45,839
freeze the mind further as the mind lets it pass through

89
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,839
so

90
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:24,000
change is an attribute of the present moment

91
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,760
the present moment itself is constantly changing

92
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:36,799
in more ways than we usually notice

93
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:45,440
settle back and observe how it is that the present moment is a

94
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:54,320
constantly shifting and changing phenomena represented most by the breathing

95
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:01,840
the body's experience of change as you breathe

96
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,360
relax into the river of change

97
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:11,840
float on all the changing aspects of the present moment

98
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,279
sometimes we're resting in the change observing it

99
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:52,480
and sometimes we're swept away in it our thoughts are also always changing

100
00:25:54,159 --> 00:26:00,400
even if even if the same theme persists and sometimes we get carried away in the

101
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,679
flood of thoughts

102
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,200
and the idea is to come back to the

103
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:24,880
to on the ground of the body and from there observe the change

104
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:39,840
in the present

105
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,320
sitting quietly observing change

106
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,000
gaze upon all things kindly

107
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:31,919
to the best of your ability in a simple maybe even

108
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:40,000
unremarkable way gaze upon all things kindly

109
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,960
and the ability to do so has a lot to do with the ability to be

110
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,320
confident in resting in awareness

111
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:03,200
feeling safe to rest here in awareness

112
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,320
in this print from the safety of being aware

113
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:17,840
to gaze upon all things kindly

114
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:31,840
to gaze upon all change in a compassionate way

115
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:48,880
those who understand how things are constantly changing

116
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:56,480
are less surprised that things go and things come that

117
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,960
things change and being less surprised

118
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:12,159
there is more space to be kind

119
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:26,240
to have good will and generosity and compassion for this world of ours

120
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:34,000
may it be that our meditation practice together

121
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:45,278
allows us to enter into the world with gift bestowing hands

122
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,200
enter into the world

123
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:59,120
with a orientation that's kind and supportive and friendly

124
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:06,840
compassionate we have these beautiful qualities of

125
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:13,440
heart that can flow more easily the more we

126
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:21,520
rest in change may all beings

127
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:28,559
be happy may all beings be

128
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:37,520
safe may all beings

129
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,480
be peaceful

130
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,080
may all beings everywhere be

131
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,840
free

132
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,840
uh

133
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:10,159
as i talked about yesterday the fourth tetrad the fourth

134
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:15,200
and final group of four practices or steps to

135
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:22,640
mindfulness of breathing involve observing

136
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:29,760
and to settle back and observe our experience and part of a big part of the ability to

137
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:37,200
observe what's being implied here is not to be assertive or not to be

138
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:43,760
doing things interpreting changing fixing escaping

139
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:50,320
our experience but learning have the stability and the ease and the strength of

140
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:58,559
awareness to settle back and just really see clearly what is happening here

141
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:05,840
to observe clearly the moment and and when we don't overlay

142
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:12,720
our ideas and our concepts what we see is change we see things are much

143
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:18,960
are changing all the time and um it doesn't take a lot to appreciate i

144
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,480
think that even aside from any ways in which we think things are unchanging

145
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,399
that moment by moment there's always change that the day changes the lighting

146
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:36,559
changes slowly over time maybe sometimes imperceptible if you're in a

147
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:43,039
city the sounds of the city are constantly changing and

148
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:48,480
the sensations of your body are changing through the day and you can watch the changes as

149
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:55,120
we get hungry and we eat and we don't feel hungry we feel uncomfortable we we engage our body in different ways

150
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,399
different muscles are used at different times and therefore different sensations come into play

151
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:06,480
there's a constantly shifting changing landscape of where attention focuses and what it

152
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,520
takes in and even things that don't necessarily change themselves

153
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:18,638
what's changing constantly is how we're perceiving it how we see it if i look at the wall

154
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:23,679
that's opposite me here that the natural thing when i'm relaxed

155
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:29,200
is to have my eyes kind of not fixate on a spot but just kind of roam around and even

156
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,320
though the wall is not changing what's changing is the the where my left

157
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:40,480
where my eyes land on or the flowing of this of perception of the wall so whether

158
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,679
it's something that's constantly shifting like a river flowing and we're watching it

159
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:51,919
or whether or it's the the act of perception is constantly shifting and moving and

160
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:58,960
going around um what we experience is a constantly shifting landscape of

161
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:06,640
change and it turns out that this is central to uh the deeper insights

162
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:13,280
of buddhist meditation so in the fourth step of anapanasati

163
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:19,920
the fourth tetrad it begins when trains experience

164
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:27,359
observing in in constancy i breathe in

165
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:37,040
one trains ex observing in constancy

166
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:43,440
i breathe out and um so in constancy here is one of the words

167
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:49,760
for change and and things uh and so here is to see

168
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,040
really begin appreciating and seeing the depth of how things are changing all the time

169
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:01,680
and one of the reasons why buddhism put such a strong emphasis on being present in having a present

170
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:09,280
moment attention is that that's where change happens that uh if we're thinking about the past

171
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:15,280
the past in certain kind of way is not changing anymore except in how we remember it perhaps the

172
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:21,599
futures maybe it doesn't really exist to change it's just kind of a projection of our imagination

173
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:29,359
and um and the the um but in the present moments where

174
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:35,920
we see the change it's kind of like where that's where the river flows by of change and all that

175
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:43,520
and everything is changing is according to the buddha everything is inconstant and

176
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:51,440
this is not necessarily obvious in ordinary consciousness and ordinary ways of being but but it's really

177
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:58,320
central to what happens in deeper and deeper meditation in meditation itself

178
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:04,480
where we're kind of no longer paying attention to the wall that's in the opposite side of the room or a mountain and saying well the mountain is not

179
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:10,960
changing and then we have to use our logic and say well it's slowly being worn down and eroding

180
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:18,640
but in meditation with the eyes closed sitting here that as we begin to

181
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:27,680
really open up to the present moment experience and really feel it sense it experience it observe it

182
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:34,839
what we experience in that kind of context of meditation is a constantly shifting of flow of

183
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:40,240
phenomenon it's experienced after developing strong stability and

184
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,440
part of the paradox is that in meditation the more

185
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:51,359
still the more stable the mind is the more the mind observes change and

186
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:58,000
impermanence the more unstable the mind is the more scattered and preoccupied the mind is

187
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,880
the more unsettled the more we tend to impute permanence the more we tend to

188
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:11,520
get caught up in our ideas and thoughts and stories which often carry with them a feeling of

189
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:18,720
things are constant or permanent this is the way things are and um and i've certainly have fallen

190
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:26,320
into the delusion of permanence without you know it being kind of unconsciously

191
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:33,119
even and if i think about it of course i don't believe what i'm feeling

192
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:39,839
but the way i'm acting sometimes since i remember one day many years ago having a difficult day

193
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:45,280
with my child and and my wife and i were kind of like

194
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:51,200
hovering over him and trying to manage with this highly spirited child

195
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:58,800
and and then my wife just looked up at me and said we're having one of those kinds of days

196
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:05,280
and as soon as she said that then i realized that i was kind of emotionally operating as if this is it

197
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:11,520
we're always going to be this way it's not going to change of course i if i thought about it i wouldn't have

198
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,560
been that way unknown that to thought that but the emotional feeling of it was of perm this

199
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:22,560
is it and as soon as you said that we're having one of those kinds of days then i relaxed and like you know okay

200
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:28,160
this is it's the manifestation of the moment this is how it is now and it will change it'll be we'll have a

201
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:34,240
different day tomorrow and something so this imputing of permanence even

202
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:41,280
or emotional feeling like this is it interferes with our ability to step back

203
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:48,560
and benefit from the wisdom of change and the wisdom of how things move and constantly shifting and this is one of

204
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:54,400
the key insights of the buddha it doesn't say it this particular way

205
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:01,280
but this is my interpretation that things are always changing

206
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,920
and change is not random change happens because of the conditions

207
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,520
that precede what's happening now that can as conditions shift and changes

208
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:21,200
the direction of change how things change unfolds accordingly that um that uh

209
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:29,040
generally we don't have rain without clouds the clouds are the condition for the changing weather of rain happening

210
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:37,359
and and so when when i feel cold

211
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:42,800
then perhaps uh it's harder to get sometimes harder for me to get concentrated when i meditate i've

212
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,400
meditated sometimes in very cold weather and i haven't really you know the conditions were not there

213
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:54,480
for me to get settled and calm there was still change happening and things were being and all kinds of

214
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,839
different ways but it wasn't one that supported becoming concentrated and there are

215
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:06,800
times when the weather has been comfortable or been bundled up nicely and my body is not you know coping with

216
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,920
you know cold and shivering that that i have different conditions of

217
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,200
being cozy and settled and it's easier than to the conditions are there

218
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:22,560
to allow the changing of into a concentrated state of meditation

219
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:28,480
so depending on the conditions that are present change go and go in different directions

220
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:37,200
and the key one that uh really central to the buddhist teachings is that things can go either in a

221
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:46,160
helpful direction an unhelpful direction in a wholesome nourishing direction or an un helpful unnourishing direction

222
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,760
and the and so we're a little bit responsible for putting the conditions

223
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,880
in place to support the directionality of change

224
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:04,000
we can't control it absolutely we can't make things be a certain way but we can

225
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,000
put the conditions in place to support a tendency in healthy directions beneficial ways

226
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,800
and and so so a deep appreciation of change

227
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,400
shows us that also things are malleable things are changeable because they're always changing

228
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:28,960
and we have a little role to play in the direction of that change if we're

229
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:34,720
floating in the river down a current in the river we understand that you know we're being

230
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:40,079
carried by the flowing change of the river but we also understand

231
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:47,920
that that which part of the current we're in how we avoid the eddies how we avoid the

232
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,839
parts of the current that takes us up against the shore and we can gently kind of guide ourselves

233
00:42:53,839 --> 00:43:02,160
in that river in a way that keeps us in the central current and we keep flowing down the river and

234
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:08,640
the um so being attuned

235
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:16,880
to change is part of this uh uh 13th step of the 16 steps of

236
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,720
mindfulness a 12 step 12 13 13 step of mindfulness of breathing

237
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:30,160
and um the um and it's to um observe

238
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:35,280
in the word is inconstancy and i'll talk more about that tomorrow

239
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:41,119
but it's a part of this family of concepts that relate to change things

240
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:48,400
becoming different and and impermanence

241
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:55,200
so so to observe in constancy observe change

242
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:01,760
and to find some degree of freedom in the same kind of freedom that we

243
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:09,119
would have if we're floating in the river there's a freedom and being carried and

244
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:14,560
but then we're also careful about what current we go in how we're where we're floating the river

245
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:21,440
maybe even which river we're floating in and um so this might be the theme for

246
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:28,160
this next 24 hours for you is to notice change

247
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:34,319
and notice how change arises changes in ways depending on conditions

248
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:40,240
and how and also how your role and where you find yourself and your change your

249
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:45,680
relationship to change and how you relate to that change

250
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:52,400
puts you on different currents if you're resisting change or if you're fighting change or if you're

251
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,599
attached to a change that puts you in a different river than one that is with change in an open

252
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:03,920
relaxed way so so there's different words different

253
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:10,000
concepts different ways of kind of talking about the same thing the buddha used different words and now

254
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:16,880
for now i'm using the word inconstancy and and are focusing mostly on change and

255
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:23,040
tomorrow we'll pick up this idea of inconstancy more directly in

256
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:28,480
a word that is in palis often or in english is often translated

257
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,760
as impermanence but that we'll see tomorrow that inconstancy um

258
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:40,800
might be a better translation so um so thank you all

259
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:47,839
very much and i look forward to tomorrow
