1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,779
and warm greetings from IMC from the Redwood City

2
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:14,099
and I'm aware that some of you logging on to this YouTube through

3
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:20,279
in the calendar at IMC or it does this seems to be not working some of these links that we have

4
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:27,000
so you're here so you found a way to do it and but we'll try to repair some of

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,140
these links that we have so um

6
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:43,860
so classically in certain kind of reputation for Buddhism it said that

7
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:52,280
there are two Wings to Buddhism compassion and wisdom and compassion

8
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,320
is you know usually considered to be some an attitude and motivation

9
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:06,960
that we have in relationship to other people who are suffering and wisdom has many meanings but one of

10
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,900
them is that we become wise about how to monitor ourselves

11
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,979
how to become free of our own greed hate and delusion how to get free of our

12
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:24,479
attachments that interfere with compassion that interfere with our freedom

13
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:33,780
and these two work together they're said to be the two wings of the bird and uh and uh so in meditate into

14
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,119
meditations functional meditation is very much and through this wisdom side

15
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:46,040
and part of the wisdom is to practice with a focus on oneself

16
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:52,259
so that one can have a healthy and beneficial focus on the world on other

17
00:01:52,259 --> 00:02:00,060
people so it's not meant to be selfish you know self-centered to be have an inner focus

18
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,719
on oneself it's a means towards caring for others or caring for the

19
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:14,700
world around us and one way that this works is that we learn how by this inner focus of

20
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:23,340
meditation we learn to find and recognize and support some of the uh uh some of

21
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,800
the healthy ways or Precious Ways or

22
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:37,680
peaceful ways that are waiting for us inside we learned to put a rest some of them

23
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,360
forces of distraction forces of preoccupation forces of anxiety and and

24
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:50,300
aversion and greed desires forces of

25
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:55,319
kind of attachment to self-concerns and

26
00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:03,840
so paradoxically there's a kind of inner focus on oneself that is meant to free us from a

27
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,780
unhealthy focus on ourselves free us from the ways in which we create

28
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,819
strong divisions between Me Myself and mine and the world around us and others

29
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:22,019
as well but I say this in preparation for this meditation that there is a very valuable

30
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:29,580
way of taking the time to pause from all unusual activities of the

31
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:36,019
Mind that take us away from ourselves take us away from

32
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,540
you know caring for ourselves in a deep way and to care maybe compassionately for

33
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,940
ourselves is to find the place where we can sit quietly

34
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:56,700
with peace with a sense of ease with a sense of warmth and and maybe

35
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:02,900
appreciation or of ourselves or not in conflict with ourselves and

36
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:08,040
non-conflictive State resting in our own Hearts resting in our

37
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:16,260
own inner life not spitting out and this is not necessarily difficult

38
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,979
um but uh it's uh

39
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,160
this is not necessarily easy not but it's a well worth Journey

40
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:37,160
and to know that that's part of the journey is this inner Journey and with time as it is inner Journey

41
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:44,160
to really rest in ourselves and be at ease with ourselves in a deep way we find

42
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,800
ourselves in certain way turned inside out ready to be present for the world

43
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,800
ready to be a compassionate and caring for the world ready for a kind of

44
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,520
selfless service for the world uh that is a healthy because the

45
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:11,000
selflessness comes with a real uh establishment of a healthy inner life

46
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:18,680
so to assume your meditation posture

47
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,560
and to gently close your eyes

48
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,258
whom

49
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,400
just sit here quietly without doing anything else

50
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,620
and notice how you are right now

51
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,600
with the idea that you're going to allow yourself to be as you are

52
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:05,220
but being your own good friend who's there for you there for yourself

53
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:13,759
to sit with you to be present to be a deep listener

54
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:22,740
not to fix not to give advice but a friend who sits with you allows

55
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:28,699
you to be yourself and accompanies you as you are

56
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:50,419
and then to

57
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:59,600
now in the midst of listening for yourself being with yourself

58
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:05,600
from the Navy from whatever depths within that you can

59
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:14,460
let a deeper inhale arise comfortable Fuller

60
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:19,220
maybe a satisfying deep in-breath

61
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,620
and a relaxing exhale

62
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,360
breathing in and breathing out relaxing

63
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:53,000
and on the exhale relaxing into

64
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:03,259
yourself deep inside

65
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,800
and then letting the breathing return to normal

66
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:23,099
and maybe for the next three or four exhales continue to relax and settle

67
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:27,319
on yourself into yourself

68
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,699
breathing in and breathing out

69
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,040
and then again checking in with yourself

70
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:16,819
maybe in the depths of your heart depths of your being

71
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,199
depths of your breathing body

72
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,459
and offer a kind of Compassionate Care

73
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:44,279
a compassionate caring listening feeling sensing

74
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:50,459
what is inside in such a way that whatever you find

75
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:56,540
inside feels reassured

76
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:04,260
feels a matter to recognize known in such a way it can

77
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:11,540
ease up or relax through space around how we are

78
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,640
with each breath a reassurance

79
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:55,620
to your inner life that it's okay to settle and relax and

80
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:01,220
Center yourself Here and Now within your body

81
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,720
feeling and sensing your way

82
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,819
to a place of well-being

83
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:22,459
even a modest sense of being at ease being in harmony

84
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,740
being free from conflict just here

85
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:37,440
present for yourself as you breathe in and breathe out

86
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,200
no need for the mind to wander off

87
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:47,420
into the past future or other places

88
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:56,760
it's profound to be able to be present here

89
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,420
for yourself breathing

90
00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:03,179
taking the time to feel how you are deep inside as deep as as easy to feel and

91
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:09,500
know how are you

92
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,880
and is there a way to recognize and know how you are

93
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:21,980
that your inside feels cared for

94
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:29,820
that how you are feels like there's a friendly presence friendly attention

95
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:38,960
a loving attention that how you are is allowed to be

96
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:46,080
and so relaxes Settles

97
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,899
moves into a place of deeper

98
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:57,860
at homeness Here and Now as it is

99
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:37,919
foreign

100
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:45,080
so then as we come to the end of this sitting

101
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:54,539
to check in with yourself again how are you

102
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:57,679
on the inside

103
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:07,940
how would you characterize the quality of your inner life interstate

104
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:21,539
and is there a way of relating to your inner way of being how

105
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:28,278
you are with compassion and care

106
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:38,600
with friendliness so no matter how you are deep inside

107
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:46,340
it feels that is if you are

108
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:55,519
there to support yourself to Aid whatever is there to let something settle and relax

109
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,360
deep inside

110
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:11,820
and as you feel a greater care compassion well-being

111
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:20,600
Within may that be a foundation

112
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:29,600
for a dedication to support the well-being and happiness of others

113
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:38,039
may this practice that we do serve for the happiness of Others May all beings

114
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:43,440
be happy may all beings

115
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,659
be safe may all beings

116
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:54,059
be healthy and may all beings everywhere

117
00:28:54,059 --> 00:29:00,550
be free [Music]

118
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,860
[Music] thank you

119
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:03,779
so hello on this Tuesday second day for our

120
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:11,580
series on compassionate action and um before I start I want to mention

121
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:17,279
that uh I also noticed that the link to this YouTube channel and some of the

122
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:24,779
places on IMC is um inaccurate and I'll see what we can do

123
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:30,899
to to fix it today and um but if you go to the home page

124
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:36,000
for imc's YouTube channel there's a a

125
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,159
square there for what's being broadcast live so that's one one-on-one way to get

126
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:49,460
to it and um I'll play by tomorrow the links that are will be repaired

127
00:30:52,559 --> 00:31:00,179
so here on the issue of compassionate action yesterday's talk was about

128
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:05,700
um it was focusing on compassionate action for the sake of others

129
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:13,500
and that is commonly how compassion is understood that we're caring for others

130
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:19,140
but uh equally important is that our compassion for others

131
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:25,559
should also include a care for ourselves

132
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:32,340
to have action to help and support others for my own sake as well

133
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:37,980
that as much as Buddhism might talk about not self and not living from

134
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:43,860
selfishness self-centeredness there is an emphasis on really being

135
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:50,580
responsible or caring monitoring carefully this this inner life of Our Own

136
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:58,799
and to care for that this too is important to have compassion for this too is important to uh bring care and

137
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:03,840
friendliness to and in terms of uh compassionate action

138
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:10,500
in the world being kind of having compassion for others and acting on that compassion

139
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:15,720
um we should all so the focus might be on doing things for others but as we do

140
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:21,539
it we should also do it for our own sake and that means two things

141
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:28,080
one thing it means is don't abandon yourself as you do it don't give yourself away

142
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,539
don't sacrifice don't easily sacrifice your own

143
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:39,480
well-being and Welfare for the sake of supporting and helping other people

144
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:46,500
it's not necessary there are sometimes we become uncomfortable sometimes our comfort level of sacrifice for the

145
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:52,460
well-being of others sometimes we do sacrifice certain things for for others

146
00:32:52,460 --> 00:33:00,899
but but don't sacrifice don't abandon yourself don't give up on uh staying

147
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:08,640
connected to the practice for yourself monitoring yourself knowing uh when you get attached and when you

148
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:16,080
are getting stressed when you get contracted when you get afraid when you

149
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:24,480
get overly anxious in what you're doing and override The Compassion by despair or

150
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:31,019
dis or dismay or a sense of obligation and and

151
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:38,519
fear of consequences if you don't do the action so the principle that to have

152
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:43,740
compassionate action in the world in a way that also is for your own sake

153
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:50,460
so that you benefit from it so that it's a way of caring for yourself simultaneously

154
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:58,019
as it is caring for others this caring for others and caring for oneself does not need to be two separate

155
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:05,100
things and many times the idea of compassion is considered to be almost synonymous with

156
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:10,260
being altruistic um and uh and and that's often

157
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:15,839
synonymous with it kind of giving up from what's up abandoning oneself and sometimes Buddhist teachers will

158
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:21,300
even say that as I said yesterday that one of the ways of one of the purposes

159
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:27,839
of being compassionate is for your own happiness and well-being by giving up on your selfishness or

160
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:36,118
self-centeredness but that does not mean that you give up on yourself in some deeper way it means that you

161
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:43,919
don't get attached to self you don't cling to yourself you don't try to lock on to some definition of who we are or

162
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:49,560
who we aren't but or to do the compassion action only

163
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:55,378
for ourselves in order to make ourselves feel better we don't really care so much about other

164
00:34:55,379 --> 00:35:02,339
people but but rather we care about others we try to act in ways that support them

165
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:07,800
and we're doing it in a way that we're not compromising ourselves not adding

166
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:17,339
stress we're not abandoning ourselves we're not um uh allowing ourselves to lose touch with

167
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:22,740
our own inner well-being our own Beauty our our inner practice our place of

168
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:29,040
Peace calm and the reason one of the reasons not to lose touch with that and stay connected

169
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:36,780
and do it for your own sake is so the compassionate actions that we do in the world are not stressful for us

170
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:42,660
so there's not we don't succumb to compassion fatigue or overwhelm so that

171
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:49,920
we don't um wound ourselves or hurt ourselves

172
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:57,900
by giving ourselves over to others in a way where we're open and receptive to feel the suffering of the world but

173
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:04,440
we're not available we don't know how to experience that suffering in a way that cares for ourselves as well

174
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:10,260
and so the suffering of the world kind of can you know very difficult for a heart that can break our hearts it can

175
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:16,740
shatter it can wound Us in certain ways but if we know how to maintain a place

176
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:23,460
of openness and non-clinging openness and receptivity that things are received

177
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:28,859
but they pass right through we don't hold on to anything or resist

178
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:35,220
anything then the Compassionate Care and contact of suffering and others doesn't have to

179
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:40,859
be challenging for us uh in fact so then we can be

180
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:46,680
compassionate for a long time if we don't get fatigued we don't get overwhelmed by it

181
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:51,780
and more important than that is that the quality of compassion the quality of our

182
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:57,240
relationship to other people is much higher if people feel that we're

183
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:03,560
at ease feel that we're a peaceful feel that we are

184
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:09,780
comfortable in our own being if we're this uncomfortable and anxious

185
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:16,740
and dismayed angry or upset in some way and that's the filter through which

186
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:23,099
compassionate action operates in the world people we're caring for will feel that

187
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:28,140
maybe uh maybe maybe it's not exactly conscious on their part but they can

188
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:33,180
feel that something's off it's kind of like by osmosis or the medium is the

189
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:39,420
message so if compassion is offered in the medium of anxiety if compassion is

190
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:45,780
offered in the media in the medium of upset if it's offered through the medium of

191
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:54,119
uh of a kind of selfish self-concerned or you know all kinds then um that's

192
00:37:54,119 --> 00:38:01,200
some that that medium and which is done that actually uh skews and and

193
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,960
um shapes the kind of action we do and the impact that action has on others

194
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,960
it's very different if people feel us care with spaciousness with kindness

195
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,720
that's open with non-anxiety non-upset non-dismay

196
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:24,420
uh that they feel now I'm with a person who has the ability to be equanimous and

197
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:29,520
present in a full way and I don't feel like I have to take care of them or I

198
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:35,400
don't feel like I have to now be nourished be fed by anxiety be fed by

199
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:40,920
upset be fed by self-preoccupation or whatever it might be

200
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:49,619
so the quality of the compassion I think is much more significant more valuable when we act

201
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:55,260
compassionately for our own sake as well and we have a sense that for our own

202
00:38:55,260 --> 00:39:01,079
sake there's something really here to care for there's something valuable here within ourselves

203
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:07,740
some valuable Center valuable way of being valuable sense of of

204
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:13,920
inner beauty or inner peace or inner wisdom inner goodness

205
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:21,119
and um and how do we discover that one of those ways is in many ways but one of

206
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:27,660
the ways is to meditate and and have this inner Focus we really

207
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:33,540
start tracking and monitoring and working with and discovering finding uh

208
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:38,660
deeply what's inside and settled the conflict inner conflict settle the inner

209
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:44,640
resentments and hurts and fears to really kind of drop down and discover

210
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,400
something marvelous Within so that when we from this kind of

211
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,500
wonderful place of ease and peace we can come forward forward into the world

212
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:01,920
so meditation is one way the other way is through compassionate action for the sake of others

213
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:07,380
that if we do that in a healthy way that reinforces this side this healthy side

214
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:13,800
of ourselves that mirrors it that's that kind of helps us to tap into it if we're

215
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:18,900
monitoring ourselves and and know that we're coming from this place

216
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:25,560
and then ultimately there's this wonderful cycle of mutuality cycle of of

217
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:31,920
um of how caring for others we care for ourselves and in this way of caring for ourselves

218
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:39,240
we end up caring for others as well and self and others in this way are not

219
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:44,280
separate it's not like it should be one or the other they are mutually

220
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:49,920
supportive until at such a point that the

221
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:57,119
Compassionate Care uh you know we feel this marvelous way that

222
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:04,140
there's no difference between self and other for the purposes of our care some some kind of barrier some kind of

223
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:10,380
division that many people live in begins to soften and not that we merge with

224
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:15,599
other people but that we become kind of

225
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:23,420
um there's a kind of a vast sense of openness that within which

226
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:28,500
caring for others and caring for the self there's no difference

227
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:36,060
just caring for whatever our perceptions our attention lands

228
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:43,680
so caring for oneself so compassion action for one's own sake

229
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:50,280
as the as the next kind of characteristics of compassionate action

230
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,920
yesterday the compassionate action for the sake of others and not not that

231
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:04,200
always is there for compassionate action and now including as we do care for others we

232
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:11,300
also want to care for ourselves not abandon ourselves not give ourselves away

233
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:17,400
so that there's more here in ourselves to be able to offer others

234
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:23,359
abandon oneself there's actually less that we can give

235
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,180
so thank you and um if you're interested in experimenting

236
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:36,180
with this you might see the situations where you are doing something nice for

237
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:41,520
others and seeing how you can um

238
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:46,560
do it in a way that feels satisfying for yourself that feels like it's this is a

239
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:53,339
good thing to do a good way to be in the world and maybe you do that in small small ways maybe that's where the best place

240
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:59,480
to experiment and um and um

241
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:06,559
and uh and then learn from there through the more difficult places

242
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,359
so thank you very much
