1
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:08,600
so uh so welcome folks um

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,700
yeah welcome to y'all um

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,920
yeah happy happy to be with you this week and um

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:29,119
I hope you're well wherever you are and um

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,040
well um to that thing we do

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,460
um and uh and set

7
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:49,280
okay so uh yes it'll settle into a posture that feels sustainable

8
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,659
just let at the Dharma

9
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,100
tell you what to do

10
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,440
and let the muscle memory

11
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:47,280
of any no your prior practice

12
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,480
tell you what to do

13
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:42,659
let your mind and take its cues from the Stillness

14
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,920
the silence

15
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:08,900
and maybe looking for the the phenomena

16
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,940
where giving giving some attention there brings in

17
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:24,138
sense of Tranquility is

18
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:33,860
maybe that's the breath maybe that's

19
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,220
Sensations in your hands or feet or something

20
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:47,660
the body that feels vaguely Pleasant soothing

21
00:06:52,080 --> 00:07:00,379
maybe that's the darkness behind your closed eyes

22
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:16,160
or maybe even amidst the ambient noise in your environment

23
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:24,979
you can kind of tilt the attention towards cylons

24
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:45,319
it's letting your mind take its cues

25
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,060
from these soothing objects of attention

26
00:12:31,579 --> 00:12:38,300
the tranquility is a

27
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:42,139
healing in itself

28
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:51,740
and the tranquility um

29
00:12:53,899 --> 00:13:01,399
makes more room for the imperfection

30
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:08,940
of the The Human Condition to be digested

31
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:24,200
so maybe we just uh what's a rising is um

32
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:32,160
some sense of e is quiet and we just abide

33
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,680
there's no project to be done

34
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:50,220
maybe the tranquility uh illuminates what is unfinished in the

35
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:56,160
heart or the transient aches

36
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,160
heartache

37
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,860
that which is uh calling out

38
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:14,820
to be digested

39
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,959
by awareness

40
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,880
so whatever is arising in experience

41
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,779
um there's goodness unfolding

42
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:12,020
and no matter how you think you're doing

43
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:18,120
you can rest well

44
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,460
in the wholesomeness of your intention

45
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,899
the goodness of the aspiration

46
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,840
to wake up

47
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:52,260
is connecting with that is also soothing

48
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,260
tranquilizing

49
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,320
we take a certain kind of Dharma posture

50
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:12,139
make a certain gesture of awareness

51
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:18,380
and then just let time pass

52
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:24,260
let time be your ally

53
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:41,580
nothing more needs to be done other than just making

54
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,620
that gesture of awareness

55
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:55,580
letting the logic of the Dharma unfold through you

56
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,500
foreign

57
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,240
so it's good to uh good to sit with you good to be with you

58
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:38,399
um yeah it's always easier actually to say hello and welcome after we all said

59
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:46,260
kind of deeper greeting in a way so um yeah I'll be I'm your substitute

60
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:54,000
teacher this week and um yeah we'll be be with you uh these days

61
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,760
and um I'll actually also do tomorrow night

62
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:05,340
um and and Thursday night do a zoom session an optional Zoom session for a

63
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:12,600
half hour that I'll post the info at the end um for you know we can sit for a few

64
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:18,320
minutes and um and have any questions or dialogue

65
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:23,840
so um

66
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:32,279
yeah I have this this friend um long time practitioner and

67
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:38,399
um and and he he is always working actively on something in his practice as

68
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:45,480
if he's like in the new phase of like intense excitement about Dharma practice he's

69
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:52,200
just like always there actively contemplating something

70
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:58,980
and um whenever whenever we talk

71
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:06,840
it's like he's living in a Dharma talk giving it to himself then giving it to

72
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:16,759
anyone who will listen really and uh he's extremely persuasive

73
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:25,799
and um one time we smoke and um

74
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:32,700
remember this conversation and and uh and he said you know we're

75
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:38,640
um we're always saying let go we're always saying open up to Anita open up

76
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:46,380
to unreliability uncertainty comprehend duka comprehend suffering

77
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:52,620
and he said it's too much it's too much we need to teach pleasure that's what we

78
00:32:52,620 --> 00:33:01,080
need to teach and um and so this week the the theme is uh

79
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:08,340
varieties of uh of Dharma pleasure now Dharma pleasure is weird pleasure in

80
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:13,460
a way but it's pleasure nonetheless um

81
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:19,980
pleasure is not the same as satisfaction and

82
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:26,159
I I really associate ordinary pleasure with

83
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:32,820
um actually strengthening the patterns of craving

84
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:38,700
of craving seeking relief finding some kind of

85
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:45,720
brief seclusion from the pain of craving but

86
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:52,080
then the cycle continuing whereas maybe we say Dharma Pleasures

87
00:33:52,080 --> 00:34:00,919
are distinctive insofar as they don't create thirst they actually

88
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:07,860
satiate they they are um Pleasures that leave

89
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:11,780
peace in their wake

90
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:17,940
so that's a theme and today the pleasure

91
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:24,320
of uh of having a path the pleasure of having a path

92
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,179
um we're we're all

93
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:38,940
um I I sometimes say we're all philosophers of happiness and we we

94
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:46,500
've all asked the question many times implicitly what is the good life yeah as

95
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:54,720
a philosopher might ask what is a good life and we're all in a sense tentatively

96
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:02,400
living our answer and

97
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:09,540
as a kid I was um Without Really knowing it but just

98
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:16,200
looking back or you know retrospect I I was asking this question

99
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,780
and was kind of picking up and ruling out many different philosophies of

100
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:29,579
happiness and a sense of like could this work no

101
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:36,960
could that work no I was so sensitive to suffering

102
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:43,200
and with so little Equanimity and I was just like trying out what could work

103
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:49,680
what could work and my conclusion was that

104
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:56,339
I didn't know and my conclusion was that adults the adults

105
00:35:56,339 --> 00:36:02,400
didn't know that much about happiness either and uh

106
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:08,880
I kind of waded into this path years later with a great deal of

107
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:15,119
skepticism sort of unsure that this had anything new to offer really

108
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:21,420
and um many of the the tears that I would shed in the early years of

109
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:28,859
practice were tears of of relief and they were the relief of this

110
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:34,140
I found a path yeah not the path that

111
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:40,800
the path that everyone must walk not the one true path but I've found a path

112
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,440
this is a path for me and there is so much relief in that and

113
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:52,980
a sense of like my heart kind of interlocking with some vision of

114
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:58,020
happiness very

115
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:05,220
soothing um the the philosopher Nietzsche said

116
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:11,520
um one who has a y can bear almost any how

117
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:17,960
one who has a y compare almost any how and we need to be

118
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:23,220
convinced of our why but when we are convinced the why

119
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:28,800
wisdom and love when we do become convinced

120
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:36,660
the rest is just kind of details yeah the rest of the path how I'm doing where

121
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:43,140
it's going what I'll learn how much I'll achieve details

122
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:50,700
we have our y and I'm really alluding to in a sense

123
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:57,740
the arising of Faith a certain kind of the pleasure of faith

124
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:06,420
baklav Havel said hope is not the conviction something will turn out well but the certainty that something makes

125
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:14,180
sense regardless of how it turns out and uh

126
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:24,180
there's this kind of faith we relax we relax we're not

127
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:31,200
um compulsively looking for evidence that we're on the right track you know that

128
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:37,440
sense of just like pinging around within our experience just looking am I doing this right is

129
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:43,740
this right should I be doing something else should I be that kind of

130
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:50,640
um energetic state that that starts to fade

131
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:58,140
the the absence of faith we could say is a kind of this wobble a certain kind of

132
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:04,079
ambivalence of always looking for evidence that we're doing it the right

133
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:09,839
way or trying to sort out our place on the path we're comparing ourselves to

134
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:17,940
others rather than just actually feeling one's own belonging

135
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,319
within the Dharma

136
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:31,020
and the absence of this this kind of Faith

137
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:37,079
leads us to a sense of like grappling in the dark and never sure

138
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:43,500
exactly what's trustworthy where to look for data you know where to validate what

139
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:48,559
we're doing and um

140
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:57,079
and that Fades that Faith there's a pleasure in our faith we stop

141
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:04,099
guessing if we're getting it right because um we know we're just going to keep going

142
00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:09,440
exploring learning growing

143
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:15,420
and the pleasure of this kind of faith is uh it's a it's a particular pleasure

144
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:22,680
I'm no no fundamentalist I'm really almost reverential about the the

145
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:29,220
permanent possibility of being wrong but um

146
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:36,720
at the same time my mind hasn't wobbled about the path for for a long time

147
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:43,980
and what that feels like is a very abiding

148
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:51,599
confidence in wisdom and love not more than the just the confidence in

149
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,780
the

150
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:04,260
Ken McLeod um a few times in my life I've been in

151
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:10,140
difficult situations situations in which I could not see any way forward

152
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:15,180
in my morning practice sessions I would to the best of my ability rest in the

153
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:20,760
confusion that swirled inside of me I suppose it was the years of effort

154
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:27,599
that made that resting possible even though all those years those efforts had seat poultry

155
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:32,700
an ineffective when I could rest in the confusion it

156
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:38,700
grew quiet and dark the quiet of a dark night with no moon or Stars

157
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:45,480
as I rested in that Darkness a Clarity would sometimes arise and with it a sense of direction

158
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:50,700
how or what discerned that Clarity or that direction I don't know but both

159
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:56,040
were there the clarity didn't illumine anything it

160
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:01,500
didn't make anything in the situation clearer

161
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:10,320
it just indicated a Direction where that direction LED or what I would

162
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:15,480
encounter I had no idea there was a Direction

163
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,380
nothing more

164
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:26,339
