1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,680
so hello and welcome

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,719
to this third day on a series of the gladness of pentad

3
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:21,840
and the middle one here today is um tranquility

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,660
is specifically the Tranquility of the body

5
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:34,460
but we can also consider it also a Tranquility of the Mind

6
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:41,160
and meditation is often associated with calmness and people will do meditation to become

7
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,379
calm but I'd like to propose that the calmness that we develop through

8
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,719
meditation is not only for its own purpose

9
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,239
but for the benefits that come with calm and one of the benefits

10
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:03,440
is um that are body and mind

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,600
becomes organized it self-organizes in the calmness

12
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,700
when we're not calm when we're we tend to be disorganized

13
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:21,299
we're scattered fragmented agitated sometimes jumping around sometimes their

14
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:29,100
thoughts are buzzing or pop uh you know jumping back and forth between things

15
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,200
sometimes the body is the can't be still sometimes the body just has to keep

16
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,079
moving and and and because being still is too uncomfortable

17
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,259
and the constant movements of the body the constant movements of the Mind

18
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:54,899
can very easily become a disorganization process that it's scattered divided fragmented

19
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:02,399
and as Things become calm and there's a settling and that's settling things begin to shift and change and become

20
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,619
organized the classic Buddhist the way of talking about this is that Things become a

21
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:13,160
unified but unified it doesn't suggest the ways in which things

22
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:19,379
cooperate or coordinate that may be organized does

23
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:24,739
and as we become more calm and more organized more settled

24
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:34,800
it allows the mind and body it allows the mind about it to heal to settle to

25
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:42,180
come alive in different ways and most importantly it allows for a cleaner more

26
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:48,720
direct Opera operating of our intelligence our creativity creativity

27
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:55,200
and our Focus and to bring our intelligence

28
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:02,900
and our creativity to becoming focused in meditation to being really here in a

29
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,920
wholehearted way a whole a wholeness

30
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,540
that is also a wholesomeness

31
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:20,340
so to be calm and perhaps by mentioning these benefits

32
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:27,260
from becoming calm maybe you can you'll give this a

33
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:33,239
give it a try as we sit here and maybe a little bit more intentional

34
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:41,780
way than you might did meditation so assuming a posture

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,400
that is an organized posture organized for

36
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,480
the purpose of meditation

37
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,440
just like a maybe like a

38
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:05,400
a painter on a canvas will bring the whole body into

39
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,799
being really present the body's organized as gather together

40
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:17,958
for the purposes of just being really there precise with the brush of the stroke

41
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:24,060
or the way they cook might be slicing making a beautiful slice

42
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:30,360
of some vegetable to Adorn a dish

43
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,300
be right there precise focused with the body gets involved and

44
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:43,500
connected and this organizing the body taking care with your posture

45
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,780
so that it's a posture that begin feeling that

46
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:54,660
as much as your posture as can can in a relaxed way

47
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:01,280
is cooperating participating in the meditation

48
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,340
maximal participation of the body

49
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:14,660
in being intentionally present Here and Now

50
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:23,699
and sometimes sitting up straighter will allow for a much deeper relaxation

51
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:30,440
of the body than leaning back and slouching in a couch

52
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:36,120
initially it seems like it's more work but over time

53
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:43,380
and a line body can let go deeply

54
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:48,660
I read once that the two postures that allow for the deepest relaxation of the

55
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:56,360
body is the yoga posture called The Corpse laying flat on your back

56
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:04,979
and the other is sitting cross-legged with a spine Direct

57
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:13,580
not slouching gently closing your eyes

58
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:22,039
so the eyes are not doing looking at things they're different than being here in the meditation

59
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:32,160
and one more time with the eyes closed making small adjustments to the posture

60
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:39,300
almost as a ritual of getting the body organized

61
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:47,180
and participatory in the meditation in being alert

62
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:05,759
and then taking a few deep inhales

63
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,940
and using the expansion of the rib cage the Torso as you breathe in

64
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:17,160
as a way of deeply connecting to your body

65
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:24,020
the stretching the opening feel it fully

66
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:31,580
and then the long exhale soften and relax

67
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,780
long exhale settle into this body

68
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,199
taking a really deep breath that expands the Torso

69
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:57,800
gives the Torso a chance to reorganize itself as you exhale

70
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,159
refined itself

71
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,520
and then to let breathing return to normal

72
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:26,960
and with normal breathing

73
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:34,560
relaxing the different parts of the body both to relax them

74
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,919
and also just begin this process of

75
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:45,500
reorganizing the body to be a Cooperative whole

76
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,620
on the exhale relaxing the muscles of the face

77
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:06,680
softening around the eyes

78
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,480
exhaling and relaxing the shoulders

79
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,279
feeling the weight of the shoulders

80
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,820
releasing

81
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,120
softening the belly as you exhale

82
00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:01,339
maybe there's a way of relaxing the belly as you inhale as well

83
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:27,000
and then in the next few exhales the inhale and the inhales feel your

84
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,140
whole body in a global way and the exhale relax your whole body

85
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:39,540
release any bracing you have bracing against

86
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:46,860
life releasing any momentum forward into time

87
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:55,160
to do to worry whole body softens

88
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:39,779
and then relaxing the mind maybe also in the exhale

89
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:45,560
a gentle softening of the thinking mind

90
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,199
a gentle quieting of the thinking

91
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:24,860
any pressure or tension agitation in the thinking mind

92
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:37,399
let it relax and let the weight of it settle it quiet it

93
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:47,600
so the fragmenting forces of the Mind begin to quiet down

94
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:56,839
and the mind gathers together in a subtle place within

95
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:58,519
and instead of now focusing on breathing

96
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:06,300
from the control tower looking down or imagine that there is a kind of a canal

97
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:13,399
or a tube from the brain down into the belly

98
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:20,160
and as you exhale all the thoughts and mental activity

99
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:26,420
awareness itself moves down that

100
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:32,700
Canal down into the belly and rests there

101
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:39,060
settles there together to experience the movements of the belly

102
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,899
as you breathe

103
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:52,260
where everything is allowed to organize itself around the

104
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:55,519
movements of the belly

105
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:17,060
if the Mind wants to be at peace

106
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:26,060
you can support that by having the Mind rest in the belly

107
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,600
come on

108
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,440
relaxing on the exhale and perhaps feeling

109
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:07,640
how the scattered parts of ourselves gather together settle down together

110
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:16,760
fit themselves together in an organized whole

111
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:26,640
Letting Go relaxing allowing everything to settle

112
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,080
around the breathing

113
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:27,559
if you're inhale your exhale is your paintbrush as an artist

114
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,880
and you have to be precise with the brush stroke

115
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,100
let your attention get gathered and settled and focused

116
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:45,600
on each stroke of the breath as if it's the most important thing of

117
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,720
the moment the last Strokes that finishes the

118
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,299
painting without messing it up

119
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:07,380
and then to end this sitting imagine that every thought

120
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:15,020
is also like a paintbrush stroking painting a picture

121
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:20,120
maybe painting the picture of the world that you live in

122
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:27,980
and every thought of Good Will and kindness it's like painting it

123
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:35,279
with a friendly color and so to end the sitting with

124
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:42,740
good will for the world for others

125
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:50,880
saying to yourself these kinds of words as you paint the world

126
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,640
Infuse the world with your good will

127
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,220
may all beings be happy

128
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,580
may all beings be safe

129
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:20,480
may all beings be peaceful

130
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:30,380
may all beings be free

131
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:45,720
then may we be organized

132
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,299
in our hearts and minds and bodies

133
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,320
with kindness compassion and love

134
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:05,309
[Music]

135
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:13,020
[Music]

136
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,520
thank you

137
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:44,760
so we're now at the third Talk of the gladness pentad

138
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:51,059
and this is uh Tranquility specifically it's Tranquility of the body

139
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:57,799
and but it I like to think of it includes calmness of the mind as well

140
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:05,820
and um here the language is not that we are calming anything but rather there's

141
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:12,000
a calming that happens from the momentum of the meditation of the practice it's

142
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,720
like if you sit still and upright when you're really tense the body just wants to relax and settle just kind of you

143
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:25,740
find yourself settling without intending to do so and so the same way for the mind there's

144
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:32,399
a way in which things are allowed to settle they're quiet if we get out of the way if we don't perpetuate our

145
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:37,620
busyness our activities so being still and it turns out that

146
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:44,220
that deep relaxation of the body is supported by gladness and joy the

147
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:49,620
first two steps of this gladness pentaton it's kind of like with with the

148
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:55,140
gladness and joy there's a contentment there's a sense of well-being

149
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:02,460
that it just feels safer to relax and let go it just feels kind of warm and cozy to

150
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:07,620
be present so that the body wants to relax more kind of like it's been tight

151
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:14,940
and shivering in the cold and then it stands in the Sun the warmth of the Sun and soaks in the warmth and something

152
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:21,000
begins to relax so when in meditation we can help with

153
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:28,140
the relaxing calming and when we allow for it as part of the art of meditation

154
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:34,140
meditation is often associated with becoming calm and tranquil and uh

155
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:39,600
it's a very useful quality of meditation but it's very it's not so often talked

156
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,760
about how the calmness the Tranquility that brings that we create that comes

157
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:50,580
along is a not for its own sake many people feel that's enough I mean I was so

158
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:57,679
stressed out it was not nice to be calm that the calmness begins to allow for a

159
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:03,559
reorganizing of the mind and body especially I think of the mind getting

160
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:08,580
reorganized maybe a mind that's disorganized is all too often our

161
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:14,100
experience in life and you've only realize that when we sit down to meditate and see how much the mind is

162
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:20,700
jumping around or fragmented or preoccupied in a way that

163
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:26,640
you know so distracted we don't even know we're distracted so preoccupied we

164
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:32,640
don't even know that we're preoccupied until we sit down and see it and um

165
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:39,059
and so the um um to begin uh

166
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:47,340
and to be present and awake and clear and see what's happening in the mind that begins allowing the mind to settle

167
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:53,340
it's kind of like making breathing room for something to settle and then we could also participate in

168
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:58,440
that relaxing sometimes and just kind of kind of being with the breath and

169
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:04,380
relaxing it being with our our mind and softening the mind

170
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:12,618
and the more that we're both awake attentive and relaxing

171
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:17,940
the more the mind will self-organize it's like the self-healing properties of

172
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:24,540
the our body and mind that are not enabled if we stay scattered and

173
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:30,240
stressed it's kind of like we're keeping ourselves away we're interfering with

174
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:36,658
the self-healing self-settling self-organizing aspects of our mind and

175
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:43,080
as we get as the mind gets more organized more less fractured more

176
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:49,200
gathered together the the purpose as I said is not just to be

177
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:56,220
calm but to so that our intelligence our creativity and our Focus can operate in

178
00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:01,680
support of the meditation and because the idea is that the calm is

179
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,619
not an end of itself but allows for a deepening of concentration of settling a

180
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:15,660
greater sense of settled concentrated wholeness not another fragmentationary lasers

181
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:22,740
focusing on something and pushing everything else aside but rather everything is allowed to settle together

182
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:29,280
nothing is left out nothing is held at Bay nothing is repressed or denied but

183
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,619
the self-organizing everything comes together and then can find a way to work together

184
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:40,400
cooperate to coordinate for the purposes of meditation

185
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:48,420
um I I was told recently about a game that uses some kind of Technology

186
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:54,180
attached to the head that can measure I guess the brain waves whether a person

187
00:35:54,180 --> 00:36:00,960
is agitated or calm and now apparently it's a game where there's a ball between two people and a

188
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:07,440
table or something and that's somehow uh connected wirelessly connected to

189
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:14,940
these headsets people are wearing and so um when we relax the ball moves away

190
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:20,280
from us towards the other person and so it's a competition to see who can get

191
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:28,500
the ball into the other person's goal or in the other person's side of the table and but what's required is to be relaxed

192
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:34,800
so you can't strain you can't be competitive in a forceful straining way

193
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,440
um and the person who wins is the one who is most relaxed which probably also

194
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:47,760
means the most unconcerned about winning and um but I imagine that you don't win

195
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:55,740
by falling asleep um you know you don't win by kind of spacing out you have to be present

196
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:01,980
very present to notice uh if the mind is you know if the boat

197
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:08,760
which direction the ball is going and whether or which direction you know is the mind now more stressed more agitated

198
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,980
or is the mind now is it more places you can settle and relax quiet the mind

199
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:20,520
and so learning this art of Being alert present tracking what's going on with

200
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:25,680
intelligence and keeping it relaxed at the same time

201
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:33,660
many people only know one or the other but to do both and then to use the uh our intelligence

202
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:39,960
our creativity to gather more fully and focus more fully just here in our

203
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:45,359
meditation so in this last meditation I suggested the idea that

204
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:52,560
um you know as an image is a creative image of you thinking of attention like a

205
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:58,980
brush stroke and like you're a painter painting something and that every inhale and

206
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:04,500
every exhale is this is a you have to have the very precise and clear relaxed

207
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:10,380
Focus of an artist who's putting the finishing touches on a very refined detailed

208
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:15,960
painting that's maybe exquisitely beautiful but uh you want to put the

209
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:21,240
last little thing in it and not mess up and so very present

210
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:27,480
maybe there too if there's stress or tension in the artist's hand it won't it won't be quite right it has to be very

211
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:33,540
relaxed but very focused and so that every exhale is a brush stroke every

212
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:40,020
inhale side brush stroke of this painting and this metaphor is not uh partly

213
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:46,380
borrows from the ancient Buddhist language Pali that in one of these coincidences

214
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:52,980
accidents of the language that the word for mind chitta

215
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:59,520
is the same as the word for painting they have different uh they come from

216
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:05,339
different Roots so that technologically they're not related but somehow in the way the language is kind of evolved over

217
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:11,220
time the accents the pronunciations they came to have the same pronunciation so homonyms

218
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:16,920
so but it's kind of a wonderful coincidence that um you know that the word for mind the

219
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:22,560
word for painting is the same because maybe there's a way in which how

220
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:29,160
we're present how we engage in attention is a way of painting

221
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:35,220
the Mind painting our experience painting ourselves into being a whole

222
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:41,180
organized gathered together everything working in harmony

223
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:48,720
and so how do we harmonize mind and body and part of the way is to allow it to

224
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:55,460
harmonize by being calm by being settled and so some of that we can do ourselves

225
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:01,560
we can relax the tensions in our muscles while staying alert

226
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:07,440
in the body to what we don't want to do is relax and

227
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,540
become limp limpness is not the Tranquility that the

228
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:17,940
Buddha was pointing to it you know the most limp person would end up you know

229
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:23,220
like a a cooked piece of spaghetti just kind of you know

230
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:30,540
call you know not no no tautness to holding it up so

231
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:36,119
we don't not possibly we're not supposed to become limp we're also not supposed to be tens

232
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:43,560
and uh so some kind of tautness some kind of Vitality energy that keeps Us

233
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:49,220
Alive Keeps Us upright and engaged but also something it allows for a very deep

234
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:54,599
relaxation of the body and the mind it's phenomenal that what can happen in

235
00:40:54,599 --> 00:41:00,440
meditation so I offer all all this all this to you

236
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:05,900
is a is a

237
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:14,700
as a suggestion

238
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:23,099
or as a ideas to encourage you to lovingly relaxedly

239
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:29,579
participate and support this organizing self-organizing

240
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:36,540
de fracturing movement of meditation that part of the reason to settle the

241
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:42,119
mind is so that the if we can become more

242
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:48,420
intelligent and creative and present for our experience for those of you who have mine to jump

243
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:53,820
around a lot some image might be helpful

244
00:41:53,820 --> 00:42:00,180
so the image for example that the as you exhale it's like you're you have the

245
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:05,280
focus of you know a painter with a paintbrush just right there with the

246
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,320
every little step of the exhale you're painting it you're right there tracking

247
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:16,079
it or maybe you know really present for

248
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:21,619
um I don't know it's a

249
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:27,660
the um you know what's the attention you need to if you want to

250
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:33,660
um some fruit like a mango or maybe avocado where you put the knife down you don't

251
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:38,760
want to cut through the skin you cut it in half you don't cut through the skin but you know from the half from the

252
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:44,400
inside you're you're slicing it down to the skin so what's that Focus right there

253
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,680
for that cut that you need to do maybe you have other images that you

254
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:55,680
like that works for this a um maybe an Archer and you know just really getting

255
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:01,920
the whole body organized settled connected they're also an Archer can't

256
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:09,920
be tense but the Archer has to be taught and everything is organic whole body is organized for the purposes of the shot

257
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,540
and then you know that kind of the mind everything takes its time to really be

258
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:23,160
there to to hit the target and um so

259
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:30,420
to org meditation as a organizing practice

260
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:35,700
that is supported by tranquility and the more we have gladness the more

261
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:43,500
we have joy the more that it's just natural for the body to feel cozy content and feel like

262
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:49,619
it can settle and relax and and participate in this reorganizing

263
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:55,640
from the disorganization of stress stress and and

264
00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:01,520
resistance and you know agitation

265
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,299
so um

266
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:13,800
look for opportunities to be tranquil you know we'll set in a park bench for a

267
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:18,960
little while and said look out the window and have tea look for opportunities to relax your

268
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:28,260
body standing in a shopping line don't read the magazines that are there as you're waiting or don't be you know

269
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:34,560
judging what other people in front of you in line have bought you standing there is a chance to soften and relax

270
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:40,560
your body maybe relax your mind look for opportunities today to relax be tranquil

271
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:46,619
not for its own purpose but see if you can notice if in that Tranquility in

272
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:54,900
that calmness if there's a way in which your body and mind kind of comes together kind of becomes more whole

273
00:44:54,900 --> 00:45:02,119
becomes more organized or gather together or Unified

274
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:10,800
so um thank you and may you have a tranquil day

275
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:16,740
and and not just because you're tranquil but

276
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:23,400
because your whole system starts coming into harmony you'll be better prepared for tomorrow's

277

278
