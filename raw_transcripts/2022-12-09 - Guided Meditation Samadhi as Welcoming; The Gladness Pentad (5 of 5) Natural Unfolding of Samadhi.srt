1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,120
so

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,980
hello everyone and

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,420
welcome to Friday morning here in California

4
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:27,660
and um we come to the end of these five part

5
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:36,120
series on the gladness pentad and if you take a moment to imagine

6
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,760
a circumstance maybe in a time when things are going well for you

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,960
a time when you have no real concerns and that you can settle into your

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:56,940
meditation first with gladness it's like just uh just glad delighted

9
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:03,000
appreciative of the chance to sit in a place where

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,159
your senses are open your body is present

11
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:15,679
we're just being alive is enough when being alive is to be

12
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:24,360
present in your senses with your eyes your ears your body

13
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:31,680
with the mind here now maybe not the highest quality

14
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:38,159
but it's just nice to be here content kind of glad

15
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,759
and then you remember that you're here to practice

16
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:51,899
being attentive practice gently lovingly quieting your mind

17
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:57,740
letting your mind quiet because you can reassure

18
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:03,960
you can reassure your mind that your thinking mind that

19
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:12,120
don't have to do all this thinking going to have to fix anything or solve anything and it's

20
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:19,099
okay just to quiet and let the mind attention

21
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:27,140
be available for the Simplicity of being alive now with the breathing

22
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:33,840
and there's a joy in the Simplicity of presence with the breathing

23
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,319
and even if the mind wanders off there's a joy and recognizing that and beginning again

24
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:47,040
with the breathing with the breathing being kind of the representative representation of

25
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,459
being centered not at home here in this life in this body

26
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:58,459
we're just being alive is enough just breathing is enough

27
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,580
were we being present for the breathing the joy of it is partly

28
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:13,040
riding on the breath like a bird soaring on the updraft

29
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,560
awareness rides up and down on the breathing and

30
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,580
the updrafts and the waves

31
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:33,180
and in this Joy of the practice of being present practice

32
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:41,480
of keep showing up here feeling sensing the body the breathing

33
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,540
it makes a room for tension in the body to relax

34
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,580
there's a softening relaxing in the body

35
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:02,400
tensions of the face soften

36
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,760
tensions of the butt belly

37
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,900
small adjustment in the positions of your hands and arms too release any

38
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,458
tension that's held there

39
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:28,940
maybe there's even a little tension in the thighs that can be released

40
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,979
and maybe there's some tension or pressure

41
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:46,940
in the thinking mind some agitation and just being aware of it is enough

42
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:53,160
the joy of having an awareness practice that knows and sees

43
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,020
without making anything a problem

44
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:07,020
and so the within the mind has a chance to relax

45
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,800
also

46
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,340
and just being alive is enough sitting here breathing and being aware

47
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:24,319
attending to breathing

48
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,000
another level of contentment or happiness

49
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,400
physical satisfaction Maybe

50
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,699
that comes from a place that's deeper than places where the body aches or hurts or

51
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:51,680
the heart aches hurts

52
00:05:52,800 --> 00:06:01,680
the place inside that maybe feels peaceful and quiet

53
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,259
and there there's a kind of well-being

54
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,580
there the breathing

55
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,319
gently arises and passes comes and goes

56
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,000
wave after wave

57
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:43,380
as the companion of an inner feeling of well-being calm

58
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,860
tranquility

59
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,780
where there's an inner place of Stillness and calm

60
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,280
maybe in the breathing

61
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:13,520
that is a center of gravity for all things where the weight

62
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:20,000
from the body gathers around this place

63
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,418
the weight of awareness Settles

64
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:37,199
the weight of your emotions your moods the atmospheres of your mind

65
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:45,680
a gentle pull of that Center gathers everything together here now

66
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:56,940
in the sense that your whole being becomes centered on

67
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:04,819
breathing centered on the Stillness or the peace

68
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:12,380
which the breathing moves through arises out of

69
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,979
even your thinking the weight of thinking settles into the

70
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:26,460
center and the thinking quiets Settles

71
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,760
and perhaps a sense that samadhi

72
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:52,140
is an immersion in experience immersion into this practice

73
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:58,519
and immersion at all of you together centered centering

74
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:06,019
gathered here now breathing

75
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:20,180
surrendering to the pull of the gravity of the center of your being

76
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:27,720
surrendering everything to that Center so it all gathers together

77
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,420
it's all working together here and now

78
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,160
foreign

79
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,760
foreign

80
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,560
foreign

81
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,720
at the center of your being

82
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:37,519
there's a sign a loving sign that says welcome

83
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,240
maybe he says all of you is welcomed here

84
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:59,000
give yourself over to this welcome at the center of it all

85
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:05,279
breathing in and out through that center of gravity

86
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,420
for all things

87
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:53,120
foreign

88
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:54,259
foreign okay

89
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:06,360
however far your thoughts take you away from yourself away from your Center

90
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:12,798
when you notice it let it all return

91
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:21,558
back to that Center in a sense bring your thoughts with you

92
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:27,380
so that they can relax and compost

93
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:32,660
back at the center of all things

94
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,600
and then taking a

95
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:40,580
gentle breath deep into your being

96
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:51,480
maybe taking a long exhale and pausing at the end of the exhale

97
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,059
in preparation for ending the sitting

98
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:00,440
brief pause

99
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,520
relaxing into your heart

100
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:24,240
and letting there be a whatever kind of sense awareness gazing upon the world

101
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,299
around you remembering it imagining it

102
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:35,480
imagining that your good will your kindness

103
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:41,778
your heart's deepest welcoming of everyone

104
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:51,960
welcomes the world and you

105
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:59,580
look upon it kindly may all beings

106
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:06,740
be happy may all beings

107
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:16,400
be safe may all beings be peaceful

108
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,880
may all beings be free

109
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:39,140
May the deepest way that you welcome yourself

110
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:47,940
to yourself extend out to a welcome to all beings

111
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:56,279
welcome letting them come well into your good

112
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:59,000
good will

113
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:15,930
[Music]

114
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:24,960
so there was unplanned the way that unfolded in terms of the meditation and

115
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:31,380
I was just welcoming you all to the sitting and having some thoughts about how to begin and

116
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:37,799
I was going to be explaining it and then somehow it transitioned into being I guess a guided meditation so hopefully

117
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:42,960
some of you understood and weren't waiting the whole time

118
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:50,580
and uh I think it came a little bit from my own

119
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:57,559
being quiet and settled and sharing that from with you

120
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:06,080
so we come to the last of the

121
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:12,900
gladness pent heads and this is samadhi and samadhi is a

122
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:19,799
powerful word in India and to translate it somalia's concentration we lose some of the

123
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:27,539
richness and the breath and the of it sometimes I have this idea that in its

124
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:35,700
Indian context samadhi is uh is has many meanings sometimes it refers

125
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:40,980
to kind of some of the deepest realizations a person can have

126
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:46,320
and um but in terms of and so some people will

127
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,539
understand it to be a deep absorption Emer immersion in our experience in

128
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:58,380
ourselves in the meditation we immerse ourselves in it some but it the quality of that

129
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:05,520
immersion that absorption at all is kind of like entering into a sacred

130
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:14,940
Place say sacred grove a sacred spot in nature a sacred Temple

131
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:21,720
there's really a feeling about this is this is where you know

132
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:28,860
allow me to say this is where church is this is where and if for people that are theistic which I'm not particularly but

133
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:35,820
this is the presence of God here it's it's a it's a really quite something to be immersed in with all this goodness

134
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:40,860
that samadhi is to translate it as concentration many

135
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:47,279
people take it to be kind of a laser focused bearing down a straining to look and be

136
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:56,700
but it's more like there's a welcome at the center of your being a warm happy

137
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:03,360
a loving welcome and that you somehow your system your whole psychophysical being feels that

138
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:11,220
welcome and uh and then is happy to kind of settle there settle

139
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:17,039
around it kind of like settling around the Earth or you know or a group of people kind of

140
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:24,840
settling around a fire and being cozy and comfortable together your whole being and so the part of what

141
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:31,919
samadhi is is a gathering together of all our faculties the classic language

142
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,960
is that of unification that there's a unified field nothing is

143
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:43,799
scattered nothing is fragmented we're not spinning out there's not a centrifugal force outwards with the mind

144
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:50,820
if anything there's a settling inward or here and as that's settling uh happens more

145
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:56,220
and more it's there's levels of it and the experience of somebody shifts and changes

146
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:02,760
and sometimes a sense of boundaries and barriers fall away then even though I

147
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:08,100
talked about this settling into the center um the center the idea that there's a

148
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:15,179
edge to the to the space which are centered on Falls away and sometimes

149
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:20,580
somebody just feels like we're immersed in um kind of like in um if we swim

150
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:26,460
underwater in a beautiful clear lake or some place and underneath kind

151
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:31,860
of in the scuba space it feels peaceful and quiet and we might look up at the

152
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:37,200
surface a few feet above us and see that there's some agitation of the water up there

153
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,360
but uh here where we are we're kind of immersed in this kind of boundless kind

154
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:47,820
of Water World so um

155
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:53,100
so samadhi and uh and the sense that samadhi is not

156
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:59,460
something to strain for is part of the lesson of this gladness pentad

157
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:07,740
that uh the um that it's built on the previous form

158
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:16,260
and you see in the teachings of the Buddha over and over again different kind of ways samadhi follows the the five the four

159
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:23,039
before it follows gladness Joy Tranquility of the body

160
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:30,500
and um happiness and then samani and it follows almost as a natural uh phenomena

161
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:36,480
and uh what we're doing here is a very profound principle of the Buddhas and

162
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:44,340
that is that we're not causing meditation to happen we're not causing samadhi or concentration to happen but

163
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:52,919
rather we're setting up the conditions that allows it to happen and and the way that these uh gladness

164
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:58,799
pentat is talked about is not something we do but rather something we allow

165
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:04,080
something that naturally flows that there's a naturalness to when we have

166
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:11,279
this Dharma gladness that from there there arises a joy from there there

167
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:20,039
arises Tranquility from there there there happiness occurs and from there samadhi

168
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:25,679
concentration happens so so

169
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:32,159
as we give ourselves to the practice we have to kind of practice as I like to say sometimes the practice

170
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:38,460
doesn't work at all I can finally tell you that practice doesn't work definitively if you don't

171
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:44,659
do it there is a doing of it that has to happen but what that doing is is partly

172
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:52,679
showing up really showing up here so we can begin allowing here to unfold

173
00:33:52,679 --> 00:34:00,840
and here unfolds without our reactivity here unfolds without our straining and

174
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:06,799
wanting without our mind being scattered and distracted and so when we start becoming

175
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:13,440
undistracted and here enough it doesn't have to be dramatic enough that that

176
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:19,378
there's a there begins to be an unfolding a deepening that is not

177
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:26,339
necessarily our doing but what we allow for so if we're always staying the agent the

178
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:32,760
one who does uh in practice we can only take the practice so far at some point

179
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:39,060
we have to start being the doer that does something shows up but at some point we also start allowing then more

180
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:46,260
and more there's more and more allowing of something to flow through us something to unfold within us

181
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:53,000
it's not so mystical it's a very you know practical or very you know simple

182
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:00,359
that comes when we allow ourselves to kind of just be present and relax and

183
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:07,440
um one of the remarkable things that's kind of a little bit um embarrassing maybe for some of us

184
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,599
is all our grand conclusions about the world about ourselves and how terrible

185
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:18,000
things are how terrible we are or the challenges we have or even how great things are

186
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:25,579
that happen from the thinking mind the conceiving mind that's kind of living in its thoughts reactions ideas of things

187
00:35:25,579 --> 00:35:31,020
that when those ideas and thinking quiets down we start living a different

188
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:39,079
world and where the conclusions are very different so even like this idea this is boring

189
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:45,839
boredom is a certain activity of the Mind actions of the mind that the mind

190
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:52,380
is kind of constructing the evaluation things are boring but as the mind gets quieter this kind

191
00:35:52,380 --> 00:36:01,020
of centrifugal force away from the center that boredom is that there's a the boredom vanishes

192
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:07,160
and you see but it's not boring here at all um unless we return into that evaluative

193
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:14,760
analytical kind of mind which is an activated mind and this quieting settling coming

194
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:23,700
together uh immersing ourselves in our experience here that kind of begins to slowly occur on

195
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:30,000
its own and sometimes uh you know if you have a daily sitting practice

196
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,720
this process might be so slow it's inconse in in and can't uh

197
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:43,680
see it day by day there's almost like a slow and steady movement that moves us

198
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,839
through this gladness pentad so much so we don't necessarily see it or recognize

199
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:54,000
the stages as so slow but then eventually allows us to kind of sit down

200
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,099
to meditate and it's more like here I am and there's a entering into it or

201
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:06,480
allowing into it that maybe is a samadhi or it can be that sometimes in one

202
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:12,599
meditation session you can almost feel the cascading movement like water down

203
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:18,380
down a hillside of going through these different steps

204
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:24,839
It's relatively easy for me to talk about it it's not so easy to

205
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:31,440
have this happen so it's very important not to be you know be a kid in the back seat that's

206
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:38,420
saying am I there yet am I there yet kind of wanting it and trying to make it happen

207
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:43,920
a hugely important part of this meditation practice is a certain kind of

208
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:49,380
contentment to be practicing with whatever the circumstances are that you're practicing

209
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:56,640
with there's a very profound principle that I like that the Dharma knows better than

210
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:04,200
you what you should be experiencing that there are no mistakes when you sit down to meditate whatever you're given

211
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:11,339
is what we learn to practice with without trying it to make it different but rather to wake up with it to be

212
00:38:11,339 --> 00:38:17,280
present with it in a very wise way if anything what we can do is we can

213
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:23,460
learn to relax relax with it all relax with a difficulty relax around

214
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:28,740
what's difficult let the thinking mind relax this

215
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:34,859
relaxing this tranquilizing is when as we stay present as we stay attentive is

216
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:40,560
this is the really the ingredient for allowing the gladness pent had to move

217
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,780
through us on its own then as we do that

218
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:51,540
and we come to some modicum of being settled and present here

219
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:56,640
so that we're not being scattered or pulled into the world

220
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:04,099
of thinking and reactivity and we're able to see and be present then the repented

221
00:39:04,099 --> 00:39:10,740
gladness pentat opens up to being able to see how things are

222
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:17,820
uh just to see deeply and um and what we see deeply one of

223
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:24,240
those things is the nature of suffering we might begin the practice because we

224
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:30,380
suffer and we want to find some relief some freedom from that suffering

225
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:36,540
but we're not really ready to address it deeply until we've prepared the ground for it until we've entered into the

226
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:42,140
temple in a respectful and kind and appropriate way

227
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:50,040
and enter into the temple of samadhi then we have new eyes with which to see

228
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:55,380
the suffering so yes we're here to

229
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:03,359
overcome suffering don't be so concerned with it at first Let It Be the motivating factor and part

230
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:08,940
of what why you feel the gladness knowing that you're on a path to end of

231
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:16,440
suffering but don't try to fix it and navigate it as you begin your practice just develop

232
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:24,000
the ability to be present and then when the time is right that

233
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,460
when the Dharma knows best for you you will address the suffering in a deep way

234
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:35,820
and seeing things as they are is the the nature of it and then I wasn't planning on this but

235
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:42,839
that says coincidentally the topic for tomorrow's day long is the four noble truths truth of suffering

236
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:48,140
so it is kind of a follow-up today I don't know if there's still space in the day long

237
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:53,460
but it's it's online it's uh you find

238
00:40:53,460 --> 00:41:02,180
the registration and um in the Insight Retreat Center

239
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,400
website where it talks about um

240
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:15,480
day longs online day longs there's also a link to it in the IMC what's new

241
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:21,780
and if there is space and you can only come to part of the day that's fine it's best to come early I suppose though the

242
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:27,119
whole day is going to be a cover the four noble truths it's kind of a little

243
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:33,000
bit of a teaching day and practice day and meditation day so

244
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:39,000
so thank you very much for this and I appreciate having this chance to teach

245
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,660

246
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:51,920
