1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,720
greetings good day

2
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:13,960
Alaska yeah good people good friends checking

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:20,000
in from all over and thus We Begin the day and

4
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,279
today returning to this theme of

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:36,600
the understandings that arise in the meditation as we practice and that as I've been saying

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:43,120
may bring a smile to our faces that Echoes that that reflects the Buddhist Smile as we see in much of the

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:52,120
iconography of Buddhist practice around the world and today the uh knowledge that

8
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:58,120
arises is the uh that it's the wise the

9
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,720
noble the uh those of good heart who engage in this

10
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:11,000
practice and so want to sort of uh celebrate the community of

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,680
practice that we that that support our practice and and to which we give our

12
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,720
support something that arises in the meditation is that this community of

13
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,400
practice is wholesome and supportive and uh helps us

14
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,479
as we develop and deepen our our

15
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:43,360
practice so let's sit together in meditation I'll guide just a little bit

16
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,040
this morning and as we close the eyes bring

17
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:56,159
our attention Inward and downward connect with the breathing with the body with the perhaps with the weight of the

18
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,240
body the the the settledness of the body we can connect too with the

19
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,759
Simplicity the slow pace and the uncomplicated

20
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:15,239
nature of the body's knowing sensing of

21
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:21,319
experience just as a way to whatever we've been up to so far this day slowing

22
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:30,120
down simplifying and balancing and rebalancing our attention

23
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:42,519
and as we settle into our own meditative place or

24
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:51,239
space today we can bring attention to this community of practice that

25
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,280
meditates together these mornings

26
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:08,000
and perhaps feeling the benefit of that support for what is our individual

27
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,920
Private Practice feeling that

28
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,120
the experience we meet in our practice the challenges we feel and also some of

29
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:27,959
the lightness the ease that comes with our practice is shared in this community of

30
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:34,560
practice and that both the challenges we face and

31
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,400
the lightness and ease are supported by this

32
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,680
community sometimes when we meditate together in a physical

33
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,280
space and we open the eyes after we finish a period of meditation and we

34
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,680
look around and uh if we're meeting the Gaze of

35
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:04,280
others we may exchange a smile SM it's a smile of knowing that comes

36
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:11,040
from the meditation experience something deep that comes up that knows that this

37
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:21,518
companionship this camaraderie this partnership or partnering in the path is

38
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,759
wholesome sometimes we know very little about our Dharma friends

39
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:37,479
people with whom we meditate but what we do know and something a knowledge that arises by

40
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:45,240
itself from the meditation as per this week's teachings there's the knowledge

41
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,680
that we are facing some of the

42
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:57,080
same challenges that we're experiencing some of the same ease or

43
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:03,160
peace and that by doing this together in

44
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,520
community we support one another's

45
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:17,800
practice so today the smile that can come up in our meditation with this understanding I'd

46
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,840
like to suggest that we can bask in this glow of what is

47
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:30,120
a a shared Act of generosity in our practice

48
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:42,960
we generously give our support to one another by showing up to practice

49
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,800
together and then we open up and receive that support from

50
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,160
others and this can be a knowing that comes up in the meditation sometimes it's hard to ask

51
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:01,639
for sometimes it's difficult to ask for help or support

52
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:10,199
and in this community that's part of what we give is

53
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:15,800
an openness to receiving the support of one

54
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:23,960
another in the path of practice anyway and see if you can feel

55
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:31,479
the community today even if mediated in this Thoroughly Modern postmodern way

56
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:37,240
through devices and screens and

57
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:45,160
electrons feel other people sitting other people at ease other people

58
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:52,680
struggling other people willing to give time and attention other people willing to

59
00:06:52,680 --> 00:07:01,000
receive and see if perhaps a gentle inward smile arises

60
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
e

61
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440

e

90
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

91
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440

92
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

93
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

94
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

95
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

96
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

97
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

98
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,278
e e

99
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:15,120
so as we move toward the end of this sitting

100
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:26,600
period we might reflect again

101
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:34,720
on the beauty of a community that gathers to

102
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:43,200
practice to support one another to receive the support of

103
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:56,519
others we might reflect that in this community

104
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:02,640
practice we join the Buddha

105
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:09,480
and other awakened ones in the meditation

106
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:17,158
practice it's a vast Community people who've practiced in these Buddhist

107
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:26,360
Traditions people who seek to see clearly to open the heart

108
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:40,919
and it's a knowledge that arises from within the meditation that this

109
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,600
goodness that's possible this ease this this place for the mind to

110
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,760
rest that this is shared by others

111
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:58,960
who Orient themselves toward freedom

112
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:10,240
there's a knowing that arises that this meditation is practiced

113
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,600
by people like ourselves

114
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:25,200
who have become aware of a mind or heart that wants to be free

115
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:43,799
our acknowledgement of this understanding that arises in the meditation strengthens our own practice

116
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:47,080
and also strengthens the

117
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:54,720
community and let's end the meditation by committing ourselves to not making it

118
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:00,278
an exclusive Community but one that that's

119
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,679
inclusive we don't know where people are on the path we know that all people like

120
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:12,080
ourselves have their quirks their idiosyncrasies their

121
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,320
warts their shortcomings their

122
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,240
failings their rough

123
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:31,960
edges and we can expand our care to meet all of

124
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:39,240
them may all the people in the community of practice may all the people in the larger Community affected by our

125
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:44,919
practice together know some benefit from this

126
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:49,200
goodness of heart this ease in the

127
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:56,919
mind may all beings be free of suffering may all beings be

128
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,960
free for

129
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:36,000
good morning again friends good afternoon good day good evening

130
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:43,080
even depending on where you are and what salutation is appropriate

131
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:50,639
welcome today I'd like to continue with the the third of the five knowledges

132
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:56,279
that this particular text tells us arise for

133
00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:02,760
us in our EXP experience of the meditation all we all we need to do is

134
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:08,000
notice that along with the meditation as we deepen

135
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,799
it there arises an understanding that the pleasant the pleasure of the meditation is

136
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:23,760
wholesome that was Monday that it um is good now and good

137
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:31,440
in the future yesterday and today that um we're we have the

138
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,760
great Fortune of practicing along with others who share a commitment

139
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:43,799
to to being Freer being awake or more awake in the

140
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:49,159
world and um The Meditation the smile that arises

141
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:56,399
the Buddhist smile is uh a recognition of the the shared experience of the

142
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:02,360
meditation and the the act of generosity uh that brings us together to

143
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:08,919
practice together so a couple comments on on this

144
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:14,399
and again I'm just going to reread the just with focusing on today's

145
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:19,720
understanding but I think it's useful to hear the opening encouragement the encouragement is

146
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:26,039
to develop a meditation that's described as

147
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:31,799
Limitless to deepen the practice to cultivate great collectedness and great

148
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:38,279
Stillness great ease in the mind and the text goes on to say that

149
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:45,120
when we do this as we are alert and mindful that is as we pay attention to what's coming up

150
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:51,320
in the meditation five knowledges arise for us

151
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:58,679
personally and the third of these is that this meditation is practicing

152
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:05,200
by um well-meaning good-hearted people and that it

153
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,200
includes the fully awake and the

154
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:15,638
Buddha when we immerse ourselves in this Community

155
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:23,358
Practice one of the understandings that arises is that we are in good company you know with one

156
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:30,358
another and also with others who've practiced this practice before

157
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:38,040
including the Buddha so that when we as the phrase is

158
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:44,000
and as I titled this Dharma talk Sunday when I Was preparing titles when we

159
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,878
associate with the wise when we come together with other

160
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:57,839
practitioners we're in the company too of the Buddha and others who've become

161
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:03,240
fully awake in this practice we enter what's referred to sometimes in the

162
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,680
texts as the Buddha's

163
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:16,760
dwelling sometimes practitioners ask why did the Buddha continue meditating after

164
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:24,119
Awakening and it's an interesting question many

165
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:30,000
ways to answer it but in a sense uh from Once

166
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:37,400
awake the Buddha's mind is always in this deep meditative state that sees

167
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,520
clearly it's a place where the means and the ends are the are the

168
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,560
same and that settling into this Pleasant abiding of the

169
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:55,400
meditation as we said in the last couple days produces good outcomes helps us in

170
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:02,119
our actions and interactions um and it also keeps us in touch with

171
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:08,040
what it's like to be more awake it's a way of practicing

172
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:15,240
Awakening practicing being present for our experience in a way

173
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:21,440
that's non-judgmental doesn't isn't filled with projections and

174
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:28,760
attachments in which the heart little by little becomes fully open

175
00:36:30,319 --> 00:36:36,880
it's also said that the Buddha continues to meditate after Awakening out of compassion for all beings that is as a

176
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,119
way to support others on the practice sorry others on the path and this I

177
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:48,880
think um is uh something that we keep alive when

178
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:55,319
we practice together this commitment to helping one another in our practices and

179
00:36:55,319 --> 00:37:02,720
by extension helping all beings so yeah this is a lovely

180
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:08,839
community that we practice in community of people who share some dedication to

181
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:14,560
being more awake in the world meeting experience with a with the heart

182
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:21,559
that's always opening more what could be sweeter

183
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,520
right just as sometimes people ask why why did the Buddha keep meditating after

184
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:37,240
Awakening sometimes asked why do meditators meditate together it's kind

185
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:42,680
of a practice we do alone you know when we close our eyes or leave our eyes open

186
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:50,079
when we enter the meditative experience we're very much in our in sort of a the

187
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:55,240
internal the inner life as Gil sometimes calls it attending

188
00:37:55,240 --> 00:38:00,760
to uh what's going on in the realm the arena of the inner

189
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:07,240
life and uh why do this together uh why do it in this fashion

190
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:15,200
right mediated over great distances by devices screens and

191
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:24,839
electrons and uh today I'm suggesting that uh we do it as a we do it as a way

192
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:30,800
uh we do it as as an act of generosity and we can receive which is hard to do

193
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:38,240
sometimes we can receive that generous uh impulse from others who practice

194
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:45,800
together with us in this community there's a fun story that some

195
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:52,280
of you I'm sure familiar with uh

196
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:57,880
that is is a helps us understand a little bit what happens with when we

197
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:05,000
practice in community when we benefit from the

198
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:13,520
companionship the camaraderie of practice on the path and when we we give our share when we contribute to the

199
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:22,839
support of others in the in the path of practice um one day goes the story and

200
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:28,000
I'm just going to sort of remember it uh off the top of my head one day the

201
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,520
Buddha and his longtime attendant probably a a cousin of the Buddha man

202
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:42,400
named Ananda are sitting alone together on a hill overlooking the plains of the

203
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:48,760
ganes and um Ananda sometimes on these occasions when he and the Buddha are

204
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:54,760
alone will share uh some of his Reflections uh or insights with the

205
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:01,359
Buddha and Ananda says on this particular particular occasion something like venerable one dear

206
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:06,520
teacher it seems to me upon consideration that half of the spiritual

207
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:12,359
life is good friendship good companionship good camaraderie

208
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:19,880
ship for good comradeship and uh I mean when you speak

209
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:26,040
in insight to the Buddha you're probably uh pretty uh you you're a little cautious

210
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:31,160
in advancing a view of this sort and so Ananda is probably a little

211
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:37,640
taken back when the Buddha says not so Ananda don't don't say

212
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:45,680
that um and the Buddha says far from being something like this far from being

213
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:52,079
half of the spiritual life spiritual friendship is the whole of the spiritual

214
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:58,040
life good friendship good companionship good comradeship

215
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:08,800
and the Buddha means several things by this the what we from what we understand of the historical Buddha uh among among

216
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:16,200
the idiosyncrasies we pick up and this personality is the uh the light in word

217
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:24,640
play and the Buddha is saying here that um that this practice in community this

218
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:34,280
practice with others is he's saying think for sure that this is an extraordinarily important part of the

219
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,880
practice and he's also saying that uh he

220
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:45,599
is that spiritual friend with whom by extension we all

221
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:51,839
practice Ananda for sure but also um Millennia

222
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:58,079
later ourselves so when we engage in this

223
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:04,640
community of practice and part of what brings that smile that inward smile something that arises in the meditation

224
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:11,520
with this understanding is that when we practice together with other people dedicated to

225
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:20,480
Awakening other people dedicated to opening the heart as fully as we can that we are in

226
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:27,400
the presence of the Buddha that this meditative EXP

227
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:36,079
experience that we settle into uh along with its pleasure along

228
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:44,440
with is pointing toward its onward leading nature I had to check what I talk about

229
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:53,960
yesterday it has this characteristic too of bringing us into the community of

230
00:42:53,960 --> 00:43:00,240
um Millions hundreds of thousands many many many practitioners over Millennia

231
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:06,200
who shared this commitment to the open heart and the free

232
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:14,319
mind so by extension I think we can say the Buddha the dhama the teachings and

233
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:20,119
the S all provide spiritual friendship to

234
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:27,960
us and the meditation when we enter into it in this way this third understanding

235
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:36,960
arises naturally from the meditation that we're in touch with um very uh very

236
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:42,160
um that we're in we're in touch with Awakening in the meditation if we pay

237
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:50,160
attention we find ourselves in the Buddhist dwelling we find ourselves deep in the

238
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:57,480
teachings in the Dharma where instead of the meditation being a means to an end

239
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:05,880
it is the end we seek or the end we seek is within it there is ease and Stillness

240
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,799
there is an open heart there to be

241
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:19,000
cultivated and we find ourselves in the company of other good-hearted people like those here today greeting one

242
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,079
another from around the world or quietly without engaging in the YouTube chat

243
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:31,079
that's most of us um you know quietly enjoying

244
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:36,280
company um quietly being

245
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:42,359
together and I I I I I don't have an ending in mind for today but what I'm

246
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:48,520
gonna what I'm going to just end with is the memory probably shared by many of us

247
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:53,839
just experienced this over the weekend took a drive with my adult daughter

248
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:59,559
who's 40 and we we drove up into the motherload country of

249
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:07,800
California I was down for a visit and um oh I don't know 20 minutes 25 minutes

250
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:14,480
in it shoulder toosh shoulder winding up the hills um sort of had this

251
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:21,200
realization that we were sitting together in companionate

252
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:26,240
quiet and this I think is how I would

253
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:34,440
characterize what our meditation can be like in community that sense of complete familiarity with others that's based on

254
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:42,400
some trust or confidence in their company and some sense that even without words spoken even without um

255
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,680
conversation even without

256
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:05,400
participate in the YouTube chat but also to all of us sitting together

257
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:10,480
quietly enjoying the company and noticing in the

258
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:18,280
meditation um the goodness of the community and maybe recognizing again um

259
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:23,720
a sense of um a sense of an inner smile

260
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:29,400
that develops as we recognize that community and it's

261
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:36,799
blessing so thank you till tomorrow looking forward to it bye
