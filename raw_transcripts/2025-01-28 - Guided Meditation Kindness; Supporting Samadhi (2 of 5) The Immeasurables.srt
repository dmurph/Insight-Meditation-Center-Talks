1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:07,399
welcome everyone is I'm taking a lot of uh joy out of reading your chat messages

2
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:15,000
from all over thank you so much and Welcome to our week of practicing

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,880
supports for samadi as well as samadi uh and doing a little bit more

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,640
independent practice um working with the instructions that we've received from

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,960
Gil so yesterday I shared the wisdom from the suta whatever one keeps

6
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,480
pursuing with one's thinking and pondering that becomes the inclination

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,600
of one's awareness and the invitation was to see

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:53,800
how you use your attention throughout the day and to understand what supports

9
00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:00,600
Sama and perhaps some of the things that lead to a distracted mind or a a mind

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,680
that has more difficulty settling and all of this was also part

11
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:14,000
of an invitation to strengthen both samadi and Sati Sati mindfulness

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,640
strengthening that during the day by coming back and to it as often as you

13
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,119
remember noticing any hindrances that are happening in sitting practice and in

14
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:31,680
daily life and meeting them with compassion

15
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:40,720
the more we see them the more we disentangle from them because just by seeing them we're already taking one

16
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,560
step towards Freedom away from dissatisfaction stress and

17
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,240
suffering so there was also the experiment yesterday to

18
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,360
visit for just a few minutes at a time perhaps throughout the day that place of

19
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:06,960
deep Stillness and to join a second sitting or to practice in a second sitting on your

20
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:14,599
own so we're dedicating the week or I'm dedicating the week to helping support

21
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:22,879
what helps us with somadi discovering what supports us with Sade and what stands in the

22
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,879
way so today again we'll continue to cultivate it in the way that Gil's been

23
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,080
teaching it extending the time that we spend uh in

24
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,040
this morning sitting by just a few minutes and we'll do the same technique

25
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:47,200
if it works for you well to count the breath very softly in the background the

26
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:55,120
primary focus is on the sensations of breathing and staying with being present

27
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,159
with the entire breath from the very beginning through the entire inhalation

28
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:06,519
maybe a little pause if it's there between the inhalation and the

29
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:13,000
exhalation and following the entire exhalation beginning and returning

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,040
perhaps in a place deep within of Stillness and then very softly in the

31
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:26,360
background see how softly it can work for you using counting so Gil introduced

32
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:32,000
several different types of counting and he encouraged this week that we try

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,360
counting the breath from 1 to 10 the breaths from 1 to 10 and that could be

34
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,040
each whole breath as one two Etc or it

35
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:51,319
could be if you need more uh stimulation to maintain mindfulness one with the in

36
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:58,799
breath two with the out breath three with the INB breath four with the out breath so with that Brief Review there

37
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:06,959
are lots of different ways to count and whichever one you find that works for you settle in with it commit to it and

38
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:15,760
work with it throughout the practice could just be one and with the next breath one so

39
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:22,560
using the method that you find most helpful so we'll settle into meditation

40
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,560
here

41
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:35,479
and allowing yourself to settle in

42
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,639
gradually perhaps taking several long

43
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,039
slow deep breaths

44
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,240
letting the breathing return to normal

45
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:25,879
naturally and taking in In This Moment how you are in the mind the heart the

46
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,360
body what here right

47
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:43,120
now noticing if there's any mentally or physically that could be

48
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,479
relaxed In This Moment consciously relaxing

49
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:57,960
it and if there are areas of preoccupation or tightness that cannot be

50
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,319
relaxed it can be help helpful to soften around

51
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:11,360
that and to appreciate it's here just as it is with some kindness

52
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,000
for what's

53
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:27,440
here if there's some tightness perhaps deliberately releasing it with

54
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,039
the out breath

55
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:49,599
however you are in this moment is simply showing you things as

56
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:59,840
they have come to be there's no right or wrong way to be in meditation

57
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:16,280
we can greet all experience in this

58
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:22,440
meditation as we would greet a very dear friend

59
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:37,599
recognizing our friend with kindness relaxing and listening to them

60
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:43,759
with kind attention experience is a friend in

61
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:51,280
meditation simply showing you things as they have come to be

62
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:07,599
perhaps beginning with a few minutes of meta this practice of sending wishes of

63
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:15,879
Good Will of kindness or friendliness and doing this in a way

64
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:21,360
that is supportive for you I'll offer some

65
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:29,919
phrases and you can silently repeat those in your mind or if it's more conducive for you

66
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:36,959
to Simply radiate the feeling of Goodwill from your heart and

67
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:42,518
mind letting the phrases Fade Into the background whatever

68
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:48,120
way of coming to this that feels right to

69
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:55,320
you perhaps [Music] Beginning by allowing yourself to

70
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,800
acknowledge the goodness the whole wholesomeness of your

71
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:07,560
intention for meditating the goodness of your

72
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,839
intention for developing

73
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:30,240
samadi and Ne recognizing those good

74
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:37,160
intentions sending wishes of support for yourself and for those here

75
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:43,079
in this meditation may we be

76
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:46,360
well and

77
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:57,800
healthy really allowing that to fill your heart fill your mind

78
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:17,200
may we be free from inner and outer harm safe

79
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:44,320
may we be happy contented in the

80
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:57,480
practice contented with what we're discovering about

81
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,399
ourselves but mostly about things as they have come to

82
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,800
be may we practice with ease

83
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,760
as you take these in and radiate them

84
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:54,959
outwards allowing yourself to come into more silence more Stillness

85
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,079
rely centering on that very still Place

86
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,399
deep within perhaps

87
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:43,120
and turning attention towards the experience of

88
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,720
breathing as the inhalation arises from

89
00:12:54,279 --> 00:13:01,120
Stillness following it as it comes into the body

90
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:11,480
present for any tiny pause and then the

91
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:20,720
exhalation following it as it leaves the body

92
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,040
as we're feeling the expansion and

93
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:42,560
contraction the rise and fall perhaps beginning in the

94
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:49,839
background very quietly counting the

95
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:02,120
breath leaving the counting in the background and the experience of breathing the

96
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,560
sensations of breathing in the foreground of

97
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
awareness

98

what

106
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:31,120
if the Mind drifts away sending some some

107
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:36,520
kindness some understanding for the Natural Way human

108
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:44,159
Minds drift and gently with good

109
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:52,480
will bringing awareness to where the mind has drifted for just a few

110
00:19:52,480 --> 00:20:00,760
moments and then gradually turning awareness to this sensations of

111
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:09,240
breathing with a light touch and resuming counting in the

112
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:16,400
background in whatever way supports maintaining

113
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,559
wearen sticking with it as soft noting in the

114
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:27,640
background while keeping the sensations of breathing in the

115
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
foreground

e e

137
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:49,760
as we come to the end of the meditation extending some

138
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:56,960
appreciation allowing yourself to feel a little appreciation for any

139
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:04,960
amount of time time that awareness was settled

140
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,320
stable appreciation for how awareness was able to return

141
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:21,039
to attention to the breathing again and

142
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:31,919
again and radiating the benefit of this

143
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:39,600
practice to everyone around you everyone your life

144
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,480
touches those you know and those you don't

145
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:53,240
know may all beings be healthy and well

146
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:05,200
may all beings be free of harm be

147
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,599
safe the all beings be peaceful

148
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:35,960
May everyone without exception be free of suffering

149
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,680
e

150
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:09,599
so as we've been practicing an integral part of this

151
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:17,560
practice of samade are these Wellings up of Good Will

152
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:25,640
compassion appreciation and equinity Tanis biku wrote this

153
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:31,160
translation a part that I'll read to you of one of

154
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:38,920
the numerical discourses of the Buddha called the samadi sutta subtitled

155
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:44,560
immeasurable concentration wise and mindful you

156
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:50,760
should develop immeasurable concentration that is concentration

157
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:59,400
based on immeasurable Goodwill compassion appreciation or equinity

158
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:05,680
so these four qualities of heart good will compassion appreciative

159
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:12,640
joy and equinity are often called the immeasurables they are also called the

160
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:18,760
Brahma viharas which or Brahma vihara which translates

161
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:27,160
as Divine abodes in other words really beautiful Elevated Places to hang out

162
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:35,680
ment and you know with the heart and body and mind um and we could consider them

163
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:41,119
beautiful qualities of mind um this reference to

164
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:48,040
immeasurables means that as we practice them regularly they grow and grow to the

165
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:57,000
point where they're capable of encompassing all beings they're boundless

166
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:10,480
so maybe many of you have already had experience of the way that good willll

167
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:17,400
compassion appreciation and equinity tend to grow the more you practice and

168
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:24,079
maybe you've even noticed them welling up spontaneously at times this is one of the beautiful things that happens with

169
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:29,920
continuity of mindfulness it's often one of the gifts of being on Retreat is just

170
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:38,280
out of nowhere feeling the heart fill with kindness or with

171
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:45,640
compassion so these Brahma vihara support the calm and peace the St

172
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:52,839
stability the settledness that help Som to become

173
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:58,480
stronger so we can apply the brah vihara during the cultiv a of

174
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,160
samade in both in formal sitting and also we can apply it in daily life

175
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:09,960
certainly so one invitation today would be to see what it might be

176
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:16,680
like to greet everything that arrives with one of these prah

177
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:22,040
vihara perhaps uh treating everything as though it were a gift from the Buddha a

178
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:29,079
teaching from the Buddha so you could ask yourself in any particular moment that stands out or

179
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:35,960
that when uh mindfulness comes back to mind what might it be like in this

180
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:43,920
moment to greet this experience as if it were a dear friend sometimes our friends call for

181
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:51,440
just a general they bring forth a general feeling of Goodwill so what might be like to agree this as with

182
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:58,640
Goodwill sometimes friends are in trouble and we greet them with compassion so there may be moments that

183
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:04,240
arise that could be greeted with compassion of course we take joy in the

184
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:11,160
things that our friends uh have in their lives that bring them happiness or a good fortune

185
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:16,839
so you might greet some experiences with that appreciative joy and then there are

186
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:23,280
times when what a friend is going through pulls us so hard that we need to

187
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:30,000
find our own balance or keep our own balance some imity is called

188
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:37,680
for so we can ask ourselves um what might good will or kindness or

189
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:43,640
friendliness teach us today about

190
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:51,079
ourselves about practicing in daily life and what might

191
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:58,160
compassion help us understand that might be perplexing at this moment

192
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:03,480
what might it be like to greet certain things with appreciation so for example

193
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:09,960
something unpleasant arises or something you don't like what might it like what

194
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:16,520
might it be like to have some appreciation for it as a teaching as something we need to

195
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:23,720
learn or as one of these moments that has arrived just things as they are in this

196
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:30,800
moment or as they have come to be and what might we learn

197
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:39,200
about equinity or balance being an ally at times that feel

198
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:47,680
tumultuous what can we learn today about freedom from

199
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:54,480
dissatisfaction freedom from stress freedom from

200
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:01,040
suffering so practicing in this way throughout the day with whatever arises

201
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:07,480
with hindrances as they arise may bring further stability to

202
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:16,000
samade and again uh an invitation today is to find your way through both the

203
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,640
difficult places that arise not to pave over them with this practice because if

204
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:28,079
you do that if you just try to substitute paying attention to breathing

205
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:34,319
for some difficulty that you know is going on uh there's a way in which that

206
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:39,839
actually stands in the way of somat so if something tough is

207
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:48,319
happening noticing it so taking a pause meeting it as a friend understanding it listening to it

208
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:53,800
and if something beautiful arises greeting it as a

209
00:42:54,079 --> 00:43:00,760
friend so the invitation today is is again to come back to mindfulness as

210
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:08,280
often as you can during the day in addition to greeting things with the as if they were dear friends with Brahma

211
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:15,000
vihara and then uh as I did each as I will do each day this week I'll offer a

212
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,839
silent sitting this afternoon for 20 minutes on zoom and you can find the

213
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:28,880
zoom link and the uh password that you'll need on the IMC calendar so you're

214
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:35,200
welcome to join that or if that's not a good time for you or you just prefer to practice on

215
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:41,160
your own maybe consider finding another piece of time during the day when you

216
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:48,400
can practice and also coming back to this practice noticing a still place or

217
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:53,800
the calm noticing the breath here and there throughout the day for even just a

218
00:43:53,800 --> 00:44:02,559
few minutes it all counts so may this practice bring all of us

219
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:09,040
greater and greater stability subtleness

220
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:16,000
presence and may that radiate out from us and support everyone else in our

221
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:23,880
lives so that everyone feels that calm that peace that collectiveness of mind

222
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,800
the mind that can be with everything and anything name that's happening right

223
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:37,040
now may we help those around us in this way may all beings be

224
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:41,280
free thank you
