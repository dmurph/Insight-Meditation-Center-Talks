1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,480
so good morning uh good uh good afternoon evening to some

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,599
of you um

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,600
okay you know uh you know the deal here

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:26,600
so um find your uh find your posture

5
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,240
so breathing in such a way that you

6
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:29,720
that helps you land here now

7
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,560
a kind of subtle ripple of relaxation of the exhalation

8
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,000
conscious effort to release

9
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
tension

10
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,720
whatever tension might remain willingness

11
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,920
to tolerate that

12
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,400
you're not responsible for experience

13
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:09,960
you're not responsible to manage and mold yourself

14
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,479
you're not responsible for awareness

15
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,880
which does itself

16
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,280
you're not responsible for generating insight

17
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,319
engineering samadhi

18
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,479
concentration

19
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,000
to the extent we're responsible for anything

20
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,879
we're responsible just for the seed

21
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:05,919
of sincerity and willingness

22
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:17,919
the willingness to offer our heart up to the dharma

23
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,720
and then trusting having faith

24
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:36,120
in the logic of the path

25
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:39,839
we drop beneath the the layers of meaning

26
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,519
into more and more simple intimate

27
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,000
experience of what's here

28
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:07,079
maybe the breath or the body more broadly

29
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,759
maybe the realm of feeling

30
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:23,199
pleasant unpleasant neutral

31
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,560
maybe sound and silence

32
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,680
maybe the darkness behind your closed eyes

33
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:59,240
we just give our attention to something

34
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:08,959
and let that simplify distill out

35
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,720
more and more of the meanings the sense making

36
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,199
until there's less and less to say about the moment

37
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:31,720
but more and more urgency to know it deeply

38
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:45,520
our compulsion to extract something

39
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:54,840
from the moment compromises our intimacy with it

40
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,399
and so there's a kind of receptivity

41
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:23,240
willingness to be softened by the moment

42
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:20,159
when we give ourselves the freedom of not needing to accumulate

43
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,159
anything

44
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:36,320
you just keep surrendering in awareness

45
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:43,880
with faith in dharma

46
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,669
[Music]

47
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:10,480
they uh researcher

48
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,600
psychologist mcadams we are

49
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:21,520
the stories we live by but we should not forget

50
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,720
that there is no good story that is free of struggle and

51
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,760
tension there is no perfect life narrative just

52
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,600
as there is no perfect life

53
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:47,039
the dharma is made of thoughts

54
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:52,799
and arrests arises when thought ceases

55
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:58,320
it's made of thoughts and arises when thoughts he says the buddha has given us

56
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:04,880
so many thoughts so many useful ideas um

57
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:11,440
decoding suffering with such brilliant distinctions and categories and

58
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:17,519
you know if you if you try to like parse experience like what is expect if

59
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:24,960
you had asked me matthew what's experience before i started practice i would have made like some wild

60
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:33,519
hand movements and i don't know what i would have said but it's confusing it's very confusing

61
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,720
and so to begin to actually make some sense of it with

62
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,919
brilliant distinctions this is so useful

63
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,399
the path is about the most beautiful thoughts you know

64
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:56,240
like is there an image that is more beautiful than meta

65
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,840
loving kindness pervading the entire world

66
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:09,039
and this path is about a deeply

67
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:14,799
meaningful way of living a way of living that

68
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:21,760
makes life feel complete a way of living where doubts about

69
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:30,399
purpose doubts about meaning really fall away the dharma answers are

70
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:38,159
quest for meaning and so the path is about meaning and the

71
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,440
path is about stepping out of thought putting down all

72
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,120
meaning all compulsion to know

73
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:56,080
and to make meaning and there's a kind of dialectic between

74
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:02,799
this meaning making and stepping out of the realm of meaning

75
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,840
so much of our thought so much of our thought has a kind of

76
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:17,679
almost a defensive quality like it's necessitated

77
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:24,720
by fear our meaning making is necessitated by

78
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:32,000
fear very innocent that it is such

79
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,519
actually some some

80
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:43,679
neuroscience the organism's survival depends on high

81
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:51,039
fidelity predictions the computationally efficient solution

82
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:57,679
to this problem is for the brain to prune its models kind of

83
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:03,360
somewhat akin to beliefs to prune its models using

84
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:09,200
prediction errors by processing the difference between a

85
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:16,800
model's predictions and sensory input the organism can indirectly quantify the

86
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,638
accuracy of its predictions and improve the models that generated them

87
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:30,398
an organism that does not aim to minimize prediction errors over time

88
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:35,398
would not survive for long

89
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,079
meaning making revolves around

90
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:50,000
this kernel of fear you know

91
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,079
the need to know we're contending with deep forces you know just

92
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:02,440
we're small creatures amidst big forces

93
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,960
and sometimes i'll see you know just look at a like a bird

94
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:15,359
in a on a branch it's so fragile and like so many

95
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:23,440
head movements just looking everywhere alert to sounds and movement

96
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,480
kind of like vigilance you know

97
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:36,160
and um we're vulnerable in some of the same ways and

98
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,680
the way to deal with that is to conceive to make meaning

99
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:50,400
and we often come to come to practice drowning in meanings

100
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,560
you know so we don't even know how utterly spellbound by

101
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:05,119
our models our interpretations the kind of house of cards of our

102
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:12,359
views and opinions our meanings

103
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,320
and when our thoughts feel real

104
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:24,320
our life feels surreal when our thoughts feel really real

105
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:30,160
our life takes on a slightly surreal quality there's a kind of alienation in

106
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:35,440
it and so gills concentric circles of like

107
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:42,000
the most elaborate fantasies out in the kind of farthest circle and we get

108
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,119
closer and closer to here

109
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,880
the more intimate we get with experience the less

110
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:01,520
we perceive as being there the less substantial life seems to feel

111
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:08,000
we make less and less meaning and this compulsion to like always be saying

112
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,320
something about experience that starts to fall away

113
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:22,400
the compulsion to like talk about our life to talk about this moment

114
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:29,920
to make meaning out of this bit of sense data that starts to fade

115
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:36,079
and experience itself when we're not making so much meaning

116
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:43,200
not conceiving in such dense ways it starts to get thinner and thinner

117
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:51,800
experience starts to get more and more run through with space

118
00:37:52,560 --> 00:38:00,560
questioner asked the buddha associated with what do appearances

119
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:08,320
disappear how do pleasure and pain disappear tell me this i'm motivated

120
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:16,320
to know how they disappear the buddha's

121
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:25,200
response appearances disappear when not conceiving concepts not conceiving false concepts

122
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:33,400
not non-conceiving and not conceiving disappearance

123
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:39,680
this is because conceiving is the basis of conceptual

124
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,680
differentiation

125
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:52,960
as the more elaborate structures of meaning

126
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:59,040
making of conceptual proliferation falls away

127
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:06,240
what is known gets quieter and quieter less and less uh substantial it's both

128
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,838
more there and less there at the same time

129
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:20,320
the field becomes less and less differentiated the lines we draw between

130
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:26,800
this experience and that experience between self and world all of this gets more

131
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:32,079
and more porous and so

132
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:39,040
we we practiced letting go of meaning and the need for meaning

133
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:45,680
letting go of the mind's desperate attempts to make conclusions

134
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:52,880
to land on a conclusion moment by moment

135
00:39:53,200 --> 00:40:00,800
sometimes i'll give the instruction and meditation like come to know conclusions

136
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:10,119
don't be satiated by any conclusion it's just another

137
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,359
conceiving moment

138
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:25,040
and then from the silence and the stillness from that we make new meanings

139
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:31,280
yeah we don't it's like we don't find our meaning in stories

140
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:37,960
but in the intimacy with experience

141
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:46,240
like the building blocks of our stories is just this very intimate encounter

142
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:55,279
with no way knowing in this really pared down simple way

143
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:04,880
and so the building blocks of our stories don't come from they come from this like encounter

144
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:12,160
encounter with experience and we tell new stories

145
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:20,720
about experience new stories about who we are new stories about what means what

146
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:26,720
new stories about goodness and new stories about what matters

147
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:33,440
and our autobiography our autobiography becomes a dharma story

148
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:39,920
a story of dukkha and delusion and clinging and

149
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,078
release and love

150
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:53,680
and meaning and meaninglessness coexist

151
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:01,760
but the stories that come out of the intimacy of this experience

152
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:09,200
they're infused with space infused with space they feel different

153
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:16,240
than other stories yeah we make meaning out of experience

154
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:23,280
we tell stories about who we are and what we're doing we tell stories about the

155
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:29,720
freedom of heart but the urgency and

156
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:34,880
entanglement with our stories that starts to dissolve

157
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:41,839
we become more circumspect about our lives our plans

158
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:47,200
all the meanings we make the stories we tell there is space

159
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:53,920
everywhere there is space everywhere even as we live

160
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,720
a committed life

161
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:07,200
so meaning and

162
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,480
meaninglessness dialectic

163
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:21,200
offer this uh for your consideration

164
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,079
and um yeah

165
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:33,359
appreciate the chance to be with you today may uh

166
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:39,359
yeah dharma blessings rain down upon you today and

167
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:45,520
well we gather 23 hours so

168
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,760
thank you
