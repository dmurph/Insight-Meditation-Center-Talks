1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,720
we'll give a sound of a bell to

2
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:21,480
begin Welcome Friends you may be a little surprised

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,080
and that I'm here this week um uh Nikki

4
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:34,160
morer who I was supposed to teach this week was not feeling very well so I got

5
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,239
a call yesterday and and so I decided to

6
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:49,039
step in uh to be with you all and this is 7 a.m. meditation and uh

7
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,719
practice and so um uh what I had in mind

8
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,719
was maybe uh somewhat simple and uh keeping our practice ractice

9
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:07,159
alive and so this week uh what we thought what I thought we might do in

10
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:13,880
our meditation is our explicitly bring in uh

11
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:23,560
some ways of a practicing that may enrich enliven our practice in some ways

12
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:31,240
and that's a hope and it doesn't have to um but you can join me however you are

13
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:38,200
um with uh a possibility to open to some of the uh perspectives if they are new

14
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,520
to you um and then I'll uh talk about a

15
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:50,320
set of practice skills uh in the daret to maybe elaborate a little more in

16
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,759
terms of uh how we

17
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:09,000
practice so uh this morning uh I wanted to start uh with a um uh

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,879
a uh a practice method that I um have

19
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:23,120
been practicing with for the last few years and this is um called the arriving

20
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:33,920
sequence I occasionally have shared this um in uh some of the dayl s and um uh 7

21
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:41,200
a.m. but this week I like to kind of uh exclusivly uh maybe naming how we

22
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,040
practice with this this is something that I learned from one of my teachers

23
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:54,519
Philip mfet it has uh really been uh quite meaningful to me and I'm hoping

24
00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:00,840
that this will be meaningful to you as well and I will be expanding standing

25
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,480
from this arriving sequence that we start today to include some different

26
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,200
elements of it as we go along for the rest of the

27
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:20,159
week and so maybe you can join me in this

28
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:27,640
meditation by finding a posture finding a space where you can sit

29
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,000
quietly uh for about 40 5 minutes

30
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:45,480
together and so maybe gently close your eyes uh if that's part of your

31
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,480
practice

32
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:03,079
arriving this arriving sequence

33
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:07,360
begins with

34
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,680
arriving arriving here and

35
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,160
now just this sense of arriving May

36
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,759
already evoke some momentary sense of a

37
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:45,639
presence mindful

38
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:56,199
presence maybe the sense of a body sitting here or lying down

39
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
here

40
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:12,479
arriving as if you're getting ready to

41
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,600
enter the temple

42
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,479
Within

43
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:43,319
gentling and feeling and sensing how it feels to be

44
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:47,400
arriving at here and

45
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,400
now maybe there is a sense

46
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:05,160
of energy settling [Music] down through the

47
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,720
Torso all the way down to the

48
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:24,840
ground mindfulness becomes more and more front

49
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,919
and center

50
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:37,120
and maybe heartfulness becomes more and

51
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:44,389
more front and [Music]

52
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:58,199
center very as a no rush to go somewhere

53
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
else

54
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:10,000
we are arriving Here and

55
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,520
Now what's the felt sense of a arriving for

56
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,960
you maybe you feel something in the

57
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,560
body maybe you feel something with the

58
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
breath

59
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:13,560
maybe now you can hear the sound and the silence in

60
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
between

61
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:08,839
allow arriving to be felt

62
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:16,240
sense and known with the

63
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,440
body with the

64
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:31,120
heart there is no need to figure it out

65
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,240
at some point you may

66
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,079
recognize that you've

67
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:02,399
arrived you're now here more

68
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:26,040
fully becoming available to the lived

69
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:34,640
experience in this arriving

70
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,720
sequence being

71
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:49,440
available arises out of having

72
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,360
arrived here and

73
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
now

74
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:24,920
what's the felt sense of a becoming available for

75
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
you

76
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:44,120
maybe a kind of softening

77
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,560
relaxing of the

78
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:57,120
body maybe the mind and heart is more

79
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
receptive

80
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:23,079
maybe there is a sense of a opening like the opening of The

81
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:30,880
[Music] Palms

82
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:40,160
being available to the lift experience that's happening right

83
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,079
now whether it's Pleasant

84
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,120
unpleasant or everything in

85
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
between

86
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,639
available to

87
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:27,760
life letting go or putting down the demands and

88
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
agendas

89
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,519
showing up for

90
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
this

91
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:17,680
Maybe by being available we can

92
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:26,399
notice how we may be caught up in the stories in the

93
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:32,800
thinking that we become un available to

94
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:51,000
life without blaming judging

95
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,680
criticizing we simply available

96
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:10,839
to notice to know and the moment

97
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,839
of CAU up is

98
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:30,600
happening feeling and sensing

99
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:42,319
the felt sense of being available is like

100
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:52,440
this you may know it through the body through the

101
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
heart

102
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:30,519
from this open receptive

103
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,120
relaxed field of

104
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:40,360
availability and a

105
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:54,360
presence we move to align our heart and

106
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:03,889
mind with the deepest [Music]

107
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,079
intentions

108
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:21,918
aligning without jumping into Concepts

109
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:29,200
ideas can you feel align

110
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:38,440
through the body aligning with what's

111
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,880
wholesome aligning with something

112
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,880
that's

113
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:01,440
aspirational you may feel something in the heart

114
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:27,240
space aligning feels like

115
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
this

116
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:41,158
the Torso May straighten up ever so

117
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,240
slightly you may feel a kind of

118
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:02,240
uplift and you may also feel a kind of a

119
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:10,720
grounding in the body and grounding in the

120
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:19,799
heart the heart can feel at ease when we are

121
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,320
aligned with our deepest

122
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:33,760
intentions even one we may not know what they are just

123
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:44,000
yet the heart may

124
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:51,679
know and the body may have an

125
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
expression

126
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:20,880
and for me aligning evokes a sense of a taking

127
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,919
refuge in the Buddha Dharma and

128
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
Sanaa

129
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:48,360
aligning my heart and mind with the Buddha Dharma and

130
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
Sana

131
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,880
my body can feel at ease with

132
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,720
this stay connected with the felt

133
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:33,559
sense words are not

134
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:03,320
necessary being aligned and

135
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,679
available can feel so

136
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:16,670
[Music]

137
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:25,759
grounding there may be a cellular level of

138
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
relaxation

139
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,720
a deeper sense of ease in the

140
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
heart

141
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:07,919
we're practicing in a wholesome

142
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
field

143
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,679
the body may feel more

144
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
alive

145
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:29,799
[Music] yeah

146
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,760
[Music] e

147
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
e

148
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:49,679
it's a field of being aligned and available is a safe

149
00:25:51,840 --> 00:26:00,080
field with our body heart and mind and

150
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,600
Trust the totality of our being can

151
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,440
soften into this

152
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
field

153
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:51,120
there may be emotional resonance bubbling

154
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,840
up a kind of

155
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:03,720
tenderness maybe

156
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,720
sweetness

157
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:21,080
Joy there may be a inod the

158
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,520
response

159
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,278
or this may

160
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:59,519
feel disconnected

161
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,559
we're feeling a little

162
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:20,240
lost allow the range of experiences to be what they

163
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
are

164
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,480
knowing this is a

165
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:03,720
practice knowing this is a gradual

166
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:29,320
cultivation and we're simply wailing and that's it

167
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
enough

168
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
for

169
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:44,519
[Music] and just reading uh that there's some

170
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:52,799
background sound um I'm not sure what to do

171
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:59,240
um hopefully this was good enough for everyone and

172
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:13,760
um so I'm going to switch gear uh to say

173
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:23,840
a few words um around the topic and that's kind of in the uh in the guided

174
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:31,320
meditation and uh let me move my uh notes up

175
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:40,440
here and so the topic I um brought today um is

176
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,919
about aligning or setting our

177
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:52,600
intentions as I spoke a little bit at the beginning of uh the guided

178
00:31:52,600 --> 00:32:00,440
meditation that this week uh my intention is to speak uh about a set of

179
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:08,279
useful hopefully useful practice skills and uh even though uh sometimes

180
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:17,279
the teachers would say that our practice is simple um but most of us know that um

181
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:23,440
the practice is actually not easy to do and so for most of us uh we have to

182
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:29,039
learn a number of different skills that make may be appropriate at different

183
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:36,799
times and under different circumstances and so um this week I

184
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:44,159
wanted to start out um today by speaking a little bit about cultivating the

185
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:50,960
skills uh to set wise intentions of our

186
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:58,440
practice it may be appropriate uh since this is the beginning of the new year

187
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:06,039
uh maybe the beginning of the new year does do something in our psyche that

188
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:14,600
it's appropriate to reflect upon uh the intentions uh that we have around our

189
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:20,519
practice why we practice and maybe do this consciously

190
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:27,159
and um uh contemplatively without some conscious

191
00:33:27,159 --> 00:33:36,000
reflection around why we do our practice it's easy uh for our practice to get

192
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,480
misaligned with our wanting mind you know that happens to all of us

193
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:49,279
and I'm certainly aware of that and just one example and sometimes

194
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:57,919
when we engage in for example uh Dharma studies um listening to talks or

195
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:03,919
uh doing reading sutas or um you know

196
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:11,919
analyzing things and when we're not conscious about why we're doing this

197
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:17,919
unconsciously we can get into a kind of gaining

198
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:23,560
mentality um we wanted to gain more information in our head and we wanted to

199
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,879
know all the lists sutas comment

200
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:35,200
and and as if knowing all the information becomes

201
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:43,358
the point of the practice and so I've met people who seems to have all the answers by coting

202
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:49,520
the lines in the sutas and commentaries and if you challenge them

203
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:55,280
they get very agitated and how can the sutas be wrong

204
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:03,400
right and then so that's just the one silly example um uh to show that sometimes we

205
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:10,960
can miss the point of learning and the studying and listening to the

206
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:17,760
talks uh if gaining the information is why we study the sutta then we're all

207
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,920
just trying to become Google you it's got all the information

208
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:31,119
there um and this can happen in our meditative practice as well so sometimes

209
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,760
uh when we are unconscious of why we're doing it uh we

210
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:42,440
could be doing it because we wanted to get something that we like uh you know

211
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:48,040
Blissful States or we wanted to get rid of something that we don't want or we

212
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:55,680
don't like like the pain in the body or the annoying boss or you know and so

213
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:01,480
this may not be an issue when we're consciously choosing something that may

214
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:09,319
be skillful that is aligned with our deepest intentions because we know the

215
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:17,319
choices supports the practice along the way but when we're unclear and

216
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:24,359
unconscious we can become the victim of our wanting mind even though we may have

217
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:33,119
thought that we're actually practicing so it's very important that from time to time we ask

218
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:38,319
this question uh why are we doing

219
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:46,760
this and so this is um why I brought this in aligning in our meditation

220
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:52,880
today and there is an interesting teaching in the poly Canon sutta that I

221
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,640
was reading recently and that's in angut AA

222
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:05,640
4.6 uh in the Susa the Buddha pointed out that regardless if someone has

223
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:12,200
learned a little or a lot of Dharma teachings you know through memorization

224
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:19,599
listening to the talks and all of those different ways and the Buddha said it is only when

225
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:27,480
the person is intent on what they have learned they will succeed in the

226
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:32,960
Dharma and the key word here is

227
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:41,000
intent and the person is intent on what they have learned and the suta Goes On by

228
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:48,280
explaining how one is intent on what one has learned and it

229
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:54,240
says that here someone has learned having understood the meaning of the

230
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:02,599
teachings the person prac practices in accordance with the Dharma and this is

231
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:07,960
how one is intend on what has been

232
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:17,000
learned and so one is practicing in accordance with the Dharma and that's

233
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:25,839
how one is intent on what one has learned what stood out for me uh in this

234
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:33,000
line um is um that the intention setting

235
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,359
intention intending is not separate from the

236
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:46,440
practice itself in fact intention orients and sets in

237
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:52,079
motion the practice and the teachings uh the in the immediacy of our

238
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:59,960
Liv experience here and now so intending has this kind of aliveness the vibrancy

239
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:06,480
in us the Buddha in the sua equates intent

240
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,240
to practicing in accordance with the

241
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:19,960
Dharma and there are two aspects that jumped out in this line for me one is

242
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:25,920
that um there is a clear orientation of the

243
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,240
Dharma that is it's about uh practicing in

244
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:37,319
accordance with the Dharma and the second aspect is that it

245
00:39:37,319 --> 00:39:46,640
highlights that the significant aspect of intending is about practicing with it

246
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,680
itself in our classic teachings on wise

247
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:58,319
intention in the context of noble Eightfold Path

248
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:07,160
um it invites us to orient ourselves to live in line with

249
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:15,880
renunciation nonharming and uh loving kindness so whenever we speak whenever

250
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:24,000
we uh act or we think we can feel and

251
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:32,240
sense if our actions speech and the mental activities are aligned with this

252
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:40,720
wise intentions are they kind are they expressions of

253
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:46,839
non-harming a non grasping often when we're getting

254
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:52,000
carried away by the flow of activities and

255
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,680
reactivities uh we sometimes can lose contact with with this kind of deepest

256
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:06,960
intentions and so that's when we are no longer um in uh living in accordance

257
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,280
with the

258
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:22,119
Dharma I want to say a few words about how we practicing uh setting cultivating

259
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:28,880
intentions so clarifying our intentions or making contact with our deepest

260
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:35,560
intentions don't need to be only a cognitive or

261
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:40,640
intellectual um activity itself it can be a part of

262
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:46,400
it um but often our deepest intentions

263
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,560
have a felt sense in the body and in our

264
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:57,240
hearts and sometimes even before we have award friend

265
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:03,880
them uh in our guided meditation uh we kind of experimented

266
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:11,200
with this a little bit sometimes uh the deepest intentions have

267
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:19,079
embodied somatic expression for me I often feel a kind of uplift through my

268
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:24,359
spine my torso and it's

269
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:31,200
energizing at the same time I can feel my whole body and a

270
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:39,440
heart a mind has a kind of a grounding in it my heart heart can feel at

271
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:45,359
ease and there may be a kind of a brightness in our heart and

272
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:53,480
mind sometimes the heart can feel a tender and over time we may

273
00:42:53,480 --> 00:43:00,000
recognize what this intentions are maybe in terms of

274
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:07,240
words and uh cognitive understanding and they don't always have

275
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:13,280
to have uh words right away but the something that's deep

276
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:19,920
inside of us we can know this and we can trust

277
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:27,079
this so to practice um what the setting

278
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:33,000
intentions it may be helpful uh first to ask

279
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,599
ourselves or what are our deepest intentions from time to

280
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:44,319
time maybe in the meditation you can drop a

281
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:51,720
question kind of like a dropping the stone in a pond uh without necessarily trying to

282
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:58,000
figure it out let yourself feel what bubbles up in the

283
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:05,319
body what bubbles up in the heart and there's no rush to get the

284
00:44:05,319 --> 00:44:17,400
answer I remember Gil mentioned that uh he had spent uh um a year to clarify his

285
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:25,040
intention and so no rush for this and the second aspect of a

286
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:31,920
practicing with with uh our intentions is to pause and turn

287
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:40,400
inward often and feel and sense what's operating inside of us in our

288
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:47,880
activities of Body Mind speech and gently

289
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:54,960
touching if this is aligned with our intentions our deepest

290
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:04,319
intentions and allow this to be an inquiry rather than judgment or blame or

291
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:10,240
criticism and let this inquiry guide you to become more and more

292
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:16,960
aligned with something our heart and mind knows deeply inside of

293
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:23,920
us and we'll continue to explore this for the rest of the week in various ways

294
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:30,640
and expanding some different aspects of um our

295
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:38,520
practice so thank you everyone for being here and we'll resume

296
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:46,400
tomorrow have a wonderful rest of the day
