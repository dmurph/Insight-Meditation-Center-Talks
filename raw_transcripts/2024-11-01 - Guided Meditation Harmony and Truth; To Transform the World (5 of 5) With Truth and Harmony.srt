1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,200
so good

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,039
morning one of

3
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:25,119
the important characteristics of the Buddha's

4
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:31,960
teachings is social teachings is the idea of

5
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:40,200
Harmony some AA and the idea of Harmony is that um

6
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,719
one one image or metaphor for it is for people to milk like to me to mix like

7
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,960
milk and water milk and water Blends

8
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,440
together very differently than oil and water that's they

9
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,680
separate for us to somehow live together in

10
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,799
harmony and the Buddha talks about

11
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:16,560
uh loving Harmony delighting in harmony devoted to

12
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:22,320
Harmony and um in the Buddhist manesa Community the only

13
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,360
Community the Buddha was actively involved in guiding put a lot of

14
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,040
emphasis on the community living together in in Harmony and cooperating

15
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,360
together so for this uh meditation I'd like to

16
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:46,719
suggest that um uh in a certain kind of ways each of

17
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:56,079
us is a community of people each of us contains a range mult multitud multitude

18
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:02,159
of different impulses feelings thoughts maybe almost like personalities

19
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,520
depending where we are I was struck growing up and speaking different

20
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,760
languages that um I was and other people I knew had somewhat different

21
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,959
personalities depending on the language they spoke because when we're learning a language in a culture you learn more

22
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,840
than a language you learn a way of being a way of relating finding yourself in

23
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:36,800
the culture and that can vary from culture to culture and uh so and sometimes we we're divided

24
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,920
in ourselves we have parts we don't like and parts we like we have preferences

25
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,080
about ourselves things we want to hide things ways that we want to present ourselves to the

26
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,760
world so there's a multitude within us and so for this meditation I'd like

27
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:02,200
to suggest that we sit together we sit here with with the idea of meditating in

28
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:10,040
harmony with all that we are that all of who we are is invited to

29
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:16,799
be here and the key thing about being in

30
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:24,280
harmony is to tell the truth speak the truth here and

31
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:33,080
now and mindfulness practice can be seen as that that Honesty is mindfulness out

32
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:39,400
loud mindful mindfulness within is not just being aware of what's here and

33
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,760
knowing it in some simple way knowing it as an act of Truth this is what's

34
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,879
happening my shoulders are tense and and see this is a TR Moment of

35
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:59,720
Truth oh this is what's true my belly is soft

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,799
I'm thinking about the

37
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,760
election and not just knowing it in a casual way or recognizing it in so can't

38
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,840
just just like almost like a dutiful way oh this is what's happening there's something about the

39
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:25,280
power of saying oh this is in fact what is happening this is the truth that at

40
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,639
this moment this time this is a mind that's thinking

41
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:38,199
about the election and how to be in harmony with that is to include it as

42
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:46,080
part of the whole of who you are so it's not sing sing singled out as

43
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,280
something to be obsessed about or caught in but something to which by telling us

44
00:04:52,280 --> 00:05:01,520
the truth of it we open to the wholeness of who we are we're so much more

45
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:09,440
and if we're distressed about something like the election the whole of who we are

46
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,639
includes a a concern a love for the harmony of all the parts of

47
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:24,120
ourselves the part of us that can tell the truth the part of us that can want want Harmony the part of us that has

48
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,600
generosity the part of us that has love and care and good will

49
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:37,400
not to push anything away but to place it in a wider context let it all live

50
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:45,720
together here so that as we meditate we're freeing up our breath

51
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,319
freeing up our body so we can be at ease in this body

52
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:57,800
here and now with all of who we are breathing

53
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,000
quietly breathing reassuring re

54
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:11,120
reassuringly an easeful breath so assuming a meditation

55
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,080
posture and gently closing the

56
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:22,520
eyes softly

57
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,639
gently in your own way the way that's good for for

58
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:36,599
you feels right acknowledge how you

59
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:43,599
are and let that be an act of Truth telling whatever way you

60
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:47,639
are the kind of Truth

61
00:06:52,039 --> 00:07:00,120
telling that allows us to be present without being caught

62
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:06,919
even if we're caught in something we say the truth would be oh this is being

63
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:10,440
caught I am

64
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:19,520
caught and in saying that that that honestly then opening to the harmony of

65
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,680
all things within you are much more than someone

66
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:32,319
who's caught much more than someone someone who's thinking a

67
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,560
lot so acknowledging how you

68
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,039
are and then in the midst of how you

69
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:52,039
are take some long slow comfortable

70
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:55,759
breaths breathing

71
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:06,280
in and settling into the middle of yourself settling in settling into being

72
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,199
here in this

73
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:33,560
body letting your breathing return to

74
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:42,159
normal and finding some place where you experience the body

75
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:51,160
breathing where there's the least sense of control least sense of being a

76
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:56,200
breather where it's most neutral to feel the

77
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:01,439
breathing could be the movements of the back rib kage

78
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,639
stage maybe it's a small movements in the

79
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:30,000
shoulders maybe it's a sense of the whole experience of breathing

80
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:37,160
the whole torso that feels it that's bigger than

81
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:45,079
any place where there's a sense of Something's doing the breathing

82
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:16,399
inviting relaxation as you

83
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:25,560
exhale not doing the relaxation almost like making space

84
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:32,399
making room for the place places where the body will relax

85
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:38,639
itself if you open invite

86
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:13,360
inviting a relaxation in the experience of

87
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:25,079
breathing Maybe by opening up to give breathing room for each inhale and exhale

88
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:53,560
inviting the exhale to relax a softening letting go

89
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:08,399
allowing the inhale to include a softening

90
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:43,480
and as we continue very as quietly and

91
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,959
softly as you

92
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:56,880
can tell yourself the truth of the present moment

93
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,079
experience whatever is happening for you here and

94
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,320
now even if it's connected to other things and other

95
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:14,320
times be truthful about how it's being how it's manifesting

96
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:26,560
now but do so in harmony with being at ease

97
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:36,040
maybe with a sense of ease or calm in your

98
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:43,000
breathing calmly

99
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,240
invite say the truth in a way that invites

100
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:56,800
everything to join together in the

101
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:06,839
Simplicity of the moment the Simplicity of being alive and breathing

102
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,040
now a gentle truthtellah

103
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,399
without

104
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
conflict

105
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
for

106
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

107
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920

and as we approach the end of this sitting to softly

122
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:52,320
gently calm your body a global

123
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,158
relaxation into the body

124
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:12,278
into whatever way that you feel more

125
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,080
settled calmer than you were when you

126
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:31,398
started gently calmly acknowledge how you are

127
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:39,840
now an acknowledgement that is a kind of a

128
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:52,159
truth-telling and an invitation for whatever you is

129
00:24:52,159 --> 00:25:00,600
happening to be part of a whole the whole of who you are the whole

130
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,120
of this

131
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:14,360
world as if there's lots of room for all of who you are to be here

132
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:21,320
in the calm in the harmony

133
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:46,760
and then imagine that you can be with

134
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:53,440
others maybe without the need to say anything or do

135
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,120
anything but that your subtleness

136
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:06,880
your ability to be present and truthful Here and

137
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,440
Now can also include an

138
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,799
invitation for everyone to be as they

169
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,559
difference to make this world a better place

170
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:24,240
and if uh and we can do so in small ways

171
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:31,960
we can do it in our communities with our friends our neighbors and um and of course it's nice to do it

172
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:38,960
more widely nice to go out and and um uh you know there's people who going

173
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:46,799
out in all kinds of all political parties to get out the vote who are actively involved in political action

174
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:52,480
and El supporting the election and other candidates and things like

175
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,519
that there's ways of uh lobbying governments and

176
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:05,480
there's all kinds of ways of changing the world but the for me the most important

177
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:14,080
is that we start with ourselves we don't lose ourselves in uh in the action we do and

178
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:20,960
I know that back when I was young there were people who were very active in uh

179
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:28,279
in uh the anti-vietnam war with all kinds of civil rights issues all kinds

180
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:35,639
of things that were going on back then and some of them got deeply discouraged because the organizations

181
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:40,679
they were involved in the people they were working with were so divisive there

182
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:47,320
was so much inner conflict and hatred and anger and greed going on that they

183
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:52,840
felt this can't go this can't continue this way and so one of the reasons some

184
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:58,480
people came to Buddhism was to find an alternative and uh and I I do hope that

185
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,760
we find it here and one of the Alternatives is to appreciate that if we

186
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:10,960
want to change the world for the better we have to change too we have to represent the change we want we want

187
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:17,840
have to be the change that we want and if we want a peaceful world we have to be peaceful if we want to have a world

188
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:24,960
where there's no hate we have to stop hating that uh the Deep inner work and

189
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:33,440
Buddhism sometimes is criticized for creating a lot of people who are maybe too passive or not involved in in in the

190
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,679
Civil Life of our our our culture but that's not true uh there's a lot of

191
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:45,000
people here coming through IMC for example that I know who have practiced

192
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,440
here for many years and are transformed who then go out and are doing all kinds

193
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:57,080
of uh good um in their own way joining different organizations joining different things

194
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:04,000
and maybe I MC doesn't so actively involved because we're a relatively small organization but the people coming

195
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:12,599
through here do remarkable things in the world and uh and um but hopefully they

196
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:18,358
they bring with them the the transformation into goodness the

197
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:24,800
transformation trans transformation into Freedom so they can act in ways that

198
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:31,919
they are the Agent of Change uh by how they are uh as much as by what they

199
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:38,560
do and um and so one way of folding all this together that I've done this week

200
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:46,079
um uh the in a way I've talked about so these different things uh it can be

201
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:54,158
summarized um love so that others will

202
00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:04,160
love be peaceful so others will learn to be peaceful give so others trust

203
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:11,800
generosity respect or dignify others because offering dignity offering

204
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:17,280
respect is contagious and then

205
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:25,920
today speak the truth with love peace generosity and

206
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:34,119
respect so it try transforms people's hearts don't only focus on policy and

207
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:39,160
action and the we really want to change Hearts

208
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:44,320
so the hearts understand how to live in harmony the hearts can come from Love

209
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:51,839
and generosity and so if we want to be the change that we want to see in the world

210
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:57,119
we have to be able to speak the truth for sure and this is where the action is

211
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:05,680
speak TR truth speak truth to power what power the power of love the power of

212
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:11,400
Peace being peaceful non-c conflictive non-

213
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:17,560
contentious uh speak with uh generosity the generous Spirit generous to the

214
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:22,960
people we speak to so they feel our generosity care our Good Will are

215
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,079
concern for their welfare speak with

216
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:37,440
um uh speak with respect speak in a way that that sees the others with as uh

217
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,800
with dignity treat them with as dignified people

218
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:49,800
everyone so it's not a hierarchy it's not some people are better than others but a universal

219
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,960
dignity this is the universal Declaration of Human Rights everyone is

220
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,400
born equal in their

221
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,520
dignity and um and then speaking speak the truth we have to

222
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:12,920
speak whether and how do we do it in a way that people will listen that's Cooperative that's harmonious that

223
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:20,800
people feel like we're not uh attacking or not lecturing or not but uh we're

224
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,720
inviting inviting people into cooperation inviting people into a sense

225
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:32,480
of Harmony when the Buddha talked about speaking uh the first thing he said was

226
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:38,960
the importance of speaking truth the second thing he said was the

227
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:48,280
following um do do not repeat what you have heard from others

228
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:55,000
so as to divide people against each other so don't divide people against

229
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:04,079
each other so don't spread gossip don't use hear say instead Recon

230
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:11,280
reconcile those who are divided reconcile those who are divided

231
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:18,960
be a mediator and uh that's one of my Great Hopes for Buddhism is that Buddhism in a sense

232
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:25,680
doesn't take sides but Buddhism steps into the conflict in order to mediate in

233
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:32,599
order to reconcile find a way for people to work together and now so rather than stepping

234
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:38,079
into one side or the other um that Buddhism enters into the middle and the

235
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:43,880
middle way to reconcile and I've done that uh locally

236
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:50,760
by being on Buddhist ethics committees where there was reconciliation work to be done but the Instinct of people was

237
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:57,960
not to find reconciliation the in Instinct was punishment the Instinct was blame um um

238
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:03,640
and uh and more divisiveness and how to reconcile so

239
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:09,760
everyone is inspired by the reconciliation how to find a way forward

240
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:15,319
that everyone feels like they're cared for and benefited for I believe that's

241
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:22,800
possible it's not easy so uh so reconcile those who are

242
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:29,480
divided supporting Unity delighting in

243
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:37,640
harmony loving Harmony speaking words that promote

244
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:43,800
Harmony so uh if we're going to act in the world and I hope we act in New World

245
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:49,040
so we create a better world uh it probably Begins by how we

246
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:55,720
speak and um and to speak harmoniously to

247
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,960
speak uh in a ways

248
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:09,000
that that um once encourages others to join

249
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:16,880
cooperatively encourages others to continue with the work

250
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:24,720
of conditioning the soil we're all earthworms we're

251
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:31,319
all working on a deep deep work of changing the soil in which we live the

252
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:40,920
soil of the heart slowly changing the World by creating rich soil for the

253
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:46,520
seeds of goodness to sprout may

254
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:52,760
we find a way to promote cooperation and Harmony

255
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,920
and truthtellah

256
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,640
of Love Of Peace of

257
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:10,839
generosity of respect and Truth be something that guides us and more than

258
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:17,800
guides us gives us tremendous confidence that this

259
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:24,800
these can be the foundation the basis of how we live our

260
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:32,119
life that these are what heals us from our

261
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:39,359
own anxiety fear hatred ill

262
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:44,400
will overwhelm sense of victimhood in this

263
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:50,119
world of so many challenges let us

264
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:55,599
become the producers The Confident

265
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:03,440
manifestors of goodness let us trust goodness
