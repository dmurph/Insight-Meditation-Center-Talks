1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:09,420
so hello and welcome and today the

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:17,220
theme in this week's series is happiness a particular kind of happiness

3
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:23,520
that um in a sense has no reason

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:30,060
external reasons isn't that we've won a prize or some wonderful things

5
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:36,440
happening in the world um but rather

6
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,660
happiness that comes with doing the practice

7
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:50,700
that mindfulness the meditation practice a kind of contentment a warm thing

8
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:57,780
that uh the pleasure that comes from the

9
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,239
from being immersed in the practice itself without any

10
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:10,200
distractions without any reference points of other things that we want or that we don't want that should happen in

11
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,080
the world or our concerns about what's coming or what's happened before

12
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,560
the immersion Here In This Moment's experience

13
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,960
so um I'd like to say this that

14
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:36,420
um what the mind what attention focuses on

15
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:45,380
can have an influence on the mind what the Mind feeds on

16
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,619
affects the health of the Mind the state of the Mind so if the Mind feeds on a lot of horror

17
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,960
movies then it might be not a surprise that we

18
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,240
spend a good amount of time being afraid if we spend a lot of time with friends

19
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:09,360
who mostly are angry complaining cynical and that's what we focus on and there's

20
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,879
no surprise then that then that gets reinforced that happened to be that way

21
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:21,739
if we spend a lot of time on advertisements no maybe no surprise that then we end up

22
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:29,099
strengthening our desires if we focus on genuine or healthy

23
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:36,300
happiness that affects and influences the Mind differently than these earlier ones

24
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,819
and so what we focus on is food or effects or is an influence on

25
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:49,200
the Mind itself if we do it regularly and repeatedly what we think about same thing

26
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:57,180
so it's helpful in meditation to lower the bar for what we think happiness or joy is

27
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,519
maybe it's a very subtle contentment or a subtle sense of pleasure of Simply

28
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,980
sitting here and being here and to include that in the focus of

29
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,319
attention let that be a food that would that be what the Mind feeds on or grows

30
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:20,819
with now mindfulness practice is often about being present for what is whatever is

31
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:27,480
predominant and so what I'm saying might seem contradictory focus on something gets

32
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:33,000
subtle and ignore the predominant desires that I'm caught up in or the

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,959
anger that I'm involved in it's a little different in that

34
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:47,220
we definitely want to be present for what is but we want to notice that the being

35
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:52,739
present being mindful being aware and here I use the word

36
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:59,760
being as a kind of deliberateness a kind of yeah conscientiousness or kind of

37
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:07,920
conscious presence and awareness that deliberateness or that engagement

38
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,620
of awareness that way of being aware

39
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:21,359
it's possible to find happiness pleasure in that so if we're being mindful of our anger

40
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,759
being mindful of our greed or whatever it might be or

41
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:35,699
um the way not to have the anger and the greed be fed is to uh

42
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:41,639
step away from being from participating in these unwholesome unhealthy mind

43
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:49,520
States and in stepping away look at them be aware of them watch them

44
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:57,440
and appreciate the watching appreciate the awaring of them the awareness

45
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:04,639
appreciate feel the feel a contentment a joy a kind of happiness

46
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:11,660
in being aware as opposed to in participating with

47
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,479
so as we sit here today as you bring up your mindfulness to being aware of the Present Moment In

48
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:25,199
your experience with a very low bar very low standard of what qualifies

49
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,780
see if you can be aware while there's a pleasure of mindfulness

50
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:38,880
the pleasure the contentment for being aware maybe a delight Maybe not something

51
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:45,660
you're actively thinking about too much but just the nature of being aware the nature of mindfulness

52
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:52,259
contains within it some pleasure some goodness something that feels this is good

53
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:57,900
this is valuable this is um this is this moment is content to be

54
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:03,720
aware this way to bring that along with your mindfulness then that is what feeds the

55
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,720
mind that's what influences the mind it's a protection from being influenced

56
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:15,060
by the greed or the anger or whatever it might the unhealthy mind States mind activities

57
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:21,960
while being aware of them at the same time so hopefully that's clear so

58
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,940
assuming your meditation posture

59
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,319
and gently closing your eyes

60
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:43,440
and slowly and deliberately bring a sense of gentleness into your

61
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,259
body being gentle with what is not gentle

62
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:54,259
being gentle with the tensions the agitations

63
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:04,159
the emotions that might be in your body a gentle awareness of them

64
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:15,740
and if you find your body being muscles being tense

65
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:24,360
almost as if you're not doing anything but being aware of them the tension

66
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:31,580
allow the tension to release if it wants to release

67
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:39,259
allow your body to relax if that's what your body wants to do

68
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,599
and then allow awareness to gently

69
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,300
be with the movements of the body breathing

70
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:28,160
wherever that movement of breathing Sensations or breathing

71
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:34,700
are the easiest or most enjoyable to experience

72
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:57,420
and as you're aware of your breathing maybe also aware of any tension and

73
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,800
agitation in the mind

74
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,680
and if that tension wants to be to relax

75
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:15,680
allow it to the mind to soften to relax

76
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:50,880
and then again becoming aware of breathing more fully

77
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,279
where there's a light touch in the body

78
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:04,459
the light touch between awareness and breathing

79
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:19,040
and awareness touches the experience of breathing lightly but broadly

80
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:25,980
not the fingertip touching but the whole hand of awareness

81
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:31,399
making a light contact with a body breathing

82
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:46,579
awareness floating on the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

83
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:15,240
if you find yourself thinking it isn't so much that you let go of your

84
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:22,820
thoughts as you let go of your interest and involvement with them

85
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:33,000
so you can be more interested and more involved

86
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,380
in the contact between breathing and awareness

87
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:04,560
and then as you're aware you might be aware of breathing thoughts

88
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,860
are rising sounds Sensations emotions all these things might come into

89
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:18,120
awareness see if you can also include

90
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:27,660
be aware of that a contentment a happiness a pleasure

91
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:33,720
in being aware what you're aware of might not be

92
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:40,940
pleasant and happy but some way that being aware

93
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:46,019
deliberately consciously knowing what's happening as it's

94
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:51,920
happening lightly gently

95
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:58,800
openly whatever way that that feels

96
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,740
comes with happiness contentment

97
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:10,040
include that as you're being aware

98
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,899
maybe you can let there be a happiness

99
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:30,560
in The Knowing in the awaring

100
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:06,299
instead of giving yourself over to your thoughts give yourself over to being aware

101
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:09,679
here now

102
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,740
sensitive to the slightest pleasure or happiness

103
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,419
that comes with being aware

104
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,340
foreign

105
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:03,980
anywhere physically emotionally

106
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:13,159
is their way of lightening up gentling on how you're aware of it

107
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:21,179
opening up the awareness so that awareness of it has a contentment or

108
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:29,039
pleasure or happiness or a feeling of rightness this feels

109
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:34,580
right to be aware this way

110
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,260
foreign

111
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,900
thank you

112
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:18,779
so then as we come to the end of the sitting imagine

113
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:26,640
that how you're aware of the world is offering medicine or food for the

114
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,820
world that if you're aware of the world if you know the world

115
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:40,039
from fear or from Anger from greed or lust

116
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:46,919
you're putting into the world something very different than if you're aware of the world with

117
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:55,679
contentment and happiness with joy pleasure love kindness

118
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:07,940
at least the kind of pleasure or contentment that can come from being aware itself

119
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:14,220
the awareness that allows us to see clearly and honestly what is here in this world

120
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:18,260
without being entangled in it

121
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,779
to be aware in a way that is

122
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,700
the awareness itself contains a joy a happiness

123
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:38,279
a pleasure the joy of non-clinging

124
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:42,320
the joy of being present

125
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:49,559
to be aware in this way provides a healthy food medicine for

126
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:57,240
this world that we live in may we bring the joy the happiness

127
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:02,460
of mindfulness into all our encounters even the ones

128
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:08,460
which are unpleasant even the ones that we have other emotions

129
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:14,539
but at least we have the subtle pleasure happiness

130
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:22,640
of mindfulness itself May our mindfulness

131
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:32,460
be a healthy influence on this world that we live in may it contribute to the welfare and

132
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:39,679
happiness of all beings may all beings be happy

133
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:46,080
may all beings be safe

134
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:53,039
may all beings be peaceful and may all beings everywhere

135
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,820
be free

136
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:05,119
[Music]

137
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,919
thank you

138
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:27,720
so this is the fourth talk on the gladness pentad

139
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:35,460
and the fourth of these five qualities is happiness sukkah

140
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:43,320
and because sukkah is sometimes translated as pleasure the um there's two conclusions about the

141
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:49,020
kind of Happiness we're talking about one is that um

142
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:54,419
uh pleasure is something we mostly can feel through our body there's a physicality to it

143
00:29:54,419 --> 00:30:00,899
and so this is a happiness which has us sublime or Pleasant pleasure

144
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:07,559
somehow in the body it's not excited it's so something gets settling and quieting

145
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:15,840
and the other is that this sukkah this happiness is not to be happy about anything

146
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,899
but rather it's the happy in doing in the inactivity

147
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:27,000
so to be immersed in an activity that just the immersion the absorption the

148
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,100
giving yourself over to it the I like this like giving ourselves

149
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:38,640
over to to really be there not to forget ourselves not to disconnect but to real

150
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,679
in mindfulness to really give ourselves over to this immerse ourselves in this

151
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:50,940
world of practice and and as the practice the strength of

152
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:57,120
it builds that immersion in the practice is not something that we will that we you know say okay now I'm going to do

153
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:02,760
this but rather something we enter into we settle into that opens up for us with

154
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:08,700
the strength of our practice and our ability to our strengthen her in

155
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,919
not being caught in thoughts so there's a momentum that builds

156
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:20,640
through practice that begins with faith with trust with inspiration and the practice itself

157
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,820
so that we want to practice and so we sit down we're glad to be able

158
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:33,360
to practice we're glad something that we're glad that wow I'm glad I I've been busy running around like crazy all day

159
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:40,620
and it's so good to finally sit down and sit quiet and and not be so busy or wow

160
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:47,940
you know I've been this is so important for me this practice and and I do it every day but this is like the center of

161
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:54,659
how I want to live my life is what comes from this practice so I'm so glad to be back here at home in this practice

162
00:31:54,659 --> 00:32:00,360
so for each of us it's going to be different but there's a gladness and that gladness is a little bit of a

163
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:06,779
encouragement a cheerleader and a to start really giving ourselves to doing

164
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:15,000
the practice the um you know we sit down to meditate and we find ourselves interested in the

165
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,640
challenge we have a look with a local neighbor and her local neighbor is not being right or

166
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,880
you know being unfair or something and that might be an important topic but uh

167
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,919
we sit down and that that's not what this meditation is about you're finally

168
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:37,200
here at home you have something you love doing and you're so happy to be able to

169
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,779
do it the concerns with the neighbors can wait for another time so

170
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:49,799
there's a momentum then being glad to do it and that gladness that we start doing it we start feeling we start feeling

171
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:56,520
hooked in or or plugged in to being mindful that being mindful is

172
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:03,000
you feel like there's a life of its own the practice it's doing itself for us now it's not constantly coming back

173
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,020
constantly coming back constantly applying ourselves but there's um there's uh you know we're kind of

174
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:17,480
like now we're on the conveyor belt like okay now we're kind of coming along and and that conveyor belt feeling of being

175
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:24,659
in the practice in the engagement um the engagement itself starts feeling

176
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:32,820
uh kind of a delightful Joy um a uh a a kind of a very subtle

177
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:39,899
Pleasant maybe thrill or a little bit of excitement oh yes we're here we're present and that's a feeling that maybe

178
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:45,240
is felt in the arms and the chest um sometimes in the face it feels like

179
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:52,380
maybe something's vibrating or something's uh energized or something there's a lightness or a Clarity or a

180
00:33:52,380 --> 00:34:00,120
tingling or a a sense of flowing pleasure to that immersion

181
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:06,779
and then we're so happy to be doing it something relaxes and let's go oh I'm

182
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:12,118
here I can trust this I can now relax more fully

183
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:17,460
and so there isn't need to apply oneself so much in meditation something about

184
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:23,940
the attention of application relaxes and the body relaxes and settles

185
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:32,520
and with that settling of the body quieting tranquilizing the body then that the gladness and the joy transforms

186
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:40,260
into a kind of Happiness a kind of contentment a kind of embodied

187
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:46,200
um pleasure that is not kind of hidden hedonistic

188
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:52,560
pleasure it's just feels so satisfying that it doesn't feel right to call it

189
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:58,500
pleasure maybe it feels better as kind of a kind of a happiness that that feels

190
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:05,119
light that feels quiet that feels still it feels more subtle than gentle than

191
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:11,240
the the joyful immersion that came earlier in the practice

192
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:18,240
so so this momentum begins happening and this is one of the great things about practice to find ourselves on the

193
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:24,240
conveyor belt of practice and some people at this point in practice will talk about it isn't that

194
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:30,780
they're doing the practice but they are being practiced it's almost like a practice is doing us

195
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:38,400
rather than we're doing the practice and so in a big part of the practitioner's role at this point is

196
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:46,320
making sure we don't mess it up we don't get in the way of it we don't get caught up in thoughts or control or trying to

197
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,740
make it better or fixing it or holding on to it it's mostly just kind of stay out of the way

198
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:58,380
like you know there's too many if there's too many cooks in the kitchen it doesn't work and so the extra cook is

199
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:07,140
you and so you have to kind of stay present for sure but you mostly have to kind of stay you know out of the kitchen

200
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:12,420
so one of the ways of understanding this pleasure to make it more accessible

201
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:17,520
perhaps because it might seem a little bit much this idea of being on the

202
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:24,359
conveyor belt and being carried along is to feel it uh very be content and

203
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:30,540
happy how subtle it can be how small it can be and one of the ways of doing this is as

204
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:36,180
we kind of cultivate mindfulness practice and get used to it and being aware and being present

205
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:42,839
being in the moment Here and Now recognizing what's happening offering

206
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:49,740
our presence our attention to what's happening here if we're drinking tea eating food opening a door

207
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:56,220
being with our breathing listening to someone that there's a kind of a kind of a

208
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:03,060
heightened attentiveness a feeling of kind of deliberateness of being present and receptive to what's

209
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:08,180
happening and then to begin feeling recognizing

210
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:15,240
that there is some pleasure some goodness something healthy some

211
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:22,079
Happiness joy in being aware of self some of this might be evaluative like

212
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:27,119
all these different uh steps of the pentad it might be that the happiness of

213
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:34,560
being inspired I'm getting to do this practice look at me it's like Ma look riding the bicycle with no hands

214
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:40,500
um look at this I was aware of three breaths in a row look at this I was

215
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:47,579
listening to my friend my friend said something difficult and I didn't habitually kind of lash out or my

216
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:52,619
usually I just stayed and was present wow this is good so that's a valuative

217
00:37:52,619 --> 00:38:00,300
gladness and then you keep listening and it just feels good to have this ability to be

218
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:06,540
attentive and open and you see that your friend who's complaining about something that something shifts in them because

219
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:13,560
you're just present in a non-reactive way and you start appreciating your non-reactivity in a deeper way

220
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:19,260
and then it allows you to relax into it and then in that relaxing you feel that

221
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:25,079
there's a little you're there's a subtle in the awareness itself not evaluative

222
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:31,680
that evaluating it but rather in the tone of it and the texture of it there

223
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:37,680
is some happiness some contentment some pleasure

224
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:43,740
and to stay gently aware of that to pleasure

225
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:50,220
that goodness that what's healthy about that kind of awareness is very useful

226
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:57,660
because what we pay attention to is what influences the the the quality

227
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:04,560
and texture and state of our mind and heart and if we're only aware of and focus on

228
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:10,320
what's painful difficult with our anger and our grief and our sadness and our

229
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,480
conceit and our discouragement and all kinds of things like that if we could

230
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:21,359
get kind of too absorbed in it without being aware

231
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:28,440
then that is cyclic it influences the mind and heart and we feel worse and then we

232
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:34,140
become more aware of it we're still we have to step out of the loop of these

233
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:40,079
things affecting us negative negatively and one way to do that is have enough awareness

234
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:46,680
that we feel the goodness of being aware the goodness of being not lost in

235
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:52,099
something or or influenced or in the grip of something

236
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:59,579
and to and to feel to just subtle this kind of keep the bar very low the subtlest forms

237
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:06,900
of contentment happiness joy satisfaction that is comes along with

238
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:12,720
being aware if you're aware if you're aware of something difficult

239
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:19,859
if you're being mindful of something difficult and while you're you know the difficulty you also know the

240
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:24,900
satisfaction of being mindful then your practice is really getting

241
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:31,260
strong because then you're not somehow glued or being influenced by the difficulty

242
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:36,599
you're actually starting to become in it's actually the mindfulness is protecting you

243
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:45,000
from being influenced by the difficulty the difficult mind States you might have and um and uh and not only is it

244
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:52,880
protecting you from being influenced by difficult mind States it's also um feeding you in with this the goodness

245
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:59,460
of the practice itself the happiness the satisfaction of the practice itself of

246
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:06,500
being mindful and um and even if it's very very small

247
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:13,079
it's a fantastic food it's fantastic for a heart our mind our body to appreciate

248
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:18,599
and feel that so as you go about your day

249
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:25,020
you might experiment a bit or notice

250
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:31,140
there might be one or two times during the day would you get really absorbed in

251
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:38,640
something some irritation some anger some desire some fear about something

252
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:45,599
and um and maybe it's not imminence like not right in front of you the thing it's more like a the Mind projecting and

253
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:52,140
thinking about the future or something that's something or some person somewhere else and you find yourself you

254
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:58,440
know caught involved in that in a strong intense way turn your awareness to

255
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,900
the way that you're caught in something like this that's the kind of you know that you

256
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:11,700
could theoretically have very negative influence on you if you imagine you're being fed a diet of this

257
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:17,579
turn around and be mindful of it really know that's there and see if you how

258
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:25,140
clear the mindfulness has to be how much you have to step back or open up an awareness to really know this is what's

259
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:31,260
happening I'm really angry here I'm really afraid here and how until you

260
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:37,020
come to that place where there's a satisfaction maybe the satisfaction of not being

261
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:43,020
caught there's a joy the joy of having this wonderful practice to do that's an

262
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:48,599
alternative to being caught or the happiness that can come which is

263
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:55,200
a kind of you're so content wow this is so good that I'm being nourished now in my

264
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:00,960
mindfulness even though I'm present with a difficult state so it's a homework assignment and

265
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:07,260
noticing the difference between being immersed in something and lost in it and in almost like

266
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:12,780
influenced it or stepping back until you find the happiness of mindfulness

267
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:19,140
and some of you maybe uh won't know until after it's over that you were really caught up in something

268
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:25,020
and um and it might be interesting too even when you finally notice of reviewing the day

269
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:30,359
there might be a way that in the reviewing of the day that maybe you can do the exercise there

270
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:36,859
and I find where that happiness is so um

271
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:43,380
so thank you very much and I look forward to

272
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:47,660
the conclusion of this pentad tomorrow
