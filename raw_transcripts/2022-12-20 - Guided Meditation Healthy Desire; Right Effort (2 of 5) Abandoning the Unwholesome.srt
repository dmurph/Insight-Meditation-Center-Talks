1
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,540
hmm hello everyone and

2
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:24,359
I feel a little slow to speak I think I'm a little bit um

3
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:30,900
just happy to be here with you and this way and somehow more

4
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,320
focused on that happiness then speaking

5
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,719
but speak I will

6
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:57,180
there's a difference between being mindful

7
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,640
and having the desire to be mindful

8
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:10,920
and and many people who learn about Buddhism and it may be in a

9
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:18,500
simplistic way will believe that there's something wrong with having desires

10
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,360
and this is not the teachings of the Buddha

11
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,400
he said that there's to paraphrase him there's something wrong

12
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,560
something painful about craving

13
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,860
about thirsting grasping

14
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:48,360
certain kinds of desire which carry with them inherent in them is pain

15
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,759
stress and um

16
00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:01,619
but desire doesn't have to have that desires can flow through the Mind

17
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:07,320
through the heart like a small Cloud floating in the sky

18
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:14,400
not with no pressure no just kind of floating through desires

19
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,920
can be quite easy to have and there are desires that arise out of

20
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,879
our goodness out of wisdom out of care compassion out of compassion itself

21
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:33,200
is a kind of a desire and um

22
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,640
and so in the difference between being Mindful and Desiring to be mindful

23
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,660
is a useful distinction if it helps us to appreciate our desire

24
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:51,720
to be mindful the wish the aspiration the

25
00:02:51,720 --> 00:03:00,480
the wanting to be mindful and to find a way to want to be mindful

26
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,080
that is this is my language which I maybe you translated for yourself

27
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:13,800
but which is delightful to have delightful desire

28
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:23,400
and maybe inspired desire maybe a loving desire

29
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,159
that has no expectation in it no pressure in it

30
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:37,140
no requirement no should no admonition it just kind of like

31
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:44,459
of course this is a good thing and so if we can find that kind of

32
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:51,360
Desire someone asks Chanda yes that's the Pali word c-h-a-n-d-a

33
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,640
and if if we can find that kind of Desire

34
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,840
maybe it can support being mindful

35
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,900
it can be a a

36
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:19,859
gentle like the that used to be water Mills water wheels

37
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:25,860
that as the current of the river passes through the wheel it turns the wheel for

38
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:32,820
the mill to grind flower and and maybe the Chanda maybe the

39
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:38,660
desire can be the current

40
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:47,840
that keeps the mindfulness engaged or present to Turning flowing

41
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:55,560
moving active so in this sitting

42
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:02,280
maybe after settling in I'll ask you to explore the nature of a desire to be

43
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,520
mindful and see if that can support the practice

44
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,479
so

45
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,300
establishing a posture for meditation

46
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,820
and then allowing the eyes to close themselves

47
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:38,060
if they want to

48
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:48,479
whether the eyes are open or closed see if you can relax The Gaze of the

49
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:54,360
eyes any engagement with the eyes to see

50
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,198
tension

51
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:08,759
into take a few long gentle deep breaths

52
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:14,340
with the inhale to get a full embodied connection

53
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:19,919
to yourself the connection to your as much of your body as

54
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,199
the deep in-breath that reaches

55
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:38,520
and maybe as you exhale long exhale let it be like all the weight of your

56
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:45,139
body Settles into the bottom of your belly

57
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,120
and from there is supported

58
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:05,418
and letting your breathing return to normal

59
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:26,280
and for the next three or four breaths to feel wherever there might be tension

60
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:33,479
in your body tightness into the exhale soften around it

61
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:36,259
relax

62
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:10,860
and then take a couple of breaths to relax the thinking muscle

63
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:16,699
any tension tightness associated with thinking

64
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:42,120
and then take a few moments to feel your whole body

65
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,580
or a wide experience of your body

66
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,560
in whatever way is easy for you

67
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,800
feeling your body so it can be a reference point

68
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:11,480
or a deeper connection to your inner life

69
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,320
and then see if you can find within you

70
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:44,339
a relaxed desire maybe one that is

71
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:50,660
Wells up from within rather than

72
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,519
a thought that carries with it you should

73
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,740
the desire which is maybe kind of an inspiration from within

74
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:16,500
of the goodness of a possibility of being present

75
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:23,240
aware and mindful Here and Now

76
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:36,860
maybe a desire to be aware

77
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:48,019
of the aliveness of this moment

78
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:03,120
knowing that whatever is occurring in the present whether it's Pleasant or unpleasant

79
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,940
is a manifestation of you you're alive right now being alive right

80
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:16,740
now and Desiring to be present for it to be

81
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,160
mindful

82
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,700
because mindfulness itself

83
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:36,480
being conscious is a primary characteristic of being

84
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,860
alive and awake

85
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:49,279
it's a wondrous thing to be aware

86
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:57,680
and a gentle loving inspired desire yes

87
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,320
to awareness desire that is so simple that it's just

88
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:11,240
a simple yes this is good this is what I'd like

89
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:33,180
letting there be a gentle on going desire

90
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:38,699
that is like the wind pushing a sailboat

91
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:46,160
through the water where mindfulness is the bow

92
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,459
that meets the water Moment by moment

93
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:58,160
as the boat moves Through Time

94
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:51,799
if you find yourself Swept Away in thinking

95
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:59,360
because of the wonderful desire to be mindful

96
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:07,919
when you come back there can be a delight

97
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,259
in following through on that desire

98
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,960
that coming back to mindfulness

99
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,400
is a happy fulfillment of his simple desire

100
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,860
and you can enjoy that fulfillment however

101
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,240
week it might be

102
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:16,260
and as we come to the end of this sitting to appreciate there's an art

103
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:20,000
to having desires

104
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:28,320
many people don't study the art of Desire Desiring

105
00:26:29,659 --> 00:26:34,980
desires can come from a place of within of creativity

106
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,640
of

107
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:47,480
non-craving desires that have no need

108
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:53,340
within them just a simple open

109
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:59,179
goodness so this would be a nice idea this would be good

110
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:07,039
a desire which can be an Inspire action can Inspire change

111
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,700
but doesn't assert itself doesn't push for change

112
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,700
and there can be then a desire

113
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,980
for the well-being of others

114
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:38,900
that come from this place of creativity and simplicity

115
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:49,158
that is a form of art perhaps it comes from a kind of Grace and

116
00:27:56,419 --> 00:28:03,240
non-neediness non-obligation from a place within where it just seems

117
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:09,799
like this is a really good idea that others would be well

118
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:17,279
it's a desire which feels good to have it's nourishing supportive to you to

119
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:25,260
have this desire there's so little pressure or

120
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:31,559
sense of lack or sense of inadequacy that goes with it it's the opposite

121
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:35,899
it's a desire that comes from a sense of

122
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:41,299
being content here settled

123
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,580
and from such a desire

124
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:55,559
wishing expressing the wish in simple words in your

125
00:28:55,559 --> 00:29:01,020
in the quiet of your own mind you might repeat to repeat these words

126
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:11,000
that I say may all beings be happy

127
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,179
may all beings be safe

128
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,320
may all beings be peaceful

129
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:39,080
may all beings be free

130
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:59,120
and may the and may your peaceful desire for the welfare of others

131
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:03,440
be nourishing for you

132
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:19,489
[Music]

133
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,039
thank you

134
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:42,840
so this week we're doing the Buddhist teachings on right effort

135
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:51,299
sixth factor of the eighthful path and in the classic description of each of

136
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:56,640
the factors of the path eight volt factors

137
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,640
this has the longest description and has a lot of repetition in it

138
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,919
so there's four right efforts and a lot of the way it's worded each one is the

139
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:14,159
same just some variation for it and there's a lot of repetition of some words

140
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:20,220
and uh so the repetition has an impact as we read it or listen to it

141
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:26,039
and um that kind of emphasis and each each and just the right effort each of

142
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:33,600
them has a series of words that um that uh describe the kind of effort that

143
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:41,220
to be made but with all these um uh and and uh

144
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:46,620
and so we'll talk about these different kinds of efforts that the text says

145
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:53,220
but each of these four right efforts is supposed to be done with desire

146
00:31:53,220 --> 00:32:01,020
the poly word is Chanda c-h-a-n-d-a rather innocent word for desire

147
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:06,480
that sometimes is used for appropriate desires sometimes for inappropriate

148
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:12,240
desires or painful ones it's kind of a broad word desires

149
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:18,240
without any ethical or other kind of valence implied except in the context in

150
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,740
which it's used but it's used for wholesome things and one of the wholesome

151
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:30,360
engagements is this right effort to engage to to how to practice

152
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:37,260
and and so learning how to have Chanda to have desire which is itself right

153
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:44,779
effort which is itself without any afflictive Tendencies the unwholesome

154
00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:51,299
and which has wholesomeness as part of it uh which is skillful which is nourishing

155
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:59,460
which is supportive for us and so the art of discovering of investigating having how we have desires

156
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:04,620
so they come from a place within That's Not Afraid which is not

157
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:09,840
greedy which is not angry or hostile aversive

158
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,240
that's not uh related to conceit you know I have to be I have to make the

159
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,820
effort here so I can be the you know the most you know perfect effortful person and

160
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:28,880
all my Buddhist Community or something so um but to really kind of begin taking

161
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:35,460
desire seriously enough that it deserves attention it deserves let's look at this desire

162
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:41,220
what does it mean to have desire and rather than maybe a kind of a

163
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:47,039
simplistic understanding of Buddhism I'm just supposed to let go I'm just supposed to let go of everything let go

164
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:54,299
of desires let go of everything there is a time and place for that kind of approach but to have that be the the

165
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:59,700
broad swath what we do with our life it's not really what the Buddha was

166
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:05,039
teaching um but to go along with his emphasis he

167
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:11,220
talked about having desire for the practice for the path of liberation

168
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:19,020
and so to discover how do you hold the desire in a way that is inspiring for you that

169
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:26,118
it comes from a place of goodness and rightness and doesn't add stress to your life but if it may be if anything

170
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:33,358
reduces the stress and you're just happy to have this desire rather than having oh one more

171
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:40,320
desire one more thing to do and you know I have those long to-do list and now I'm supposed to do this too

172
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:46,618
um you know but not not like that but something like oh I'm so lucky I'm so

173
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:52,858
fortunate to have this this is a great thing and um in a sense one of the great

174
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:59,640
aspects of these four right efforts it's taking it's an application it's a way of

175
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:05,099
being a way of being with everything we can possibly do

176
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:10,200
no matter what we're doing we're looking at it from the point of view is how I'm

177
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:16,560
doing it and what's motivating it is it wholesome or unwholesome is it helpful or unhelpful

178
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:23,040
and um and then to uh does desire to not be involved with the unhealthy ways of

179
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:29,579
doing things and to desire the healthy ones and then how is that desire am I in a

180
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:35,700
hurry with desire I have so many to do things to do I'm in a hurry if you are in a hurry and trying to fill

181
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:41,460
your life or can you tap into the healthy form of Desire

182
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:48,420
is healthy for my desire come from some other place one of the paradoxes of of really strong

183
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:55,920
desire of you know neediness or craving or thirsting of wanting to do things even if we do it

184
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:04,619
out of fear you know fear of missing out or something is that it diminishes the wholesome

185
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:10,260
and sometimes the wholesome within us gets eclipsed entirely by all the

186
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:15,900
desires we have but if we find how to have wholesome Desires in a place where there's time

187
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:23,820
and space then the wholesome can well up the ways in which we do things can be

188
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:30,780
fulfilling in and of itself and we don't need to find fulfillment from accomplishing a lot of things we find

189
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:37,440
our fulfillment in the moment of doing something much more so

190
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:47,540
um so each of these four right efforts talks about taking up taking hold of the Mind

191
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:56,820
and with desire so the way that this the right effort is

192
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:01,859
often written translated it's a little bit

193
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:09,000
you know I think I often felt it was just I was tired by the time I read it so here's a common

194
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:16,320
translation of the it's also part of the each of the four right efforts that's similar for each one about

195
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:22,619
it's a it says um one makes effort

196
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:28,640
arouses energy exerts the mind and strives

197
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:37,079
um so that seems like a lot of uh work

198
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:44,040
but I want to read you a different translation that the one that I've made that uh some of some of the what the

199
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:50,460
original poly is left out in the English Trend this English translation so

200
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:57,900
um one takes up and takes hold of the Mind

201
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:05,940
so here one begins by being present for one's own mind one's

202
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:12,180
own inner life one takes hold and takes up

203
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:18,839
um so so you know our inner life let's say inner life everyone's inner life the mind this is important to engage and be

204
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:25,140
attentive to um so one takes up and takes hold of the

205
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:34,260
Mind and generates desire so one arouses one gives birth to desire

206
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:41,160
so there's a conscious intention here to look for that desire that is appropriate that's healthy

207
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:47,339
that's um you know so uh beautifully done like a piece of

208
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:54,599
art that you like to look on this desire one takes up it takes hold of the mind

209
00:38:54,599 --> 00:39:00,480
and generates desire initiates

210
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,720
initiates courageous effort so the word initiates is there in the original

211
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,880
and the word for courageous effort is Viria

212
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:17,700
which is a very powerful word sometimes it

213
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:24,240
means power or strength and it's um sometimes it's correct translated I think maybe into Tibetan Buddhism is

214
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:30,420
courageous effort um someone who's a uh a warrior is

215
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:37,440
sometimes called a you know a word that's related to a very uh so courageous but I like the word

216
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:45,060
courageous effort that sometimes uh we have to have some courage to be present and for ourselves

217
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:51,380
and hear so it's a little bit has it's it's it's bringing some strength to it

218
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:56,579
um um so one takes up and takes hold of the

219
00:39:56,579 --> 00:40:03,119
Mind and generates desire initiates courageous effort

220
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:10,380
for the non-arising of unwholesome states of mind

221
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:16,079
so that's the first right effort for today I want to introduce now the second one

222
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:22,500
and uh and this one goes takes up when takes up and takes hold of the Mind

223
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:29,240
and generates desire initiates courageous effort

224
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:35,820
for abandoning unwholesome states of mind

225
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:42,119
and this word uh pahana abandoned is a powerful word it's

226
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:47,420
different than just letting go Letting Go has more of more a sense of

227
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:53,820
letting go of it for the moment abandoning is Letting Go done with

228
00:40:53,820 --> 00:41:01,079
wisdom and commitment and Clarity and a fullness this I'm going to put down this

229
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:07,980
I'm not going to be involved in anymore of course mostly they come back but there's a kind of a definite in this or

230
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:14,940
fullness or seriousness this I will abandon this I won't do anymore

231
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:21,300
and here again we have this kind of idea of living in a conscious mindful way that comes when you take hold of the

232
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:27,980
mind if take hold up take hold of your attention take hold of you know being here in the present moment

233
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:33,900
take it up be here so that when you're doing something you

234
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:39,619
do it wholeheartedly and here this right effort is

235
00:41:39,619 --> 00:41:45,359
generate the desire to wholeheartedly abandon

236
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:50,700
whatever you're doing that's afflictive that harms you maybe it harms others as

237
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:57,060
well it's not necessarily it's not at all easy to abandon and let it go so just

238
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:03,180
say it so simply is uh you know can be confusing or even you know even

239
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:10,740
stressful but this we're talking about having the desire for this the healthy desire

240
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:17,040
taking the time to find that the definitiveness of clearness that you know I think I want to be

241
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:24,480
finished with this I've been critical of others in an aversive annoying way

242
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:32,280
and I'm done with this I've done this for so long it's not good for them it's not good for me I want to abandon this

243
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:37,619
aversive nature that I have this criticalness this cynicism

244
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:43,079
the resentment I have I've been caught in addiction which is

245
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:48,180
very difficult I want to undermine or under understate the difficulty of it

246
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:54,119
but still I've had enough and I want to now just you know I would

247
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:59,579
I want to have the desires here to abandon it and once that clear desire is there to

248
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:05,040
abandon it then we can engage engage in the process of

249
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:13,380
doing so so it might not just be snap our fingers and then we just do it it's um it's uh

250
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:22,079
you know then we practice the rest of the hateful path so that we can find a way to do that

251
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:28,440
so um um the second of the right efforts

252
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:33,780
is to arouse give birth to generate the desire

253
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:39,060
find the desire find the way to desire that you enjoy

254
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:45,540
it does require you to take some time to get to know what that kind of Desire

255
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:51,540
might be maybe it's a desire you arouse

256
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:58,260
when you're relaxed at ease having cup of tea looking out the window for something or

257
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:04,920
or maybe you can be in touch with that kind of healthy desire at the end of a sitting of meditation

258
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:10,440
so this is not an obligation to let go of unwholesome desires or a statement

259
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:17,339
having unwholesome mind States it's not a statement you're a terrible person if you have unwholesome states of mind

260
00:44:17,339 --> 00:44:25,079
it's rather discovering something wonderful inside a wonderful desire

261
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:32,160
that cares for yourself that wants to engage in a process

262
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,680
of bringing these to an end so they can be abandoned put down once

263
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:43,200
and for all and maybe it's done in small pieces small steps

264
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:51,060
maybe it's done gradually over time maybe for today if you know you have

265
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:57,240
some afflictive unhealthy mind States and desires

266
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:04,020
that you don't want to kind of live by but you're caught in often maybe the goal for today is not to abandon them

267
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:10,260
entirely but to discover a desire to abandon them

268
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:15,300
so whenever they arise take the time to find a healthy desire one that you like

269
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:20,819
that you enjoy having in relationship to the things that you would like to abandon

270
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:26,839
and then rather than abandoning them entirely maybe you can less lessen the frequency

271
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:33,000
or their intensity today by 10 percent

272
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,040
and um and what would that look like just going to turn down the volume a little bit

273
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:43,160
as opposed to being caught up in the idea it should be all or nothing

274
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:48,540
so I hope you enjoy your desires take time today to look at them and explore

275
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:54,599
them and maybe enjoy the desire to

276
00:45:54,599 --> 00:46:00,720
be done with some of the unhealthy unsupportive states of mind that you

277
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:06,119
might live with and maybe you'll enjoy

278
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:12,359
doing them 10 letters less so um thank you

279
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:17,940
very much and tomorrow we'll start the discussion about um

280
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:23,220
the third right effort which is the related to

281
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:28,940
um wholesome mind States thank you
