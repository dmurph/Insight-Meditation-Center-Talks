00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,519
this weekend i learned that in a south african

2
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:21,520
country in south africa language that the word for hello

3
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,880
is i see you and the

4
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:37,040
african person who told me this speaks the language i said that i see you has a kind of opening

5
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:45,840
impact this kind of a different way of connecting to people than saying hello and and then this idea to be seen

6
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,640
and it is little you know a little bit odd to i can't see any of you that i'm i'm speaking to but i do see the

7
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,280
chats and i so much appreciate the greetings and the connection and i sit down here and

8
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,478
delighted to begin the mornings this way

9
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:14,320
so maybe in a figurative way i see you and offer you my greetings and

10
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:23,040
so in important ways

11
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:30,320
the breathing how we breathe the experience of breathing is a reflection of what's happening in

12
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,400
the mind the mind is tense the breathing is tense

13
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,159
certain emotions in the mind or in the heart stimulate the breathing in one way and

14
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:48,479
other emotions do it a different way it's also to some degree true of the body as a whole there's something about

15
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,640
when we sit down to meditate some way in which we experience the body which does in fact

16
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,079
express or mirrors what's happening in the mind and it's kind of a profound thing to

17
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:08,080
appreciate this or to actually see how this works it's not obvious maybe in on the surface but then the

18
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,879
it works in the other direction that as the breathing changes it changes the mind as

19
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:21,040
the mind as the body somehow changes it changes the mind and i say this as we

20
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:29,280
begin as we often do with relaxing the body as a way of entering into meditation

21
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,800
and but relaxing the body and adjusting the breathing

22
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:42,400
are not just done for the sake of physically settling in and being here it also is a kind of a

23
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,840
an influence a healthy good influence on the mind or the heart

24
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,840
so for example as we relax the body perhaps that has a maybe we feel a

25
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:01,519
little bit safer maybe we feel a sense of safety or at least less fear or less anxiety

26
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:07,200
or less tension less preoccu and if as feeling less tension

27
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,800
in the body allow that to translate or to waft or

28
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:20,879
influence the mind feeling less tense as well and so the relaxing the body is

29
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:27,599
part of also preparing the mind for meditation and i'll talk more about

30
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,280
this during the talk so to take a to assume a meditation

31
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:41,680
posture and gently close your eyes

32
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:51,440
and with your eyes closed to spend a little bit of time rocking back and forth swaying back and

33
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:58,400
forth to see if you can find just kind of stretch and kind of awaken your body a little

34
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:06,239
bit and have a sense of your body in space and then maybe feel the contact with

35
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,760
your sitting bones if you're sitting against your cushion or chair

36
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,239
and then come to center looking for a way of sitting that feels like your weight of your body is

37
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:24,479
balanced in some way if you're sitting upright that the weight of your body is centered

38
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:31,120
over the sitting bones you're not leaning forward or or not

39
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,400
you know your center of gravity is not behind you but because you're leaning backwards

40
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:48,320
and then to take a few long slow deep breaths

41
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:57,600
not only to feel your body more fully but to establish the connection between

42
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,440
the mind and the body more consciously

43
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:11,280
kind of create open the channels the communication between the mind and

44
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,759
the body

45
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:27,759
feeling the rib cage stretch and expand as you breathe and feeling the same rib cage maybe

46
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:38,080
collapse or contract as you settle in when you exhale

47
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:45,919
and then as you exhale long deep exhale see if you can relax and soften

48
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:52,160
your body

49
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:59,919
shoulders belly and as you take a long exhale

50
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:06,080
and relax the body let that have an influence on the mind quieting of the

51
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,919
mind relaxing of the mind

52
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,840
and then letting your breathing return to normal

53
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,759
and see that if we also do some more relaxing and see if there's some way maybe subtle

54
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,880
way that relaxing the body

55
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:43,120
has an influence on relaxing the mind as well

56
00:06:44,720 --> 00:07:03,840
so beginning by on the exhale relaxing the muscles of the face

57
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:18,319
as you exhale softening the shoulders releasing them to the pull of gravity

58
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:29,360
maybe the weight of the arms encourages the shoulders to release a

59
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,840
little bit

60
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:58,560
perhaps relaxing your hands any tightening in the fingers

61
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:05,520
and as if the mind participates in the relaxation

62
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:12,400
relax the chest the center of your chest your heart

63
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,800
center

64
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,840
softening the belly

65
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,240
and as it softens the softening in the

66
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,839
mind

67
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:23,360
softening in the lower waist and lower back

68
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,040
and relaxing the thighs

69
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,000
and then to feel your body in some global way

70
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:53,279
and then as you exhale to relax the whole body

71
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:05,839
easing up in any way in which you're bracing yourself against life

72
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:26,240
and then bringing your attention to your forehead

73
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,880
behind your forehead and the area of the brain

74
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,560
feeling any tension or holding pressure that might be there

75
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:47,360
agitation and as you exhale

76
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,000
relax

77
00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:01,839
the thinking muscle relax the tensions and pressure associated with thinking

78
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,720
associated with worrying

79
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,839
associated with wanting

80
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:35,760
and then once again feel the global body in whatever way that's easy for you

81
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:45,040
to the degree to which it's easy perhaps you feel a subtleness

82
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:51,120
or a tingling or aliveness

83
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:59,440
warmth some energy coursing through your body

84
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,720
maybe even you can notice some feelings of contentment

85
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,839
or peacefulness in your body

86
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:28,320
and within the body is part of the bodily experience become aware of breathing

87
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:41,600
and gently maybe slightly at the end of the exhale

88
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:48,320
relaxing the breathings maybe you breathe

89
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,839
exhale a little longer

90
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:02,160
at the top of the inhale a subtle relaxation releasing

91
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:21,839
maybe the inhale continues a little more

92
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:37,040
and then can you make some small adjustments to the breathing so breathing is more

93
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:44,639
pleasant more enjoyable not dramatically but just a little bit more

94
00:13:44,639 --> 00:14:03,839
breathing a little slower a little faster a little longer or shorter

95
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,720
looking for whatever subtle pleasure there is

96
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,839
in your breathing

97
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,839
and quieting the thinking mind

98
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:59,839
so there can be more intimacy with the experience of breathing

99
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:41,639
and if there could be if there is any coziness

100
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:50,160
contentment it's just being here in your body

101
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,440
or satisfaction

102
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,560
being connected to your bodily experience directly

103
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,839
even if it's uncomfortable

104
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:18,319
maybe you can allow the mind and heart

105
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:25,600
to share with some of that contentment or coziness or satisfaction

106
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:47,840
content just to sit here breathing in this living pulsing body

107
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,640
there is an intimacy and deep connection between the mind and the

108
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:49,120
body that functions more deeply or more

109
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:55,840
clearly when the thinking mind is quieter

110
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,880
gently letting go of your thoughts

111
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:10,080
appreciating the ways in which the mind can be quieter stiller so

112
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:17,840
there's a richer connection awareness of the body breathing

113
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:31,840
in the goodness of breathing or the relaxation of the body

114
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:45,840
can have a nice influence on the mind

115
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
so

116
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:59,039
perhaps there's a way you can soften your belly more relax it

117
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:06,400
to settle your breathing further

118
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,799
and to reassure the mind and heart

119
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:21,840
breathing in and breathing out

120
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:07,760
and then when we breathe

121
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:14,880
we breathe together with all breathing life

122
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,799
we share it with all of everyone else who's breathing

123
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:29,440
it's our common humanity that we all require breathing

124
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:37,200
to not only to live but for their whole inner life to be

125
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,840
functioning well

126
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:55,840
and while we might wish at the end of the sitting for all beings to be well and happy and free

127
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:05,278
we could also wish them to have an easeful breath

128
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,559
for their breathing to be easeful and comfortable

129
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,679
relaxed open breathing

130
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:26,960
because this way of breathing is deeply connected to being happy and

131
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,159
safe and free

132
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:39,360
may all beings have an easeful breath

133
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:50,799
may all beings breathe with reassurance and safety

134
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:56,559
may all beings feel delight

135
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:05,360
with their breathing as they breathe

136
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:11,840
and may it be that we live together with other people

137
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:17,360
so that we do not we're not the cause and condition

138
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:21,278
for their breathing to be tense

139
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:31,679
shallow tight may we be a condition and a cause

140
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:38,080
to support others to breathe at ease happily and peacefully

141
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:47,519
and perhaps we can coexist with an easeful breath

142
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:55,679
and the best in all of us has a chance to come forth may all beings

143
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:12,299
breathe peacefully [Music]

144
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,120
you
