it's evening so good having you

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,680
here we're going to just begin with about half an hour of

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,559
meditation so if you like to just take a few moments to uh get

8
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:56,079
situated um find a sitting posture or

9
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:04,198
find a maybe find a space where you can sit un comfortably for half an hour and

10
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:11,400
feel free to do so and maybe um some of you might use chairs or some might sit

11
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,560
on the cushion wherever you are just take a um a couple of minutes to um land

12
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,118
in a space where you can feel

13
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:33,000
comfortable take a few moments to maybe just just um move your

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,920
body and to allow yourself to settle into the sitting

15
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,799
Place sometimes you can kind of just pull the shoulder up and let the

16
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,719
shoulder drop or move your

17
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,799
head neck

18
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:12,879
and momentarily you can settle settle into a more quiet sitting

19
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:28,079
posture it's helpful to take a few long deep breath at the beginning of the

20
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:35,200
meditation to allow ourselves to arrive arrive

21
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:42,720
here maybe as you breathe out sensing and feeling that you're

22
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,800
arriving here

23
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:05,920
deeply now the lower half of the body to be rooted on the

24
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,840
ground maybe feel some firm connection of the lower half of the

25
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,480
body to the chairs or the floor

26
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:39,799
and from a rooted Place allow the Torso and

27
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:43,400
spine to be

28
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:58,439
uplifted allow this uplifting to be

29
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:02,920
energetic at the the same time

30
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,480
relaxed soften the muscles and the

31
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:30,280
face sometimes you can open the jaws and then float it together

32
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:37,680
to just release any tension around the muscles on the face

33
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,280
around the

34
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:02,880
neck and quickly scan the whole body from the head to toe to invite some

35
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,880
sense of ease and

36
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,360
relaxation and when you're

37
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:35,240
ready rest your ATT tension on the breath or in the Body Sensations in the

38
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,240
body

39
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:13,800
sometimes I imagine this connecting with the breath

40
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:24,120
and the body as if we're inviting ourselves to come home to this body

41
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,880
this intimate home of our

42
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,160
body maybe there is sense of

43
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:55,919
safety [Music] warmth and

44
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:03,120
ease sense of coming home right

45
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:32,680
here feeling and sensing in into the

46
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,360
breath resting in the movements of the

47
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:58,039
breath or the changing temperatures as you breathe in and out

48
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:34,839
coming home to the present

49
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
experience

50
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,360
e e

51
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:11,120
as a home of our being has a door that's wide

52
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:20,519
open welcoming the the coming and going of all

53
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,560
experiences sound traveling through

54
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,040
you

55
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,560

Sensations in the

58
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,760
body maybe tinkling on the

59
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:30,399
feet pulses on the on the legs

60
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,360

62
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,639

e e

65
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:01,360

66
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:05,120
quietness in your

67
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,079

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,120
already back at home

72
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,600
the home of

73
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
awareness

74
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839

75
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840

76
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840

e e

86
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:27,320
sitting here feeling and sensing that a group of us are sitting

87
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,120
together right

88
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:44,120
now it's as if we're all sitting in a virtual meditation

89
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:48,960
Hall practicing

90
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,440
well e

91
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:47,600
maybe knowing this that we're practicing

92
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,200
together you feel a little more

93
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:57,200
uplifted more energetic

94
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:02,559
in staying

95
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
present

96
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

97
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

98
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

99
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,159
e e

100
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,919
this last couple of minutes of Vis

101
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:12,679
sitting we have a deep inner bowing to

102
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:18,080
ourselves showing up

103
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:27,000
practicing showing up of for ourselves and for each other

104
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,200
it's a virtual [Music]

105
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,840
community deep bows maybe an ignor bowing

106
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:58,240
gesture to each other for showing up for each other

107
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,559
supporting each other practicing

108
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,480
deep bows to

109
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:26,080
everyone so um what I had in mind to share today

110
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:33,799
tonight um is that uh I finished a chanting Retreat last

111
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:39,840
week there was still quite a lot of energy reverberating in me from this

112
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:47,039
chanting Retreat so I thought I'd share some Reflections on one of things that stood

113
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:55,480
out for me that is uh taking refuge in the Buddha Dharma and

114
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:03,120
S and that is often called the triple gam and some of you probably know this

115
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:10,960
and then probably have done this multiple times

116
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:21,000
um and I just want to um maybe just chant this a poly chant um um right now

117
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:30,880
for everyone and maybe share a little reflection about um the sense of a taking refuges

118
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:39,120
in the Buddha Dharma and S and so the poly chant goes uh like

119
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:54,959
this [Music]

120
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:04,799
[Music] and it often times get translated as I

121
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:10,559
take refuge in the Buddha I take refuge in the

122
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:19,960
Dharma and I take refuge in the Sana and this um the typical form is to

123
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:27,960
chant this three times and so on this a chanting retreat

124
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:35,480
we chanted this um multiple times and taking this refugees are often

125
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:43,880
down formally in a ceremony when one commits to become um a

126
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:50,639
Buddhist to walk the Dharma path a teacher May initiate um the

127
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:58,720
ceremony and chanting this uh refugees taking refugees is part of the ceremony

128
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:04,000
and for me when I H did this um

129
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:13,120
ceremony long time ago um it it felt like a turning point in my

130
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:21,039
life I felt some deep s sense of surrendering to this dap

131
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:29,000
paath and so nowadays uh in many uh Dharma centers or retreat ret centers in

132
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,600
particular I know in inside Retreat Center our Retreat Center here uh in

133
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:41,880
Scott Valley California uh usually at the beginning of the retreat and the group would

134
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:49,039
initiate this whole Retreat process by taking refugees in the Buddha Dharma and

135
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:54,279
Sanaa together in monastic settings and many

136
00:33:54,279 --> 00:34:02,679
lay Buddhist communities uh take refuge is very often sometimes on daily

137
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:11,118
basis so what does this really mean taking refuge in the Buddha Dharma and

138
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:16,560
S it's quite a worth reflecting um for

139
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:26,240
me I was I was I feel like I'm very fond of the Chinese translation of buddham

140
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:33,118
gami this p CH in particular uh the Chinese

141
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:39,878
translation um of s gachami is that of

142
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:46,760
return and rely and so and the a Chinese uh version

143
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:55,800
of taking Refuge is something like this and to the to the Buddha I return and

144
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:03,079
rely to the s to the Dharma I return and

145
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:10,240
rely and to the sa I return and

146
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:17,839
rely I like the sense of returning a lot and the Chinese character used uh

147
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:24,680
for returning um it often relates to the sense of

148
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:30,839
returning home or coming back you know sometimes when uh someone has

149
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:38,720
been um staying oversea in some other places when they go back home and and

150
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:45,119
this is the character that's being used and which is this returning so what does it mean by

151
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:51,680
returning to the Buddha coming home to the Buddha this

152
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:57,880
orientation and the sense of returning and to me is that it's it's

153
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:02,838
not necessarily going out to

154
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:11,119
somewhere out there but rather it's just turning Inward and

155
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:21,560
coming back right here somewhere within us the home of this being this

156
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:28,000
life and so in this way uh there's a sense of

157
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:35,599
return and rely um is not a pointing to something

158
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:40,720
of uh worshiping something out

159
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:51,720
there rather something deeply inside of us uh in the poly um uh recollection

160
00:36:51,720 --> 00:37:00,960
chants and often times in the monasteries there this form of a chantings that um monastics do on very

161
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,240
regular basis called the Recollections there is a um a particular

162
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:12,160
chant around the recollection of the triple Jam that is one is to remember

163
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:19,480
and be reminded of and the qualities of the Buddha Dharma and

164
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:27,800
Sanaa and the um the qualities of the Buddha in this Rec recollection chant

165
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:33,920
um is that the Buddha is the one who is an

166
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:40,160
arand who is completely free from great hatred and

167
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:47,119
delusion and he's someone who's rid of this kind of a forces

168
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:53,599
completely and totally incapable of great hatred

169
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:01,160
delusion and another quality that's often being uh remembered or

170
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:06,760
recollected um is this um term called V

171
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:12,720
charana Sano that is one whose wisdom and

172
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,880
compassion are in Perfect

173
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:24,280
Harmony One is wise and

174
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:32,920
compassionate and another quality and is that the Buddha is the one who trains

175
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:39,800
those who wish to be trained like us and wish to be

176
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:45,839
trained and Buddha serves to teach those who wish to be

177
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:53,000
trained so there's a sense of taking refuge in the Buddha is like returning

178
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,119
home to this kind of qualities finding true true Safety and

179
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:06,839
Security in this kind of qualities relying on non greed non

180
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:15,359
hatred a non delution to live our lives instead of relying on I don't know

181
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:20,960
money status relationships

182
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:29,640
power you know many things that um we may rely on um are actually quite

183
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:35,520
unre unreliable um in the the Dharma

184
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,960
teachings and it's really possible through the practice and to cultivate

185
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:52,680
this kind of qualities as if it's not that the Buddha would not have taught for over 45 years and by wondering all

186
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:58,240
around in different parts of India um

187
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:06,119
by foot so uh personally this sense of

188
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:12,359
taking refuge in the Buddha evokes the sense of surrendering oneself to this

189
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:18,560
possibility to this possibility to become free from great hatred delusion

190
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:23,720
and this P possibility to um be wise and

191
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:30,000
compassionate the possibility of serving oneself and and is serving

192
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:46,160
others and often times um through it's through cultivation of um mindfulness

193
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:52,720
concentration uh ethical conducts that this kind of quality began

194
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:59,119
to become possible um or accessible um within

195
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:05,839
us and through the teachings of the Buddha and this tools of mindfulness the

196
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:13,599
tools of uh cultivating concentration the tools of um of abiding

197
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:19,839
CA um can allow us to um cling

198
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:24,920
out the stuff that hinder the access to this kind of beautiful

199
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:31,680
qualities and this leads to maybe the the second Refuge which is a refuge in

200
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:38,440
and the Dharma returning and relying on the Dharma so what does this mean

201
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:45,040
returning and relying on the Dharma in the recollection of the triple

202
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:50,720
GM the Dharma is said to be here and now

203
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:56,920
always present timeless

204
00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:06,240
inviting investigation and Dharma

205
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:13,318
leads is leading inward or leading towards

206
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:21,079
Liberation and Dharma is to be individually experienced by the

207
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:30,960
wise and so you hear this kind of qualities that describe the Dharma something that's right here and

208
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:36,720
right now it's present right here it's not found

209
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:43,800
in kind know long- winded memories or um fantasies in the

210
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:50,520
future but it's something that we can touch into right here maybe in the

211
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:59,040
breath we breathe in and breathe out and in the sensations of the body

212
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,040
in the sound that's traveling

213
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:10,720
through something that's unfolding right here right now in front

214
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:17,480
of us and it's said to invite

215
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:23,880
investigation invites us to see pay careful attention to this quite a secret

216
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:29,119
unfolding of our lives right here

217
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:40,640
and it's by this form of quite deeply intimate seeing and clear

218
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:47,480
seeing of the phenomenon that's unfolding in front of

219
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:53,000
us and liberating insights can

220
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:01,480
arise the insights into an nature d anata that is

221
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:09,720
impermanence stress and unsatisfactoriness and not

222
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:18,599
self this insights can really lead can lead to the freedom of grasping um lead

223
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:25,200
from lead um us into the freedom from great hatred

224
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:34,520
delusion and so that's through this returning again and again to the immediacy of our LIF

225
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:41,119
experience we can begin to see clearly what is going

226
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:47,680
on as I was reflecting about um what we

227
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:53,559
usually rely on or return

228
00:44:53,559 --> 00:45:01,319
to you know when we are when we H didn't uh when I didn't start practicing

229
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:09,400
Dharma and there lots of external things that I'm thinking that I would depend on

230
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:16,119
or rely on that would make me feel okay I feel safe you know maybe the weather

231
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:21,160
needs to be good or and the neighborhood needs to be

232
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:27,440
nice and the shelter is comfortable and somehow one we another family members

233
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:33,480
are in Harmony and our bodies are healthy enough

234
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:39,960
um or maybe you know no one is saying anything bad about you or no one is

235
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:46,520
looking down on you maybe you have a good job lots of those kind of things

236
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:51,960
and that um one can put a lot of uh

237
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:59,040
efforts in to try to get them all lined up so that we can feel feel um a sense

238
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:08,160
of okayness or feel a sense of safety but after we try for some

239
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:16,079
years maybe many years we begin to see it's pretty difficult

240
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:22,240
right no matter what we do somehow um maybe they're always someone who's not

241
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:27,880
particularly happy with what you said what you did um

242
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:32,119
things are not always coming together

243
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:40,119
harmoniously so putting a lot of effort on trying to sort out all of this

244
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:44,000
external uh

245
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:53,760
relian may not really work out so this taking refuge in the Dharma

246
00:46:53,760 --> 00:47:03,119
is a calling for us to look in a different way not outside but deeply inside of

247
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:14,720
us also something that happens Here and Now not in the past and not in the

248
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:25,800
future and I also say that um when we when we uh follow the uh

249
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:31,200
Buddhist teaching cultivating our mind and heart we don't

250
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:37,200
do this alone as I was reflecting on the vast

251
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:43,559
transmission the corlection and the and the translations of this teachings that

252
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:50,760
came from more than 2,600 years ago countless individuals have walked

253
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:58,640
the path countless individuals have been cultivating their heart and mind in the

254
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:04,640
past and right now just look at all of us here

255
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,519
together practicing

256
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:19,240
together and there will be um this kind of forces happening in the future

257
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:25,280
too in the way we are the direct beneficiaries of the stream and currents

258
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:32,880
of the wisdom compassion from so many people before

259
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:45,200
us I'm feeling that even in our virtual meditation hall or Dharma Hall um a

260
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:55,280
group of us are joining the current of the practice the current of the Sana

261
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:03,559
so here the community of the practitioners who practice well is a

262
00:49:03,559 --> 00:49:10,079
home to return to I'm fond of this particular sutta

263
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:15,880
where Ananda said to the Buddha one time that half of the Holy

264
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:21,040
life is s but the Buddha corrected him and budha

265
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:27,040
said no no Anand don't say that the whole of of the

266
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:33,799
Holy life is Sana because if the Sana practices the

267
00:49:33,799 --> 00:49:39,160
noble Eightfold Path you will do so as

268
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:46,559
well isn't that true and so if all of you are practicing Noble

269
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:53,119
Eightfold Path I will be doing this no

270
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:58,119
doubt as part of the s

271
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:07,359
and so for me personally at some point of my Dharma Journey Dharma practice journey I had a re realization that the

272
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:13,920
Dharma path can't be claimed as mine because I'm

273
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:21,559
constantly influenced shaped inspired and moved by people like

274
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:28,040
you by my teachers by the Dharma bodies by the SAA

275
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,559
I'm part

276
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:42,119
of and when I'm returning to the home of Sanaa there is no doubt that this

277
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:49,280
currents will drawing force and the practice will unfold will

278
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:55,079
move each other I remember sometimes uh if I get

279
00:50:55,079 --> 00:51:00,359
caught up in the things of of the world um I don't know worldly

280
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:07,440
wings um but when I'm entering into a group of

281
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:14,640
practitioners for a sit or for a Dharma talk or for a event

282
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:20,279
together often I have this sense of coming

283
00:51:20,359 --> 00:51:28,040
home there is a real sense of safety here I can trust the collect

284
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:35,839
conscience Collective Good Will kindness and the Beautiful wholesome

285
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:41,520
qualities that the the S cultivates

286
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:53,079
together this uh returning and relying on the goodness of the S is a real

287
00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:57,520
Refuge a real home

288
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:10,240
so um I wanted to maybe and just feeling this and chanting

289
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:16,160
Retreat energy I wanted to end today's talk Maybe by

290
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:23,319
chanting uh for a few minutes on on this particular chant that touched me quite

291
00:52:23,319 --> 00:52:29,960
deeply and this is um paying respect to the Buddha Dharma and

292
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:35,559
S and the the chant is in P um and it's

293
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:43,079
actually quite a simple chant and if you wish and definitely join me join me and

294
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:50,040
it's a repeat so um hopefully as you follow along and a couple of times

295
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:57,359
you'll be able to join in on on this chant and this chant go

296
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:09,480
like [Music]

297
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:18,640
this so Vante means um uh reverence or to

298
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:28,359
Revere and so what this chant um is saying is um to rever the Buddha to

299
00:53:28,359 --> 00:53:34,000
rever the Dharma and to rever the

300
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:42,200
Sana and so I'm going to begin and if you like to join me and after maybe
