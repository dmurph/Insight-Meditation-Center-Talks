1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:07,560
so today I would like to focus a talk around a particular

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:14,940
poem that the Buddha taught it was a poem that he seemed to have been eager to have his students people

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:21,600
memorize because there's accounts in the ancient texts of um of you know him

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,240
helping people memorize the text he had recited so they'd learn it and um

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,758
it was an oral tradition back then in the ancient world so there was no Library you could go to so if you wanted

6
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,360
to have access to teachings in the texts you had to have memorized them

7
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,739
and so all the suit does all these this discourses were eventually memorized but

8
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:49,680
many of them were put to memory after he died but during his lifetime there's only a

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,140
particular ones that we have record of that he was actively teaching people to

10
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:00,780
memorize so I take that to being that it was really important for the Buddha

11
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:07,939
and he gave then he explained or gave an analysis of the poem as well

12
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:15,360
and whether the Capone is a poem or whether it's a song is a little bit of a

13
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,240
you know interpretive exercise there was a time when some of the

14
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,720
early Western Scholars especially from Sri Lanka who spoke English would call

15
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,540
these kinds of poems ballads and sometimes the way they're chanted

16
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,299
can sound very much like a something that we may be Associated more with a

17
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:46,619
song or or ballet or something and that helps the memorization of it

18
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:51,840
the and so this one is called

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,899
um it has an interesting title I I call it an auspicious day

20
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:05,340
and the word for auspicious bada means something like something that is

21
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,819
so uh fortunate something that's wondrous a blessing auspicious

22
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:17,940
and but the word rata r-a-t-t-a can mean night

23
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:24,239
and but it seems in the ancient world uh it also meant the day just like in

24
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:31,440
English um uh data the word Day means both daytime and the whole 24 hours

25
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,319
but uh in uh uh week so they would count the days by

26
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:44,099
how many nights it's been and so if you said that if you said you know an auspicious night people

27
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:49,260
understood in the context it would be a day so I translated as an auspicious day

28
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:55,860
but it's interesting because the word rata is uh is a particular grammatical

29
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:02,760
formulation of the word Raga which can mean a kind

30
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:10,560
of a passionate attachment and uh and so so one translation that

31
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:17,180
bikubody had in his early translation was inauspicious attachment

32
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:23,519
and so it's a kind of word play going on here so is it okay to be attached well

33
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,580
if you're attached to this maybe it isn't too bad maybe it helps you to be if you're attached to healthy

34
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:36,060
things then as long as it's helping you it's okay to be attached but when you realize it's not it's hindering you

35
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,819
that's when we let go of it and this is a very nice way of understanding attachments there's a tendency in

36
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:47,640
Buddhism to kind of like it's all or nothing like if you're attached let go you're not supposed to be that way

37
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,920
but rather that recognize well there's often a reason to be attached it's the

38
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,140
reason why people are attached to strategy for something and maybe sometimes it's not a bad

39
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:03,420
strategy and so for example being attached to your health

40
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,519
might be good until the point especially if you're sick but then if you're really

41
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:15,959
healthy if you're excessively attached to the health at some point you might find that it's actually making you unhealthy because you're kind of so much

42
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:23,880
preoccupied and worried and stressing about it so so the uh so an auspicious attachment

43
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:31,199
if you're going to have an attachment nadarma the one I'm going to read uh this would be good

44
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:38,040
oh as long as it's good and then you let go so this is I also I call this uh poem

45
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,919
um the vipassana anthem so uh for the inside movement for us all

46
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:49,860
kind of like a this is you know has such a wonderful special place for us

47
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:55,139
and um so um

48
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:00,139
there's four verses four four stanzas

49
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:07,919
an auspicious day don't chase the past

50
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:13,680
or long for the future the past is Left Behind

51
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:20,040
the future not yet reached clearly see phenomena

52
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:27,479
anywhere they appear not faltering and not agitated knowing

53
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:34,380
this develop the mind ardently do what should be done today

54
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:40,740
who knows death may come tomorrow

55
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:48,960
there is no bargaining with mortality and death's great Army

56
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:58,860
whoever lives thus ardent active day and night is says that peaceful Sage one who has

57
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:06,539
an auspicious day so I think part of the power of this

58
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:12,000
poem is the third stanza verse uh ardently do what should be done today

59
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,400
who knows death may come tomorrow there is no bargaining with mortality

60
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,740
and death's great Army the um

61
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:30,560
so um and here the lesson of this death contemplation taking it into a seriously

62
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,560
is not morbid it's not kind of to be you know and uh and it's not then to live in

63
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,319
such a way that you have a better rebirth or something but rather to take this

64
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,660
moment seriously as the place for practice as a place to be mindful and

65
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:54,600
attentive and more than that this is the place to have insight

66
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:03,060
and um and that if you can have inside here if you're able to live really centered here as life is being lived in

67
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:08,780
a lived moment and lived life and have insight as you go along then

68
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:15,419
this is an auspicious day says the peaceful Sage peaceful Sage is a word

69
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:22,860
for the title for the Buddha but the word peaceful is important because this is the purpose of this path

70
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:31,860
this is the purpose of this auspicious practice is so we can discover for ourselves a deep abiding sense of peace

71
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:37,680
one of the great gifts that we can give the world is to die peacefully

72
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:45,319
if it's possible that we do the truth it helps people not be afraid of life

73
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:51,060
it's been lots of studies done that have pointed out that um something like

74
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,819
there's a tendency for uh for the people who are afraid of death

75
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:04,080
to be afraid to live their life fully and the people who are not afraid of death tend to live Fuller more engaged

76
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:10,020
life exactly how that how to explain that I don't know and but but it's an

77
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:16,500
interesting correlation and so so it starts with this kind of

78
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:22,319
instructions that don't chase the past or along for the future the past is Left

79
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,360
Behind in the future not yet reached uh one of the lessons that I learned

80
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:34,800
slowly over the years was when I thought about the future imagine the future and planned around

81
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,899
the future had wishes and fears about the future

82
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:46,500
um I had plenty of it for all kinds of situations and it turned out I had an amazingly

83
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,860
poor prediction rate that I would predict you know based on

84
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,440
some idea of what was going to happen in the future and so many times it didn't work out that way it did happen

85
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:05,100
differently than I was planned or how I thought or was afraid and so it's slowly dawned on me that I

86
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,800
had very bad record and even then it took a long time for

87
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,620
that to sink in deeply and eventually I realized oh

88
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:23,820
I don't know the future and so I'm not going to be so attached to it or so caught in my prediction

89
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:29,880
I might take it into account and you know do some modicum at least bring an umbrella or something

90
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:36,680
but in case but uh the uh it kind of loosened up

91
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:43,260
my my way I was attached to the Future cut up in the future concerned about the

92
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:49,560
future and I discovered as I learned to let go of that pre-concern the preoccupation

93
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:57,779
with my future and I would show up and I discovered that generally once I'm

94
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:04,200
there in the moment I generally know how to find my way with it and that helped me relax even more

95
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,420
and the result of that relaxation was a greater appreciation and willingness

96
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:15,200
just to be with here with what's going on be present

97
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:21,480
so the future is not yet reached the past is Left Behind and um

98
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:28,320
you know I've held on to the Past not want to let go and nothing you know when I hold on to the memories hold on to the

99
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:34,800
people hold on to whatever who I was back then and sometimes it's held me back

100
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,620
sometimes my self-image of myself was based on who I was in the past and I'm

101
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:48,779
still trying to prove that or be that and it's going to interfere with my ability to be present here in a full way

102
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:54,959
don't chase the past or long for the future so when the Buddha uh after he gave this

103
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:01,140
poem in one of the sutos where it appears and he then gives an explanation of what it means

104
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:06,480
and I want to explain that to you if I can but I would like to do it first with

105
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,779
a an analogy many years ago I read of a study

106
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:18,959
where some psychologists took um a

107
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:24,779
an actor and to give a talk at some significant

108
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:31,019
conference and um and after that actor gave this

109
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:37,200
talk they would interview the people coming out into the lobby how was that how was that what did you think of that

110
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,920
talk and um and uh people would say that was really great it was wonderful the best

111
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,560
things happening at the conference the thing was that the script that the

112
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,779
actor had been given to read or to present to the conference was nonsense

113
00:11:54,779 --> 00:12:01,200
it it didn't make any sense and so there was something about the

114
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,680
actor's delivery something about the actor that led people to believe that there was

115
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,860
something significant here being told the article I read about it didn't say

116
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:21,540
too much about the actor but one of the things I I imagined it wouldn't be surprised the actor was probably a tall

117
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:28,399
white middle-aged man a kind of a certain kind of person that tends to be given a lot of authority

118
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:34,260
automatically when they show up unfortunately people like me maybe sometimes

119
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:40,140
and and so uh and perhaps the person had a

120
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:47,519
great melodious voice it was really enjoyable to listen to them and could speak with great confidence as an actor

121
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:54,660
right like they really knew what they were talking about and I imagine maybe that I could imagine for example that maybe they dropped

122
00:12:54,660 --> 00:13:00,180
certain words got repeated maybe the word peace got repeated

123
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:07,200
and but the sentence didn't make any sense but people hear the word peace and so they were in my whole piece oh yeah

124
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,800
peace oh yeah peace and they'd be reminded and then when they left they thought that's what they were left with this guy talked about peace I'm so glad

125
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:21,000
people did it there's so much conflict and um and uh so in this scenario

126
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:28,800
the audience some of the audience are making certain things up first uh they're making things up based

127
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:36,420
on appearance appearance of who the person is based on their voice their sound and that's just

128
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:41,820
what's being approached and they're making something up it maybe the

129
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:48,660
researchers wanted people to make it up I don't know you know but still the audience was actively involved by their

130
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:55,079
own background and predispositions making up some idea of who this person was this is an authoritative person

131
00:13:55,079 --> 00:14:01,260
speaking authoritatively uh they were also making up that it was pleasant

132
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:06,720
enjoyable maybe because of this style of delivery maybe the person was animated

133
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,120
in a wonderful way maybe the voice was really Pleasant to listen to and so they

134
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:18,779
were making up this idea this is a really Pleasant event to be here I really enjoy being here

135
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:25,500
was the enjoyment really there or how much were we responsible for the creation of it

136
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,540
they had Concepts the made-up Concepts so this person knows what he's talking

137
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:37,920
about this is a great talk and they were making up these Concepts that they were then living in

138
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:46,019
they also were making up all kinds of reactions and inner things in their mind they were constructing universes of

139
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:54,420
um you know you know I'm so wonderful I came out on time to the conference I paid my my lots of money for it this is

140
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:00,300
a great thing I can't wait until I go you know I don't know what you know we're making up a whole story a little

141
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:05,880
Universe of what it means to be there and and how wonderful it is and

142
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:12,560
and then probably the knowing of it the knowing all this also felt really good wow I'm in the know now

143
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:19,860
my first zen teacher had this way of talking about uh where's zen zen fit

144
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:26,160
into current event world of current events and he was you know friends with the

145
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:34,399
governor and different people in Washington and and famous people and so we were given this feeling as he spoke

146
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:41,100
that our practicing Zen was on the Forefront of our culture

147
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:47,220
and it was so good to know this to be part of this so that was kind of you know it was rather unfortunate it was actually not

148
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:52,560
so helpful for um for our sen students to be caught in the

149
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:59,399
grip of this kind of thing that being created so these people the audience was

150
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:07,560
creating something so I hope you appreciate that and um so we our minds are creative our

151
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:13,500
minds have an amazing capacity to make things up and in fact it needs to it's doing it

152
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:20,760
all the time and generally it's predictive ability to create images and ideas and

153
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:28,620
is relatively good otherwise you wouldn't have made it here today you do just enough to find here

154
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:35,399
but but sometimes how we create things gets in the way and causes US problems

155
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:42,600
so then this is how the Buddha ex it didn't no did what I didn't know the study but what he said in explaining

156
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:49,139
this that the chase that um chasing the past

157
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:54,480
what that means is some translators translators Reviving The Past

158
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:01,019
what it means is that the idea of of making up ideas

159
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:07,079
of who we were in the past making up the appearances that we had

160
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:15,240
making up um you know I've seen the lives I've reviewed my life in my old age now I now

161
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:22,079
will make up new ideas of what I was like in the past you know it I mean sometimes I tell

162
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:29,640
myself well now I know better now I recognize who I was a long time ago but do I really you know it's kind of still

163
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:38,160
kind of an appearance and making up an appearance somehow and um and then making up Sensations

164
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:45,360
you know things in the past that were unpleasant at the time now I'm go back look back I'm grateful for and there and

165
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,880
I see them as a pleasant event or opposite happens something that was a

166
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,059
pleasant now is seen as unpleasant so this idea of you know we were constructing the past the concepts we

167
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:02,820
have about the past changes and we make up new ideas new concepts of it the fish

168
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:09,600
gets bigger by the telling right the new concepts of the fish they say and then our reactions and the story

169
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:16,799
making mind that we live in changes over time of the past and then our sense of knowing and now

170
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:23,059
with the quality of knowing that happens as we know the past so the Buddha specified these five different areas

171
00:18:23,059 --> 00:18:30,000
that people make things up and so not chasing the past is in is

172
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,760
means don't make things up about yourself in the past this way

173
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,100
and longing for the future it's the same thing about the future don't make things

174
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:48,299
up about yourself about the future because you'll get in trouble for it that's how you get we have a lot of

175
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:54,600
suffering can come from some fixed idea this is who I am

176
00:18:54,600 --> 00:19:00,900
I'm this way I'm supposed to be its way I should be this way this is happening to me I'm a victim to

177
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:07,440
all this you know or I'm asserting myself I'm supposed to have I deserve things or there's a complicated world of

178
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:13,919
self that we create part of the function of mindfulness is to take a good look at and see to

179
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:20,340
discover to really understand how it's working and then here in the text it goes on and

180
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:27,900
says clearly see phenomena anywhere they appear so what this means is there's a stay in

181
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:33,720
the present moment enough that you see what's happening as it's occurring

182
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:39,960
the constant flow and change oftentimes we live retrospectively

183
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:45,299
or you know in the present moment like something happens and then we spend a little while thinking about it

184
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:52,320
uh there's not a few times that I've noticed that someone is talking and um

185
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:58,020
and uh I'm beginning to thinking about something and I realized I don't I didn't hear what they were saying for a

186
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:04,620
while because and it happens the most for me occasionally I hope

187
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:11,220
um when I'm on um on Zoom especially with the group of people you

188
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:17,280
know somehow I think about something I've gotten distracted or something's happened and I'm in my world of thinking

189
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:24,960
and um and so I'm not there as it's occurring maybe someone said something and I found myself reflecting on it and

190
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,960
I'm in the now I'm lingering in the past but this ability to really stay here in

191
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,720
the present moment is um is where we see Insight that's the

192
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:44,100
kind of the key thing about this to be pasna practice we do is to not just see what's happening not to see what's here

193
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:50,820
but to see it as it's happening and you can't see it as it's happening

194
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:56,760
if we're living in the constructs the Mind makes the concepts it lives in

195
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:02,520
if you see a river going by and you just think that's a river

196
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:09,240
and you live in the concept of the river you might not notice what the river is is constantly flowing

197
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:16,380
you can kind of get into your head oh that's a river maybe I should go swimming in it I didn't bring a bathing suit I don't have a bathing suit where

198
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:22,140
am I going to get a bathing suit it'd be great to go in the river yeah I bet it's nice and comfortable I love swimming I'm

199
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:29,220
such a great swimmer and and we're living in a world of that we're making up in a sense and of thought and we've

200
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:35,820
lose touch with the actual experience of the river we're relating to it but now it's relating through the conceptual

201
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:42,780
mind the story making mind and so but to really be in the experience of the river what you'll see

202
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:48,840
is the river is constantly flowing and that's a very different way of experiencing a river than all the

203
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:56,159
stories we're making up around it and we're doing vipassana that's where we kind of want to try to rest in uh

204
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,980
especially meditation is in the as thing occur as things are happening this is

205
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:07,620
where we have insight so then the Buddha goes on and he says in the poem

206
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:15,600
um not faltering and not agitated knowing this developed the mind

207
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:22,200
so this is not just simply to be in the present moment for the presence moment's sake but that we're actually learning to

208
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:30,299
develop ourselves to become a stronger mind clear mind uh more centered mind more receptive

209
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:36,840
mind there's all kinds of ways the mind gets developed and as it does so the qualitative way in

210
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:42,740
which we can live our life now be attentive and be present changes

211
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:49,260
so that as the quality of the Mind increases then we're able to move closer

212
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:54,480
and closer to a time when we know what to let go of so we can be at peace in

213
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,539
this world in the moment as it's current occurring even if it's our last day and last

214
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:07,260
minutes of life we know how to be peaceful we know this is what's possible

215
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:13,980
and to the Buddha in its explanation of this text then he explains what he means by not faltering

216
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:22,559
and um and to not falter and is is as things

217
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,960
are occurring in the present moment uh we don't

218
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:36,059
um make a self in relationship to it so as for example things appear

219
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:41,880
or our appearances are there it's a sense to say Sensations are there our thoughts are there

220
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:48,840
um I saw that in my mind whereas I was meditating today where you know I sat down to meditate and um and I could see

221
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,940
for a while the first I don't know a few minutes I could see that I was teetering

222
00:23:53,940 --> 00:24:01,320
back and forth between being my thoughts and knowing that I was thinking

223
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:06,360
and I could easily slip back into just being my thoughts so in a sense I am my

224
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:12,840
thinking because that that's where kind of was a living and then as I was settling I could see you know you know I

225
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:18,240
could know that my mind was thinking I was thinking I was like kind of like I was like kind of like the image I had

226
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:24,600
was I was kind of looking up into my mind saying the mind is thinking a lot and that was a much better place to be

227
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,880
that was kind of interesting oh I might just look at that it's like this you know the radio is on

228
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:35,700
as opposed to getting swept into the the radio and kind of believing I'm the I

229
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:43,620
don't know what I'm the I'm the thoughts and so uh so you can believe uh you're

230
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:50,340
forgive your thinking you know I am my thoughts you can believe the thoughts are part of

231
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:57,419
me thoughts are in me uh the uh

232
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:04,500
um the thought you know there's all these ideas senses of self we create in relationship to our thoughts to our

233
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:10,860
feelings to our perceptions to our thought ideas to our con being conscious

234
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:15,900
and again it's a made-up mind it's the constructive creative mind and for the

235
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:24,840
Buddha this idea that we create a self an identity around it is different than having an identity

236
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:30,179
so you know some of us have identities which are obvious to some of us these to

237
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:36,720
ourselves and that we kind of need to have it uh you know we could find certain parts of the world we need to

238
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,299
kind of behave accordingly according to our identity some some are role identities

239
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:47,700
some are gender identities it used to be they had male and female bathrooms

240
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:54,179
and um and Once Upon a Time by mistake I went into the women's bathroom

241
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:59,279
this was not a good thing and no one saw me but I realized when I

242
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:05,100
walked out that uh oh I could have gotten big trouble for this

243
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:11,400
so you're supposed to kind of behave you know know certain things about the identity but so so some of them were

244
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,639
born with in all kinds of ways but some of it is made up

245
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:24,299
um so if my I'm you know an identity it kind of have especially sitting here giving a Dharma talk is um I'm a

246
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:30,600
Buddhist teacher so it's okay I think you're you're kind of going along with it so it's okay for

247
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:39,020
now it has a it has a purpose but when I go home

248
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:44,100
and my wife and my kids guess what identity is no longer

249
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:49,980
relevant Once Upon A May 25 years ago when I

250
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:55,679
started teach I came home to my wife we were talking and she stopped me and said Gil

251
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:01,260
you're using that voice I was using the teacher voice for her

252
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:07,740
you know that's not the place to be a teacher right so so sometimes you get in trouble we have these identities but we use them

253
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:15,179
inappropriately we hold on to them we get attached to them some identities are are value judgments I'm a lousy person

254
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:20,340
I'm a bad person I'm a right good person I'm the best person I'm this kind of

255
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:27,600
person you know and so we live in these values of ourselves and some people it's tremendously heavy the weight they carry

256
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:33,779
the negative identities they're holding for themselves you know I'm

257
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:39,360
uh I mean for me you know some of you heard this before when I was in my 20s I

258
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:47,700
thought that the Gill was short for guilt and because uh I I I I didn't have to do

259
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:53,580
anything to be guilty I just was and if I did something then I was guilty but I didn't you know like I

260
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:59,279
remember seeing it really clearly this is where I it was by doing meditation practice that I saw it so clearly

261
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:06,480
uh because I was walking across a meditation hall floor when people are meditating and just walking across the

262
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,820
floor I was guilty I mean what am I guilty for I'm not just walking you know but it was

263
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:18,240
such a strong tendency of mine so the identity of being the guilty one was strong for me so I had taken on that

264
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,820
burden that kind of identity so for the Buddha not faltering

265
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:30,860
is not to take on make up and live in these made-up identities and be attached to them

266
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:37,080
the attachment itself is a problem the attachment to seeing how this works

267
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:42,840
to being in the present moment the moment moment seeing things that they occur seeing how attachments occur to

268
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:48,360
see the arising of a story The arising of a made-up idea

269
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:53,520
oh I hear it's occurring and this is one of the values of really being present as

270
00:28:53,520 --> 00:29:00,720
things are occurring is you have a better chance to notice when we start making up stories making up identities

271
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,960
making up these things that we're living in and then we can put a question mark next to it is this really useful is this

272
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:13,559
true maybe I don't need to do this so you're just trading one attachment

273
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:18,899
for another a painful one that's painful for you and sometimes for others for an

274
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:27,240
attachment which is the opposite is one's beneficial develops the mind not faltering not getting hung up not

275
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:33,600
agitated identity that we make up trips people up

276
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:39,299
it makes people agitated and you can see it a little bit some of

277
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:44,360
us some of you may be um if uh

278
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:51,720
if people either praise you or condemn you

279
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:59,880
I bet you either falter or get agitated if you get praise the agitation is kind of a good agitation feels good wow

280
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:05,039
I mean if they criticize you it's like a bad agitation or you're faltering you know

281
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:11,640
now that I have this now that I'm so great I have to keep it up and then we're tripped after each we

282
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:17,340
tripped up or something so uh so this power of this mindfulness

283
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:23,640
practice is that of cutting through the ways we get caught

284
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:29,940
in identity and Concepts in this made-up world that's actually much bigger part

285
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:36,539
of our life than most people realize and so it is to develop the mind is to

286
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:42,000
have this clear capacity for insight that's clear ability to name and see and

287
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,860
see through it and and for what purpose so we can relax

288
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:55,340
deeply deep enough to experience a deep abiding sense of peace

289
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:02,760
ardently do what should be done today who knows death may come tomorrow

290
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:10,799
there's no bargaining with mortality and death's great Army since there's no bargaining no escaping

291
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:16,140
death for the Buddhist point of view this is what's worth doing

292
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:23,220
this moment this minute this time this day is when we have our lived life

293
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:28,500
live it fully but not greedily like live it fully to have you know

294
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:33,600
by going to Disneyland or something live it fully by waking up being a

295
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,760
really present for the lived moment the live moment is more exciting than

296
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:44,940
Disneyland whoever lives thus ardent

297
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:51,360
active day and night is says the peaceful Sage

298
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,820
one who has an auspicious day

299
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:03,600
so this is the ipasna anthem

300
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,760
if we know that the Buddha encourage people to memorize it maybe you'll

301
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:15,600
memorize it and um and um

302
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:21,659
so those are my my thoughts for today

303
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:27,320
so do you have any comments you'd like to make or any questions about this

304
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:38,898
or anything else

305
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:11,279
good morning um so this is a somewhat minor piece of what you were

306
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:17,220
talking about but you mentioned sometimes especially on Zoom

307
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:23,640
you're somebody's talking and then you're thinking about some reflecting on something else that

308
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:28,980
they said or whatever it is getting distracted by some thoughts

309
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:35,880
and I just wonder in those situations

310
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:41,399
like sometimes is it skillful to just try to slow the conversation down to

311
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:49,380
because I noticed sometimes for me it's hard because maybe that reflection needed some time

312
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:54,899
to maybe it was an important reflection and then the conversation is just moving on and

313
00:33:54,899 --> 00:34:01,860
yeah does that make sense it makes a lot of sense and if you and uh for you to be tracking yourself well

314
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:09,240
enough to know what you need in order to participate in that conversation is a really important skill to have and

315
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:15,358
whether it's appropriate to ask for things to slow down or not for you depends whether it's one-on-one and

316
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:22,080
you're talking about something really important interpersonally that's completely good or I've been involved in

317
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:27,358
conversations where someone is moving on very quickly and I said we have to make

318
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:33,118
an important decision or something and I've explicitly asked sometimes can we slow down I need to track this much

319
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,580
better and can we go over this again or something can you can you repeat this what you said

320
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:43,919
so I think that's a a really useful skill when to do it and when to not do

321
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:49,260
it you know if it's a you know if it's uh you know that big

322
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:54,480
conference with a thousand people there um and uh and to ask the persons

323
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,119
presenting say it's not nonsense it's really good to ask them to slow down for your sake and you're one out of a

324
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:06,119
thousand people might be a disservice to everyone else makes the whole thing more difficult for everyone else so you have

325
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:12,660
to kind of you know understand the context situation but I love it that you're asking this and that's there are

326
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:19,500
times when that's really healthy okay good

327
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:25,500
good and then hopefully the people you're with appreciate that because you know that's part of the context you say

328
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:31,800
you know can you can we slow down and that person doesn't have the ability for that or it doesn't somehow or

329
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:38,640
takes it too personally like they've done something wrong and it just makes the whole situation more difficult than it had to be so it's understanding

330
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:46,020
context is such an important part of living a wise life yeah I mean I think maybe one more piece

331
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:51,060
that I'm reflecting on is maybe sometimes I need to

332
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:58,619
take care of it in some way like write down a quick note or something about an Insight that I had so that I

333
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:04,440
can not keep churning on it and then be able to return to what's happening now

334
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:10,859
because it's not the appropriate time yeah yeah I've been some things I've done a

335
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:18,960
few things to help me be present sometimes I have taken notes as I listen if there's a long presentation because I

336
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:25,980
take notes I don't need I don't really need to take notes but by taking notes I stay present and more actively and I'm not less likely to wander off

337
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:33,480
and the other thing I do is I make sure I sit straight on Zoom if because if I kind of relax

338
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:39,240
and sit back I'm more likely to my mind's more likely not to be present fully for the

339
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,800
experience to track it

340
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:03,720
hi thank you for the talk somehow I find it though um a little bit remote from

341
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:09,300
the realities if we're living in this paradise where everybody is peaceful and

342
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:14,520
you know there's no problems no protest no nothing like this so it feels a

343
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:21,240
little bit um theoretical perhaps and makes me wonder like have you ever

344
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:27,060
participated in any sort of protest in what protest like protesting against

345
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:32,640
something yeah and how would that go and I guess I would like to hear some side

346
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:39,300
of some some sort of like example of how to do more of a peaceful protest perhaps

347
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:46,380
like you know the world is full of problems and we do not live in the like you know Paradise so to speak do you

348
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:53,460
understand what I'm saying yeah very much so but um I think that uh what it's inspired to do is to kind of put it back

349
00:37:53,460 --> 00:38:00,300
on you that um you're not if if you think we live in Paradise here in Silicon Valley uh

350
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:05,940
you're not looking uh that's not what I'm saying I'm saying the opposite actually listening to this

351
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:12,540
poem yeah it's great I mean it feels to me that it would be great to follow this

352
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:20,520
poem If we were living in Paradise but unfortunately we're not living in paradise and thus this prioritizing this

353
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:28,560
peaceful being and stuff like that that just seems to be like like some sort of some sort of fairy tale I guess do you

354
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:36,420
see what I'm saying I understand what you're saying but I don't I don't see the logic of it because in my logic that if you can do

355
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:42,359
this if you can try if you could really be present enough to watch how you construct your reality your life

356
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:48,300
then you can be peaceful in the middle of conflict you can then you can you're much better

357
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:54,060
positioned to be able to do things wisely when things are really difficult and challenging it's the people who

358
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:59,700
don't know themselves well and don't can't track their reactions their responses internally who when there's

359
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:05,940
conflict and difficulty even if they go through a protest they're peaceful for a while but then that someone kind of

360
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:12,780
yells you know you're crazy protesting and they're before they know it they're punching the person out they've they're

361
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:19,920
certainly reactive so I think that this here is a recipe for responsible engagement in the world

362
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:27,420
and the challenges and I'm you know I'm staking my life not on the making people kind of uh you know

363
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:32,579
in some kind of retired Enlightenment that they just sit and stay home and do

364
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:38,300
Wordle [Laughter]

365
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:46,980
but I want you know I want this practice to be one that makes people change agents for for a peaceful world

366
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:53,220
okay and right here in Silicon Valley I mean there's a there's like a fifth of the people here in Silicon Valley are

367
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:59,940
hungry that's a big that's a very high percentage go visit Second Harvest

368
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:06,599
they're they're one of the premiere organizations here that are non-profit that's uh trying to bring food to the

369
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:13,500
hungry and there's a huge population of people who they're feeding so it's right here

370
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:20,160
close by thank you do you have time for one more thought

371
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:27,420
yeah um I I get what you were saying I thought that was an astute observation

372
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:35,280
um about the practicality of this this very um wise uh poem and it just dawned on me

373
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:41,940
there's a real world example um that's been unfolding globally right for the past I don't know

374
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:49,619
nine months it's and I appreciate what you were saying Gil about us being creative beings we

375
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:57,720
are talking a recession into existence why right maybe we should be talking

376
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:03,300
something else into existence but it's becoming well I don't believe it but

377
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:09,180
others believe it's a self-fulfilling prophecy a recession is coming a recession is coming why don't we all

378
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:15,180
collectively try to think of the opposite or maybe think of nothing and then see what happens

379
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:21,420
so I just found this to be very timely yeah yeah poem that you've shared yeah there's so many things that we actually

380
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:30,599
think into existence that much more than people realize that you know we live some things are uh are

381
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:37,619
a self-fulfilling prophecies and so if we believe certain things then we everything organizes around that and

382
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:44,099
so it becomes true and um and I've known people who I've seen who

383
00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:50,220
are aversive people and very angry and so and they have this idea that everyone

384
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:57,060
else is out to get them everyone else is mean but so they could but they're more angry but then when they go someplace they

385
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:02,460
have this this atmosphere of anger around them and then people are treating

386
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:08,760
them unkindly and so it's fulfilling the very things that they're afraid of or they want so so the power of this

387
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:14,099
creative mind is quite something so this practice of you know clearly see

388
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:20,400
phenomena anywhere they appear it's really the present phenomena means as your experiences are happening as your

389
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:26,640
inner life gets born to really see it clearly is such a relief it's so needed

390
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:33,119
for our society um you know it's a you know I've put a tremendous amount of Hope in having

391
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:37,519
people become healthy in this way

392
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:45,480
great so may you have an auspicious day laughs

393
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:50,940
thank you very much and if you want to stay around a little

394
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:56,880
bit and say hello to each other maybe you can say hello to the person next to you and then say goodbye or

395
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,920
but it's nice to have a little bit of community
