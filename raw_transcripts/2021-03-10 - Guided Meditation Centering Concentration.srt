1
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,840
so good day to everyone and here in redwood city there's a light

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,240
rain it brings me much

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:23,439
both joy and a kind of intimacy of uh just with life and wonderful times

4
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,759
and

5
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:36,719
so here we are to sit here and you're here

6
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:44,719
everyone has their own here and in some ways for each of us to say here

7
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:51,039
is uh is something we say in common and also is unique to each of us because

8
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:59,840
of the different location that's here for us different place that we sit or meditate

9
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:08,240
and in part of meditation practice is on this anapanasati is

10
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:15,840
gathering ourselves together here and as the practice develops

11
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,960
there is an emphasis on concentration an english word which doesn't really do

12
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:30,159
justice to the pali words that are sometimes translated as concentration or

13
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,360
concentrating and um but the word samadhi the one

14
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:43,680
one one associated word is a uh yeah and it's a

15
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:51,520
word that sometimes is translated as a one-pointedness but uh if it's one pointedness

16
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:59,200
it's kind of like the um it use an ancient analogy of um of a

17
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,479
um all the rafters of a small hut that maybe started more or

18
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,959
less a round hut they all come together up into the point of the singular point to the top of the

19
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:18,480
roof and and so everything gathers everything points everything reaches for that point

20
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,720
and that point in a sense if it's a circular building is that if you look from above it's at

21
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,360
the center of it all and everything else radiates towards or comes towards it i guess

22
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:38,160
and so everything moves towards the singular focus but

23
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,480
focus suggests in english too much that a strain and a duality between us

24
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:51,200
and what's what we're focusing on and laser focus or something and rather i think of it more if you use

25
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,879
rather than a hut you know the root roof but just a circle concentric circle

26
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:04,239
and and the the the center of it is where

27
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:10,239
the mind everything is focusing everything is gathering everything is circling around and it's

28
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:16,879
all included in these concentric circles of our lives body emotions thoughts

29
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:23,680
mind everything is somehow included but everything is gathered to this

30
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,959
around the center so sometimes we say in english around

31
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,799
meditation practice to be centered and so we're centering ourselves here

32
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:43,120
with everything included but resting at the center and so one of the

33
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,879
ancient techniques for centering ourselves and really kind of being gathering ourselves and everything kind

34
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,640
of coming in around something developing concentration

35
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,560
is counting the breath and i suggest we do that for the sitting

36
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,879
and the way that i was taught which i did for i still do sometimes is to

37
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:13,680
count the exhale and and then the next exhale gets the next count so 1 two

38
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,759
three up to five up to ten and at ten start over again be

39
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:26,840
completely relaxed about not forgetting losing count or getting

40
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,240
distracted at the first opportunity just begin again at one it doesn't matter if you only get to two

41
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,639
or even in just two gets to one before you lose count start again at one and

42
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,479
one teacher one person i knew who practiced in japan his and teacher taught them to count up

43
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:50,639
to one and then over again and um and uh and then kind of

44
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:58,000
but don't just make a count a little voice in the mind that counts but rather

45
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,880
uh see if the whole mind the whole being can somehow one like all of you is

46
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,919
included like if maybe if you were singing or something and you

47
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:15,440
all of you is included in the singing one it's kind of like really there the

48
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,479
exhale and with the release of the exhale kind of settling and gathering together

49
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:26,800
and the complexity of counting up to 10 requires a little extra attention to keep count that makes

50
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,240
a little protection from wandering off too easily into thought and you're more likely to catch yourself

51
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,280
thinking perhaps you notice you're not you've lost the count because you have this very clear

52
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:45,120
kind of task but the main thing to do is just gathering together this the whole mind settles and lands

53
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,560
landing on the center and the center is the place where you most experience

54
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,759
the breathing so the belly or the chest or the nostrils or whatever

55
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:06,240
just gathering settling one so taking a posture for meditation

56
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:13,680
where you can somehow begin centering yourself

57
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:21,120
in your body and centering yourself

58
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,800
around where you're going to experience your breathing

59
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,638
the inhales and the exhales

60
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,520
the predominant place to experience breathing and then from this predominant place

61
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:46,319
the center of it all take a few long slow deep breaths

62
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,599
and this as we do this the exhale

63
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,000
use that to really settle in let go

64
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:08,400
release yourself into the body that's breathing into the place where breathing is felt

65
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,840
deep breath in and exhale relaxing the

66
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,840
shoulders

67
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,280
softening the belly

68
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,840
releasing

69
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,919
the tensions in the face

70
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,280
and then letting your breathing return to normal

71
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:13,039
and familiarize yourself to with that part of your body where your

72
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:19,919
feel your breathing and imagine that that's at the center of

73
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:29,280
it all center of the universe and that as you breathe from that place

74
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:38,080
awareness spreads outwards throughout your body and maybe even beyond and as you exhale

75
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,839
awareness settles back in to that

76
00:08:51,680 --> 00:09:01,519
and then with a very soft quiet voice

77
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:08,080
but with a voice that includes

78
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,160
all your being on the exhale

79
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:23,839
use the count one

80
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:37,839
and if you want you can just do one each time as if each breath is complete in itself

81
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,640
or you could keep it simple or simple enough and just count to three

82
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:51,839
and then start over again

83
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:02,839
and if that works well you might count to 10 and if you get to

84
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,440
10 you could

85
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,640
start again and while they want to try to keep the

86
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,920
count the important part is the settling in

87
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,720
to the center

88
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:33,600
relaxing any centrifugal force out into outwards into thought into feelings

89
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,759
that takes you away from being centered on the breathing

90
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:47,120
not fighting anything or resisting anything just not giving it attention

91
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,040
not getting involved where attention goes where your

92
00:10:53,040 --> 00:11:00,800
involvement goes is following the count

93
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:07,519
in centering yourself here in the breathing inviting all of who you

94
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,720
are to be included

95
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,920
so the count is not just a little word in the mind

96
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:26,079
but it's an expression of your whole being willingly fully here

97
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:43,839
quietly here with the breathing

98
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:33,040
as you do the count spread out the pronunciation of the

99
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:41,440
count long count one in such a way that maybe it begins

100
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,920
quieting the rest of the thinking mind

101
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:55,839
like you're gathering yourself around to say something intimate and soft and

102
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:03,839
warm-hearted and as you do this soft one

103
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,839
center your body on the breathing

104
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:23,839
land fully with your whole being on the experience of breathing

105
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:05,200
giving yourself over to the counting and experiencing breathing

106
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:14,320
as if it's the only thing to be done for the next minutes

107
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:23,840
letting go of your thoughts accept account

108
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,278
and then in the last couple of minutes of this sitting

109
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:56,880
to let go of the counting and just sit here with the breathing

110
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,400
enter into the breathing center yourself on the breathing without

111
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:08,000
the counting and see if you're a little bit more

112
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,840
centered and connected

113
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:31,679
and then at the end of the sitting to remain as centered as you can

114
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:39,039
centered inside of yourself rooted in your weight of your body and

115
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:45,840
the weight of your attention into the center of breathing

116
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:53,440
a place of balance where you're not easily pushed around or

117
00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:01,120
caught up in things and being so centered

118
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:07,279
now open your awareness up to the world around you

119
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:15,120
to the communities that extend out from where you are neighbors and townspeople and

120
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,200
people in your county your province

121
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,480
outwards into the world

122
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:33,919
open yourself up to consider the people you might run into today or communicate with today

123
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:42,240
and from a centered place where maybe nothing has to happen

124
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:48,799
at least for now sitting here no responsibilities for them no

125
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:56,320
requirements obligations just as centered experience

126
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:02,000
that includes other people awareness of them thinking of them

127
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,159
imagining them

128
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:13,600
and in this kind of way of not being obligated or

129
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:22,000
not being required to do anything or react or talk to them to open your

130
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,880
heart to evoke your good will

131
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,679
your basic capacity for friendliness

132
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:40,240
care kindness and love

133
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,279
maybe that's related to a tenderness

134
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:55,520
within to whatever degree that you could have this good will for others

135
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:03,919
feel how it maybe also is rooted in your centeredness in your calm

136
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,039
or your concentration

137
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:17,679
and then imagine that it radiates out from you as a warmth as a light

138
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:26,960
as a care may all beings be happy

139
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,840
may all beings be safe

140
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,960
may all beings be peaceful

141
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:48,559
may all beings be free

142
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:58,840
and may we appreciate how being centered and balanced and

143
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:06,960
non-reactive supports this possibility for the world

144
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:14,960
may our practice be for the welfare and happiness of all the people we encounter

145
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:29,840
communicate with today may the world benefit from our meditation together

146
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,919
[Music] you
