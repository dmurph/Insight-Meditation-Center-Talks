1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:09,480
good evening welcome welcome nice to see you

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:16,640
all it's so great to practice together I don't know I I hope it's nice for you guys too that we're just sitting

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,920
together there's something really uh beautiful about

4
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:30,400
it so I just tonight I wanted to talk about sometimes there can be a Feeling

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:37,559
of we're just kind of stuck like maybe we don't have a sense

6
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:43,600
of that we're really going anywhere maybe we don't even have a sense that we

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,600
should be going anywhere but uh we have this feeling of okay maybe we are

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:56,120
meditating regularly but there's not a feeling of

9
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:03,719
Vitality or movement or juiciness or r nness maybe there's a sense of dryness

10
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:12,400
about it or maybe there's this feeling that just for not like going anywhere I know

11
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,439
that there was a I often am keeping a notebook of some

12
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,280
of my ideas and that kind of help inform my drama talks but also my practice and

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,799
uh there was a time when I looked at this uh notebook this is some time ago

14
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:36,000
and I realized really I was thinking and worrying about that years ago also and

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,759
here I am you know so there can be this way in which we feel like H there's not

16
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,600
not much uh happening and then if we there's this

17
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:55,759
way in which if we look at it carefully we can often notice there's this slight

18
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,680
disconnection there's this slight separation from our our actual

19
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,239
experience instead we're lost in our thoughts lost in Concepts lost in ideas

20
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,280
lost in speculation we think we're meditating and we think we're practicing just like

21
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,000
we have before but there's often it's because there's something we want to

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,879
avoid so we disconnect just a little bit and that just that little bit is a way

23
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:31,080
in which we just end up spinning in our mind and not really going anywhere we're

24
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,120
not connected to what's actually happening in the present moment it's more we're thinking about the present

25
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:45,360
moment or thinking about the practice and what I'm pointing to here is a subtle difference it can be easy to not

26
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,720
recognize it but maybe one way to a clue

27
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,400
can be the role that words have if there's a lot of words whether there're

28
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,519
sentences chapters or novels there's a a way that the ner the

29
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,799
words can take us away from the experience feeling the pressure against

30
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:13,519
the body from the cushion feeling the temperature of the air feeling the tension in the shoulders you know

31
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:20,640
whatever it is that uh might be experienced and there's this way that

32
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:28,760
sometimes it's not all the time but sometimes what I'm describing could uh fall under the hindrance that we call

33
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:34,360
vcha doubt doubt is this way in which there's

34
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:41,680
this uh vacillation there's is the mind is kind of spinning there this not quite

35
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:49,200
engaged it's not that we're completely absent but we're not completely engaged

36
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,439
either maybe there's this where we have some reservations or as I said we're

37
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:59,480
trying to not feel something but in order to make sure we don't feel that we

38
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:06,239
don't feel anything else either or just have this indecisiveness or maybe a

39
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,720
sense of Suspicion like this isn't quite right or I shouldn't be doing this or I

40
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:21,359
can't do this or you know something like this kind of things that have that flavor of not being sure not uh kind of

41
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:28,360
like committed and um in with the practice with this way in which we're

42
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:34,240
hesitating and so so and I'm actually I'll say that if we do pay attention we

43
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,880
might see that there's this family of or a loose collection of thoughts as that's

44
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,759
often is what's uh being experienced there's a kind of like a certain

45
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:53,919
direction or family of or orientation that's uh happening in the

46
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:01,440
mind and there's often when um I'm teaching about doubt it's some of you might know it's uh one of the five

47
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,560
hindrances one of recognized I mean thousands of years ago the Buddha talked about this as something that can get in

48
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,199
the way um when I've talked about this before I've talked about that an

49
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:20,280
antidote a way to work with this is investigation to kind of like roll up our sleeves and get in like what's

50
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,600
actually being experienced or what am I unsure about

51
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,840
what questions do I have and try to like nail them down

52
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:37,960
but sometimes this whole idea of Investigation turns out not to be so helpful sometimes it's great and exactly

53
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:43,240
what's needed and can help um provide the traction that's needed to have a

54
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:49,720
sense of a vitality and juiciness and aliveness in our

55
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:56,520
practice but sometimes investigation can just lead to more thinking and we could

56
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:02,919
say that more thinking was the problem to begin with and then we say oh just investigate and that gets interpreted as

57
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:09,280
thinking and then we're just thinking is upon thinking and we're just

58
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,800
thinking instead of like uh really get engaged so I'd like to offer something

59
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,960
tonight that is a little bit maybe more specific or something that

60
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:28,840
um can maybe provide some direction of how to gain traction when we feel like

61
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:35,440
we're stuck or a little bit disengaged or I'm not sure exactly what the words are to

62
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,840
describe it and this is

63
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,240
um maybe I can summarize it in the like really high level is to bring in this

64
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:55,599
notion which is called s is the word in poly has a really clunky English

65
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,680
translation it's called clear comprehension

66
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:06,720
I guess it's you know it's good enough the ja is related to jity which

67
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:13,960
is knowing p is like really knowing and some p is

68
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:20,680
uh kind like knowing it's Al we'll just say really knowing so clear

69
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:26,759
comprehension this how it often gets uh translated and it's very similar to

70
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:33,479
mindfulness and often can be synonymous so in the Su some of you

71
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:39,759
might be familiar with this they talk about Sati s so mindfulness and clear

72
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:46,720
comprehension but when you really look in the suit does it's really difficult to tease them apart like what exactly is

73
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:54,440
the difference however uh maybe like 800 years after

74
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,800
the Buddha or the death of the Buddha there was a some people who are were

75
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:08,039
writing commentaries you know like interpreting the teachings of the Buddha and they wrote you know just a

76
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:16,400
tremendous amount and they were like defining the terms and providing the backstory for uh

77
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:23,120
some of the characters that are in some of the stories and something like this and in these commentaries they flesh out

78
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:31,080
this idea of clear comprehension which I think could be useful in this uh scenario when we feel

79
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:38,120
like things aren't quite going just not going or don't have traction so in the

80
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:45,279
commentary so this is not the words of the Buddha but almost a thousand years later still that's quite some time ago

81
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:51,519
that's what 1500 more than 1500 years ago they um defined a clear

82
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:58,600
comprehension they put it into these four categories and I would like to unpack these as a little bit just as a way to

83
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:04,480
help us maybe get engaged so rather than just I'll just

84
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,320
introduce one category at a time so here the first one is just to have this

85
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,680
sensitivity or to tune in what is the purpose of what I'm

86
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:22,920
doing why am I doing this whatever it is you might be doing this is something you

87
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,640
could be doing in meditation but it also could be you know just in your daily

88
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,440
life but just to sometimes have this sense of like what because sometimes what we

89
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:40,519
think is the purpose isn't the purpose for example you find yourself standing

90
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:46,640
in front of the refrigerator with the door open now why am I what why am I here

91
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,680
with the the door open and you might say well because I wanted to open the door

92
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:57,279
of the refrigerator and so I did okay that's one answer but there could also

93
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:04,880
be well I don't want to feel loneliness so uh I'm just distracting Myself by

94
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:12,440
looking in the refrigerator I don't want to feel this sadness so I'm making a

95
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,760
snack I'm going to go to the grocery store later and I'm just going to take inventory of what we have and what we

96
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,839
don't have right so there's all these different reasons why we might or I'm

97
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:28,560
going to cook dinner for my family I love them I want to take care of them this is part of what I do right

98
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,800
there's so many reasons why we might open up the refrigerator this is just like one

99
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:39,680
example but there's this way in which if we're going there because we are trying

100
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,440
to avoid something else we're using it as a distraction then often we

101
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,160
won't really be tuned into to what we're doing there and so if we can ask

102
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,560
ourselves well what is my purpose here this can be a way in which we get

103
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:03,360
engaged and maybe we say because I want to distract myself because I feel

104
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:09,800
awful that is fantastic even to just to say because I feel awful like sometimes

105
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:17,480
even just to say it out loud and to recognize I feel awful I don't want to feel this and I want to distract

106
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,920
myself that is being with what's actually

107
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:29,000
happening wanting to distract this is good practice to just

108
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,079
be with what's happening wanting to distract is what's happening we're not

109
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:41,120
saying that you have to feel the terrible thing that will arise in its good time it'll get metabolized when

110
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:48,480
it's ready to get metabolized but to maybe could Fe just recognize yeah I I don't want to feel

111
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,079
sadness anymore I don't want to feel loneliness anymore I don't want to feel whatever it is I'm standing in front of

112
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,560
the refrigerator with the door open or another place in which we could

113
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:05,680
use this um idea of purpose is with our

114
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,519
speech with what we're saying we could have just this clear or sorry this quiet

115
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:17,600
in the background sense of why am I saying

116
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,440
this is it because um I want them to I want to impress this

117
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,360
person is it because I want them to like me

118
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,079
is it because I'm trying to help them I see that they're in some distress and it's making me uncomfortable and I don't

119
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:42,199
want to feel that so I'm just going to try to make them fix their problem so that I'm no longer distressed or maybe

120
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:47,959
I'm talking because I love them and I want to connect with them and care with

121
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:53,680
them or maybe there's this way that um we just find ourselves speaking

122
00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:00,800
impulsively and we don't even know why we're talking we're so this is a great way to get

123
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:09,399
connected with ourselves to ask you know to have some this query like why am I saying this this has uh been a practice

124
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:15,160
for that I've been doing for some time don't always remember but wow it's

125
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:22,600
really powerful really powerful to just notice that uh what are the things that

126
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:30,920
motivate our speech sometimes we just feel like we need some attention that's okay but can we maybe

127
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:37,279
just acknowledge yeah I'm feeling disconnected and so I'm talking to uh

128
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:44,160
connect with people or or to show how much I know but there's this way if we find

129
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:51,639
ourselves complaining or explaining there's often a way in which

130
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:57,880
that's also a way of avoiding just like standing in front of the refrigerator snacking if we're complaining and

131
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:04,079
explaining I think there's one other aing but I can't remember

132
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:09,279
it yeah it doesn't come to my mind right now but but if we find ourselves doing

133
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,519
that there's a way in which uh we're um

134
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,720
also feeling disconnected from ourselves and wanting to distract ourselves so we

135
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:27,759
could just ask why why am I saying this or maybe we can have um ask

136
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:35,320
ourselves this when we or sit down to meditate why am I meditating do I have a purpose in mind

137
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,560
for this even if it's the same answer every

138
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:47,720
time there's a way in which just asking the question why am I doing this what is the purpose here you might find because

139
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:56,000
I want to find more ease and freedom in my life because uh I believe that um more

140
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,360
calm and steadiness is available because I recognize that my day unfolds

141
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,600
differently if it includes meditation and even if you find that you're saying

142
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,440
the same thing again and again there's just this orientation towards why am I

143
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,480
doing this because there can be a way in which okay I'm doing this again because

144
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:25,399
I'm supposed to I'll put the timer on and I'll sit here and you know there's this way that we're just not really

145
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:31,680
showing up we're sitting on the cushion but we're not not really showing up but

146
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,560
we only have so much energy in this life only have so much time in this life and

147
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:44,600
it can be really helpful to to kind of like align with what's important what's important for us what is what do we want

148
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,959
to spend our life energy on what do we want to spend our time

149
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:55,040
on and then maybe I'll just say that pointing to this like Reflections or

150
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,600
these contemplations about is this aligning what is the purpose and is it

151
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:06,600
aligning with a purpose that I want maybe we find ourselves watching Netflix

152
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:13,240
and off a lot like is this uh what I want to do with my

153
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,199
life Netflix wants you

154
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,240
to so maybe these are types of questions maybe if when we're out for in a walk or

155
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,560
out for a walk or in the forest or outside and sometime it can be nice

156
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:37,240
sometimes to drop in some of these questions like what is important what are some of the things

157
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:43,440
that are important for me and what are some of the when are the things that I'm spending my time and energy with are

158
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,040
they aligned with them and then the second aspect of Clear

159
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,240
Com comprehension is this uh notion of uh

160
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:00,800
suitability we might say like is it is it the appropriate uh thing to be doing

161
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:09,240
or is it uh fit the situation is it the right response is it suitable what we're

162
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,640
doing whether this is on the cushion or in daily life or whatever we might find

163
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,720
ourselves is I mean the obvious or maybe I should say the maybe it's a cliche

164
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,480
this idea of um maybe trying to get water from a rock if you want water then

165
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,000
why are you going to the Rock and not pounding on it you should be pounding on a coconut or

166
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,320
cutting up an aloe vera or you know something like this or going to the stream of course you know these types of

167
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:44,760
things so how this might show up and I've seen this uh in meditation there

168
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:52,520
was a time when I was uh teaching what we call happy hour couple days a week it's still going on um 6:00 to 7:00 p.m.

169
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:58,280
it's online Monday through Friday and um for a few years I was

170
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:04,919
teaching this couple times a week uh just and it's loving kindness and compassion practices heart heart

171
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:12,559
practices and uh I would have like a um a little Q&A at the end and I was so

172
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:18,120
surprised how people were really sincerely wanting to cultivate the

173
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:23,760
warm-heartedness really wanted to cultivate some you know softness of the

174
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,840
heart and then the questions that they would ask they would be so mean to to

175
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:36,960
themselves I can't do this I'm a terrible meditator um something's wrong with me

176
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:44,039
there wouldd be this way in which they'd be so mean to themselves and not even recognize it like we're we're trying to

177
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:50,360
cultivate kindness and warmth and openness and yet they spent the whole time beating themselves

178
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:55,480
up it's easy to do this right especially if beating oneself up is a familiar

179
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:02,000
thing and we just think it's the normal way to be but there's this way in which it can be

180
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,520
really helpful just to ask is this uh suitable what we're trying to do the

181
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:15,360
way that we're approaching this whatever it is we'd like to do are we approaching

182
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:22,320
it in a way that's suitable for us and recognizing that all of us of course are individuals we have different strengths

183
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,760
and different life situations or in different seasons of Life different

184
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:35,400
energy levels different Health you know this is this is what it means to be a human is you know these change

185
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:41,400
throughout our life and we just ask ourselves giving given this the

186
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,720
circumstances of our life is the way that I'm approaching what I would like

187
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,120
to do suitable are we putting in the right

188
00:19:52,120 --> 00:20:00,120
amount of effort too much effort or not enough effort or something like this

189
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:08,640
because there's this way in which just even asking the question even if the answer isn't quite clear can be really

190
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:14,720
helpful it's a way to kind like get us engaged again with our life with our

191
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,400
meditation practice with whatever's

192
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:27,120
happening maybe I'll say that um you know Buddhist practice this movement

193
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:34,520
towards greater and greater PE Peace and Freedom and ease and well-being it's not a linear you know step one step two step

194
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:39,720
three step four I mean sometimes we teach it in certain steps but that's not

195
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:45,000
how it goes I mean nobody's life goes you know just in a straightway linear to

196
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,440
uh to perfect Enlightenment but there's always things

197
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:59,159
that need to be Revisited and maybe there's an domain of our practice which is really unfolding and Bloss boming but

198
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:06,600
maybe there's a domain in which we feel kind of like stuck maybe we have some of this doubt that shows up some of our uh

199
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:14,080
inner critic shows up and we find this revisiting this again and again and again but there can

200
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,200
also be times in which there's some real openness and spaciousness and ease and

201
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:25,640
we might be like cycling through that is so this suitability this question of

202
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:32,000
suitability doesn't mean that we have to say well I should be on step three now because I was on step two whatever step

203
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,200
three might be instead just this

204
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:42,799
recognition that given who we

205
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:51,080
are and the what we're the direction we're trying to go is it appropriate is our

206
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:57,760
response appropriate and then there's also having

207
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:03,480
said this there's also a way in which we can also recognize that trying to spend

208
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:10,000
time figuring out what is exactly is the what is the meaning of life what is my

209
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:17,919
purpose that's not what I'm pointing to here there can be some questions about

210
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:23,600
this like well what what is my purpose I'm not going to there isn't one

211
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,559
answer to this and if you're looking for one clearcut answer you may find

212
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:35,000
yourself swirling around looking for that or waiting for

213
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:43,000
that there can be a way in which we have some clarity and it feels like the answer is somehow to support others or

214
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,200
to be um a way in which to bring some more ease and wellbeing just into the

215
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:55,400
world but that gets expressed in so many different ways countless different

216
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:04,000
ways so I don't want to suggests that we have to like find this one meaning or

217
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,840
purpose so also this idea about suitability of course can get carried

218
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:17,240
into our daily life just in the same way that uh maybe it's the same family maybe

219
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:23,799
we're with the same group of people the same family members for example so maybe a very similar setting might even be in

220
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:29,440
the same location but what's suitable well if

221
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:37,520
we're having a remembrance or a funeral or honoring the death of somebody what's

222
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,200
suitable there is different might be the same people same location for a sweet 16

223
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,600
birthday party very different and so just for us to have some sensitivity

224
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:54,720
well what is what is like this moment asking for what is this

225
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:01,559
situation asking for and and that's an interesting way to put it what is it asking for as opposed

226
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:06,720
to what do I want if we're just going to always be pushed around by our

227
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,480
preferences what we like what we don't like then that's we're going to kind of often be spinning our wheels just

228
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:18,440
chasing chasing chasing chasing our preferences turns out they don't get

229
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:25,360
satisfied you might have noticed that there's this hedonic treadmill right that we're always just

230
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:32,080
looking for the next thing so the

231
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,559
suitability the third dimension of this clear comprehension that could help us

232
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:43,640
if we're feeling like stuck or not quite engaged in some kind of way is this idea

233
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:51,000
of the domain um the word in poly is

234
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,320
Goa and uh it literally means uh cow

235
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:03,120
walking cow walk so we can understand it like

236
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:10,320
pasture so we would say like domain so where where is it that uh like maybe we

237
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,399
could say cows hang out and are nourished and protected that we would

238
00:25:15,399 --> 00:25:20,559
say where are we nourished and protected what what what is our domain what is our

239
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:25,760
pasture where is a good place for us to hang out literally and figuratively but

240
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:32,440
figuratively the Buddha pointed to these found foundations of mindfulness that is uh bringing some

241
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:39,640
attention to the body uh feeling tone Fad in up mind

242
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:45,799
States chitt and I guess what we'll

243
00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:53,799
call D so the poly word is dhas but it's hard to translate that uh categories or

244
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:59,159
the types of things that are in the dhas is the five hindrances for no truths

245
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:06,799
seven factors of Awakening these are the type of things that are in that fourth category so of the recommendation of the

246
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:13,039
Buddha is the domain is to be with your experience between those four categories

247
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:18,440
will be all of your experiences the bodily experience and

248
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:23,640
the mental experience if we could divide it those two ways all of that gets

249
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:30,720
covered in these foundations of mindfulness so that the domain points

250
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,799
to just being with these channels of

251
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:40,840
experience whatever is being experienced doesn't mean it's uh what we want to

252
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:47,320
have happen or doesn't mean what we intended to doesn't mean that uh we might have sat down and said okay I'm

253
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:55,159
going to do mindfulness of the breathing suitable for I want to have some settledness and so that I can have

254
00:26:55,159 --> 00:27:01,919
some better well-being and then we discover we sit down and then our back is just killing us and then we discover

255
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:09,279
okay I'm not going to do mindfulness of breathing I'm going to be with this uncomfortable experience in my

256
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:14,440
back and then noticing how the mind is wanting to make lots of stories about

257
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:19,520
it so well that would be an example of just using kind of like the domain is

258
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:26,760
just being mindful of these I we could say these

259
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:31,960
uh four Avenues of mindfulness but maybe it's

260
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:38,559
easier to say what's not nourishing and that is just this mental proliferation

261
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:46,080
just the way that the mind can spin and spin this what I'm calling like doubt this hesitation this

262
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:53,559
vacillation that's not nourishing so instead to spend our energy our life energy and

263
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:58,720
our attention on what is nourishing

264
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:05,000
and then the last category of uh clear comprehension

265
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,760
s is non delusion I'm like but how does that

266
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:18,840
work when we're having delusion we don't know because we're diluted so there's this way in which we

267
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:25,600
could just say it's about being aware of our thoughts just having some awareness

268
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:32,559
of thoughts and not to get pushed around by them to recognize that sometimes when

269
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:40,080
we're going to go to a new place meet a new person be in a different situation or even if we've been to it

270
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:46,039
before we often are have we're fabricating a story about how it's going

271
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:52,799
to be or maybe we are rehearsing a conversation we're going to have with somebody that we're going to meet it's

272
00:28:52,799 --> 00:29:00,880
perfectly appropriate to plan but there's this way in which we are just cooking up this whole scenario 100% in

273
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,320
our heads and then when we get there right of course it never goes the way that we

274
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:11,760
thought it would never does am I allowed to say the word never there that's I I'd

275
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,960
be surprised I'd be surprised if it does never precisely the way we thought it

276
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:23,320
would so this non- delusion is to recognize oh this is just a story I have

277
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,399
about how it's going to go and to recognize the storess of the story

278
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:35,519
instead of thinking like oh yeah this is actually how it should go and then when things start to go differently start to

279
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:40,760
complain or uh feel frustrated because our expectations aren't being met or

280
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:48,200
something like this so This non- delusion is to recognize oh yeah I have a story about this I have these ideas

281
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:55,240
and it's just a story or maybe there's this way of that

282
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:01,000
we can look at our thoughts with some meditation practice we can the

283
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,760
mind can be settled and we can just notice when thoughts are arising and see them as like oh wow look at that instead

284
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:15,000
of getting lost in it and then we can reflect we didn't make that thought

285
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:21,320
arise we didn't do anything to make it arise we didn't control the content of

286
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:28,240
it we didn't control the duration of it we didn't control the thought that followed that thought these things are

287
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:35,440
just arising and there's this way with this recognition of how we aren't controlling

288
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,320
them there can be this well there's a way in which we're not that's not who we

289
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:47,519
are like it's these aren't you know inherent to who we are as individuals we

290
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:55,399
are not our thoughts even though so often we feel like we are there's a way in which we feel connected to them but

291
00:30:55,399 --> 00:31:01,080
just to notice how we we aren't doing anything to have them arise that can be

292
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:07,080
some non- delusion is to not take our thought so personally thinking that

293
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:16,000
we're making them happen or not making them happen or something like that so this idea of clear comprehension

294
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:23,200
purpose suitability domain and non delusion these are four different ways

295
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:30,039
four different levers maybe four different approaches that we can bring to our experience either on the cushion

296
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:37,960
or off the cushion as a way to help get re-engaged as a way to help us uh feel

297
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:43,399
like um bring some Lively uh some aliveness maybe some Vitality to our

298
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:49,120
practice and maybe undo some if there's any sense of stuckness and this

299
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:56,559
stuckness sometimes is in the form of doubt about 100% of the time but sometimes this sense of Doubt is H what

300
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:01,600
is the stuckness so maybe in this way there can be this

301
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:08,440
movement from stagnation to Clarity this movement

302
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:13,879
of maybe a stuckness to non

303
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:23,440
stuckness and with that I think I'll open it up and see if there's some questions or comments thank you

304
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:42,600
I remember when I played uh quarterback at Ma you know high school and at

305
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:48,960
throwing an interception and Son as the coach would leave me in the game and just said keep playing and it showed a

306
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:55,120
kind of faith in me you know as the quarterback right I'm wondering what role faith has in all of this because

307
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:02,279
your intuition is very shy right it doesn't he doesn't want to get you know smacked away so what does faith have in

308
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:07,919
helping that to come forward I think I thank you for asking us that's a great

309
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:13,840
question um I would use the word a certain amount of confidence but faith is actually a great is a great word too

310
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:20,200
I think that's uh you're right it takes a certain amount of faith and confidence to even like for example engage with

311
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:28,039
what I was saying and to stay in there yeah thank you for bringing this up I think it's a great point

312
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:44,480
yeah thanks for the talk um it's given me a lot to think about I think personally um one thing it reminded me

313
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,840
of or got me thinking about is um struggling with the concept of softness

314
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:55,679
of heart um so i' love to hear a little bit more about that or um it's kind of a

315
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:01,279
relatively new topic for me in addition into like the uh Insight pieces that we

316
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:06,679
normally get but how to develop a softness of heart is would be of

317
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:12,358
interest okay maybe I I'll say briefly about it one way there's a number of

318
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:17,440
different ways you can practice with it and one way and that uh I like to teach

319
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:23,720
is that we start by bringing to mind a lovable being whether this is an actual

320
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:29,679
being or an imaginary one so it's often just like kittens and puppies and babies

321
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:36,320
or grandkids or so somebody with whom we have an uncomplicated relationship and

322
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,839
we have this you know we have this tenderness towards them some care can

323
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:47,560
also be maybe somebody in our past who was a coach or a mentor or a guide that

324
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:52,878
really helped us and we have like so much appreciation for them so either of

325
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:59,960
those things and then we connect like we bring them to to mind like imagine them

326
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:06,960
could be one way and we connect with uh this sense of appreciation or care that

327
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:13,920
we have and then there's certain phrases that we can repeat to help kind of um

328
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,400
excuse me to help uh what's the word I'm looking for maybe

329
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:25,040
to um nurture that uh connection in that sensation and we just stay there for a

330
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,960
little while and it's quite simp thing how if we say it just naturally starts

331
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:37,680
to grow on its own if we allow it so start where it's the absolute easiest

332
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:43,920
this is the key people want to start where well I'm having problems with my co-worker I'm going to try to have warm

333
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:50,760
feelings towards my coworker but it's to really start where it's the absolute easiest and hang out there for quite

334
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:56,599
some time in fact it can be a long time it can be months it can be just there's

335
00:35:56,599 --> 00:36:02,079
something cuz often maybe if I've been talking about stuckness part of uh

336
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:11,280
sometimes stuckness can be because there's a way there's a part of us that is starving for some of this warmth and

337
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:19,800
care and tenderness and so there's a way in which just hanging out with uh cultivating it

338
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:25,200
that's the word I was looking for cultivating it can be so supportive for

339
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:31,160
us really just uh can bring also some vitality and energy and juiciness to our

340
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:36,440
practice is is this helpful yeah thank

341
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:44,520
you anybody else have a comment or

342
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,839
question okay so I'm wishing you all a wonderful

343
00:36:54,839 --> 00:37:00,920
rest of your evening and safe travels home and may you not feel stuckness but

344
