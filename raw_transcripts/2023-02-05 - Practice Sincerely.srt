1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:08,700
so warm welcome again everyone here in IMC as well as those who are online on

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,719
YouTube you know from all over the world

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,020
I just came out of a week-long online Retreat on Friday

4
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,680
and so I'm still feeling some Rippling effect of it

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:37,440
and so at the end of The Retreat and I got an opportunity to share a gem

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:45,920
that arose out of the retreat and what came to me very strongly

7
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,059
over the course of the retreat was this deep sense

8
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:59,239
of trust and rootedness in sincere practice

9
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,739
sincerity of the practice

10
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,439
and then the context of the retreat we had a retreat theme

11
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,320
and there was samadhi and some of you know this concentration

12
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,420
as translated as concentration and many words samadhi

13
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:32,880
just by naming samadhi so often our mind immediately get to I

14
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,460
want to get that okay I don't want to have that

15
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,579
and so that becomes a goal of the retreat you know we get concentrated

16
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,920
or in the Bliss of a samadhi

17
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:56,880
and the teachers knew this very well so on the very first day Philip Moffett

18
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,200
one of the teachers of the retreat said this

19
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,340
we need to be cautious that we don't turn this Retreat into a hunting party

20
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:14,099
for concentration we're learning to recognize that

21
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:20,660
concentration naturally arises as a felt sense

22
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:27,060
such wisdom such a wisdom

23
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,220
you know we have a theme of samadhi Awakening

24
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:39,379
we can so easily get caught that that is something that we're getting

25
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,599
so I must retreat and fill up with the lead and this

26
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:53,360
guided meditation each morning at 8 A.M and English guided meditations

27
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,280
he would offer a preliminary kind of process

28
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:08,599
or you can call it Preparatory process to prepare our body mind and heart

29
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:17,900
so that we're ready and open to the whole process of the meditation

30
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,400
and this preliminary process is called arriving sequence

31
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,700
and I won't be talking about the arriving sequence but I wanted to share something I

32
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,220
learned from this process and so

33
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:41,760
um usually this morning third is an hour or a little over an hour or something like

34
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,319
that and the Philippa would offer this

35
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:55,940
microscopic level great minute details of

36
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:01,319
what happens as a we arrive on the cushion

37
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:07,640
on our seat with tiny little shifts in our posture

38
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:15,840
some shifts in our mind and heart and great detail great details

39
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:24,240
is this arriving sequence you know could be 15 20 30 minutes 35

40
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:32,479
minutes sometimes it feels like a forever and

41
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:40,259
you know this is an experience the student Retreat to so many people have heard about this arriving sequence and

42
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:45,780
practice the weather differ many times you know and in a hundreds of

43
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:55,800
times so sitting there just being with the arriving sequence

44
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,080
was not easy wow that was not ex what we expected you

45
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,060
know our mind wants to get to somebody

46
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:13,440
um but such a teaching so one day

47
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:20,940
sitting in this Timeless arriving sequence

48
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:28,560
it just dawned on me wow what a sincere practitioner

49
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:36,300
what a sincere teacher and he wasn't going to rush over it

50
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:41,940
he wasn't actually going anywhere he was just there

51
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:47,340
was what was present right in front of him with him

52
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:55,080
while he was offering and sharing pointers to the rest of us who was

53
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,960
practicing with him there was no shortcuts

54
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,139
no Fast Track just arriving

55
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:14,280
I was so touched and moved by that and when I recognized that

56
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:21,000
all of a sudden my body relaxed my heart softened

57
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,479
I was humbling and inspiring

58
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:36,479
and I had this immediate sense in my being and I finally arrived

59
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,340
and I didn't have to go anywhere

60
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:48,780
and so that's what I thought I was going to um share today

61
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:54,560
um that is the sincerity of the practice

62
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,979
and it's easy for us to come to the Dharma practice

63
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:06,360
using the same attitude that we may be having

64
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:12,180
um in engaging in all kinds of aspects of Our Lives right we're here to get

65
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:18,479
something or to achieve something uh something we want

66
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,580
or we wanted to come here to get rid of something that

67
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:30,300
really bothered us the bad stuff bad habits or

68
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:36,560
you know the lousy neighbors and you know who knows

69
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:42,599
so we can come here with the attitude attitude of

70
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:46,639
getting or getting rid of

71
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:54,180
I don't want to diminish that because all of us probably come to on the Dharma

72
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,520
through that we had something that connects to us and and we needed

73
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:07,080
something and yet and as we began to have some

74
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:13,500
understanding of the Dharma teachings and began to engage with the practice

75
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,500
ourselves

76
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:23,819
my soul will find out maybe for ourselves

77
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:31,020
that usual patterns of attitudes don't work

78
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:38,300
they just don't work they actually hinder how we practice

79
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:46,339
and so what's asked of us is something quite drastically different

80
00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:53,040
from our usual attitudes and I would say what is asked of us

81
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,019
is to learn to practice sincerely

82
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:13,140
I'm intentionally passing here just to practice sincerely

83
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:22,579
nothing else period practicing sincerely period

84
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,620
just take a moment to feel into your being your heart and mind and

85
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,500
what did that what does that feel to you

86
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:43,920
know I've had many moments when this was said you know my mind would go what

87
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,580
don't we have to sincerely practice in order to

88
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:57,380
get something get somewhere and have something happened to us you know

89
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,920
we have lots of plans

90
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:09,620
that are we okay to just practice sincerely

91
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:16,500
so I'm very fond of the Suzanne story that Uncle tells us sometimes and I

92
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:23,060
think many of you probably have heard this that someone asked um

93
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:32,279
about Enlightenment and uh and he responded if you practice it sincerely

94
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:40,320
it's just as good so how is that possible

95
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,560
unless I wanted to unpack this sincere practice

96
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,740
a bit maybe in a few different dimensions this is just something that kind of

97
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:59,940
arose from the reflections of of the retreat and that I just came off

98
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:05,220
and doesn't mean that those are the only Dimensions there may be many other

99
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,560
dimensions associated with this as well

100
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,500
and so the first one and the first one about practicing

101
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:24,019
sincerely I is to become aware

102
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:32,040
to become aware of what is happening here

103
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:40,320
how we are practicing and what is here right now that's the very first thing

104
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,079
so even right now as we're all sitting together I'm speaking and you're

105
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:52,860
listening what's here are we aware

106
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:58,220
what's in our mind in our body in our heart

107
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:07,560
and if we are preoccupied with some

108
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,720
plans projections interpretations

109
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:20,640
we are not aware what is actually happening and whatever arises

110
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:26,519
maybe habitual patterns out of the storytelling mind

111
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:33,540
our impulsive mind and so the first thing is to become

112
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:39,180
aware and make contact with our lived experience

113
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:47,600
and not something in the past or in the future and so that's the first aspect of

114
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,399
sincere practice is just to become aware come in contact with

115
00:12:53,399 --> 00:13:01,399
the lived experience Here and Now when we're not aware we can't be sincere

116
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:08,399
I'm gonna say this again when we're not aware we can't be sincere

117
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:14,220
because we don't know what is truly here

118
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:21,920
we're only going to be kind of living in the surface level of or storytelling

119
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,660
stories and ideas imaginations

120
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:33,720
so that's the first one now once we're aware the second

121
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:40,260
dimension of a sincerity is that of truthfulness

122
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,160
honesty

123
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:50,880
so when we practice it sincerely we're aware come to contact with our present

124
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,519
to lived experience and what's called for immediately

125
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:02,339
following that is to meet those experience truthfully

126
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:09,060
not how you prefer how would you'd rather but this

127
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:16,399
whatever is happening right now here this is the truth

128
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:24,180
and so if you're sitting down and you find yourself having aches and things in

129
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:32,519
the body there's a truth to that can we be with that honestly

130
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:38,940
or if there's something in the mind and I'm irritated and

131
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:44,420
or I have certain fear coming in my mind

132
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:51,420
is it okay to be with that as they are

133
00:14:51,420 --> 00:15:00,000
meet with this truthfully and we all know that our minds tend to

134
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,680
skip over you know things that we don't want unpleasant experiences and

135
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,500
and of course you know we don't like that and it's not comfortable and

136
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:19,940
you know my mind tends to have this habit of Turning Away

137
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:28,440
and then to just kind of um reflecting you know often in our Dharma

138
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:34,800
teachings we offer this lists and Maps you know when we offer a list of eight

139
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:41,579
you know our mind can't stay at one or two we jump to

140
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:48,300
number eight within an hour the first 10 minutes we're not getting

141
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:55,579
to number four something is totally wrong with us right and then

142
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:04,620
but uh sincere practice asks us to be true to where we are how we are just as

143
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,839
is we're not moving away

144
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,320
and so um do I dare to stay true

145
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:24,899
to this this is another phrase that a fella be used very often on this retreat

146
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:32,220
do I dare do we dare and sometimes the what's here

147
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:40,320
we're afraid of so we run away do we dare so it takes courage and

148
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:46,880
um trust and integrity to really be here

149
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:54,180
and I really liked the Chinese translation of a sincerity I don't know

150
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:59,180
if any of you would know this and um

151
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:08,220
and it's meaning something like you know our heart it's what it means is that

152
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:14,220
it's something that our heart and mind can trust

153
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:20,699
when were sincere there is a certain kind of trustworthiness

154
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,459
in our heart in our mind

155
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:34,559
and maybe it's because that we can stay true with what is here

156
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:40,279
and so in in this way our heart and mind can trust it

157
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:54,840
and then the third aspect that I like to speak about and after us being aware

158
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:01,440
with what is happening and stay true or honest with our experience

159
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:09,299
the third dimension of a sincerity comes in in the form of being open

160
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:14,940
to what is here and this is a kind of opening on

161
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:20,760
you know I had this sense of a gesture I don't know some of you may be doing yoga

162
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:28,340
and it's a mountain pose in a mountain pose you stand on your mat you know with your kind of

163
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:34,440
hands open a heart lifted and and that you're open

164
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,900
to what comes this is that kind of a gesture we're

165
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:45,059
open to this experience fully wholeheartedly

166
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:50,400
you know not half-hearted and you know partially checked out

167
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:57,840
but we're really here fully I'm also find a find a fond of this

168
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,880
one-liner that girls sometimes talk about you know in order to get it from A

169
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,120
to B you stay at a fully

170
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:17,220
and so the same sense of opening up to embrace

171
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:22,440
stay with the experience fully

172
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:28,740
and we all have probably lots of examples of how we might be experiencing

173
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:35,340
what's happening half a half-heartedly right not totally fully

174
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:43,080
you may have had experience where you are with someone and you know someone is keeping and Company with you

175
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:48,360
but they're really not there maybe they're on the phone

176
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:53,760
and they're kind of gesture is you know they're not looking

177
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:01,559
at you or they're not there with you and they are kind of there but they're really not

178
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:07,559
there with you we all have experienced this and we can

179
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:14,340
be experienced with that part of ourselves in our inner being

180
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:24,000
you know some aspect of us that we may prefer not to be here is here

181
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:31,740
maybe somebody said something about me that that the defensive part of me is here

182
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:38,640
I don't like it I really want to wiggle out of this hurt feeling but it's here

183
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:45,840
can I be with this can I allow this to be here

184
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,960
without shuffling it around and pushing it away

185
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:59,700
and I remember on one Retreat a recent Retreat that gill

186
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:07,220
had given a long extended posture instruction

187
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:16,799
I was struck by the details that he offered in this

188
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:22,799
posture instruction kind of again as my new details of

189
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:29,159
different parts of the body energetic field and you know the jaw the eyes and

190
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:35,700
the eye socket and you know just kind of everything

191
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:41,580
and I was struck with me was wow how attuned he was

192
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:46,799
with all of us just with all of this is sitting and

193
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:55,380
it's just sitting here and it wasn't just for one sitting but it's over time over

194
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:01,140
the decades and Decades of a practice he was paying attention to how

195
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:07,980
posture shifts and changes so as if you're meeting this

196
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:15,260
as an old friend at the same time as a brand new friend

197
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:23,640
and so that's kind of the attitude that we're bringing in through the sincere practice

198
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:29,700
and we Embrace this so wholeheartedly that as if we've never

199
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:35,700
well actually we have never met this this moment before we just give

200
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,880
ourselves over to it bowing down to it

201
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:49,140
and then the last Dimension comes in

202
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:55,520
which is to be content with this

203
00:22:55,799 --> 00:23:00,840
now that you're aware present honest truthful

204
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,580
open receptive

205
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:14,840
and be content with Where We Are how we are just as it is

206
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:21,480
it is easy for our mind to feel that somewhere else would be a better place to be

207
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:28,440
just not this but the sincere practice asks us to to

208
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,780
check can we be okay with this experience

209
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:40,500
whether it's a bliss pleasant experience or unpleasant

210
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:48,419
very uncomfortable so whatever is happening is good enough

211
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:51,259
it's good enough

212
00:23:54,179 --> 00:24:00,419
you know our mind are tricky we don't always have clarity

213
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:05,700
and so on an invitation for this sincere practice

214
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,980
is to also open to this as a learning process

215
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:16,080
as an ongoing learning process that's part of the sincerity

216
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:22,380
sincere practice bring humility and modesty to our

217
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:29,580
practice setting ourselves up against some high standards

218
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:36,320
reading only kind of bring to come to us

219
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,480
and I want to share this poem that I just

220
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,500
heard this morning

221
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:58,620
and this is from this little book and the first free woman

222
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:05,000
it's a poems from the early Buddhist announce

223
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:16,080
and this is a from this nun whose name is rahini

224
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,559
the title of the poem is wandering star

225
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:30,360
you don't cut sorry I'm gonna restart you don't become the cloth just because

226
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:36,900
you put on ropes you don't don't turn into empty space

227
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:43,980
just because you carry a bowl the sun doesn't Bow Down

228
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:49,140
trees don't throw flowers at your feet

229
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:56,820
birds don't start answering when you call the path will hold even the biggest

230
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:02,279
mistakes the path will make room for even your

231
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:09,960
deepest regrets but you don't become the cloth of the of

232
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:16,140
the robe overnight you can begin very quietly

233
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:24,419
something you barely even notice like the touch of water on your skin

234
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:30,179
like a knife in a drawer like the next five minutes

235
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:34,399
unless they are your last

236
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:44,580
the path isn't a line on a map it's a great shining world

237
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:49,820
enter wherever you like

238
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:58,679
you might get thrown back once or twice but if we push through the outer layers

239
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:06,480
oh my siblings then you will know the true welcome that is the very

240
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,220
essence of the path

241
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:18,860
so we can always begin to enter

242
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:22,760
wherever we like

243
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:29,480
may we all practice sincerely

244
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:46,700
hmm so we have a little time

245
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:57,240

252

thank you

265
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:12,539
hi I I'm just curious to know what the name of that book you read the poem from

266
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:18,000
is yeah I like that poem yeah the first free woman

267
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,460
and this this is the book feel free to come up and take a look if you need but

268
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:28,519
it's called The First the free woman thank you

269
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:36,059
I want to thank you for your talk and that poem was very moving also um I

270
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:41,159
think I like the difference between that we're content with something versus

271
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:47,100
something is okay so for me the okay is less judgmental or

272
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:54,120
it's not as warm and fuzzy as content and yes can we be okay with things just

273
00:30:54,120 --> 00:31:00,899
as they are so yeah great thank you yeah great yeah we find our own words you

274
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:06,600
know words are tricky you know we have our own associations with them so I'll

275
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:12,740
find the words that work for you you know and for me sometimes it's just oh this is good enough

276
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:18,620
that's that's enough yeah great

277
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:43,580
while you are very quiet and if there is no other comments or sharing

278
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:50,039
I guess we can end so maybe we'll end with a dedication of

279
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:53,899
a merit and together

280
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:05,480
yes take a moment to gather ourselves

281
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:14,100
and allow a sense of a gratitude to arise being grateful to be able to practice

282
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:19,340
together sharing Dharma together

283
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:28,039
grateful for our own presence right here our courage to be here

284
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:35,520
and may whatever benefits and goodness that arose out of

285
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:41,880
our practice together and our sharing together may they be shared

286
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:48,120
all around in all directions with all beings

287
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:54,779
may all beings be well may all beings be happy

288
00:32:54,779 --> 00:33:01,580
and may all beings be free to everyone
