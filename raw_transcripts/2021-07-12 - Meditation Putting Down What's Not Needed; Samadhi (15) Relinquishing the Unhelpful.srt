15
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,240
of our practice is to to put down to put down what is not

16
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:52,479
necessary to put down what is not necessary what is when drag and image

17
00:01:52,479 --> 00:02:00,798
i would like you to consider is if you were riding a bicycle

18
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:09,119
if you imagine for example the professional bikers in tour de france reducing

19
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:15,120
wind drag reducing wind drag is so important putting down what is not necessary what

20
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,800
sticks out so that one can be in the flow

21
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,480
be in the flow of movement in this case movement of the breath on

22
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:36,080
upon the sati movement of this moment the movement putting down what's wind drag

23
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,360
what's wind drag for us is whatever is not necessary

24
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,599

26
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,319

27
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:08,640

28
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:16,879

30
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,599

for the benefit of ourselves others and the world

32
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:47,360

33
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:54,080
let's begin adjusting our posture to whatever

34
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,239
is called for in this moment whatever is necessary

35
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:07,040
listening to the body what does the body need does it need to sit up a little more

36
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:15,840
straight with integrity

37
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:28,080
spine [Music] aligned vertebrae

38
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,439
sense of alignment as if there was

39
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,479
a vertical a vertical point of reference

40
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
internally

41
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,080
sitting nor lying down or standing with integrity

42
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,759
and then inviting the body to relax all the soft tissue

43
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,560
all the soft tissue to relax

44
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:25,840

with the goodness the sacredness

54
00:06:52,479 --> 00:07:03,840
of renunciation of what is extra what is wind drag

55
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,840
settling

56
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:24,479
into the sit bones

57
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,960
letting our weight drop internally

58
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,599
into the sit bones

59
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,840
held by the earth

60
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,879
letting go of the weight of the legs

61
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,840
and feet offering it to the earth

62
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:13,840
ah softening relaxing no need to hold on for it to be tight

63
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,640
dividing the abdomen the lower abdomen

64
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:55,839
to release

65
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,760
any tightness or holding

66
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,000
for the chest

67
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:14,399
to soften for the heart the proverbial heart center

68
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,839
center of the chest place of emotions

69
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:37,839
letting it be safe feel safe for whatever is present right now

70
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:51,839
softening around it breathing around it

71
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:20,399
inviting the neck and shoulders the arms the hands

72
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:32,240
ah to put down to relax

73
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,040
to release the weight their weight

74
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,440
similarly for the forehead

75
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,519
for it to soften

76
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,519
any tightness any holding in the forehead is wind drag

77
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,399
not needed

78
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:15,839
inviting the eyes their socket to rest

79
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,320
the jaw the chin all the muscles

80
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:43,839
behind the face they can relax

81
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,839
inviting the breath

82
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:33,120
to breathe you just as it has been doing for all these

83
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:41,760
minutes and years just naturally

84
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:54,000
simply being aware intimately intimately connecting

85
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,079
with the flow with the flow

86
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:20,480
and the abdomen lower part of the body to settle

87
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,399
and if judgments arise

88
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:34,800
i can't do this my mind is distracted when drag not needed

89
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,279
put down the self-criticism

90
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,680
i don't like this

91
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:56,480
this is not good etc etc wind drag wind drag

92
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:05,440
relinquishing relinquishing putting it down

93
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,160
giving your heart

94
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:31,839
to itself not to these strangers

95
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,839
any type of conflict with reality

96
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,839
extra

97
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:27,840
and if thoughts arise lots of entanglement in thinking

98
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,280
past future present

99
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,840
there isn't a problem in thinking per se

100
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:48,240
and yet giving our hearts to this practice of

101
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:55,840
simplicity in this moment relinquishing

102
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:05,760
putting them down for just this not

103
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:11,039
needed in this moment later later

104
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:23,840
seclusion of the mind resolving ourselves and seclusion of the mind

105
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:13,840
and for the last moments of this practice

106
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:24,880
if there are any criticisms externally internally

107
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,799
judgments self-judgments

108
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:35,120
arose during this period

109
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:44,000
oh my mind was distracted etc it's too noisy around

110
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,640
whatever no need it's all extra it's all extra wind drag

111
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,840
wind drag for the mind for the heart

112
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:02,000
and with resolve putting them down bowing to them

113
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:10,799
with gentleness with kindness putting them down thank you you're not needed

114
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,480
and appreciating that we have showed up

115
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:23,600
we've done our best for the benefit

116
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,640
of self others

117
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:37,840
and the world that is enough

118
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:46,720
dedicating our goodness our shared goodness freely generously

119
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:55,279
with all beings everywhere even if we may judge our practice to be

120
00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:00,399
shoddy trusting there is goodness

121
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,840
trusting there is goodness generated

122
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:12,000
may all beings be well

123
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:33,840
may all beings everywhere including this being that is me be free

124
00:31:50,240 --> 00:32:01,840
thank you thank you for your practice

125
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:57,840
so greetings everyone greetings friends friends in the dharma

126
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:05,679
hmm how nice to sit together dispersed in space and maybe

127
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:12,880
time so powerful so powerful

128
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:22,080
to realize to consider for a moment really the beauty the grace

129
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:29,760
the wonder of us sitting together in this moment in time

130
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:39,840
all around the world this profoundly touches me

131
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,640
so if it may be of support for your practice

132
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:55,200
i'd like to share some reflections about calming

133
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:02,880
quieting settling the mind and heart settling [Music]

134
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:12,240
landing the mind and heart chitta translated as mind heart

135
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,839
because when our minds settle it's really our hearts that settle also

136
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:25,919
mind hearts also our body settles true they're all related the body is unsettled the mind

137
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:34,320
is unsettled and the mind is unsettled mind heart the body is unsettled so settling settling calming

138
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:42,158
calm abiding unifying arriving so many different words

139
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:47,200
we can use for the same concept another word that's used often

140
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,240
is the word concentration to concentrate the mind

141
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:58,880
though that brings this translation of the word samadhi the practice of

142
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:05,000
samatha brings some tightness

143
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:12,160
concentration i feel like whenever i hear that word i remember doing math problems i want to concentrate and my

144
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:17,359
forehead gets tight which by the way i've seen for many practitioners

145
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:25,200
therefore it gets tight as if they're trying to concentrate whereas ah actually somebody

146
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:31,440
collecting landing settling is more of a relaxed endeavor which

147
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:38,800
we'll talk more about tomorrow relaxation so the theme for this week is settling

148
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:45,839
the mind the word samadhi

149
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:54,160
derived from the pali prefix sum which means together and the root

150
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:01,440
da which means to put to place

151
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,200
which is related to the verb

152
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:16,400
date so basically samadhi means to put

153
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:22,240
together to bring together to concentrate concentrate in that way to bring

154
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:27,599
together so it entails unifying the mind

155
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:35,119
steadying the mind with undistracted awareness

156
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:41,920
many other words as i mentioned used for this idea

157
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:50,560
composure gathering collectedness non-distractedness stabilizing

158
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:59,200
calming i especially like calming steady malleable

159
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:08,400
are some of the other words used stillness that's another word also use

160
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:18,720
stillness where hindrances and distractions are at bay and the mind is protected

161
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,599
so samadhi

162
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:34,240
can support us this settling of the mind this calming of the mind

163
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:40,960
this undistractedness of the mind can be so supportive through

164
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:49,680
our practice the path of practice for insight for seeing things clearly

165
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:56,000
in about ourselves about others inside the rising and also it's

166
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:03,440
tremendously helpful in life in our daily life

167
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:11,200
for example having a mind that can become settled unified composed undistracted

168
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,720
still is very helpful when you want to go to sleep

169
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:23,280
and we know that in terms of health impact sleep has number one health impact more

170
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,640
than anything else um that we can do for ourselves

171
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:35,119
for example researches is is more and more research is is showing

172
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:41,119
that sleep is really number one numero uno and have you noticed at night if your

173
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:47,280
mind is distracted here and there and everywhere [Music]

174
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:56,160
it's hard to settle it's hard to sleep it's hard to be nourished so developing developing your mind

175
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:03,119
that's undistracted that can settle that can calm learns how to knows how to

176
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:10,880
do that has been trained how to do that is a huge gift

177
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,079
that can that we can give to ourselves again not just for practice

178
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:24,240
but for our daily lives for sleeping for for doing what is needed to be done etc

179
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:31,520
and for practice um i once did the survey and looked at machi manikaya

180
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:38,000
and um the number one number one and two

181
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,320
words that were repeated the most was buddha and dharma and number three

182
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:53,280
there were few there were few words tied for for the third uh position um the third one

183
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:59,760
in that position was [Music] states of jhana absorption samadhi

184
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:08,240
so states of mind being calm and undistracted so

185
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:14,800
it is so important for this practice for us to know for us to learn for our heart

186
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:24,720
minds to learn how to settle be unified be undistracted

187
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:31,119
there are many different ways many different tools that are

188
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:36,839
supportive that help this distractibility of the

189
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:43,119
mind as we'll discuss together this week

190
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,920
the first one i'd like to discuss today as actually we've been practicing with

191
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:57,880
is sense resolve is a sense of resolve for seclusion resolve for

192
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:03,920
non-distractedness or what i called when drag to put down to put down what

193
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:10,160
is not needed in this moment put down what's not needed

194
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:20,040
and often when we think of seclusion or if we think of

195
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:25,760
relinquishment we think oh relinquishment sounds

196
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:33,040
so heavy and oh relinquishing what's good and sounds pretty bare whereas it's actually

197
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:39,000
the other way around we're relinquishing giving up we're renouncing

198
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,200
renunciation of what is extra what is too much what

199
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,838
is distracting what is not wholesome

200
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:58,000
and renunciation this relinquishment

201
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,680
is it requires right intention it requires a sense of resolve

202
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:10,079
so that when the mind says goes off in thought and and worry or self-judgment

203
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:16,480
or ill will you name your top 10 list

204
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:23,119
the heart mind doesn't revel in it like oh yeah juicy fun more ill will

205
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:28,480
more self-judgment no there is a right intention there is a resolve

206
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:36,480
no no come back i've done this so many times not helpful this is not helpful

207
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,760
dear mind beloved mind come back come back again with loving kindness

208
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:50,640
with gentleness and yet with a sense of resolve knowing that this is not helpful for your benefit

209
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:59,838
for others and the world

210
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:07,839
and the buddha talks about this um and i'd like to share briefly quickly

211
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:13,839
from majamalikaya 19.

212
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:23,359
as i remained thus hateful ardent and resolute thinking imbued

213
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:32,079
with ill will arose in me i discern that thinking imbued with ill will has arisen in me

214
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:38,000
this is the buddha talking of course and that leads to my own affliction

215
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:45,680
or to the affliction of others or to the affliction of both it obstructs discernment

216
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:51,359
promotes vexation and does not lead to unbinding

217
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:58,720
and as i notice that it leads to my own affliction it subsided as i noticed that it leads

218
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:04,240
to the affliction of others to the affliction of both it obstructs discernment

219
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:10,000
promotes fixation and does not lead to unbinding and binding being freedom nibana

220
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,359
it subsided whenever thinking imbued with ill will had arisen

221
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:22,640
i simply abandoned it dispelled it wiped it out of existence now

222
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,838
that is pretty um

223
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:37,040
direct that's very direct guidance noticing noticing

224
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:43,440
what is what is not helpful what is not helpful what the where the

225
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:50,800
mind has gone before and with hatefulness ardent

226
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:57,759
urgency and resolution abandoning abandoning

227
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:06,560
so my invitation for today is to notice in your daily life what is extra

228
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:14,000
what is wind drag what doesn't lead to benefit for yourself

229
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:21,520
for others and the world and in fact the other way it leads to your own affliction affliction of others

230
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:29,520
or both as the buddha says what needs to be put down and just doing

231
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:34,960
what you're doing if you're washing the dishes just wash the dishes donate the extra

232
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:44,720
wind drag donate the extra afflictions just be just simple undistracted

233
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:54,880
wishing you all the best sangha and may our practice be of benefit to ourselves

234
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:01,838
others and the world may you be well

235
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,480
take good care
