here we go excellent so hello everyone hello again ah so lovely to be with you um In

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:15,160
This Moment In Time In This Moment In Time so so the theme I like to invite us

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:21,600
to um practice together um is is a sense

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,480
of meta for this moment in time you know we've done practices in happy hour with

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,840
the past present past future f pre past

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,000
selves metaphor younger versions of ourselves and actually we haven't done

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,680
future selves I realized that would be fun maybe we'll explore that tonight meta for our future selves if there are

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,559
any that's that's uh you know meta for different arcs of Our Lives as well as

9
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:58,519
meta loving kindness friendliness for for who we are in this moment in time

10
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:04,439
and if we consider the Arc of Our Lives of course not knowing how long it

11
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:10,520
might be but but the Arc of our lives whatever it is as this hologram in time

12
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:17,119
as this hologram in time as if um we could have this hologram stretch and we

13
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,479
could see this hologram in time and and often we

14
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:31,040
don't consider this moment in time as as it's going along we sometimes look back

15
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,720
at our history at when we were younger at another version of

16
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,880
ourselves and yet we don't often have this appreciation as we're going through

17
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,360
life that this is a moment in life that is going to become past that we don't

18
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,600
have this you know we're so in our head sometimes not embodied and perhaps

19
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,479
compassion and meta is not so available thinking about oh this is a part of my path this we don't step out of ourselves

20
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:07,599
to to see this being who is me um as um

21
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:13,720
as as going through this this life path and this moment being part of this Arc

22
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:20,000
the challenges difficulties that we have the the intentions the good will the

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,319
beauty that we have so so um we're going to be playing around with that and if

24
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:32,560
all of this sounded a little too heavy you can let it all go you can let it all go and I'll unpack it and oh I forgot to

25
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:40,959
also thank um Neil for putting information about happy hour Google Groups and uh um the happy hour breakout

27
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,360
just sit together and I'll guide us wherever this might go let's let's uh be

28
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,200
open as always we're going to sit just arrive in our

29
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:06,000

breath Landing arriving with the breath

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,680
and can we relax and receive the breath not so much focusing on the breath but

33
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:44,560
can we relax the body and receiving the

34
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:52,920
breath relaxing and receiving relaxing and receiving this

35
00:03:52,920 --> 00:04:00,720
breath in this moment as it presents itself however it's presenting itself

36
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:19,000
and can we relax

37
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,799
around receiving the breath relaxing the

38
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:34,039

39
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:40,759
center relaxing our back our

40
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:47,360
belly relaxing our sit bones sit bones into the cushion into the

41
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:56,400
chair softening our legs upper legs knees and lower legs and

42
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:03,080
feet and arms and and

43
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,360
softening offering the whole weight of the body to the Earth Landing

44
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:16,800
[Music] landing and allowing the breath to be

45
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:25,319
received just as it is deep shallow doesn't matter and

46
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:30,479
notice I'm not inviting us to focus on the breath or to breathe because it all

47
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:38,319
happens on its own simply receiving what is already here simply relaxing and receiving the

48
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:45,039
breath it's so simple simple don't need to make it

49
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:51,080
complicated relax and receive and let the breath

50
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,919
be as it is and can there be just a little bit of enjoying of this breath

51
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:01,639
just a little bit enjoying this breath

52
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:14,400
and taking some time to land in our bodies allowing the body

53
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:21,400
to envelop the breath the body enveloping the breath

54
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:27,800
the breath enveloping the body with

55
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
ease

56
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
e

57
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
e

58
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,479
e e

59
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,680
can we allow this breath to

60
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,760
be nourishing

61
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:18,029
nourishing and soothing calming [Music]

62
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:27,880
settling as if we're tuning into the quality of the breath

63
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:36,950
the same way that we would tune to a particular [Music]

64
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:47,240
station on the radio is tuning into

65
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,200
this the quality of calming soothing

66
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:01,440
settling there could be also the energizing quality that we could to into at times

67
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:11,320
and different qualities but right now tuning Our dial the settling quality of the breath

68
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:34,640
nourishing what does that mean for for me for each of

69
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:42,600
us and don't let it be effortful but no it's already here the same way that

70
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,720
the radio waves are already there it's just a matter of tuning into them ever

71
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:54,040
so subtly it's already here we don't have to create it and if it's not accessible

72
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,320
to tune into it no problem no worries

73
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,760
can we then be with the whole frequency range whatever is present whatever is

74
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,920
present it's all okay it's all

75
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
okay

76
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,240
e e

77
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:57,000
spending it just a few more breaths feeling feeling the body feeling embodied the breath within the frame of

78
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,199
the body

79
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:09,440
feeling the breath in our toes our feet our

80
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,480
hands our belly our

81
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:20,839
chest now I'd like to invite invite us to

82
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:26,800
consider as if we were feeling this

83
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:32,920
body feeling this body body and yet as if we were watching the movie of our

84
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:39,680
lives and then not a movie in time you know movies you can only watch

85
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:46,240
one particular point of a movie right but as if it was a hologram this this

86
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:54,199
hologram extended hologram and were saying the our birth our

87
00:13:54,199 --> 00:14:00,560
childhood young adulthood seeing this moment then

88
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,370
perhaps future moments of [Music]

89
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:17,480
Aging this Arc of our lives and with at the beginning of this meditation

90
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:27,800
I like to invite us to bring some emphasis as this moment in time as as an unfolding of of this Arc this Arc of Our

91
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:34,040
Lives this being who was

92
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:41,160
born whom we identify as this being was born he grown up has had challenges

93
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:47,720
difficulties Joys lots of Joys Ambitions

94
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:54,639
hopes happinesses pain sorrow and not in a way of getting

95
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:02,480
involved in the stories this is not a time to think of the stories but just as if you're looking from a distance a

96
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,920
hologram hologram and this moment in time is part

97
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:16,040
of this Arc ongoing Arc of this being doing their best with

98
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:23,440
what they have been given and of course this being will

99
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,160
continue to agent

100
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:36,120
and get older and and and die at some point and that's a part of the Arc of life as

101
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,880
well and bringing awareness and appreciation to this moment in the ark

102
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,759
of this life this moment in the ark of this

103

together appreciating appreciating our

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:04,980
practice that we're planting seeds we're planting seeds of friendliness

144
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:13,200
[Music] Goodwill and planting seeds even one

145
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:20,279
seed of Goodwill and kindness It's infinitely better than no seeds at all

146
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:26,480
and we don't know when the seeds are going to flower and appreciating our

147
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:34,000
practice of cultivating Goodwill friendliness for ourselves and for others as we're more

148
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,440
friendly to ourselves we become more friendly with the

149
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,000
world starts with

150
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:51,640
ourselves and may our practice be of benefit to all beings everywhere in ways

151
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:58,520
that we cannot comprehend and foresee may all beings be well may all beings be happy

152

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:31,760
practice for for coming to together in this way cultivating good willll

157
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,919
kindness and just a few words about this practice so we

158
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:46,000
um started with inviting the breath to be received

159
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:53,360
not to focus on the breath but to receive to relax and receive the breath and to also tune into how the breath can

160
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,559
be nourishing and calming that frequency of the breath as

161
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:04,720
I invited you and then um we explored this this idea of

162
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,919
seeing the Ark of Our Lives the moments of our lives past present future and

163
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:15,520
then seeing this moment as part of many many moments because usually again when

164
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:22,440
we're in the midst of Our Lives we we tend to lose track of of this that this

165
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:29,360
is one moment that is going to become the the past moment very soon as soon as

166
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:36,440
it's experienced um and can we can we imbue this moment of our lives with Goodwill

167
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:43,000
with meta with friendliness so that was an invitation to really try shifting these

168
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,519
perspectives uh looking at ourselves as if a beloved other as as if a dear friend then also receiving our own good

169
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:58,480
will I'm doing the best I can in this moment um and if this didn't work for you it

170
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,159
didn't quite click that's okay no problem there might be some other aspects of it that

171
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:11,960
worked so um yeah that was the invitation for this exploration and um

172
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:17,720
yeah we often don't think of ourselves in this moment as this is seeing as if

173
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:24,120
there's this moment is part of the arcs of Our Lives we're always either future oriented planning there there or

174
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:29,200
thinking about the past regretting but there's just a different way that we can relate to

175
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:36,960
ourselves um so that was the invitation and I hope something something opened

176
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:43,320
up so um i' like to invite us to um to

177
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:48,399
um now shift to another way of practicing which is when the practice

178
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:56,679
from sitting perhaps with our eyes Clos silently on the cushion uh now meeting

179
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:02,840
others meeting the world this becomes the practice of meta Goodwill in um in

180
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:11,279
real time meeting another couple of practitioners um and and sharing so so

181
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:16,399
in the invitation that I have for you actually in this practice um well I'm

182
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:23,880
going to put the guidelines in chat as we've been doing so these are the happy hour breakout um

183
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:31,120
room guidelines um so practicing meta in the

184
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:37,640
small groups M standing for mindfully listening and speaking e embracing

185
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:44,039
compassion t for staying on topic and the topic I want to give um tonight the

186
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:48,679
the invitation the question is this

187
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:57,080
um is um what is not wrong in this moment like as you think of this Arc of

188
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:03,360
your life right as you think of this Arc of your life what is not wrong in this

189
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:10,600
moment so and this is the way you'll answer it and you'll go around and round uh

190
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:17,159
answering this question what is not wrong so so um what is not instead of

191
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:22,200
what is right like oh I'm okay you know I'm healthy so this is a different

192
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:29,039
question you're going to answer it what is not wrong well uh my ankle is not hurting right now my back is not hurting

193
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:34,720
right now I don't have uh acid reflux right now I don't have a headache right

194
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:40,640
now I don't have a u i don't have hunger right now I don't have impatience right

195
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:48,519
now I'm not angry right now right just all the things that are not wrong right now does that make sense it's it's it's

196
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:56,440
a kind a little bit of a mind twister I am not uh exhausted right now I'm not um

197
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:02,919
I'm not drowned in a crowd right now I I don't have earache right now like whatever what is not wrong right now

198
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:08,559
okay does that make sense where we're going with this yeah okay just play along play along and you'll see how this

199
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:13,799
goes so in this moment in time especially because we've done this practice now with The Arc of our lives

200
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:20,919
like what is not wrong well I'm not in grief right now I'm not in whatever it is so so play along see see how this and

201
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:28,720
we're going to go around and around so we're going to go uh with alphabetical order which is the next t wait take a

202
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,960
turn turns briefly so the first person whose first name starts the first uh

203
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,279
closest to a will say well um I don't my

204
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:46,200
finger my ring finger doesn't hurt right now or whatever you want to say I don't have a toothache right now okay the next

205
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:51,320
person like this this is what's not wrong right now they'll offer another

206
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:58,120
sentence and then the third person then you go around and round a few rounds um

207
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:05,360
and and it's it's a way to really appreciate this moment in time and um

208
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:12,720
and then to tie U to tie it in with the sense of Goodwill maybe actually do this

209
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,440
for maybe maybe five six rounds when you feel yeah do this for five six rounds

210
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:25,880
and then maybe switch for a uh a if if you are a beloved other of yourself like

211
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:34,639
if you're stepping out of yourself doing that thing the things that are not wrong right now what what are the good what is

212
00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:39,799
the what are the blessings or what what is the Good Will so it could be either a

213
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:45,360
statement of gratitude or statement of Goodwill for for your own self so I'm

214
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:51,679
giving you a lot of R latitude in the next round so it could be a statement of Goodwill for yourself you know I

215
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:57,919
preciate that I'm um yeah I'm going with the flow there challenges but you you

216
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:03,559
know she's doing the best she can right now or I'm grateful for XYZ so the next

217
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:08,960
rounds after you do what's not wrong right now then is is either statement of

218
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:16,240
gratitude or statement of appreciation for yourself how's that play this is improv we're just throwing spaghetti so

219
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:22,639
there's you don't have to get it right it's just uh so all right so I'm going to

220
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:27,880
create a uh create the small groups oh and then did I already go through the

221
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:33,480
yes TTA and avoid cross talk giving advice and all that so I put um all of

222
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:40,360
that in in chat so so I'm going to create the breakout

223
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:48,279
groups here we go and again please be kind to yourselves be kind to one

224
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:55,799

225
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:01,399

233
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,158
I see Peter's hand just shut up so hi

234
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:03,560
Peter thank you Nick that that was a whole lot of fun it was uh I had trepidation going in it was

235
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:09,839
unlike anything before ever um but we we we had a lot of fun and it seemed very

236
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,880
productive thank you oh neat that that that makes me happy any other um any

237
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:21,680
more Nuance you want to offer yeah I'm delighted to hear was fun and productive can you say little it require it

238
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,760
required a very different way of thinking to do that um and so I think it

239
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:33,680
allowed to go deeper in what's happening for us nice oh nice that's just great

240
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:40,320
that's just great thank you thank you for that Peter yeah great Mima

241
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,480
please what I found it was it was a lot of fun but it it really helped me focus

242
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:52,200
on the blessings just today about what was happening with me so it kind of Drew

243
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:59,680
my attention to my brother called me and I saw his beautiful face when he smiled at me when he saw me on FaceTime and

244
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:06,280
little things that were happened throughout the day that I it would have gotten by me if we wouldn't have practiced this tonight so thank you for

245
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,880
this practice thank you ah sweet thank you so much Mima that's lovely Nicholas

246
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:18,480
good to see you uh yeah um so like like Peter said I

247
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:26,160
I found um it almost like as an exercise of improvisation where um you you don't

248
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:36,040
realize how many things are going well they're just they're so ubiquitous that it can be hard to um draw them up um

249
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:42,240
whereas like we we focus so much on what is not well that um yeah it's just a

250
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:47,760
it's a a warped perspective in in that regard but um it eventually it became

251
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:55,000
easier to acknowledge what is um what well in this moment nice nice That's

252
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:02,240
great yeah thank you yeah we it's we yeah we it's all of us right we tend to focus

253
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:08,720
on what's wrong what's not going well and and yet you know what's not wrong wait what what what's not going wrong

254
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:15,680
what's not wrong today yeah yeah very cool thank you Claire I see your

255
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:22,599
hand yes thank you it's good to see you Nikki um I did out to what everyone else

256
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:28,760
has said so far but one of the curious things in our we we had a three-man team

257
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:37,160
and it turned out it was we didn't ask it just was revealed that we were all writers we all had the same common

258
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:45,000
allocations or passions so that was really very lovely to be in a you know

259
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,119
like-minded group of people was fun sweet yeah thanks for sharing that yeah

260
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:57,079
I love that sweet and um I see Amy says um there was a swet meta magic in our

261
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:02,480
break room that's sweet meta magic I love that and Lakshmi says it was very

262
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,640
sweet to connect with people and feel happy for their good fortunes ah isn't

263
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,920
that sweet yeah and Bruce is asking how do you bring up the hand okay so Bruce

264
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:22,079
um I I see you so I'm going to ask you to unmute you've brought up your hand by sending the message so

265
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:29,560
please oh I was just curious um I mean I we didn't we were

266
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:35,160
top heavy so we we answered the first question a lot get around to the second

267
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:42,359
that's all good how did that go how did that go for you how did it went fine I mean we um how did it feel I think um I

268
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:50,520
think as we went along it started to get more difficult and um started to go a little deeper I think nice um so you

269
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:57,079
know that was good great that's the purpose of these questions usually is first we get to the we answer the

270
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:03,240
surface things and then yeah it it be it becomes deeper which is beautiful yeah

271
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:08,760
great thank you and and the way you would turn uh rise your hand later if uh

272
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:15,000
different systems if if you go if you click on react um there's a raise hand function

273
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:21,440
under react for on many systems Vicky hello

274
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,480
Vicki so great to see you Nikki thank you the same and you know it was just

275
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:34,520
interesting to think of what the difference is in what's not wrong and what I have gratitude for you know

276
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:42,000
because starting out that way you think well there's so much wrong in the world

277
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,040
but then you realize how much there really is that's going

278
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:53,280
right and so that that was a really curious way to get to what's right

279
00:39:53,280 --> 00:40:00,680
thanks nice love it exactly there's so much that is going right in the world

280
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:08,640
right yeah there there many things that are not but there's so much that is going right in the world yeah awesome

281
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:18,318
well said Thank You Vicki thank you so great yeah any other Reflections

to the body scale especially breathing into the different parts of the body and

294
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:45,160
letting each one receive uh but the idea of of the body and the breath um

enveloping each other you use the word envelop and I had a wonderful image of

right this this this play of the breath and the body and um this was inspired by

301
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:28,480
a quote I um read a few days ago by um I

302
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:34,920
forget his name but Ralph is his last name this is the person who came up with Rolfing this which is a style of massage

303
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:41,880
ralfing and he said something like the body is uh how did he say it my

304
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:48,559
interpretation was my paraphrase is that that that the body is kind of solid matter that wraps itself around the

305
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:55,079
breath that that kind of like enveloping the body enveloping the breath and I just love that image of oh yeah kind of

306
00:42:55,079 --> 00:43:00,920
it helps me land into my body more and my breath so so thank you dear ones

307
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:06,119
thank you so much for your practice thank you for coming and planting seeds

308
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:12,680
of kindness wholesomeness goodness for our own sake and the sake of all beings

309
