00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:06,600
hello everyone I'm Maria strotman I am sitting in for

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:13,200
Guild this week who is I hope enjoying the retreat he's leading at tasahara

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,440
so [Music] um over the course of this week what we've been talking about

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:26,660
is how one comes to grips with the feelings of self-criticism self-blame

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,540
and we've taken the approach of considering at the con the cultivation of blamelessness

6
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:39,780
rather than trying to get rid of something what would we like to cultivate in our lives and we began by

7
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,420
talking about impermanence that we're not the same people that we were yesterday or will be

8
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,420
tomorrow or in the next moment for that matter and then we talked about judgment

9
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:57,660
and how judgment leads to suffering and then we talked about doubt

10
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,760
and today we're going to talk about forgiveness

11
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,540
because forgiveness has as its Central feature letting go of blame

12
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,360
letting go of blame not forgiving or not not pardoning or

13
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,180
condoning but letting go of blame so

14
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:28,400
we've used as our Talisman through the week the opening

15
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,960
discussion in in the dhamapada and it starts with

16
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:40,079
all experience is preceded by mind led by mind made by mind

17
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,500
speaker act with the corrupted mind and suffering follows like the wheels of the cart behind the

18
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:53,520
hose of the ox all experience is preceded by mind led by mind made by mind

19
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,920
speaker act with a peaceful mind and happiness follows like a never departing

20
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:05,880
shadow but that continues and that's the subject of today's talk

21
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,280
he abused me attacked me defeated me robbed me for those carrying on like

22
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:18,300
this hatred does not end she abused me attacked me defeated me

23
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:24,900
robbed me for those not carrying on like this hatred ends

24
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:31,260
hatred never ends through hatred by non-hate alone does it end

25
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:37,560
this is an ancient truth many do not realize that we here Must

26
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:44,000
Die for those who realize this quarrels and

27
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:52,099
hatred never ends through hatred by non-hate alone does it end this is an ancient truth

28
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:57,599
this is the spirit in which we approach the idea of forgiveness

29
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:06,540
forgiveness really is for you forgiveness is letting go of the blame

30
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:12,780
the hatred the ill will the resentment particularly the resentment from past

31
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,480
events forgiveness is realizing that whatever

32
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:26,280
the source of this pain is whatever this this uh insult to you this this uh

33
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,280
behavior that you find offensive all of that happened in the past

34
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,980
but what's present now is the pain of your remembering it of your recalling it

35
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:45,659
of your re-energizing it by telling yourself the story about how of course we justify

36
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:51,019
this you justify this anger and this resentment

37
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:58,379
yeah but that anger and resentment is actually no longer linked to what the

38
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:04,819
cause was it's all here it's all in US

39
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:11,580
and the task of forgiveness doesn't even require the other person or

40
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:18,479
the other place or are agreeing with ourselves

41
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:24,780
what it requires is laying down the determination to be resentful over

42
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:33,000
whatever that insult was being hurt is the normal consequence of

43
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,180
living we all have experienced hurt from ourselves from others

44
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:48,180
it happens stuff happens deliberate or non-deliberate stuff

45
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,360
happens and we get hurt

46
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:00,479
but the refusal to let go of the resentment toward ourselves or others

47
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,639
is just pounding the nail over the head after it's already in the board

48
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,740
it's done it's in the past now there's a famous phrase that that

49
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,900
forgiveness is giving up all hope of the better past all hope of a better past

50
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:22,380
it's over that has happened so now what

51
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:28,020
so now what it's a very human thing to want to blame

52
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:33,240
somebody for something that's happened it's all part of that

53
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:40,320
if I'm feeling threatened I have to protect myself from being from harm and so there's a natural reaction that I

54
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,620
should understand what happens so I can protect myself against it and we tell ourselves the story over and over again

55
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:52,199
and we say oh well that was your fault well if it wasn't your fault if if I

56
00:05:52,199 --> 00:06:01,400
want you to love me and so I can't really make you into a bad person then I make me into a bad person I blame me

57
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,259
but blame does not have to be the response to something that is unjust

58
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:14,699
unfair unwanted it does not have to be the response and

59
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:21,180
if we understand that that's the part about holding on to the corrupted heart the part where we're holding on to that

60
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:27,000
resentment and we're stroking that resentment and making it part of

61
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,340
everyday living we are reproducing the harm in ourselves we are the source of

62
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:39,360
the suffering we are the source of this suffering it is not to say that whatever happened

63
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:46,460
is okay it isn't okay we're not condoning we're not pardoning

64
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:52,400
the act of forgiving is giving up blame

65
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:58,440
not easy not easy but if you think about it and you

66
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:04,440
realize it's really coming from here it's coming from here

67
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:10,319
you know for years I love Thanksgiving I love everything about it it's a

68
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:16,020
wonderful family day it's got lots of wonderful food and for years

69
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:21,180
I had terrible thanksgivings because the family would all come in and they would

70
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:27,479
expect me to take care of them and I had envisioned something totally different we'd all get together and we'd all cook

71
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:35,160
together and we'd have a good time together and other people didn't have the same vision

72
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:41,759
of Thanksgiving as I did and I suffered every year until I gave up my idea of

73
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,800
Thanksgiving my idea

74
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:53,580
and for the last few years it's been absolutely delightful because I don't require everybody to

75
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:59,520
meet my view of what it looks like that was a great lesson for me the first

76
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,780
time somebody told me you know it's your fault you're suffering I was Furious what do you mean they're the ones that

77
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:13,440
are just laying around no it all had to do with my wanting

78
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,379
things to be a certain way now that's easier to do than

79
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:26,460
some harm that's been done to you some harm that's been done to you to let

80
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:32,099
go of holding on to the resentment of that is the task at hand

81
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:37,620
to let go of the resentment of that but remember the forgiveness is for you

82
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,940
it's not for the other person

83
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:50,100
you have to give up expecting things from your life or other people that they

84
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,660
do not choose to give you

85
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:01,019
you have to give up expecting things from your life or from

86
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:07,740
other people that they don't choose to give you the fact that they don't give it to you

87
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,019
is you're wanting things to be a certain way

88
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:20,120
and that's where forgiveness comes in it's the letting go of I need to be right about this

89
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,339
one of the things that we can do when we find ourselves telling that

90
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:40,680
story to ourselves over and over again when I find myself putting energy into oh what that's just not right

91
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:46,260
I recall that that all of that energy of that is

92
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:51,720
not right is being created right here I'm burning up that energy instead of

93
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:58,920
burning up the resentment and I'm reinforcing it

94
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:07,500
and what's required is to say how can I let this go how can I forgive

95
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:14,399
there is a practice a forgiveness practice where similar to something like meta or Equanimity practice you could

96
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,880
say certain phrases to remind yourself of what you're trying to do and they're they're very simple and

97
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:27,920
probably most of you have heard them before if you've been on Retreats at Spirit walk for example

98
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:35,600
so what we say is if I have hurt you

99
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,779
by word thought or deed deliberately or undeliberately

100
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:50,640
may I be forgiven if you have hurt me by thought were to

101
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:58,279
deed deliberately or inadvertently I forgive you

102
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:05,700
if I hurt myself by thought word or deed deliberately or

103
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:11,959
undeliberately I forgive me

104
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:19,860
now these phrases are just phrases but if you can say them and repeat them

105
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:28,140
to yourself and keep them in front of you with the idea of intention the intention to

106
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:32,720
soften your heart to have peace in your heart

107
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,980
it's amazing what it can do

108
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,160
but the first thing you have to do is want to get rid of the pain in your

109
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,820
heart you have to want to let go

110
00:11:52,140 --> 00:12:00,660
some things have become so ingrained in us that they feel like part of us this is who I am I'm the person who who is

111
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:06,360
the victim of this I'm the person that is fighting against this thing I'm a I'm

112
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:13,500
a person fighting this bias and all of that reinforcing of me as the

113
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:21,120
person who is fighting against this is all Happening Here in our own minds

114
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,240
and it's up to us to decide whether we want to let go of that pain or not do I

115
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,579
want to continue holding on to that live wire

116
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,640
my my stepmother is in hospice right now and

117
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:47,880
earlier in the year I she's 97. so she's she's lived a long

118
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:53,399
time and I thought I should go see her because there were some things between

119
00:12:53,399 --> 00:13:01,019
us that were not right and I determined I needed to go and talk to her and just get the air cleared to

120
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:06,860
make my heart at ease and I went to see her and she's she's uh she was even then

121
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:12,839
somewhat demented and she mostly remembered things 50 years from now that's mostly what she talked about

122
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:18,899
earlier 50 years earlier and my husband kept saying uh you you

123
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:25,680
haven't you haven't talked to your mother yet you haven't talked to your mother about that yet you haven't went and I said you know it turns out I don't

124
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:34,740
need to talk to her it's all in me this this discomfort this unease

125
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:41,160
I no longer need to say anything to her it serves no use useful purpose

126
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:46,500
totally unneeded not because it was too late but because

127
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:52,440
I finally let go of my own holding on to the discomfort

128
00:13:52,440 --> 00:14:00,680
I finally just said oh it's all in my mind it's all in my heart

129
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,500
it's miraculous

130
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:24,300
it's going to read another Jane hirschfield poem this book is just wonderful

131
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:31,260
so the name of this poem is the bowl if meat is put into the bowl

132
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:36,660
meat is eaten if rice is put into the bowl it may be cooked

133
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:42,540
If a shoe is put in the bowl the leather is chewed and chewed over a sentence

134
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:49,800
that cannot be taken in or forgiven a day if a day could feel must feel like

135
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:55,740
a bowl Wars loves trucks betrayals kindness it eats them

136
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:02,820
then the next day comes spotless and hungry the bowl cannot be thrown away it cannot

137
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:09,180
be broken it is calm unequipsable rindless and big though it seems fits

138
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:15,899
exactly into human hands hands with ten fingers 54 bones capacity

139
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:21,779
strange to us almost past measure scented as the curve of the bowl is with

140
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:29,279
cardamom staranus long pepper cinnamon hyssa the bowl is just the bowl it's what we

141
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:35,600
put into the bowl that we eat

142
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:44,100
so I hope this has some meaning for you and understand that it is the laying

143
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:51,439
down of the flame that leads to blamelessness thank you

144
00:15:53,880 --> 00:16:00,360
hey thank you Maria so if anyone on Zoom or YouTube has any questions can raise

145
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:07,139
your hand Zoom or you can put your questions into chat on zoom and YouTube and we'll

146
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:13,040
read the chat messages to Maria as they come in

147
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:21,380
um I I had a quick question about the Thanksgiving dinner actually so um you know I think it sounds like you

148
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:26,519
had a change of mindset or change of how you looked at things

149
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:32,880
um and our expectations it sounds like and so was there any

150
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:39,660
I've experienced this myself where I've kind of changed the way I've seen or drawn boundaries sometimes and like did

151
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:46,079
you communicate your change of expectations to your guests or was it just kind of like well I've changed my

152
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:51,600
expectations and they'll have to just deal with my shift in mindset

153
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:58,519
well of course the shift to mindset was really positive for them because I stopped grumping around

154
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:05,760
so it wasn't necessary for me to say you know I've changed my mind and now I'm going to think this about it what what

155
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:12,660
what I did was uh I first of all began asking people for something rather than

156
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:18,000
expecting them to offer it to me you know what that's like well you know if you loved me you would just do this

157
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:25,020
right I wouldn't have to tell you so I would say you know you have special special need requests would you mind

158
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:31,559
bringing one thing that that you I used to make three separate meals at

159
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:37,080
Thanksgiving to meet everybody's uh particular dietary requirements you

160
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:42,720
know and so I would just so I would ask people for something and I would give up

161
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:49,320
my idea of what it had to look like and so I gave up wanting the food to be

162
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:57,419
a certain way and and let let go of of uh I I heard that people treated a

163
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:04,260
holiday as a day I can let go and so my gift to them became letting go for them

164
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:10,919
allowing them to let go and not resenting them for letting go and laying around that's what they

165
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:17,280
wanted to do with their holiday so it involved looking outward and not so much

166
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,500
emphasis on what was inward I didn't have to say anything I just

167
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:28,640
became a more pleasant person not by Design but by effect

168
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:38,640
so yeah yeah the communication sounds like it was also a good kind of lubricator as well too yeah cool it's

169
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,679
great sometimes you have to tell people what your expectations are expect them to

170
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:50,760
know yes exactly yeah uh so we've got uh Lucinda if you want

171
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:57,539
to unmute yourself and thank you hi hi I really enjoyed this

172
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:03,360
week very much thank you um two questions one is on which uh book

173
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:11,160
for the Jane hirschfield uh did you read from okay okay thank you

174
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:16,940
um and then I recently discovered it turns out I had another copy on my shelf already

175
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:24,539
I relate um my my question uh is around forgiveness I've been um uh recently

176
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:32,400
struggling with a family member and um came to around a pretty huge conflict

177
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,740
and uh through basically through this practice

178
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:46,440
um have come to a place of true forgiveness and um the but what's come up for me is um I

179
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:52,740
am uh scheduled to go on a family trip with this family member

180
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:58,919
somebody I deeply love um and who's and my ability to get hurt

181
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:04,980
by this person is uh monumental and I don't know what to

182
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:12,780
do with it other than not to do anything about it I mean I just I don't have any idea it's it's not until December but

183
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:18,240
it's a big trip and um I'm just letting it be I don't know what

184
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:25,380
else to do I mean I feel like I have this thing that wants to have a conversation with this person but

185
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:31,500
he he's not a very he's not open to that often uh any any insight

186
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,539
or suggestions so uh it's a little unclear to me well

187
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:43,980
um what the what the fear is it sounds like the you don't want to be in conflict

188
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:52,320
with this person but you want more than that you want also to to have a feeling of affection between one another yeah so

189
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,940
so um

190
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:06,419
all conditions are different so but all families are are different but similar

191
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:12,600
and uh I have been in conflict with various members of my family and want

192
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:18,000
them to be uh and want that not to be true and so the approach I've taken is

193
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,840
to avoid those places where I think where we are in conflict and recall call

194
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,419
to mind in me what it is

195
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:38,400
that I would be the attitude that I would like to have so what I mean by that is I want people to be friendly to

196
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:45,840
me I begin by being friendly and not by putting my Awareness on how we differ

197
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,940
um so I I work inside myself to to be what

198
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:58,380
I want to be and not become someone who knows how to deal with this does that help at all that's so helpful

199
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:03,080
that is so helpful thank you thank you

200
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:11,640
okay and from YouTube uh Kane is asking how do you let go of judgment and blame

201
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:19,020
from close family especially when you know your intentions are correct and you are doing the right thing it feels like

202
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:24,539
I I have to emotionally close off to them to protect myself

203
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:31,500
no no we're actually going to talk about that tomorrow

204
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:37,260
that is my topic for tomorrow it has to do with uh Equanimity establishing

205
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:43,740
Equanimity and um and it it has primarily to do with the

206
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:49,020
realization that what others choose to do

207
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:54,720
is not my they choose to do I don't get to I don't

208
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,240
get to determine what they do just as they don't determine what I do and so it

209
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:06,539
comes from a place of my suffering arises from my own

210
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:14,700
intentions and actions not what others may wish for me despite what I may wish for others

211
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:19,980
things are as they are there's a certain amount of letting go

212
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:25,980
of the need for it to be different that is essential but I'm really going to spend a lot of

213
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:31,500
time talking about a lot of time we only have 15 minutes but I'm going to talk about that tomorrow so I want to delay

214
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:39,419
that that particular theme what I can say is that uh

215
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:45,900
the act of judgment the the deliberate you are wrong about this

216
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:51,659
is building up in one's heart the resistance the blame the anger the ill

217
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:57,600
will that will lead to suffering and understand that in doing that you are

218
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:03,960
doing that to yourself I am doing it to myself if I am get if I

219
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:09,659
arrive loaded for bear you know you need to

220
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:16,440
we all need to see that not everybody is coming from the same place

221
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:24,320
and whatever they choose to do is their choice we can we can

222
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:30,179
be as generous as possible with what we think will help them but we

223
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:36,000
can't make them do anything they will do what they will do

224
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,820
and some of the pain arises from the frustration of not being able to fix it

225
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:48,419
so to recognize one's own need to fix something is adding to the suffering of watching

226
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:56,280
their suffering is useful so Cain without any uh

227
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:03,419
specifics about the issue the the only thing I can say is that anger resentment judgment lies

228
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:09,900
in US and then way to let go of them is to see

229
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:16,400
when they arise to not be enchanted by them

230
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:24,179
and they fall away to not be enchanted by the unrightness of this to not be overcome with

231
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:29,760
righteousness but just to I see

232
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:36,840
you're suffering my suffering arises from our own intentions and actions not

233
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:41,940
what others wish for us so we we will talk about that more

234
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:48,120
tomorrow thank you hey Susie uh you've got your hand ray so

235
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,140
you can go ahead and unmute

236
00:25:56,779 --> 00:26:00,919
you're muted Susie okay

237
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,580
you're there

238
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:14,059
Susie we can't hear you now you're muted

239
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:22,860
sorry about that can you hear me now yes I have I have four Bluetooth devices I

240
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:28,140
can't I'm trying to always connect because a computer says perhaps out good morning Maria

241
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:33,360
um I was I was sort of fixated on use the word refute one's refusal

242
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:39,720
to um which is I haven't heard you use that word before and and it reminds me of a

243
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:47,100
past lover would say that I say to me that I choose suffering and I would respond you know if if I could it's not

244
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:54,240
it's not something I would actually voluntarily choose I just don't know how to do it differently so the refusal was

245
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:00,120
a little new for me in your vocabulary and and I was thinking also that when

246
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:05,460
you responded to a woman about uh the Thanksgiving dinner how you

247
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:12,480
Focus you you choose you give your attention to what what you I forgot

248
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,299
already what you said what you like what you have in common with your with the family members rather than areas of

249
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:27,960
difference so when that resentment anger judgment hurt victimhood arises and the nature

250
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:35,340
The Habit energy is that Groove is so deep where can you know before we fall in

251
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:40,679
besides noticing the Rival which is arising which is already not being

252
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:47,159
intoxicated you know what where where can we go you just said some a place to

253
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:53,220
give our attention but it's not so familiar it's not familiar um place for me you talked about

254
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:59,760
intentions and actions and is there something more um a lay person

255
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:06,480
friendly um yeah and and once again I am going to

256
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,740
talk about this tomorrow so uh the um

257
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:19,620
I discovered for example that I got into uh

258
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:24,659
group behavior that a group behaves different than an individual and so to

259
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:30,000
deal with my family what I did was call everybody up or text them and say I want

260
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,539
to meet with you just you they appreciated the attention and then we didn't have the family dynamics that

261
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:42,299
altered it if you know this is just an example of something that is

262
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:47,400
that is just a shift away from how things always are so that I set up in

263
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:54,600
advance a little bit of protection around habits right so so I no longer go

264
00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:00,600
to big parties with my family I see them individually and I've learned so much more about them I like them so much more

265
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:06,539
and I assume they feel the same because it's just us and it's simpler

266
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:11,940
now if it's a one-on-one with someone and I uh

267
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:18,360
I can um feel myself saying oh you always do that

268
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:25,320
as soon as I hear you always do that in my head I remind myself they don't always do

269
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:30,899
that and this is this is me putting the emphasis on you always do that it's me

270
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:36,419
placing blame and if I can just stop placing blame and hear whatever it is

271
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:43,140
they're saying Just Hear It actually hear it

272
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:48,480
I'm less likely to be reactive it's when I think it sounds just like then I'm I

273
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:54,419
drag myself into that pattern so I listen for my own triggers

274
00:29:54,419 --> 00:30:00,779
and that you always do that that statement just right away catches my attention

275
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:08,399
you always do that oh and I always react this way and did you really do that and

276
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:13,919
what are you really saying it's a pulling back into now and letting

277
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:19,020
go of all the things that happened before you know that little string that we

278
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:24,299
carry along behind us of you know the continuity of life it is just

279
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:31,799
get back into the now as fast as you can just oh wait a minute what's happening

280
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:39,059
right now what did you just say what what and hear it without the baggage of

281
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:44,960
the habit it just takes practice Susie

282
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:51,840
and sometimes I fail boy there's a wonderful animal out here

283
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:58,760
making clicking sounds and I don't know what it is but I am not going to be distracted by it other questions

284
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:04,919
Theresa you can go ahead and unmute hi Theresa hi Maria

285
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:10,380
um maybe this will all be resolved by the time tomorrow when you give your

286
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:17,880
other talk but um I'm having a lot of trouble with a sister of mine who's a year younger

287
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:25,380
than me and the last year we've just had these terrible art conflicts and arguments that don't go anywhere like we

288
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:31,140
get so angry that I just get lost and I think I'm coming

289
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:36,179
to the fact that it's very possible we just can't relate to each other

290
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:43,020
and I'm I'm having trouble letting go of her like it it's almost like I'm anxious

291
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:49,620
about it and um I mean I hear everything you're saying and a lot of is about I want this

292
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:54,779
reality to be a certain way I want this to be a close sister relationship and

293
00:31:54,779 --> 00:32:01,500
for years there's been something wrong so let me let me remind you that the the

294
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:07,700
the vision of it being a close sister relationship has is a specific vision

295
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:14,039
and for you a close relationship looks like X and I'm not going to presume what

296
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:20,640
it is yeah whatever it is that's the expectation that's not being met not the

297
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,820
closeness the intimacy intimacy between people is very tricky

298
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:32,279
because we have an idea of what it looks like what it should look like yep

299
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:39,240
that is the place that view is the place they're not matching my view

300
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:46,919
so there's somebody very close to me that I was in conflict with because for

301
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:52,260
political reasons it would be a huge gigantic political Gap

302
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:57,440
and I kept and and all of us would say

303
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:04,200
how can he believe that how can he believe that he must not be who I thought he was and I kept reminding

304
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:11,220
myself he's exactly who I thought he was he's living his life this way despite

305
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:17,159
what he professes and he is a good man

306
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:23,340
so I shifted my attention to knowing what I know about him and not the

307
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:28,799
argument that we're having between us and I never let go of

308
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:36,659
he's a good man and and the subject of her which

309
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:43,039
we fought hasn't come up in about a year and a half

310
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:47,059
and he is a good man

311
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:57,200
and and it was a it was a serious breach

312
00:33:57,299 --> 00:34:02,640
but what got me through

313
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,940
was just recalling this is a good man

314
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:16,919
it's where you put your attention it's it's the meat you put in the bowl is what you eat

315
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:22,260
the shoe you put in the bowl is what you shoot you chew on

316
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:31,080
so yeah it's an expectation of a family that is hard to it's dying

317
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:36,419
it hard yes yes yeah

318
00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:43,080
I'm just hoping it it does pass because it it just eats at me and keeps

319
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:49,800
me awake but yes I just need to continue it's in you yeah you have more control

320
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:57,540
over it than you think it's just that we don't have control so all we do is just repeat here's my

321
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:04,200
intention but it doesn't have to look the way I see it this is really important it doesn't have to look the

322
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:10,920
way I see it I got my happy family Thanksgiving it didn't look the way I thought it

323
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:19,820
would look that's what I had to let go of okay okay

324
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:26,460
and uh so I also want to say that you know the the Saturday group had a couple of

325
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:32,220
people drop out of it those of you who know about that and so there are a couple of open spots on the Saturday

326
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:38,900
practice Discussion Group so uh next Kevin

327
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,180
hey Wendy you can go ahead and unmute

328
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:57,839
Wendy oh hi

329
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:05,220
um so I was um thinking about the forgiveness

330
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:11,060
and I have a family member that

331
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:17,220
caused me some childhood trauma and

332
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:24,800
I had actually kind of you know let go of that and kind of

333
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:31,680
forgiven him but then I started to feel like I wasn't

334
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:39,839
honoring myself and that that was hurtful and that maybe

335
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:45,960
I should you know I don't know what I would do with that

336
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:51,420
but maybe I shouldn't let him off the hook

337
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:57,359
so easily I I don't know I'm not really sure you know what I I don't know if

338
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:02,579
this is I do so once again forgiveness is for

339
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:08,099
you not for him forgiveness is for you

340
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:13,440
it is it is so you hold in your heart peacefulness

341
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:21,960
so so there's a place to start from and and then I remind you that it does not mean that

342
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:28,680
you condone or pardon the behavior you're not pardoning the person you're

343
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:33,900
not telling them it's okay it is still not okay

344
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:41,820
but the fact that it's coming back says that there's still some part of you that's that is holding on to a piece of

345
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:48,079
of uh pain and resentment over it

346
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:54,420
I can tell you I went through forgiveness practice with my father who had

347
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:59,700
caused some pain in my life and I finally got to the place where I had

348
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:05,760
forgiven him and I said okay he did it the best that he could do and after I

349
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:11,040
heard that in my head several times I said what if he didn't do the best he could do

350
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:18,319
and I realized that my forgiveness was conditional I had made an excuse for him

351
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:25,859
and I had to go begin all over again to let go of

352
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:31,160
I can only let go of this if I make an excuse for you

353
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:39,300
so I did more forgiveness practice and more forgiveness practice until I realized that all the pain I was

354
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:45,960
creating when I felt you know it's one thing to intellectually say you're creating your own Pain by recalling this

355
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:51,720
and and holding on to resentment and it's quite another to feel it coming and

356
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,759
going quite another

357
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:03,140
the determination to live with a peaceful heart

358
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:12,960
allows you to notice those moments when there is peace in your heart and to say ah into those moments

359
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:20,339
and then you don't choose to suffer you say ah

360
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:27,920
that was then and today I'm at peace and that peace grows

361
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:33,900
I hope that helps Wendy yeah yeah I just have to

362
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:40,380
make the decision I guess not to find myself going back to

363
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:46,520
the memories of those events from my childhood

364
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:53,220
things about my father that I really loved only the people who you love can really

365
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:58,320
hurt you interesting yeah

366
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:05,520
I guess so yeah so I just wish there was a way to turn that

367
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:13,140
off in my head it feels like I just keep going back there over and over again I know

368
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:19,619
so I I had I had some uh an offense that that came up that I worked with a lot

369
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:24,720
that uh the forgiveness was kind of global and um

370
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:31,440
that is it didn't have a single person that I needed to let go of and over time

371
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:37,079
I became to the realization that this had become a kind of metaphor for

372
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:43,500
for unhappiness in my life that is I began to see that when that story came

373
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:51,060
up in my thoughts it meant I there was something I needed to pay attention to that that was not actually the proximal

374
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:57,599
cause of my unease it's just that in my mind I went back to that

375
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:03,720
so whenever I hear a particular story that has to do with something in my life

376
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:10,440
when that story starts running in my head I think oh oh there's some similarity here

377
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:19,020
something is going on in my life that I'm not paying attention to what is it I saw it now it's become a kind of uh

378
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:25,260
not a touch tone but a warning light that story so you might consider that also that

379
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:32,720
that it comes up because there is some need in your life that needs to be seen

380
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,820
yeah okay thank you

381
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:45,720
Maria we had a question about the Saturday group and how someone would

382
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:50,820
find out about that uh so if you get the The Weekly Newsletter it's always in

383
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:56,760
there there's a section that says you can talk with teachers either through the the group practice discussions or

384
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:02,940
individual practice discussions and also on the website um

385
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:09,839
I always it changes so on the website there's a section I'd

386
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:15,780
have to look it up Maureen do you happen to know can can you help us here where where to find

387
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:21,440
that exactly Cindy actually just posted the link on um oh that would be wonderful thank you

388
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:29,300
that's great if someone posted the link so it's a Sign Up Genius thing

389
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:35,880
okay Cindy posted it um and I just reposted it in Zoom so

390
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:42,900
okay great thank you um Cindy actually had a question

391
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:48,119
in chat is it okay to stay away from the person that has caused trauma in your

392
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:56,400
life I can forgive but I'm not interested in being with the person because it's upsetting

393
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:03,260
well why would you put yourself through that yeah stay away from them

394
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:09,780
you know you're you're not required to seek out suffering there's plenty of it to go around

395
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:16,220
so uh until I can feel

396
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:24,599
and you know the the thing is not to make it into a thing I'm never going to be around this person but to to avoid

397
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:30,180
being in a place that that stimulates the memory and the pain in this and the

398
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:35,880
suffering there's no need there's no need to make yourself feel unsafe but you can test it every once in a while

399
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:41,339
and see how sensitive you are to that and see if the sensitivity changes

400
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:49,319
yeah Cindy well other other people in my family you know like try to put guilt on me you know

401
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:55,800
that I won't participate there's seven kids in my family Irish Catholic anyway so

402
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:02,460
um it's one person out of seven so I guess that's not bad but but

403
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:07,980
um yeah it's just the pressure I get you know because I don't want to go to

404
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:14,700
family reunions I don't want to be involved in um they say what's your you know they
