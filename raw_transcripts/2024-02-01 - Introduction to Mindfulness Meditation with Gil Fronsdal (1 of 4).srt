1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:07,200
so it's not quite time to start but I was just happy to I was kind of looking forward to this

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,599
that we have haven't I haven't taught this intro class now since beginning of the pandemic and I was kind of delighted

3
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:20,000
and so I couldn't wait to start we're three minutes early and people are still coming so um we'll just kind of kind of

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,439
just say hello and are any of you like completely new to

5
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:32,078
meditation completely never meditated before so welcome it's very

6
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,239
nice and some the rest of you have had some meditation experience if any of you

7
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:47,640
have taken a meditation class before taken one here or somewhere else here with me okay great welcome

8
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,280
back it's uh I've been doing this intro to meditation class

9
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,680
for so it's 2024 probably for at least 30 years now as part of this community

10
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,080
and it's one of my favorite things to do and uh you know it's kind of I've done it so

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,280
many times it's a little bit second nature but I'm I'm part of part of my joy is I'm always waiting to learn

12
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,720
something new from the teacher for me I might say something new or say it in a

13
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:32,040
different way and and um and uh and there's something very very

14
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:38,360
significant about the kind of beginning instruction because it's not just beginning it's kind of like in some ways

15
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,439
the whole thing or represents something really really significant

16
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,119
about what we're doing here and in recent years I've liked to us to say

17
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,920
that um there are two kinds of meditators there are beginners and they

18
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:01,119
are experienced beginners so we're all beginners in some

19
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:07,840
way and some of us had a lot more experience being beginners but in some ways we're all beginners uh and that

20
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,959
makes it kind of fresh you know it's uh and it represents kind of a I think

21
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:19,440
something very honest about how life always brings us something new and something new to meet and be present for

22
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:27,280
and find our way with and so um so whether you've meditated before or

23
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:35,200
not welcome nice to have you so let's

24
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,760
um so welcome to this five-week course in introduction to mindfulness

25
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:49,080
meditation and there are people still coming in so maybe I'll uh one of the least important things to to say uh is a

26
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:56,239
little bit about me and um I've been the teacher for this community since

27
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:03,959
1990 and I came to study at Stanford and I'd been a a monk for 10 years

28
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:10,120
practicing here in this country practicing in Japan and Zen monasteries practicing in Southeast Asia in Thailand

29
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:16,239
and Burma and um and that was my life I was really

30
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,360
there was a time in my life to no longer be a monastic but I wasn't you know

31
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,040
leaving Buddhism or something so I I just somehow ended up at Stanford

32
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,239
studying of all things Buddhist studies so I didn't get that far away but then

33
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,439
when I came there the the people in I started teacher training with Jack

34
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:43,159
cornfield and um and Jack cornfield knew the facilitator for a small sitting

35
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:49,480
group in paloalto and they he tell told them well you can invite guil to be the teacher

36
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:58,360
and so I came there to start teaching in 19 August 1990 and um and then uh slowly over

37
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,760
those time that things grew and developed until it became uh active

38
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:11,159
enough for us to buy our own place and so and um in 2000 end of 2001 we bought

39
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:18,880
this place from the wonderful ministers we had this beautiful couple who they really wanted us to buy their church

40
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,960
because they were kind of mystical Christians and they sat in silence and

41
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:29,039
then we sit in silence so they really wanted us to have it and um so we had a

42
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:34,199
wonderful relationship with him a lot of love and a lot of kind of a mystical not

43
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:39,880
mystical but contemplative beautiful silence we had together and

44
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:48,639
um and so then we've been here now for 22 years it's a long time it's hard to

45
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:55,120
believe so um I have a lot of experience meditating that that mean I started

46
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,560
meditating when I was 19 and that was

47
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:09,960
oh when you do the math that was half a century ago it's kind of unbelievable so

48
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,520
so I've been doing this for a long time and uh I something I love doing and

49
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:22,240
um and uh something that has brought me a tremendous amount of benefit

50
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,240
tremendous healing tremendous uh wisdom tremendous Freedom

51
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:35,000
tremendous capacity for compassion and and um and it's brought me a lot of ease

52
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,960
in my life and uh so it's been a wonderful journey and um and so it's one of my

53
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:48,840
favorite things I said to teach this inter meditation class and for some of you maybe it's a beginning of a journey

54
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,240
and for some of you it just continues a journey because that's what I I think of from the point of view of Buddhism this

55
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:02,080
practice or meditation that's what life is it's one endless Journey that every step is so wonderful to do and now part

56
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:09,520
of the benefit of mindfulness meditation there's something that teaches us about the tremendous value of The Next Step

57
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:16,639
the next breath this moment here and so we find fulfillment in a certain way not

58
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:24,639
from the conventions of conventional ways of being fulfilled in life not by having jobs or finding partnership or

59
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,919
getting praise or getting wealthy or um I don't know

60
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:36,000
having wonderful recreational experiences and Vacations or there's a lot of things people

61
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:44,319
pursue um uh conventionally in order to be fulfilled to be happy that um are not

62
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:51,120
that are kind of that are kind of from a Buddhist point of view are kind of fragile they easily disappear and they

63
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,560
get challenged and many people it's not enough to have success and they want

64
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,720
more and the people there's lots of people in our Society who are poor lots of people who are struggling with

65
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:11,759
oppression and racism and different things and um and and there too to to be caught in

66
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:18,199
that world interactive world and and uh maybe not caught but kind of Trapped in

67
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:25,479
it because of how Society is meditation teaches that there's a kind of a side door to take that doesn't

68
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:33,400
really cure racism but creates a very different landscape that can again be healing can

69
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:39,599
be uh freeing can bring a Kind of Love kind of Peace that's not dependent on

70
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,680
what goes on around us and that provides people with a lot of Courage it provides

71
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:50,919
people a lot of confidence provides people with um a much more sense of um

72
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:56,240
sense the word of the day fulfillment that they can be fulfilled and happy

73
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,319
without the world around them changing

74
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,840
I have a book on mindfulness that's available for free on the on the counter you're welcome to take one if you're

75
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:12,280
when you leave there might be more of you than there are books on the counter but we have lots in the shelves so just

76
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:20,840
we can pull out more but the reason I'm mentioning it is it starts off with a story of um the Ancient Ancient World

77
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:28,560
where um they um there was a king who uh

78
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,919
they every back then walked around Barefoot and the king one day stubbed

79
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:40,919
his toe cut his foot or something so he ordered his people to carpet the Kingdom

80
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:48,399
so he wouldn't hurt himself again and someone said you know that's there's an easier way than carpeting the kingdom

81
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:55,160
just make shoes for everyone and then you can go anywhere and so in a sense to try to change the

82
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:03,120
world the whole world to make it just perfect for you so everything is good good um it's a lot of work and what's

83
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,000
much more realistic is figure out how to wear shoes and so wherever you step it

84
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,959
become safe for you and so mindfulness is a way to find maybe it's kind of

85
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:20,279
funny to call it shoes but uh to every every every Everything You Touch with

86
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:25,680
your senses everything you see and hear everything you think everything that

87
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,800
happens to you you have now have uh a u a safety net you have a you have a

88
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,240
capacity you have a means by which to know it and be with it that you're

89
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:44,279
protected you're safe in some deep inner way and uh and that's a lot better than

90
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:50,760
carpeting the world to make it all work for you and some people are very busy trying to change the world when it's

91
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:57,600
easier to change yourself so um I love teaching this

92
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,040
class and I hope to hope that this is nice for you you get a taste of uh This

93
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,279
Joy and kind of what's what's how mindfulness can be nice and

94
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:15,800
um um IMC our Center here is a Buddhist center it is a Buddhist Meditation I'm

95
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:21,440
teaching and though we're kind of Buddhist light here so we don't really

96
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:28,760
care whether you're a Buddhist or not doesn't that that's not really important you don't have to adopt Buddhist beliefs

97
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:34,240
ideas teachings in order to do this practice this practice uh does not me

98
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,360
the practice doesn't need Buddhism um Buddhism needs the

99
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:45,320
practice so um so if you come to do the practice and you hear me refer to

100
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:51,320
Buddhism and it's maybe it's weird or you know something just know that that's

101
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,760
the Buddhism part is take it or leave it it's all take it or leave it but just just just a little warning in case some

102
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:02,639
people some people get a little uncomfortable with the Buddhist

103
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:10,639
references and um the um so the way this course works is it's

104
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:17,279
five weeks and the instructions is Progressive so uh today we'll talk about

105
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:23,160
some basic ideas of meditation posture to kind of and then meditation on

106
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:30,279
breathing and with that as a foundation and then hopefully you'll practice a little bit at home and then next week

107
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:37,800
we'll build on that to do mindfulness of the body the body is phenomenally important um and so much so that it's

108
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:43,120
maybe unfortunate that we they translated into English the word Sati as

109
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:50,120
the ancient Indian word Sati as mindfulness uh it's probably I would have preferred they have chosen B chosen

110
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:56,800
body fullness because to really learn how to be embodied as part of mindfulness as part of where our

111
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:03,560
attention and awareness resides is uh is Central to this whole journey that we're

112
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:09,200
on and then the third week is mindfulness of emotions and um and

113
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:15,240
people have complicated relationships with their emotions but to be a human being is to have emotions some people

114
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:21,959
have them strong sometime people have them weak but they're still important part of life and so the idea is to fold

115
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:27,880
emotions into the practice not to push them away not to try to deny them or

116
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:36,000
have shame around them or feel like some are you shouldn't have some mindfulness is a is a amazing place when you do

117
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,399
mindful meditation that you can really open to the inner emotional life in a particular way that's very healthy and

118
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:50,560
healthy for that inner life of ours the fourth week we'll talk about mindfulness of thinking and for some

119
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,040
people who meditate there's a war between thinking and meditation because they think so much and they think they

120
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:03,240
shouldn't be thinking when we do mindfulness medit ation there's no divide like that that um certainly

121
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,639
sometimes the mind gets very quiet almost like it doesn't think at all and that's quite nice but there there we

122
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:14,480
don't we don't mindfulness practice we're not living in a divide between how things should be and how things actually

123
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:22,160
are we're always being present for how things are as they are and if we're thinking a lot then um

124
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:28,079
the idea is to learn how to bring mindfulness to that in a way that's beneficial for us how to bring attention

125
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:33,560
and awareness to it so we're not caught in the thoughts we're not being driven and pushed around by the thoughts or

126
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,839
troubled by our thoughts and so we learn how to be mindful of them and um but you

127
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:43,880
don't have to stop thinking so don't we don't want to set up this strong dichotomy strong

128
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:51,160
separation thinking is wrong and meditation is supposed to be silent so we'll talk about that on the

129
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:58,040
fourth week and it's a lot easier reason we wait wait for the fourth week to talk about thinking is that it's a lot easier

130
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:03,959
to have this uh useful attention to thinking if you're first have if you know how to be

131
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:11,519
mindful of breathing you know how to be present for your body and you know how to be present for emotions those three

132
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:18,800
then really are huge support for mindfulness of thinking and then the fifth week will be how to P pull all

133
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,880
these together so they work together as a whole not only in meditation but also

134
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,639
outside into our daily life and U and one of the one of the benefits of

135
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:36,839
learning mindfulness comes from not keeping the mindfulness to meditation but learning how to bring a higher

136
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:42,399
quality attention awareness uh into our daily activities in life and so the

137
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:49,560
benefits of meditation are carried with us into into our life in the way we live and then um from from a Buddhist point

138
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:55,440
of view then we learn how to live with much more freedom in our life than many

139
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:04,360
people experience when they're caught in their attachments caught in their fears caught in their Ambitions or

140
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:14,519
preoccupations so that's the kind of uh the path we'll take and um in the um so we'll do uh

141
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:19,560
I'll do some teaching we'll do probably most days we'll do one or two short

142
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:25,120
periods of meditation and then um and then uh

143
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:32,680
you'll be a chance for some questions and um and hopefully you'll feel well engaged

144
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:39,000
in all this so

145
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,920
um the other thing that I want to say as a as an introduction to this kind of mindfulness

146
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:58,079
meditation is that um it can be many people find it challenging many people find it

147
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:04,040
challenging to sit quietly and to um have their mind be quiet or sit still

148
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:11,040
and because they're Restless or they're something and um the

149
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,639
um um i' like to kind of encourage you

150
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,399
to consider that either it's impossible to fail when you do this

151
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:28,839
meditation or we simply don't bother with the orientation that you're doing

152
00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:34,800
it right or wrong or you you're succeeding or not succeeding it's just a waste of time when you meditate to have

153
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,360
those thoughts um so you're kind of it's fine whatever happens to you when you

154
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,839
meditate the approach here is it's fine it's just one more thing to be

155
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:53,240
mindful of one more thing to be aware of to really recognize it this is a practice of recognizing what is as I

156
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:59,480
said earlier recognizing what is not recognizing what you think should be

157
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:05,280
and many people want things to happen they should happen I mean many people are suffering and challenged and in

158
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:13,600
their lives so of course we want to be happy but the path here in this mindfulness tradition is Define that by

159
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:21,000
learning how to be present for this experience now in a productive way in a useful way to really learn the art of

160
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,558
how do we show up for our life in the moment no matter what's happening to us

161
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:32,919
and um so that's that's why you can't fail because you just get to have be

162
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:38,679
where you are and then the Journey of discovering well how do I have a

163
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:45,240
productive how do I have a useful attention to this how do I hold this with care with compassion how do I hold

164
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:51,200
it with ease how can how can I be relaxed even with this even with this as

165
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,840
opposed to fighting it or justifying it or all kinds of complicated things that we

166
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:04,559
do so please come in you can come in anywhere to a chair and and

167
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:12,440
U you arrived at a good time because it's kind of like we're starting

168
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:19,720
now so I thought maybe a nice way of beginning is um to do something really

169
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:26,320
short to give you a little taste of what's possible that it doesn't have to be a long meditation to benefit from

170
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,799
this mindfulness practice and uh you can do it in the posture you're in you don't have to change your

171
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:38,760
posture because in this is can be done in daily life as well and it doesn't require you know anything more than just

172
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:46,600
a few seconds I call it the three breath journey and that is uh to close your

173
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:53,840
eyes and just hang out with three breaths you can count them one two three

174
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,880
and just with your eyes closed just stay there with three breaths

175
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,039
so why don't you try

176
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:29,400
that so maybe that was three breaths so what happened in three over

177
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:36,039
in the course of three breaths did anything change for you or is it nothing changed like why way did I do

178
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:39,639
that anybody want to

179
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,240
share yes please it's kind of nice and relax a little louder it's kind of nice

180
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:56,679
and relaxing kind of nice and relaxing in three breaths uhuh great someone

181
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:03,080
else oh I just noticed distractions you

182
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:08,799
noticed distraction well that's one of the primary things we're trying to do is notice what's happening for us and you

183
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:15,080
think it was useful to notice that yeah I I noticed it and was able to

184
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:22,760
refocus on breathing uhhuh and that was a nice thing to do it was great how

185
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:28,360
so just the sense that I don't have to be at the mercy of what's going on

186
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:36,158
around me or what I'm what thought comes into my head great lovely that's a great

187
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:51,280
lesson I felt a little bit like once I paid attention to my breath I wanted to

188
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:58,720
control it so and then it just took me a bit to try and relax and have it come at its

189
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,480
own uh Rhythm uhhuh I don't think I accomplished that in three breaths

190
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,400
though you know it u in the way that we do mindfulness uh it's enough just to

191
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:17,159
notice you're trying to control it you don't have to stop doing it the stopping will take care of itself

192
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:23,520
if you if you just if you see clearly what's happening that's all we're that's all we're doing in the main thing in

193
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,679
mindfulness practice and uh and then it's remarkable if you stay like that very simple and just say oh it's like

194
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:35,360
that it's like that um something begins happening without you having to fix it

195
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,919
and that's a real that's a real cool thing to see happen but I think I think it's

196
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:47,799
fantastic that you saw that you were trying to control it and I apologize if I'm completely miss you or something but

197
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:53,720
what I see is when people report right away when they sit sit down that they're trying to control the breathing it

198
00:21:53,720 --> 00:22:00,240
represents a tendency that's playing out in their life in other ways as well and so so it's a good tendency to see this

199
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,480
is the good place to see it and kind of work with it and find another

200
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:14,919
way time slowed down for me time slowed down for you very nice so in three

201
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:21,279
breaths very nice so it didn't take long did it so some of you found it was nice

202
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:27,360
and so imagine if you did that you know I don't know once an hour through the

203
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,880
day it probably change your day quite a bit and it doesn't take the three breaths

204
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,840
doesn't take long and how many times in your daily life or you're just waiting for something to happen that where you

205
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:45,679
you could you could take the three breaths oh I don't have to wait I can just do three breaths and then see what

206
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:51,880
happens so mindfulness can be that easy we're going to meditate for longer but

207
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:58,320
uh but I think getting that message that can be that simple um and to do it repeatedly that three breath Journey

208
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:06,799
over over days of over the day here and there just whenever it seems like it's nice um you begin you start you start

209
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:12,279
building up a familiarity to all these little tricks of the Mind the body how

210
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:18,600
you are how you how things can shift you have you develop a capacity to let go of

211
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:25,440
whatever you're caught up in in the moment in some small degree and to have that kind of accumulation of those

212
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,320
lessons over time is really be very helpful in any life we

213
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:40,720
live so we practice meditation which is sitting quietly for some kind of extended period of time and um and the

214
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,880
classic idea of meditation is sit on the floor cross-legged it's not necessary to

215
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:52,880
do that those of you who are going to do your meditation in a chair you can be reassured or be inspired that the in

216
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,320
Buddhist lore and this the kind of Buddhist mythology the next Buddha will

217
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:05,080
be a chair sitter so um maybe you know maybe

218
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:10,559
you and U but uh there's something nice about sitting on the floor because it's

219
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:17,120
easier to have a kind of a the stability of a tripod uh your two knees and your bottom

220
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,760
creates a nice kind of foundation that uh in a low center of gravity that lets

221
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:29,720
kind of the upper torso kind of relax and settle and um many ago I read a study

222
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,840
that said that the two human postures that allow the human body to relax the

223
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:42,039
most is in yoga What's called the corpse posture when you're laying on your back and uh sitting in full Lotus like this

224
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:49,320
upright that's something about this alignment of these postures allow for a deeper relaxation over

225
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:55,080
time so it's nice to do this if you can and um the way we it's usually done is

226
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:02,159
you want to be elevated a bit and uh depending how open your hips are um it

227
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:08,600
will depend how high you want to sit if you're tight in your hips the higher you want to sit and if you're really loose

228
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:15,279
you can sit pretty low but you want to have enough height so that uh there is a teeny bit of curve in your lower part of

229
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:21,399
the back for most people it's kind of the natural curve that's retained but just a teeny bit not overarch but just a

230
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:27,760
little bit so there's a teeny bit of of uh uh movement in the spine that helps

231
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:33,159
push you the rest of your torso upright and alert

232
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:38,679
um and then there's also sitting on your knees like the gentleman here that's

233
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:44,799
that's uh's you're sitting on top of a cushion that way and some people find that works really well for them um and

234
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:50,640
the gentleman here is sitting on a bench we have it we have these benches in the back in the corner there and some people

235
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:57,880
love sitting in those benches and that's uh easier than cross-legged for some people and U but it gets you low center

236
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:05,919
of gravity if you're sitting in a chair the um um the classic instruction

237
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:11,600
is to have both feet uh flat on the ground in front of you and have the feet

238
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,960
parallel to each other legs and with with the the knees slightly lower than

239
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,399
the hips so that because if the knees are above the hips it tends to push out

240
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:27,840
the spine in the lower back it causes trouble over time and if it's um and if

241
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:34,159
you need to have extra help we have a variety of cushions here and if you're if you're short you can put

242
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:40,840
a a cushion underneath your your your feet if you're tall then you want to

243
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:48,120
maybe put a cushion underneath the the SE on the seat of your chair so that um you get the right kind of way in which

244
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:55,559
your your knees are just a little bit lower than the hips not a lot lower and not

245
00:26:55,559 --> 00:27:02,240
higher um some people people like to have their legs out wide like in a triangle they feel stable that way but

246
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:08,320
the idea is to have a feeling of stability in the feet um that you're really here in a strong way so you're

247
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:15,080
rooted here with the feet firmly on the ground and then if possible to sit uh as

248
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:20,240
Alert in the chair as you can upright in the chair as you can some people find it

249
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:26,919
really nice not to use the back rest there's something that extra alertness that comes when you're not resting the

250
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:33,360
body against something but you're holding it up yourself and it supports being really present here sometimes when

251
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:39,559
people are using a backr too much it's kind of like you're being supported and some people are lulled into kind of

252
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:46,279
being a little bit complacent and not engaged fully in the practice but whatever you need to do so

253
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:51,799
you're comfortable um to do the practice um but the point is not to be

254
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:57,600
super comfortable don't don't like try to like because you're supposed to you think meditation is about all about relaxing and you're going to find

255
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:05,080
absolutely the most comfortable posture with you know that you can so that you can relax as much as you can that's not

256
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:12,320
the point of mindfulness relaxation is certainly a byproduct of this practice and it's really helpful up to a point

257
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:19,880
but if it's overemphasize and that's if that's the be all and end all of what you're trying to do when you're meditating you're you're Miss missing

258
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:26,519
out on the benefits that come from developing a calm but clear awareness

259
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:32,240
and so what we're looking for for is a balance between calmness and

260
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:39,640
alertness and if you overemphasize calmness then you lose the alertness if you over emphatize alertness then you

261
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:45,679
might lose the calmness it's a little bit stressful and so it is to find the balance and some of that is found

262
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:52,799
through the posture so the idea is to have a posture that supports both calmness and

263
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:58,640
alertness in our tradition we meditate with the eyes closed and and um but some

264
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,720
people prefer meditating with their eyes open which is fine to do um in our

265
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:10,480
tradition we emphasize in having your eyes kind of half open looking 45 degrees down to the floor with a very

266
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:18,360
loose Focus like you're looking at a mountain in the distance and the hands uh can be in many

267
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:24,760
many ways um these in the last decade or so I've been having my hands on my

268
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:30,320
thighs this way and um for decades before that I had my hands together like

269
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:36,799
this when I meditated and sometimes it goes back and forth still and um one of

270
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:42,720
the things you have to be look out where your hands are that your hands are not so far forward that they're pulling your

271
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:49,679
shoulders forward so because then it's very easy many of us you know in the computer all day or something and are

272
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:56,559
leaning forward already and so we want to kind of not be constantly kind of pulling over and so bringing bringing

273
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:02,799
the hands back so the elbows are right along the sides here of the body and if you're sitting with the

274
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:08,080
hands together Somehow Here rather than resting them on the ankle which

275
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:13,200
sometimes pulls you forward also is to get something that you

276
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:19,000
um you so there your hands are resting higher up and this kind of keeps the

277
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,640
chest a little bit more open and and and relaxed so that's kind of the basics

278
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,840
there's more I could say but that's I think for their purposes tonight so

279
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:37,120
let's uh uh try it I'll do a guided meditation on um beginning the

280
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:43,120
meditation which just getting started every meditation has a period of preparation getting getting warmed up

281
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,159
for it and then we'll switch over to do a few minutes of mindfulness of

282
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:53,559
breathing so uh so and if you need to get it we have lots of cushions there if

283
00:30:53,559 --> 00:31:00,200
you want to try to get some more cushions and make yourself more comfortable you're welcome to do

284
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:07,200
that so assuming a posture that for you is a comfortable

285
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,638
posture that helps you sit

286
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:17,080
upright and gently closing your

287
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:33,480
eyes and the first task is to just relax the surface tension of the

288
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:42,399
day one way to do that is to take a few deeper breaths not too deep but deep enough to

289
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:49,760
be really feel your body stretch and expand your torso and then as you exhale

290
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,840
to relax your

291
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:02,039
body the deep

292
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:08,240
inhales are a way to feel connected to start making a connection to your

293
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,880
immediate experience of your

294
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:20,679
body and the exhale is a time to relax into your

295
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:32,720
body and then letting your breathing return to

296
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:39,679
normal but continue the process of relaxing on the

297
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,638
exhale starting with the muscles of your

298
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:51,398
face as you exhale softening the forehead and around the

299
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,039
eyes

300
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,600
as you exhale softening the

301
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:22,080
shoulders as you exhale relaxing the

302
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,960
belly

303
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:58,960
and maybe in the next few exhales softening your whole body

304
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:22,679
and there's one more place where it's nice to relax and that is any tension or

305
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:30,040
tightness or pressure that you might feel that connected to your

306
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:36,320
thinking maybe behind the forehead and middle of the

307
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:43,839
head maybe in the shoulders sometimes in the chest

308
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:50,480
wherever that there might be some tightness connected to thinking the thinking

309
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:58,879
muscle for the next three exhales relax that thinking

310
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,960
relax your thinking

311
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,800
muscle

312
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,000
and then

313
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:47,920
you notice now where in your

314
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:54,640
body is the experience of breathing most pronounced for

315
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:04,040
you where is it easiest to feel the movements in the body as you

316
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:11,200
breathe some people is the movements of the

317
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:20,400
chest some people the movements of the belly the

318
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:30,000
diaphragm some people enjoy feeling the movement of the air going in and out

319
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,319
through the

320
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,400
nostrils and some people like experiencing all those

321
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:46,839
together somehow the whole experience of breathing in the

322
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:55,079
body in a sense we're looking to notice how the body your body

323
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:58,680
experiences breathing

324
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:32,200
and whatever way you're breathing is completely

325
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:42,160
fine it's not about how you're breathing it's about how you stay connected to it

326
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,960
aware of

327
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:03,280
breathing instead of attention going to reinforce

328
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:09,319
thinking we use our attention to reinforce being present

329
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:16,000
here and now in our bodies as we

330
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,520
breathe

331
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:03,520
and sooner or later you'll notice your mind is distracted or pulled into a world of

332
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:13,000
thoughts you're not doing meditation wrong when that happens it's

333
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:19,720
okay what the meditation is what we do then is just recognize

334
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:27,520
clearly I'm thinking recognizing you're

335
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:32,880
thinking is not staying on the train of

336
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:39,040
thoughts stepping away and saying oh look at

337
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:44,119
that and then Begin Again with your

338
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,400
breathing

339
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:19,599
if the thinking mind is strong then you might start all over

340
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:24,720
again with the little exercises in relaxing the

341
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,960
body relaxing a thinking

342
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:58,319
mind

343
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,240
for

344
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:50,680
if you find yourself drifting off in thoughts often

345
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:58,240
strongly you can always do the three breath Journey

346
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,280
just to be content with three

347
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:15,359
breaths and then maybe do it

348
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,160
again

349
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,160
for

350
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:28,079
for

351
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:59,720
and then as we come come to the near the end of this

352
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:06,599
meditation you might pause briefly from being with your breathing

353
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:12,240
or trying to be with your breath and

354
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:19,480
instead see if you can recognize how you feel right now how are

355
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:30,000
you and see if in whatever way you are or you can let it be enough just to know

356
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:38,000
it just to recognize oh this is how I am without adding anything more to that

357
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:45,200
any judgments or commentary reactions to it oh this is

358
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,558
how it

359
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,960
is

360
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:08,359
and whatever way you are in the middle of it now return to

361
00:45:08,359 --> 00:45:16,720
your breathing as if you're breathing into the middle of how you are

362
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:23,359
out of the middle allowing yourself yourself to be

363
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:28,558
the way you are but Cent h on your

364
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,880
breathing

365
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:27,079
and then to end the [Music] meditation again take take a few long

366
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:34,440
slow deep breaths and as you breathe in deeply

367
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:41,000
feel your body more fully reconnect more fully to your

368
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:47,240
body feel your body against your cushion the

369
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,400
chair the

370
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:03,240
floor and then when you're ready you can open

371
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,440
your

372
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:17,739
[Music]

373
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,720
eyes

374
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:37,280
so many years ago I was on a Meditation Retreat up in the Santa Cruz

375
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:43,040
mountains and there was a I had a break from the schedule and I was sitting at

376
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:50,359
the bank of a small Creek of very clear water and as I looked at the water it

377
00:47:50,359 --> 00:47:55,440
was very shallow but very clear I looked at it and said I don't

378
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,880
think think the water is moving I think but it's a creek so it's probably moving

379
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:10,240
so I was kind of like looking at it so then I took a stick that was next to me and I put the stick into the water um

380
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:15,520
vertically and then a little wake little waves got formed on the edge of the of

381
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:21,760
the of the stick oh yes the water is moving and this is the direction it's

382
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:27,160
moving sometimes with our in our life we don't see see what's happening to us

383
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:32,680
very clearly we're caught up in our thoughts we're caught up in our activities our feelings what's going on

384
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:39,319
and we're so involved in it we don't quite know what's happening but it's useful to have a reference

385
00:48:39,319 --> 00:48:46,119
point that from which we can see oh look at that so in meditation the breathing

386
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:54,280
is that reference point if you um sit down and try to follow a series

387
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:59,400
of breaths in a row and you very quickly realize you

388
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:06,280
can't my mind is out of control then now you and you didn't know

389
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:11,559
that until you started to be with your breathing then the meditation has been

390
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:18,440
successful not at following the breath but that's not necessarily the point the point is to see yourself more clearly oh

391
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:25,319
look at that my mind is out of control and we say in N tradition that

392
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:31,319
it's it's better if you have a mind that's out of control it's better to know it than not know

393
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:37,359
it and so having that reference point trying to be with the breath and not being able to because the mind is

394
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:44,160
spinning or preoccupied or or there's feelings and emotions which are bubbling up and all that if there's reactions

395
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:50,599
being bored like just making commentary about what's happening this is you know this is the best thing since peanut

396
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:57,720
butter you know this is great then uh all those things are taking Tak you away from the Simplicity

397
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:03,960
of just being here and so rather than being upset that it's taking you away from the Simplicity

398
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:11,720
of just being with your breathing it's actually the whole point is to be able to see yourself clearly look at

399
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:17,599
that I'm I'm thinking about peanut butter all the time when I meditate isn't that fascinating what's going on

400
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:24,920
with me I had no idea now that I think about it now that I realize it I'm thinking about peanut butter all day

401
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:35,280
it's probably peanut butter but some people that's what they do there's some equivalent and um so um so it's a way of

402
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:41,839
highlighting and seeing ourselves getting to know ourselves better so if you try to sit down to be

403
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:48,040
with the breathing and it doesn't work that's okay the meditation works if

404
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:54,680
you see what it is that's distracting you what's C oh that's what it is some

405
00:50:54,680 --> 00:51:00,880
people get so frustrated because they can't stay present for the breathing um and that's unfortunate

406
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:06,720
because that's not the point the the main point is to see ourselves

407
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:14,280
clearly but as we but if you're able to stay with a breath the breath is a is classically a calming for most people

408
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:20,240
not everyone a calming uh influence on us and if you

409
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:25,599
can stay with the breathing breathe mindfully it tends to calm the the

410
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:30,799
nervous system some people find that just breathing a little bit exhaling a little

411
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:36,280
bit longer than usual helps that calming of the system down many people live

412
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:42,359
tense lives preoccupied lives so it's good to calm and so that calming effect

413
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:48,160
sometimes is contagious kind of like oh this is interesting I want to stay with this because it feels good and then

414
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:56,000
you're kind of in the world of breathing which can be nice and then but to stay with breathing sometimes you get calmer

415
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:02,400
quieter and some people you know really like meditation because things get quieter the mind gets quieter the

416
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:10,200
tensions in the body tend to fade away over time um mostly because we're not reinforcing them anymore but in the

417
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:15,720
daily life we go around thinking the same things having the same emotional responses and reactions and so the

418
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:21,440
tension is just being reinforced you know the Fe for fear all the time and every place we go we're afraid of

419
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:27,119
something you know show but before you know our shoulders up by the ears we don't even know it because that's just

420
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:32,359
normal and then we sit down to meditate and we're no longer living in that fear

421
00:52:32,359 --> 00:52:39,040
World slowly the shoulders begin to relax because they're not being

422
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:44,599
reinforced as we stay with the breathing and just relax with it that supports

423
00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:50,359
this this movement of no longer feeding our reactivity feeding our

424
00:52:50,359 --> 00:52:56,799
preoccupations as we get calmer we start seeing deeper layers of

425
00:52:56,799 --> 00:53:04,119
our reactivity deeper layers of the operating principles of what makes us run and what's driving us that is often

426
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:10,240
um happening uh out of sight from ordinary life we see some of the common

427
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:16,119
patterns of emotions that really are influence us or driving us or in you

428
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:21,839
know affecting us we see some of the beliefs and thoughts assumptions we have

429
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:28,839
that are kind of hidden because we're so much in the surface mind so bus and activated so there's a value of getting

430
00:53:28,839 --> 00:53:36,240
quieter and quieter because it allows us to see what's happening with us clearer and

431
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:41,799
clearer I'm emphasizing this so you don't set up breath meditation as

432
00:53:41,799 --> 00:53:49,799
something you can do and fail at there's no failing it's it's uh you do it the best

433
00:53:49,799 --> 00:53:57,040
you can and then you learn from how you're not doing it then you're 100% doing meditation

434
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:02,480
accurately oh look at that that's what that's why I keep losing the breath

435
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:09,640
because I'm much more interested in peanut butter who would have guessed you know like wow I'm like a peanut butter

436
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:15,880
junkie and um boy I better stop eating peanut butter for breakfast lunch and dinner I that that's going to consume

437
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:21,160
all my waking hours so I'm being silly with that but it's not a silly phenomena

438
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:27,960
that people get preoccupied with all kinds of things um and um and um and

439
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:33,280
that's what they think about all the time or concerned with all the time sometimes it's kind of sad you know some

440
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:41,200
people there's a lot of people in our society we have a society that um that

441
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:46,839
uh feeds us fear Society social kind of constructs

442
00:54:46,839 --> 00:54:52,920
that really reinforce fear and feeling of inadequacy of who we are and it's and

443
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:59,200
then people take it very personally a personal failure which really a society that's kind of teaching this to

444
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:04,760
us and we're some people are caught up in some level of anxiety all the

445
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:11,799
time to see that and be able to just see it and breathe with it and relax with it

446
00:55:11,799 --> 00:55:18,000
is life-changing if it's an alternative to always being caught up in it and some

447
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:24,520
people come to meditation and discover that they I had no idea how that was pervasive I'm always anxious I didn't

448
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:30,640
know it's sad but it's really inspiring to

449
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:37,359
finally see it the principle in this practice here that it's much better if

450
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:42,920
you see what you're doing see what's driving you than not knowing it at

451
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:48,760
all once you see it the idea is to be really simple with

452
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:57,119
it don't there's no need in this meditation to judge yourself no need to to uh feel like

453
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:03,720
anything that you do when you're sitting quietly in this kind of meditation posture is wrong that it's just

454
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:11,640
something else to see it's something else to know and to hold kind of like you're your best

455
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:17,160
friend or you know maybe some of you I hope some of you have had the experience of either being someone's friend or

456
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:24,440
someone being your friend where one of the people is really Disturbed really upset about something and you sit on a

457
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:30,760
bench and one of the the friend just listens to you just is there accompany you it doesn't try to fix you it doesn't

458
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:38,319
try to solve anything they're really good listener and something in your system relaxes with that so they

459
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:44,119
meditation we're being our own friend we're just listening we're just being with how we are so that something in our

460
00:56:44,119 --> 00:56:49,160
nervous system can relax so so the idea has to be simple be

461
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:56,319
that friend oh that's how it is oh that's how it is okay let's go back to breathing in the middle of it let's go

462
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:02,480
back because maybe there's more to discover let's go back and breathe breathe and then sometimes maybe you

463
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:10,079
breathe for not three breaths but 10 breaths maybe sometimes you start feeling there's a kind of little um um

464
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:17,599
at some point where uh you stay long enough with a series of breaths you kind of like Get In the Groove with

465
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:23,799
it and it just feels like you're starting getting concentrated and oh this is really good and it just feels

466
00:57:23,799 --> 00:57:28,880
very sweet there's all this wonderful sweetness or actually kind of inner

467
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:35,599
beauty where the breath feels really beautiful you feel really beautiful on inside that comes from being absorbed or

468
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:41,480
being really kind of t uh kind of tuned into the breath over

469
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:46,880
time so that's one of the byproducts can happen don't try to make that

470
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:53,599
happen you know anytime you try to make something happen meditation then guess

471
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:59,480
what that's that's the opportunity to see look at that I'm trying to make something

472
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:05,000
happen turns out I'm I'm trying to do that all day long I do it all day long

473
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:11,880
trying to make something happen fix something adjust something improve something now I'm doing a medit of

474
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:18,200
course I'm doing it in meditation look at that now I can see it much more clearly I keep even here I'm doing it

475
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:24,799
wow I guess meditation is working I see it as opposed to oh no I can't meditate

476
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:31,480
I'm a terrible meditator because I'm always trying so that kind of attitude now I'm

477
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:37,680
not doing it right I'm a terrial meditator that's one of those odd things that's a self-fulfilling

478
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:43,079
prophecy if you have that belief it kind of becomes true but you don't have to

479
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:49,720
believe it don't don't go that way that's that the meditation is a radically different Paradigm of how to

480
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:57,440
be with oneself just to know this is how it is so now I'll take some questions or

481
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:03,760
about any of this we've done so far but before I do that I want to say I forgot to say at the beginning you know my

482
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:08,960
voice is kind of quiet so if you have trouble hearing me you can raise your hand and ask us to turn up the volume

483
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:15,599
but we also have a hearing system devices just outside there on the counter and you can uh go now if you

484
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:22,680
want them or anytime you come here those hearing system devices work well too to to augment the

485
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:30,039
sound so any questions about anything or concerns about anything that so

486
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:51,039
far hello um so I meditated for a few years now closer

487
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:59,799
here can you hear me now okay so meditated for a few years now and somebody once told me that when you eat

488
00:59:59,799 --> 01:00:08,480
and then you meditate after it's it's not good because your concentration is doesn't it gets how you say it wouldn't

489
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:16,760
work you yeah yeah and so I never listen to it but I always meditate in the morning before itat and so today we ate

490
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:22,000
right before we came here and I realized that is that has some kind of Truth in

491
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:28,160
it or it's just I don't know just

492
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:38,599
thinking so it's very interesting what you say the idea in meditation in mindfulness meditation is

493
01:00:38,599 --> 01:00:43,839
to learn to become your own teacher so you so the way you become

494
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:51,839
your own teacher is to experiment with that um uh um uh sometimes meditate

495
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:58,880
before you eat like before breakfast and see how that is sometimes do it afterwards and then see what works for

496
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:04,480
you some people find that it's easier to be present for meditation if their

497
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:10,079
stomach is not full other people find that only by uh eating a little bit

498
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:16,760
first do they have the energy and Clarity to be able to practice attention so different people are

499
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:24,000
different this way so rather than me telling you what it should be it's much better if you become the uh you discover

500
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:30,359
for yourself by trial and error different things is that okay yeah thank

501
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:36,920
you but there is a long tradition of meditators medit meditating first thing

502
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:42,280
in the morning um kind of before everyone else is awake and it's so it

503
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:50,079
can be so sweet you it's still very quiet there's not many cars on the road it's maybe dark it just feels like like

504
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:56,559
there's all this support for just being present and quiet and and calm and and

505
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:03,119
uh some people find the advantage of meditating as soon after they wake up is that um the momentum of daily concerns

506
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:09,520
hasn't built up and uh and so it's a really nice time some people find other people find that

507
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:15,920
it's terrible to meditate first thing in the morning and they're just so anxious and they can't wait for their cup of coffee

508
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:21,119
and you know so the idea is to learn how it works for you there was a long time

509
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:27,119
period in my life where I meditated um twice a day the when I was in college I

510
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:32,240
meditated the first thing in the morning and um the 40 40 minutes before I went

511
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:38,880
to bed in the in the evening and that was my rhythm and that was a great Rhythm for me there was another period

512
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:44,279
of time where I meditated first thing in the morning and then I meditated when I

513
01:02:44,279 --> 01:02:50,440
came back from work in the in the 6:00 and that was really great to come back

514
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:56,839
from work and and just kind of clear out and a lot of the first half of the meditation was clearing out all the

515
01:02:56,839 --> 01:03:03,160
momentum and stuff of the work day and the second half the of the meditation I had the benefit of then being cleared

516
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:08,680
out and now I was sitting there really clear and that was clear for the rest of the evening it was a real like I was

517
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:16,200
refreshed and clear and renewed for the evening so they he has to experiment and find out what's nice

518
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:21,920
and so there's a couple of can we he was he had his hand up before and

519
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:27,079
then um I was actually going to ask about meditating in the morning yeah and

520
01:03:27,079 --> 01:03:32,480
trade-offs between you know there being I guess nothing to be worried about yet

521
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:37,760
yeah the day just started um but you you addressed it so thank you yeah and I

522
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:44,720
mean if if a person has lots of time and ability it's great to do it two times a day just because you different times a

523
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:49,920
day you different benefits in different ways but most people can't do it you

524
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:55,480
know lot people at work and they have responsibilities and and um so you know

525
01:03:55,480 --> 01:04:03,279
once a day is plenty yeah so when I first heard that when I first started

526
01:04:03,279 --> 01:04:08,680
that you can't fail at meditating um I remember I took that and interpreted

527
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:14,160
that as so whenever I sat down I would just do whatever let my mind go wherever

528
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:20,559
and I just go you know and so now I know a little better but would would you say

529
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:27,160
that that's I don't want to use fail but are you not really medit ating if you just kind of yeah yeah let your let your

530
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:32,680
mind go all over the place yes um it's possible to sit down and not

531
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:38,279
meditate you know sit sit there and just Daydream and you know I can't fail and

532
01:04:38,279 --> 01:04:45,680
I'm thinking about going to Disneyland and buying more peanut butter and those are my first days yeah yeah you know and

533
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:51,200
and there's people who Wasted Years of their life because somehow they got their permission the idea that they're

534
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:56,599
allowed to think anything they want everything's okay in meditation and they're just drifting off in thought

535
01:04:56,599 --> 01:05:04,640
and planning vacations and all that and I mean maybe it's nice to do but it's not meditating to meditate is to

536
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:10,720
recognize what's the core thing of mindfulness is to really recognize oh oh

537
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:18,119
I'm planning vacation oh this is what's happening now but it's not just recognizing it lightly

538
01:05:18,119 --> 01:05:23,440
is to recognize it with such Clarity that it's the equivalent of

539
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:30,039
you're in a it happened happened to me when I was younger once where I was in a crowd of people who are arguing about

540
01:05:30,039 --> 01:05:35,119
something and some reason I had to leave and when I came back a couple minutes

541
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:42,279
later they were still arguing but I was like 10 feet away and I just stood there looking at them and I was no longer in

542
01:05:42,279 --> 01:05:48,520
the argument I was no longer invested I was no longer caught I just watching it from a distance wow that's quite

543
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:54,119
something they're they they're all kind of lost themselves in this argument and they're not listening to each other

544
01:05:54,119 --> 01:05:59,480
other and but I was no longer caught in it so it's like taking a step back from

545
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:04,920
your life and really seeing it and it's not like a checklist approach you know

546
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:10,799
oh you know distracted and that you know let's continue talking thinking about

547
01:06:10,799 --> 01:06:18,440
the distraction it's like oh taking the time oh look at that step back

548
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:24,160
oh I'm planning vacations oh this is what planning vacations are like and

549
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:29,799
what you'll see is what we as we go through these weeks then you can in order to see it more clearly you start

550
01:06:29,799 --> 01:06:35,200
feeling the the sensations and physicality the body side what happens

551
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:41,839
you're thinking about vacations then you start recognizing the emotions that are driving it then you start recognizing

552
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:47,839
knowing how to mindful the thoughts that are driving it so the whole Ecology of what we're doing starts becoming open so

553
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:53,440
the active recognition is seeing kind the big picture of our life what's really all the details of what's

554
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:59,200
Happening and as you do that you're no longer caught in it you're starting to become

555
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:05,119
free and in that freedom the whole system will begin to relax and become

556
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:12,279
calmer and more clear does that make sense yes thank you so there is a there is a kind of purpose

557
01:07:12,279 --> 01:07:18,000
and momentum and all this but um I mean if you really if you're like to fa if

558
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:24,000
you really like the idea of failing yes I mean if you're really just

559
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:30,079
sitting here daydreaming and just not you know paying any attention to what's going on then of course you failed

560
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:35,799
meditating but as soon as you are paying attention then you can't

561
01:07:35,799 --> 01:07:38,960
fail thank

562
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:52,000
you hi um so uh I've been meditating hold Closer Closer okay so I've been

563
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,559
meditating for a while um but I wanted to um sort of contrast the experience of

564
01:07:57,559 --> 01:08:03,279
mindfulness versus another technique so with what I've noticed with um you know

565
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:09,960
like the technique that you're teaching which is just keep coming back to the breath what I find is at least for a

566
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:16,758
while I'm wondering what is it about the breath there's no drama there's no nothing why should I keep going back so

567
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:22,960
there's a certain borom that starts coming in and then slowly I what I notice is the Dynamics that I start

568
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:28,960
settling down become calmer and then it can focus on the breath a lot better

569
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:34,318
does that make any sense or I think so there's there's many many ways of

570
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:39,920
meditating there are different kinds of meditation practice so and even Buddhism we have different meditation practice

571
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:45,600
people do some meditation practices are uh focusing much more on concentration

572
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:51,120
in rather than mindfulness in Buddhism there's just two major movements of

573
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:56,719
meditation there's the mindfulness movement and there's a concentration movement and some people do one or the

574
01:08:56,719 --> 01:09:02,120
other some people combine them in a certain way and that's kind of what we do here at IMC is combine

575
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:07,520
them but some people uh begin with concentration concentration is much

576
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:12,758
easier to fail because you're either concentrated or you're not and the mind

577
01:09:12,759 --> 01:09:19,080
wanders off and you failed you have to come back come back what's the advantage of the concentration approach just come

578
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:24,520
back and come back come back it's really simple you don't have to think about what you're doing you don't have to

579
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:31,480
recognize anything just start again start again come back something for some people something really begins to relax

580
01:09:31,480 --> 01:09:37,560
when it's that simple and you're no longer feeding the distractions so some people it works

581
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:43,798
better to do concentration first and then mindfulness some people works better do mindfulness first than

582
01:09:43,799 --> 01:09:49,080
concentration um some people um it's uh mindfulness turns out to be a

583
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:54,199
phenomenally useful meditation practice to learn to be able to do any other kind

584
01:09:54,199 --> 01:10:01,120
of meditation practices people do or contemplative practices or prayer or spiritual practices people do and a lot

585
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:06,679
of people have come to who who following non- Buddhist religious tradition have

586
01:10:06,679 --> 01:10:13,040
come to learn mindfulness so they can do their own religion better because they see clearly what the mind is doing they

587
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:20,040
see how they get caught they see how they uh can learn how to be more present for what they're doing so is this an

588
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:26,960
adequate answer for you or do you want to ask again no and uh I think that's okay okay

589
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:33,080
I have to kind of practice it some more to understand I tend to try and concentrate which is problem yeah so

590
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:39,679
that's what you did before was the the concentration approach yeah I've been doing trying to do mindfulness also but

591
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:46,239
I tend to start trying to con stay on the breath and then then it goes away

592
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:52,480
and then and then I wonder why am I just you know it's difficult to stay there

593
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:59,159
yeah so so what what I'm suggesting here is you know stay a little bit on the breath but is but when you find your

594
01:10:59,159 --> 01:11:04,440
mind wandering off take the time to recognize oh that's what's

595
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:10,560
happening and then begin again at the breathing but always take your time oh

596
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:16,679
this is what's happening this is why I'm distracted this is what I'm caught up in and then Begin Again the breathing until

597
01:11:16,679 --> 01:11:23,679
the next thing you and over time some of the reasons for being distracted will quiet down because you've seen it you're

598
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:29,800
no and maybe you're not so tempted anymore okay come back come back and

599
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:35,120
then maybe rather than being with two breaths you're four six eight and once

600
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:42,280
you can get into like maybe I mean without forcing it without trying too hard if you can stay with 20 or 30

601
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:49,080
breaths in a row at some point you might feel like something CL you get in like I said earlier you get in the groove the

602
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:54,760
sweetness of that there the human system that we have loves to be

603
01:11:54,760 --> 01:12:02,199
absorbed have you ever read some of you maybe have read I don't people read novels anymore but now there's Netflix

604
01:12:02,199 --> 01:12:07,360
but but um the uh uh some of you have

605
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:13,560
probably read a novel and it's just so enjoyable to read it or you do a craft or do play a musical instrument and you

606
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:19,199
kind of get absorbed in what you're doing and or cooking and you get absorbed in what you're doing and it's

607
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:24,920
just so nice to do it you kind of everything else kind of gets forgotten this idea of everything forgotten and

608
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:30,480
just really doing your one thing kind of being in the groove of that is really

609
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:37,840
good for this psychop physical system of ours there's a lot of it feels really nice and sweet to do it so the same

610
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:43,040
thing can happen with breathing that some point uh when we no longer get so

611
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:49,199
pulled away into all these things because we've recognized them we've learned to settle them we learn to relax

612
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:54,560
at some point you know 20 30 40 who knows how long it takes but the uh the

613
01:12:54,560 --> 01:13:01,400
whole system begins to gather around the breathing and um it's usually called concentration you get concentrated on

614
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:07,520
the breath but gathered around and it's like believe it or not it's like better than reading a good

615
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:14,239
novel it doesn't mean un principle or just hearing that it seems ridiculous right the breath how can that be

616
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:19,320
interesting but uh what's interesting is not the breath what's interesting is the

617
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:24,520
way the mind's ability to get concentrated and focused and um not a

618
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:31,600
few meditators feel a lot of Joy there's something there's something that produces Joy a sense of well-being for

619
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:38,000
our system to be unified into an absorb State the unification of Earth most

620
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:44,639
people live fragmented lives and this meditation helps us to stop being fragmented and brings everything

621
01:13:44,639 --> 01:13:49,960
together so it can be unified in Harmony and that's where the sweetness

622
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:55,360
comes yes

623
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:03,560
so um I find that when I'm trying to come back to the breathing so I get go

624
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:10,560
off in my little tangent in my mind I have this tendency to do this sort of

625
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:16,679
visualize this person who is doing this sort of motion in and out for the

626
01:14:16,679 --> 01:14:23,840
breathing but I don't know if then that is using my mind to

627
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:29,239
like focus on the breathing but I actually I don't know it just sort of

628
01:14:29,239 --> 01:14:34,560
happened where I just visualize this person who's just doing this motion I

629
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:40,360
don't know so the interesting that's great so the interesting to be able to answer your question I have to answer

630
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:45,400
your question I have to ask you a question um when you do visualize that

631
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:53,440
person doing this thing with the breathing uh what happens to you um well I relax and I I can do the

632
01:14:53,440 --> 01:15:00,760
counting so I can do the counting the one so it helps you be present helps you relax helps you to be be there yeah so

633
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:06,800
then it's useful okay and uh and then but at some point you want to stop the

634
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:13,040
visualizing okay so use it when it's useful to get you going or get you centered and then once you're kind of

635
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:18,920
more there then stop doing it okay does that make sense yeah yeah you look a

636
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:24,159
little bit teeny bit per don't know that I can do that like think like

637
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:29,520
it's like I don't know if I can then what am I actually thinking about am I

638
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:36,120
thinking breath in breath out oh when there's no visualization yeah oh okay so

639
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:41,920
um yes so this is so this gets to another uh instruction that we give in

640
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:49,440
this tradition about mindfulness um that's optional but some people find it very helpful is uh as

641
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:59,760
whatever you're being aware of you make a very very quiet gentle tender relaxed

642
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:07,199
note naming it so if you're with your breathing you would gently say in as

643
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:15,000
you're breathing in out as you're breathing out and that might be enough for your mind to be

644
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:20,199
involved and in uh the way I was taught originally it was Rising because we were

645
01:16:20,199 --> 01:16:27,360
told to follow the breath in the belly so breathe in the rising of the belly we say rising and then as you bre out

646
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:32,760
falling is the the belly fell so so there's this different words you can use

647
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:38,199
and then if you find yourself thinking about peanut butter you say thinking you don't even you don't have to even say

648
01:16:38,199 --> 01:16:46,320
peanut butter you can just thinking or if you're finding yourself feeling kind of agitated agitated and

649
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:52,040
there's something and so we'll talk more about this but maybe for you this is the

650
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:57,960
you're looking for something that you can do so you're not too idle and so the visualization of this person doing the

651
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:03,960
breathing gets you involved right so so the other thing you might try is this

652
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:10,079
very simple mental noting in out and see if that keeps you on

653
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:20,000
track so yes so we have in the corner if you can wait for the mic and if if you

654
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:26,719
can turn it up a little bit the volumea so one thing that I noticed was I'm a

655
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:32,960
I'm I'm very new to meditation one thing that I noticed today as I was meditating was when I was concentrating

656
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:38,639
on the breath I felt that I have forgotten how to breathe I was just s s slow down but you know I don't have my

657
01:17:38,639 --> 01:17:43,920
hearing a I lost them next week I'm supposed to have them back but um but so

658
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:51,000
yeah I was just saying that as I was concentrating on my bread I almost felt that I have forgotten how to breathe and

659
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:57,440
every action of breathe in breathe out did not feel natural like I was breathing in too hard breathing

660
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:03,120
out yeah like you know like it was more like a like what they tell you in yoga

661
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:08,880
like deep in very breathe when you are breathing in breathe in very deeply and

662
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:15,000
then breathe out very deeply so I was trying to do that because I was concentrating too much on the breath

663
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:20,360
right but I think that's unnatural but I also wanted to hear your thoughts about

664
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:26,000
yeah for people who who have come from a TR where you do a lot of um controlling

665
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:31,760
your breath where you breathe in particular ways it takes a while to switch gears and come here do this

666
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:36,800
practice where we don't try to do anything special with our breath we just leave our breath alone and let it

667
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:43,280
breathe it let the breath breathe itself just what we call it a natural breath but just don't try to make special don't

668
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:49,400
try to change it so but sometimes it goes for people some people it's goes on automatic that they start trying to

669
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:55,040
controlling their breath and doing the doing something their breath so there's two things you can do with that the

670
01:18:55,040 --> 01:19:01,880
first to go along with what I said already today um now you get to be mindful aware of what it's like to have

671
01:19:01,880 --> 01:19:08,679
a controlled breath it might be uncomfortable it might feel like you shouldn't be doing it but if you're

672
01:19:08,679 --> 01:19:14,480
doing it uh just relax and keep doing it and be aware that you're doing it oh

673
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:21,280
look at that this is a controll breath you can use the mental note control this is what control is like and the magic of

674
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:28,280
this is that if you clearly see that this what you're doing at some point your inner system will begin to

675
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:35,159
relax but if you feel like you're controlling the breath and then you try to control it by controlling it

676
01:19:35,159 --> 01:19:40,880
more it just you can you can spin out and end up in trouble so they just just

677
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:48,880
relax so control breath not control breath just know you're breathing the way it is and let it be really simple so

678
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:54,480
that's the that's the first thing I would suggest the other thing you can do is sometimes when we're caught up and

679
01:19:54,480 --> 01:20:01,560
controlling the breath is just stop breathing for a little while and a little while means four seconds you know

680
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:09,760
just very short until you feel a natural pull to breathe in and just then allow

681
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:15,400
it to breathe in maybe at the top of the in breath pause until you feel the

682
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:21,280
natural pull to breathe out and sometimes that little pause breaks this

683
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:24,760
the controlling

684
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:38,000
okay do you have suggestions for creating uh the habit of a meditation

685
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:43,600
practice great great uh I think one of the one of the ways of developing a

686
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:49,280
habit of meditation practice is to do it every day and um and so that's kind of

687
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:56,960
like a catch 22 right so so first first what you should do is consider what's realistic if you

688
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:03,760
decide I'm going to sit meditate 45 minutes every day in the morning but your life is so busy and it's impossible

689
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:10,840
to do then you're just disappointed because you can never do it so you have to figure out how long and when in the

690
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:16,440
day is realistic for you that's some of the reason why some people find it really good to do it first thing in the

691
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:21,600
morning before we get caught by everything but you know it's possible

692
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:28,040
that you're that's not what your life is about and but it's possible if you do 10 minutes a

693
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:33,639
day that's long that you can realistically do anything more than that is not

694
01:21:33,639 --> 01:21:40,480
realistic and um so I would start with something short and then build on that in fact

695
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:46,280
that's what I recommend from this intro meditation class is that for those of you who are starting your meditation

696
01:21:46,280 --> 01:21:52,159
with this class start with 10 minutes each day uh for this next week and maybe

697
01:21:52,159 --> 01:22:00,400
not even every day but um six of the next seven days um so you can you know and um and

698
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:07,440
so maybe Sunday's off or something but uh but um uh and then uh

699
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:12,480
and then next week add five minutes and so that's one way to develop

700
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:18,360
a habit doing something that's brief enough that you can actually do it and then once you after the week you might

701
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:24,199
enjoy it enough you might be in the groove a little bit more and so then adding five minutes is

702
01:22:24,199 --> 01:22:31,360
manageable and then then the following week I'll suggest another 5 minutes another 5 minutes and um and once you

703
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:38,560
get up to you know 30 minutes maybe that's

704
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:47,400
enough Gil you um you have your morning sessions right at 7 7 o' yes um are

705
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:52,840
those also available like recorded yes people could do that even earlier that

706
01:22:52,840 --> 01:23:00,679
7:00 time doesn't work right yeah what's being referred to is that every morning at weekday morning at 700 p.m. uh I'm on

708
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:13,440
meditation and uh and then I give a 15 minute talk and uh those are recorded

709
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:18,560
both on our YouTube channel that you can listen to it later and and um and also

710
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:24,120
we we recorded on the audio and we have a website called audio Dharma that you

711
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:29,480
can get to it's on the top of our we imc's website there's a link to it and

712
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:35,560
there is where you can uh listen to all the talks that are given here so like this talk today if you ever want to

713
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:42,360

714
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:48,679
listen to it on audio or you can go on the YouTube CH YouTube channel and and our Channel and and um because the

715
01:23:48,679 --> 01:23:55,679
videos recorded as well so so so um but

716
01:23:55,679 --> 01:24:01,719
what I'd recommend is so what's a little bit some of you might know this that I you know I've been doing now the whole

717
01:24:01,719 --> 01:24:07,520
since the beginning of the pandemic these guided meditations for 30 minutes some people are kind of becoming

718
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:12,960
dependent on guided meditations and uh and uh so I'd

719
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:18,760
recommend that uh as you so you asked about a habit for starting that's another way people get the Habit is they

720
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:24,239
use guided meditations that keeps them engaged but it's sooner or later it's

721
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:29,360
really good to learn to meditate without any guidance and just be just be quiet and

722
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:35,560
not have any extra input and just because the idea is you're supposed to meet yourself and when you have a guided

723
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:41,800
meditation then you're a little bit you're not quite alone with your own mind and your own heart and that's where

724
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:47,920
the real benefit comes when you're really alone with yourself and meet yourself in some deep way um and the

725
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:54,520
people who have guided meditation sometimes get a little bit attached to how that the guided meditation helps

726
01:24:54,520 --> 01:25:00,440
them get relaxed and then they get attached to that but that's not the point of this meditation the point of is

727
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:07,199
to see clearly the word for the the the ancient Buddhist word for insight you know we're

728
01:25:07,199 --> 01:25:12,760
called the Insight Meditation Center the word is um the ancient word language

729
01:25:12,760 --> 01:25:21,280
it's vasana which literally means clear seeeing this is the practice of clear

730
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:24,280
seeeing

731
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:35,480
so let's end with we're it's just about time to end let's end with a five six

732
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:37,840
minute

733
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:57,520
meditation so so beginning with a care for your

734
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:04,638
posture and gently closing your

735
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:18,320
eyes and again preparing for the meditation period taking some long slow

736
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:25,639
deep breaths relaxing on the

737
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:43,400
exhale then letting your breathing return to

738
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:54,199
normal relaxing the belly

739
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:14,080
at the end of the exhale pause for just a moment just long

740
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:21,800
enough to feel the impulse to want to breathe in and as soon as you feel that natural

741
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:30,760
impulse pulse in the chest in the belly allow let there be a feeling of

742
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:37,000
allowing allow the inhale to begin almost like you're making room for

743
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:41,080
it welcoming it ah

744
01:27:51,119 --> 01:27:54,119
come

745
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:12,400
and then at the top of the inhale just before you exhale pause there as well just for a

746
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:18,320
moment just long enough to feel the body wanting to

747
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:27,880
Exhale and then [Music] relax so the body does

748
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:34,239
exhale release the

749
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:45,440
breath allowing the inhale releasing with the

750
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,000
exhale

751
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:23,920
for

752
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:53,920
for

753
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:26,480
allowing the inhale and as you release the

754
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:31,920
exhale release any concerns you

755
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:35,960
have let go of your

756
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:46,719
thoughts and ride the exhale all the way to the end of the

757
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:53,840
exhale

758
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:23,760
for

759
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:57,360
and then to end this meditation taking some deeper breaths to

760
01:31:57,360 --> 01:32:00,520
feel your body more

761
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:09,199
fully feel your chair the floor the

762
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:15,639
cushion remember that you're in a room with a group of other

763
01:32:15,639 --> 01:32:20,679
people and then when you're ready you can open your

764
01:32:20,679 --> 01:32:34,430
eyes [Music]

765
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:45,679
so thank you for being here coming to this I hope this was not too many

766
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:51,400
words there's a tradition that I didn't follow which is when you want to teach

767
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:57,320
Med meditation you do it with as little words as possible so there's not so much to think

768
01:32:57,320 --> 01:33:03,560
about um but I uh but I want to just say that as a way of

769
01:33:03,560 --> 01:33:10,360
saying keep it simple try to keep it as simple as you can and if you don't remember everything

770
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:16,600
that I taught today it's probably better ju just enough to keep you doing it and

771
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:22,920
in a relaxed way and just kind of doing it a lot of the learning comes from doing it so so if you're able to over

772
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:29,480
this week to just meditate 10 minutes a day um you know and then you'll be more

773
01:33:29,480 --> 01:33:34,760
prepared to come back and and hear the next set of instructions if you don't

774
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:40,840
meditate in the next week don't worry about it just come anyway if you want um

775
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:46,639
it's okay and the way I teach this course as we go along um I'm trying to

776
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:52,719
also teach some life skills with mindfulness and awareness it's applicable in your life independent of

777
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:58,080
meditating so I don't feel like if you're you know you're not a failure because you don't meditate so just you

778
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:05,920
know you might benefit from this anyway and um we some of the people who

779
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:11,000
