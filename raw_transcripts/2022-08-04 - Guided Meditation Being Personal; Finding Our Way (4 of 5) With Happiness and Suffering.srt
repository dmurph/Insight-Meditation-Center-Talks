1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:08,240
hello everyone welcome and um

2
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,799
so

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,640
you know uh offering a welcome is uh kind of sharing my joy and

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,560
happiness with being here with all of you and i think a welcome carries the most

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,880
value if it's offered quite personally um

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,320
if it was every other word came out of my mouth was welcome to everybody and

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,800
everyone it might feel kind of an automatic pilot and not mean much but there's a person

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,920
if it feels personal actually a person personally feels the welcome or some

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,920
some the fullness of the person is welcoming you into into their space

10
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,960
it can feel kind of richer or fuller or something and and perhaps sometimes when uh you

11
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,240
come to some place where you really do feel welcomed it feels like all of you is welcome like

12
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,920
it's very it's a like you it's you feel it personally this like you're maybe in

13
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:25,200
your bones and your muscles and your heart just feels like it's a full uh experience of oneself that's being

14
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:33,520
welcomed so i i would like to do something that'll offer a little unusual for

15
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:41,680
a buddhist meditation and that is to really take it personally

16
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,600
uh welcome yourself fully allow yourself be welcomed fully

17
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,720
um but take you really let this meditation be very personal

18
00:01:52,720 --> 00:02:00,240
uh sometimes uh the wisdom teachings in our tradition uh people say don't take it personally

19
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,799
whatever happens and um and it's very freeing to not take something personally and we have a

20
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,920
thought maybe it's a horrendous thought and don't take it personally

21
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,360
meaning don't define yourself by it don't let it be the whole being of who you are

22
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,560
just let it be something like the weather that you know it's kind of wanders through

23
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:30,800
and and um you know that it's uh impacts us but it's not us

24
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,959
so don't take it personally but today i'd like to suggest it to really take things personally well don't take it

25
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,160
that we're taking is a evocative word that maybe is part of the problem of it all

26
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,840
but let it all be personal but personal in a particular way

27
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:56,000
not personal in terms of letting yourself be defined by it where your ideas and memories and

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,720
ideas of the future your stories of self come into play but rather the kind of cozy

29
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:10,560
personal that you may be if you were engrossed in a very good book and really

30
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,720
kind of comfortable on the couch reading and just it's you wouldn't call it personal but

31
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,760
something very subtle and full and whole is there just being

32
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,120
in the pleasure of the reading that

33
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,319
maybe after a full week of activity and you go for a walk in a park and

34
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,440
everything falls away your concerns and your problems and issues and

35
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:45,440
and it's just so nice and full you feel kind of fullness and happiness just being alive and walking in the park

36
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,200
it's very personal the sense of aliveness may be a spring and you feel

37
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,799
like spring inside so not taking it personally not making it

38
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,080
personal but experiencing it personally

39
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,120
with all of who you are so as we sit today maybe

40
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:14,080
there's a place that has depth in you or or breath in you or fullness in you of

41
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,959
what is personal that's not your identity not what you think about yourself

42
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,840
but something how you feel or be or and it's so

43
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:33,199
personal and as meditation goes deeper and deeper in a way it's very personal

44
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,800
it's no it's not someone else's experience it's this experience of this body this

45
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,639
person here so um [Music]

46
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:52,080
maybe by going personal today and going all the way personal

47
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,680
something drops away some self-concern self-preoccupations and

48
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,000
self some ego drops away because there's no room for ego

49
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,080
in the depth and fullness of what's most personal

50
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:17,199
so assuming a meditation posture which is also very personal each person

51
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:23,160
finds their own posture and comfort

52
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:31,360
and gently closing the eyes

53
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,840
and with the eyes closing we sometimes you feel we're coming into a personal world

54
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,440
here maybe a little bit in internal

55
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,199
and then taking a few long slow deep breaths

56
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,960
and on the exhale letting go of your thoughts your concerns

57
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,479
your ideas reactions to what i've said

58
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:12,319
maybe an exhale letting go of a certain kind of self-preoccupation

59
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:19,639
that travels in the highways and byways of your thinking

60
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,440
and as you let go of

61
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,400
relax your body

62
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:44,960
letting your breathing return to normal and gently on the exhales

63
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,960
relax

64
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:56,639
there's a settling in as the body relaxes

65
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,880
the shoulders

66
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,720
the belly

67
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,080
maybe the thighs can soften

68
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,400
the arms and the hands

69
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:29,840
and there can be a settling in coming home to

70
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,360
as the body begins to soften

71
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,400
breathing in and breathing out

72
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:59,319
this relaxing deeply in the core of your being relaxing

73
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,879
settling into what is more personal

74
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,960
than personal that which is more personal than how you

75
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,680
usually define yourself think of yourself

76
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:24,840
in the depths of your being let this meditation be personal

77
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,960
maybe the breathing

78
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,279
your breathing can be

79
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,240
a gentle invitation

80
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,279
to come deep within

81
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,640
for all of you is welcomed

82
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,800
and as all of you is welcomed

83
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,680
there's a letting go of what is superficial

84
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,760
there's a relaxing into the depths of our being

85
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:28,160
breathing through the depths breathing with the depths of our

86
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,360
fullness our beingness

87
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:45,200
and whatever happens during this meditation it's all okay

88
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:51,519
but assume that it's uh means

89
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,440
of relaxing into something deeper more personal

90
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,600
not the what's on the surface of your thoughts and feelings and ideas

91
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,720
but almost from like the place where they are from where they arise

92
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:20,560
the depths of who you are breathe there

93
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,640
trust the depths that's within you

94
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:56,720
all too often thinking takes us away from the depths and

95
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,920
fullness of what is most personal here with us

96
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,120
more personal than our history and our plans

97
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,720
here deep within this body and heart

98
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:21,959
may be a quiet place a warm place

99
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:29,000
where we can sit with what is most personal here and now

100
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,440
so

101
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,679
how quiet can you let your thinking mind be

102
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:50,799
the kind of quiet that allows you to feel or listen

103
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:58,000
to the fullness or the depth of your what's most personal here as you

104
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,280
sit quietly and breathe

105
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,720
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

106
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,960
to reflect for a moment how

107
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:56,400
when you are most comfortable with yourself at peace with yourself

108
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,520
at home with yourself uh when then that's when this might

109
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,640
happen that you become a message the medium is

110
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,760
the message you become a walking message that it's

111
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:19,120
possible to be at peace possibly at home and comfortable with oneself

112
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:25,679
and this is a gift for the world where so many people don't have that experience

113
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:33,360
and perhaps with whatever degree way that you are now that

114
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,640
maybe you're more settled or maybe more willing to

115
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:45,840
find a way to be it at home in yourself in this deep personal way

116
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:54,159
may this serve to bring greater well-being and peace to this

117
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:59,600
world whether it's directly or intentionally or

118
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:05,200
indirectly unintentionally may the benefits of this meditation

119
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:11,440
we've done today with all the many of us

120
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:17,360
doing this together across the globe

121
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:25,279
may it spread from us in benefit for everyone

122
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:31,360
may all beings be happy

123
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,679
may all beings be safe

124
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:43,240
may all beings be peaceful

125
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,880
may all beings be free

126
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:57,799
and may we each find ways to contribute to this possibility

127
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:16,130
[Music]

128
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,760
thank you

129
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,880
so finding our way in this challenging world

130
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:39,278
finding our way with the personal challenges we have and with our minds and all that

131
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:45,919
and one of the things we're navigating and working against working with is the

132
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:52,399
the uh navigating the terrain of happiness and suffering

133
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:58,240
and in buddhists talk a lot about suffering

134
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,679
it's a big word for some people sometimes some people who come new to buddhism are a little disturbed by often

135
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:10,240
we talk about suffering because suffering just seems like such a you know monumental

136
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,919
thing but we use the term in a wide way

137
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:21,600
and but one of the ways i like to use it today

138
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,480
happiness and suffering is

139
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:33,039
is something that's deeper than contentment deeper than gladness deeper

140
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:38,399
than joy that but uh that happiness

141
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:44,159
is something that's deeply personal and that um

142
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:50,960
the opposite of that suffering is also something deeply personal

143
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:57,039
that some of the greatest suffering that people experience is when they've been a real a personal

144
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:02,159
violation whether it's a physical violation against your body

145
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:09,679
or whether it's been in a violation against some deep sense of trust or deep violation about who you are as a person

146
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:16,240
or in a relationship to others and um the um

147
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:22,000
i remember many years ago that a friend of mine had her car broken into

148
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,039
and she felt it was such a deep violation somehow that car

149
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:33,440
represented so much more than just a car and

150
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:39,760
so our sense of safety and place in this world our sense of belonging

151
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:46,159
and it is a very personal issue and to have the sense of belonging absence of

152
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:52,480
connection to the world or our sense of meaning uh personal meaning and purpose have

153
00:31:52,480 --> 00:32:00,720
sense of um or even our sense of worth our personal

154
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,880
value somehow dismissed or destroyed or or threatened

155
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:13,440
can cause a lot of suffering it isn't just a simple suffering that i have a flat tire and i came late to an

156
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:19,519
important meeting that something is deeply personal and and with that it's you know can k we can

157
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:25,840
stay it can have deep conditioning factors within us on the corollary there's a same for

158
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:32,559
happiness it's not this happiness that oh now i fixed the car the tire and that's great

159
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:39,039
i'm not stuck here anymore and i think i'll get to the meeting on time that's nice and certainly can be happy

160
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:44,080
around that but by the time you get to the meeting you've forgotten about the tire and what

161
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:50,880
happened there but that the happiness that real sukkah and pali word the real happiness

162
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:57,519
of the dharma is something very personal that touches something very deep within

163
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:05,519
us of fullness and and and is overlaps with deep feeling of sense of belonging or meaning or purpose

164
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,880
overlaps with a sense of worth and value that is full a sense of personal

165
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,559
confidence and so there's a fullness there's a depth to it

166
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:22,880
some people might take exceptions to my use my my repeated use of the word personal today

167
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:28,559
i do a little bit to be to because it's something a buddhist don't tend to use to really kind of

168
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:33,919
challenge you to look deep or into yourself into a fullness

169
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:39,200
um and of course there's a little common

170
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,640
teaching in buddhism not to take things personally and i understand this to mean it's the

171
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:50,640
taking it's the uh appropriation of things and saying this is who i am

172
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:57,760
the act of defining ourselves by something the act of um

173
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:05,279
of uh proving ourselves or building up a self building up this edifice of ego that we have

174
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:11,919
which keeps us in some way superficial the happiness of

175
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:19,040
of of sukkah this happiness of the dharma is something that's full or deeper than

176
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:25,919
anything that you could take personally or assume to be or define yourself by

177
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:31,839
it's not about definitions it's more like being so comfortable with yourselves

178
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:37,358
that you will you don't need to be defined by anything you don't need to prove yourself towards

179
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:43,520
anyone you have nothing to fear because it's so deep the personal is so

180
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:50,158
deep it's kind of like we tap into that some depth inside of peace of well-being of

181
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,599
personal personal personalness that

182
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:02,560
can't be touched can't be hurt no matter what other people do to us maybe this is a place that

183
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:09,520
is a reservoir of well-being so it's very personal

184
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,640
now in terms of so part of the theme of today this week is

185
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,680
the pendulum that there is a kind of happiness and suffering

186
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:25,760
that live in relationship to each to each other and uh you set up one

187
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,960
and it almost it's almost like a preparing the ground for the other to come back and forth

188
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,480
and that's when we take things personally in a superficial way

189
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,960
we take things personally by some

190
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:47,760
appropriated identity or definition that is not really who we are

191
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:54,079
so for example if um if um

192
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:59,359
i define myself by being a youtube

193
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:06,160
producer producing shows for youtube or whatever and then the technology works well for a

194
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:13,440
few months like it has lately i could feel really happy about myself but when when somehow i forget to push

195
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:19,440
the right buttons then then the happiness that comes from the

196
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,280
praise i get from others and the delight others have with my great capacity on youtube

197
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,400
plummets and then i feel miserable because i forgot some push the right buttons

198
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,760
and um and so then i feel unhappy and i suffer and

199
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,280
and um and so that pendulum that happiness and suffering is dependent on these kind of

200
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,200
superficial things and fragile things is really it's because reality is always

201
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,800
changing it sets up for crashing and building yourself up again

202
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:59,760
so finding our way with this superficial will keep us superficial

203
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,280
the dharma practice is to connect something deep something that's not

204
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,800
defined by these superficial things or it's not influenced or affected by what happens

205
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:18,079
it's not affected by what other people think about us believe it or not not affected by whether we're successful

206
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:24,400
or a failure in the things that we do we do things sincerely and honestly

207
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:32,000
and some succeed and some fail and but the depth of our being

208
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,119
where we really reside and live inside where we're comfortable with ourselves

209
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:43,359
that is not um that is not you know touch that's

210
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:49,200
that stays intact and so um so to

211
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:57,040
not know the depth of and be comfortable and resolved and healed in the depth of us

212
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:03,680
can leave that depth in a place that there's a lot of suffering but if we heal it and work with it and

213
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:10,000
relax and open and deeply in it and this deep personal place where we can find

214
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:17,119
peace and home and trust and refuge it's not exactly a pendulum anymore it's

215
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:22,960
it abides by itself and and if it falls away it doesn't

216
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:29,760
necessarily go into despair or steep suffering

217
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:37,680
but deep suffering is there if we take things personally deep suffering is not there

218
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:43,280
if we are personal if we abide and rest in that which is

219
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,800
deep and full and complete inside of ourselves and

220
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:54,480
and so in buddhism we're quite fond of talking about not self

221
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:01,040
and one way to bring these two things together i'm talking about today and not self

222
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:07,760
is that when we are so personal so at home so resting what's most personal most

223
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:15,119
intimate most full that flows from within in us

224
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:21,280
it's so full it's so complete it's so that there's no tendency or desire

225
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:29,440
to define a self out of it to find a self in it to want to self in it to hold on to a self

226
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:35,839
there the any kind of the kind of idea of me myself and mine those kinds of concerns

227
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:41,040
just fall away just as maybe someone who's involved in

228
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:46,160
wonderful play or wonderful sport or wonderful playing of music

229
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:53,520
there's they can get lost and lost in the in the what they're doing

230
00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:01,040
we say lost completely absorbed in what they're doing and it just feels so complete and good

231
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:06,079
to be there and there isn't occurred to them while they're doing the activity

232
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:13,119
the usual thoughts about myself and me myself and mine so the same way we meditate or in the

233
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:19,520
dharma this deep personal place where we can find comfort comfort

234
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:25,359
belonging healing happiness well-being

235
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:30,880
if we really can learn to be there and trust it and allow ourselves to get quiet enough to

236
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:37,040
really be absorbed in it there's no

237
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:44,160
movement in the mind no tendency of the mind for me myself and mine

238
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:49,520
from the point of view of the surface where we think a lot about me myself and mine and we live in that world of me

239
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:56,480
myself and mine um they might when i say these things might immediately come but i am me and

240
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:03,040
there are things that are mine so from the logic of that more superficial world

241
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:10,160
yes and maybe what i'm saying doesn't make sense but um but that superficial world that's

242
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:16,000
the world where the pendulum of suffering and um and happiness uh live in

243
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,440
relationship to each other and and uh we kind of get trapped in the pendulum we can swing back and forth

244
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:29,359
maybe and and uh and then it never ends but this the depth of who we are

245
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:35,760
the depth of well-being the peace of the dharma that's within us the dharma

246
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:42,079
and so when you become yourself fully in this personal way

247
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:47,599
then it said then the dharma becomes the self when you are yourself

248
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:53,680
the dharma is the dharma you are the dharma then

249
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:01,119
so um thank you and look forward to coming back tomorrow and

250
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:08,000
and then having our meeting at the in 24 hours

251
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,560
so thank you
