1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:05,460
so warm greetings to all of you

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,660
and um

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,920
his uh as part of this wonderful community of

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,800
ours of 7 A.M meditators and the one who does the most speaking

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,460
maybe I can represent all of you and and offer that welcome and behalf of all

6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:37,200
of you so we're all welcoming each other and have a sense of being included by the

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,460
whole community so thank you for being here

8
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:52,079
and I want to start with analogy say that you're going to go do some

9
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,920
exercise maybe go to the gym and you really enjoy exercising

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,518
you need to exercise there's a physical kind of thing you're trying to heal from or something

11
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:12,180
and so you're determined and motivated and everything's good you go there and as you're going into

12
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:19,260
the gym you you're thinking about uh yeah it's just you see other people working out this is good to work out and

13
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:25,979
certain vitality and engagement this is a really healthy thing for people and you think about a friend of yours who

14
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:31,259
really needs to work out maybe for all for many reasons

15
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:37,079
and so you're thinking about your friend you care about your friend you have compassion for your friend and you want

16
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:44,460
to help your friend and um and so you walk by a little Lobby part

17
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,520
of the gym and there's some magazines

18
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,860
and maybe there's a magazine big headlines you know working out in health or something just like with your

19
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:03,840
concerned for your friend so you pick up the magazine and you go uh sit on a

20
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,119
maybe in a little couch in the back wall of the gym

21
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,520
you hear people working out and for the hour you had to work out you

22
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,800
read this magazine another magazine and all caring for you know to think about your friend

23
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,560
and then your hour is up and then you realize wait a minute I didn't exercise at all I spent the whole time you know

24
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,599
thinking about my friend you know I could have worked out I need to work out

25
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:37,379
and I could have done the reading and magazine or looked into it later in fact I didn't really learn that much

26
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:43,920
by looking at these magazines so I gave this analogy for coming to meditate

27
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,420
we're here to meditate to kind of a kind of a mental working out if you may

28
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:56,340
and if you start thinking have compassionate thoughts for people who are challenged and you start thinking

29
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:03,120
about it I'll help them and do things for them um and you spend the whole meditation in

30
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,900
this kind of planning mind discursive mind thinking about them in a sense maybe for that meditation

31
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:17,159
session you're not meditating at all you're not doing it for the practice you're doing thinking about a friend

32
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:22,560
in the context of meditation of course you might think about a friend

33
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,700
who's suffering and of course you might think about how to help them or do something for them but in the context of meditation

34
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,099
the most significant way to respond to the suffering of the world

35
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:43,140
that we experience and feel is actually not to use meditation as a time to plan and think about what to do

36
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:49,319
rather if to really prepare ourselves for doing and acting later

37
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:55,019
that powerful thing is to act in a certain way

38
00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:02,459
and that is to go back recognize what's happening to you recognize concerns recognize the

39
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:09,120
feelings that are there recognize the impulse the aspiration to help these are all good

40
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,459
and then go to fold it all back in to your

41
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:20,180
workout to your practice and these steps we've been doing this week around compassion

42
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:26,940
are a great series of steps to do to fold it back into your practice

43
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:33,300
come back and just rest in Awareness being aware of how you're feeling be aware of the

44
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:40,500
sensations in the body of of the compassion the care the concern

45
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:46,860
you have for your friend and uh what it feels like in your body to have a desire to do something

46
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:53,100
just be aware of what's happening for you as you're aware become attuned to

47
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,680
yourself find harmony with yourself and to go ahead long into planning and

48
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,800
thinking about the friend is actually a way of losing touch with oneself meditation is a way of being profoundly

49
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,160
in touch with oneself here and to be attuned to this person and if

50
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,380
you're suffering attuned to your suffering if you're not suffering being attuned to the sensations and feeling

51
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,780
and what's happening appreciate appreciate yourself

52
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:27,300
appreciate what's happening respect it deeply but don't give in to it don't

53
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:35,340
fall into it don't spin out with it and and then here have an aspiration

54
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:40,800
maybe the aspiration is in fact to care for the suffering of oneself and for

55
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,440
others and then in meditation then you can do

56
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,780
it again and again and and so you're actually building

57
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:58,800
by this repeat repeated Cycles you're actually building the kind of foundation

58
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,919
that allows compassion to grow that allows it sets the ground for

59
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:10,500
cleaner and greater simpler straightforward compassion to be there

60
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:16,800
for later if you go head along into I need to fix the problem I need to help the problem I

61
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,139
need to do something and start planning it

62
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:27,360
um at times that's useful but not when you're working out in the gym

63
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,479
then you want to then you want to sit deeply and come back do the cycle again

64
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:39,600
and again to purify to clarify to simplify how it is for you

65
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,020
so that we're freeing ourselves from the

66
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:52,919
you know the distractions of discursive thinking about it

67
00:06:52,919 --> 00:07:00,139
we're freeing ourselves from looking at the magazines rather than doing the exercise

68
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:06,660
and by doing the exercise something strengthens inside of us then later

69
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:16,340
will give birth to a greater capacity for compassion and get greater capacity for how to act

70
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:21,800
so to assume your meditation posture

71
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,580
foreign and gently close your eyes

72
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,000
and to

73
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,380
without anything else

74
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:54,199
begin your meditation and if the occasion is right for it

75
00:07:54,419 --> 00:08:03,560
go through the first four A's of the five A's of this week

76
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:09,380
cultivate awareness Attunement

77
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:15,060
appreciation aspiration

78
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:21,419
and Debian meditation the aspiration is to be present

79
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:30,319
be here desperation is to keep cultivating

80
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:36,360
greater awareness of the present moment greater Attunement to the present moment

81
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:44,240
greater appreciation of the present moment and letting the aspiration to do so

82
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:52,760
be simpler clearer more harmonious more supportive

83
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,560
of going through this process again

84
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,880
if you're thinking if you're reading the magazine

85
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:23,519
begin the cycle of aware attuned appreciative

86
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:30,920
and aspiring to be here and present not lost in thought

87
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:35,699
and he if while I'm meditating you have any

88
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:40,880
suffering stress tension about something

89
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:52,759
offer yourself these five steps be aware in a deep way

90
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,839
attune yourself in a useful way

91
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,040
appreciate yourself and

92
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,539
in a supportive way

93
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:24,140
have the wish the aspiration that you be free of the suffering

94
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:32,659
and then act and the ACT we do in meditation

95
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:38,160
is to do the first four again go through the cycle

96
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:45,140
just keep deepening with it expanding it

97
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,039
quieting the mind

98
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:31,278
and then as we come to the end of this meditation

99
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:38,940
to appreciate that meditation is a time to

100
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:45,620
be inward inward Focus to our own experience Here and Now

101
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,220
and to maybe do it so deeply so fully

102
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:59,299
and that we become we turned we are turned inside out

103
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,860
so that there is a deeper sensitivity

104
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:11,240
and availability to the world

105
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:18,320
and to let now the attention go out into the world

106
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:27,559
aware of the joys and Sorrows that are so extensive in the world

107
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:36,840
to be attuned to a certain kind of Harmony

108
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:43,580
of heart with all the joys and sorrows

109
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:55,039
to never forget to appreciate and respect

110
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:00,200
all people in the world

111
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:09,480
and to allow the hearts aspiration to Bubble Up

112
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:16,799
the hearts of aspiration to care for suffering wherever it's

113
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:23,279
encountered and when we encounter it in the world

114
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:30,059
around us to Aspire that that suffering comes to

115
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:37,340
an end and then action

116
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:44,580
May each of us aspire to do

117
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:48,860
at least small actions

118
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:58,340
to make this day a better day for others May each of us

119
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:07,640
alleviate lighten the suffering of others

120
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:14,360
through even the smallest acts Smiles checking in how are you

121
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,520
offering a small gift

122
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:32,460
being aware attuned and appreciative of others

123
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:38,880
that itself is a gift that alleviates suffering

124
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,559
it doesn't have to be more complicated

125
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:52,140
and if you know if nothing else is relevant

126
00:29:52,140 --> 00:30:00,919
your act to support the world is to go back to being aware

127
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:05,299
attuned and appreciative

128
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:16,679
the benefits of doing so will spread out into the world

129
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:25,440
may all beings be happy may all beings be safe

130
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:35,000
may all beings be peaceful and may all beings everywhere be free

131
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:52,789
[Music]

132
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:02,789
thank you [Music]

133
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:14,820
so then today we come to the Fifth Element of compassion action

134
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:20,179
and it's actually very important that we Act

135
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:27,840
and there's something empowering something freeing something uh enlivening

136
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:35,460
in actually acting rather than just have wishful thinking rather than living under the weight and

137
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:42,299
burden rather than just feeling the challenges and the suffering of the world

138
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:47,880
and um and even a small Acts

139
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:55,799
count for our hearts small acts who knows how much they'll benefit others

140
00:32:55,799 --> 00:33:03,559
sometimes small acts of kindness of compassion I have the biggest impact

141
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:11,399
and but always it's important to act but we have to be very careful what that

142
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:19,100
means and how we take that in if we live under the obligation that we have to go and help someone else

143
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:25,860
then it's very easy to add stress attention to that very effort and to

144
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:32,220
bring along and can imbue it with something which is actually maybe not beneficial for yourself and others

145
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:37,620
one form of action is in fact to keep purifying oneself to

146
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:44,640
really clarify and develop oneself and um and so there are times when we feel the

147
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:50,460
suffering of the world and maybe we can't do anything there's so much suffering if you read the news and we're

148
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:57,120
not going to reach out to all of it but we can still be moved by it we can

149
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:04,140
still do the first four of these elements of compassion and as we move into action

150
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:10,440
it's not necessarily to do things directly for the people who are suffering but sometimes it's just simply to go

151
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:17,940
through that cycle of of awareness appreciation awareness Attunement appreciation and

152
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:23,460
aspiration again kind of it's kind of like a cleansing it's kind of like a refining it's a

153
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:30,179
smoothing out it's a it's a growing of the of the

154
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:36,240
so the clarity of that compassion the fullness of that compassion and care

155
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,398
so it becomes stronger and it becomes less and less mixed with

156
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:49,378
tension with suffering many times compassion when we there's a quick impulse to be compassionate we

157
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:54,599
don't realize how much we bring along our conceit our ideas of self of others

158
00:34:54,599 --> 00:35:02,339
of of pity of um of tension of obligation that kind of messes it up in

159
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:07,380
some way there is something like a natural compassion that can well up

160
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:12,480
I feel very fortunate because that my discovery of really The Beauty And The

161
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:20,040
Wonder of compassion was it found me through this repeated meditation practice I did and just by meditating

162
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:26,420
day and day and day for years it welled up it's like I made space the the

163
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:31,859
hindrances for compassion settled and they are lo and behold there was this

164
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:37,920
beautiful feeling of compassion and care and love that was there it wasn't and it

165
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:45,000
first was there without the need to do anything or a specific direction that had to be addressed it was just there

166
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:51,960
and I got to appreciate the beauty of compassion so one of the reasons to be recursive to

167
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:58,140
go back the action is to go back and go through this cycle of mindfulness again maybe when you're meditating

168
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:04,560
is so you can start discovering the natural compassion that really is quite beautiful

169
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:11,780
and sometimes that got the action of compassion and the aspiration for suffering to end for someone

170
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:17,940
leads us to say well I can do something it's not just wishful thinking it's a

171
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:23,460
wish that yes I can do something for them I can do something for the world

172
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:29,520
and um and then but to do but to do it on this foundation of the first four

173
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:36,000
elements hopefully means that um that there can

174
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,440
be a beauty there can be an Attunement there can be a A

175
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:51,660
naturalness in the action that we do and um so it isn't a sense of uh heavy

176
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:57,300
responsibility it is a sense of like bearing down I got to do something and and

177
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:02,940
um and maybe do something because I'm angry and I have to fix something in the world yes I have compassion but I'm

178
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:09,420
angry and I'm gonna go do something um the natural compassion that can well

179
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:15,420
up when we really centered on ourself really have this autonomous awareness

180
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:21,900
this deep Attunement this this agency that goes into kind of clarifying it all

181
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:28,020
that um there's a beauty to it and a pleasure to it there's a it's a

182
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:35,820
kind of source of happiness that is not happiness that is something we're intending to be happy because it's

183
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:42,240
not about us but it's something because of this the the Purity the clarity the Simplicity

184
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,820
the absence of of

185
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:53,880
dust the absence of tension the absence that it's doing then the uh then when we

186
00:37:53,880 --> 00:38:01,020
get ready to act there's a Simplicity to it the naturalness to it a beauty to it and a

187
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:07,820
kind of pleasure something that feels good and I was so surprised when I started discovering how good it felt

188
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:13,260
just to have these very simple acts of care and attention and compassion for

189
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:20,099
other people and um and first I thought is this okay is are we allowed to do this because

190
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:26,579
it's felt so good you know and and um and you know just so just sell am I doing it now for selfish reasons

191
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:32,820
but I found very quickly that as soon as I tried to do it for myself that that messed it up but there had to be kind of

192
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:37,920
a kind of an absence of Self in the action in the care that and there was

193
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:44,700
something deeper than this self-concerned self-preoccupation that was motivating the whole thing

194
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:50,460
so and then if it comes this natural compassion this natural action then it's

195
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:56,460
one that's attuned to oneself attuned to the situation and even if what it is is sending a

196
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:03,000
check to a good cause that um there's a there's a kind of a delight

197
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:09,180
a joy and to be able to do it to kind of a kind of a steep satisfaction a kind of

198
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:14,579
pleasure happiness that to just be able to do that it isn't like oh I should do more or

199
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:22,500
some things just oh yes this is good um if uh a friend is suffering and all

200
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:28,200
your all what seems right to just go over and sit near them uh you don't have to get more involved

201
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:35,820
sit near them and see what happens maybe it's near them might be you know 10 feet away and sit there and be available and

202
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:42,540
see what happens and and there are people sometimes who find it so meaningful as they suffer that they were

203
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:49,680
accompanied from a distance someone was there with them or maybe exit closer maybe you don't say much

204
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:55,920
and um and because just sharing the spaces enough with them

205
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,320
maybe it's getting somewhat a glass of water you see they're distressed and can I

206
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:07,079
bring you some water can I you know we know are you hungry

207
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:12,720
there's so many small ways in which compassion can take form

208
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:18,720
um I know there's not necessarily you know so small but I had this wonderful experience when with my son when he was

209
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:25,260
small and maybe it was five years old or something I was going out to a Mexican restaurant to get a burrito or something

210
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:33,240
with him and um and there was a homeless person in front of the restaurant asking for money for some food

211
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:39,119
and um and so uh I said well come come with us

212
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:45,839
and I'll buy you something and so he came in and he just ordered the simplest thing like a simple burrito

213
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:51,240
and I said don't you don't want more and he said no this is enough and I thought well I thought maybe this was his chance

214
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:57,000
to anyway so he and his offered to eat with us but he said no and he left

215
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:04,200
and um and I didn't think too much about it uh until I left the the restaurant and

216
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:11,160
he was waiting outside for us and he had no paper but he had found a brown garbage uh you

217
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:17,579
know a shopping bag and he was a poet and he said I wrote a poem and I want to

218
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:24,359
read it to you and thanks and he read this beautiful poem to us it didn't give us the poem but he read this

219
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:30,660
beautiful poem and um and uh and that was his thanks and I said wow

220
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:38,099
who gave who a gift here it was you know it's pretty simple for me to pay for his burrito but wow what a

221
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:44,760
beautiful thing to take the time to write something and so nice so um

222
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:50,520
so to uh what do we what can we do HUD and what how do we do it in a natural

223
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:55,859
way and and how do we do act so the action

224
00:41:55,859 --> 00:42:01,440
that we do benefits ourselves if it's only about benefiting someone

225
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:07,079
else that it's too easy for it to get messed up

226
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:14,460
um and if it's only about ourselves it certainly will be messed up but there's a way of caring for both to

227
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:21,480
be attuned to both and being attuned to oneself is not be attuned to our at our concept of self

228
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:27,740
our our Alter Ego or something to be attuned to self is to be attuned to

229
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:35,220
the motivations and the sensations and our suffering and our Joys and our pleasure attuned to where the beauty is

230
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:41,940
here selfless Beauty so that when we act that's what flowers

231
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:48,980
in us not um not our selfishness

232
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:57,619
so compassion is a profound and wonderfully natural aspect of the human heart

233
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:05,040
it's a kind of a Birthright it's kind of who in some ways at some point you realize oh this is

234
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:10,260
it becomes a point where you feel this is who I am

235
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:18,599
this is what I want to orient my life with because it feels so integral and so right

236
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:25,200
it's not a duty it's not an obligation it's an expression

237
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,300
of some of the deepest understandings deepest ways of being

238
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:37,079
centered here in a selfless way and to be able to come into the world

239
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:43,920
to express this deep deep inspiring part of our hearts

240
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:50,579
is one of the greatest things to do in this life and until we really discover that then

241
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:55,920
can live that don't underestimate that one of the

242
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:02,460
greatest actions you can do is this practice of mindfulness and awareness

243
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:09,380
really cultivate awareness Attunement appreciation

244
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:15,960
aspiration these four things are part of the profundity of Who We Are

245
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:23,040
and to practice them and goes through them and deepen and just clarify and

246
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:30,540
and then when the time comes for action you'll know when when the time is

247
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:36,500
sometimes the action occurs when nothing else makes sense

248
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,400
and so may we all

249
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:50,060
be agents of change to change the world to make it a better place

250
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:57,060
I teach the Dharma to help individuals to support individuals

251
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:04,619
and my aspiration is that and my trust is that as we individually

252
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:09,900
Blossom and the Dharma that we benefit this world I would like

253
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:17,400
this Dharma to really flower and benefit the whole world and so this process of clarifying our

254
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:22,680
compassion is you know it's one of the profound ways

255
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:29,819
that we become agents of Peace agents of joy and

256
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:35,460
support and compassion so thank you all

257
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:44,760
very much for this and um and next week I'll be on retreat at the

258
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:51,119
retreat center an inside Retreat Center in Santa Cruz and very happy that uh

259
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:58,079
um Nikki murgafori will be coming back one of the Great teachers here at IMC and you'll be in

260
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:03,780
good hands with her and they'll be back in the following week and I was thinking that probably I

261
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:09,420
would like to continue this theme of compassion and there's because there's much more

262
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:15,180
that's invaluable about it so probably I'll do that when I come

263
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:23,359
back so thank you very much and um look forward to being here and

264
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,359
the week after next
