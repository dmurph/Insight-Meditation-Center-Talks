1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,600
so the last few talks I've been talking about this idea of the role of thoughts and

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,059
beliefs and views and what an impact they have in our

3
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:19,020
practice and how the Buddha really emphasized direct experience rather than views but of

4
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:25,920
course we also have Right View as the right wise view I'll talk a little bit

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,859
about that as a first step in the 0.8fold path

6
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:38,700
but today I want to talk a little bit uh different idea about views

7
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,280
and that sometimes we use spiritual just use that generic word

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,440
kind of spiritual views or ideas or beliefs

9
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,860
as a way to sidestep or avoid

10
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,739
what's going on in our lives in terms where maybe holding on to views

11
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:07,500
as a way to not be with what our experiences and help us so that we don't

12
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,740
have to face some uncomfortable things whether it's emotional issues or things

13
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:20,880
that are inside us that's maybe you're not even clear what it is we just have this feeling like we don't want to look

14
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,180
at it Whatever It Is so maybe I'd say that the key words here

15
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:34,080
are the side step and avoid so of course like views of course we

16
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,900
need to have them there an integral part of what it means to be human it's an integral part of

17
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:48,259
our practice or even if you don't have a practice but it's when we use them as a way to

18
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:54,060
not look at things that may be helpful and not only that

19
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:00,000
we use the views to kind of legitimize our avoidance

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,899
from how we're using them as a way to like oh yeah I don't need to look at that because of X Y or Z

21
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:14,040
I'll explore that a little bit tonight so we might say that um

22
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:20,340
this is a process in which we are using the practice that is supposed to

23
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:28,200
help us work with a problem as a way to avoid a problem so we

24
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,819
started thinking it's going to help us

25
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,379
sorry about that so it's when we we have this practice

26
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:59,280
that we initiated to help us work or find some ease with a problem but

27
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,640
the way that we unknowingly kind of are using it is to just help us avoid it

28
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:10,739
or not look at it or sidestep it in some kind of way or white

29
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:17,879
wash it or this thing that we want to try to find a better relationship with or have

30
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:25,019
more ease with instead we end up kind of avoiding so for example we might have this

31
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:31,920
Buddhist teaching on Equanimity it's really held you know really high esteem in Buddhist practice

32
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:39,000
being able to have this sense of balance and evenness with whatever is arising

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,400
but we might hear this in fact I think it's probably all of us

34
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:52,440
do this or have done it this teaching about Equanimity this evenness and balance balance and we

35
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:59,159
might kind of like slide into indifference and recalling it Equanimity oh this is a

36
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:05,220
wise mature way to be with it but in fact what has happened is we've actually disconnected

37
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:12,000
from our experience disconnected from what we're feeling or we're disconnected to what's happening

38
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,340
in our environment and that's why we're able to have some balance and evenness

39
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:24,660
is because we're not engaged with what's happening instead we have this aloofness

40
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:30,540
maybe even some coldness and we're thinking like oh this is equanimity

41
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:38,520
but in fact you know Equanimity has a quality of warmth and connection and openness and spaciousness

42
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:45,900
and that's what gives the room for the balance and evenness is because there's this big space in which we're allowing

43
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:54,180
things to be whatever they are but we're still connected with what's happening that's maybe one way maybe another way

44
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,220
is if we might have this

45
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:05,100
thought in our mind we might actually hear ourselves saying that something like well

46
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:10,280
if that makes you uncomfortable well that's just part of your practice

47
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,300
kind of like saying well it's your problem if what I said makes you feel

48
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,520
uncomfortable or it's uh your problem you just have to work with it if somehow

49
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:27,419
What's Happening Here in the community in the group or something like this isn't your preference

50
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:34,139
and to be sure sometimes that is an appropriate response but if we always find ourselves kind of

51
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:40,380
thinking that that people are getting annoyed with us or irritated with us and we're thinking well you just need to

52
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:46,979
practice with that clearly you're not as awake and as I am and you have preferences or you know

53
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:53,400
something like that maybe I'm exaggerating this to make a point but there's a way in which we

54
00:05:53,400 --> 00:06:00,300
might think that um well you just practice everybody just has to practice with whatever arises in

55
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:07,560
their mind and we don't somehow have to take responsibility for how we're affecting others

56
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,560
maybe to some of the insensitivities we have or some ignorance we have and

57
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,560
biases we have that come out in our language or our behavior and that

58
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,259
we might not intend to but it might be hurtful to others

59
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:33,960
so instead of saying oh that's just your practice can we recognize oh I I harmed somebody with my

60
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,960
words or my actions even though we didn't mean to instead of kind of trying to whitewash

61
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,960
it away or so there's an expression that was coined

62
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:52,440
by John Wellwood of Buddhist practitioner I think it was in the 90s

63
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:58,319
I think it was he was a psychologist and a Buddhist practitioner is a few books

64
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:06,660
that right now the titles Escape my mind but I think he coined this

65
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:13,560
expression and it's called spiritual bypassing if you've heard of this

66
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,620
and and I would say it's it's probably everybody does this if

67
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:25,500
course we do because this is part of how we find our way with practice or new

68
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:34,319
ideas or new ways of showing up new ways maybe of speaking interacting with others is sometimes we get it right and

69
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:41,880
sometimes we don't of course it does it's not like we're going to learn some hear something and then just do it perfectly every time

70
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:49,020
and sometimes we just we're not uh feeling we don't feel well either we

71
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:55,919
have some emotional turmoil or if we're not sleeping or whatever it might be physical pain

72
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:03,120
and so maybe we don't have access to our greatest wisdom and wisdom and instead we're slipping into something that we

73
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:10,740
just feel like okay I need to avoid or bypass because I don't really have the capacity

74
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:17,539
right now and maybe it's not a conscious thought it just happens

75
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:23,780
it can be helpful to recognize though that this is something that's not uncommon

76
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:30,180
psychologists they like to look at this and they say well yeah some people get become really spiritual and do this

77
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:37,560
spiritual bypass and they'll use the language kind of like a as a defense mechanism as a way to disconnect us from

78
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:44,459
our feelings as a way to disengage with what's happening or to Shield us

79
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:49,519
from something that's uncomfortable

80
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,860
maybe it's some truth that we've seen about ourselves some truth that we've

81
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:01,260
seen about our life it's not unfolding the way we expected

82
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:06,959
and and rather than acknowledging that then I remember doing this spiritual

83
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:13,380
bypassing and so spiritual bypassing is this

84
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:18,959
related to the our relationship to the practice or

85
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:24,000
um you know how we're like holding on to it or interpreting it so it's not so

86
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,360
much our practice itself I would say I guess maybe one could argue that okay

87
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:36,779
it is the practice but it's like the manner in which we practice but I don't want it to sound

88
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:42,779
like okay well you shouldn't do any spiritual things Buddhist things any

89
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:48,600
spiritual tradition because you're just using it to avoid the difficulties I

90
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:55,320
don't want to say that I don't want to say that I just want to highlight that this is a

91
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:02,640
natural part of what happens is that sometimes we use it as a way to just make ourselves feel

92
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:10,200
better without actually using practices in a way to help us find more freedom

93
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,959
sometimes we might think that just avoiding everything that's unpleasant is freedom

94
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:21,360
but there's a sense of freedom is like has a sense of possibility

95
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,760
even though it's uncomfortable even though it's not what we want even

96
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,100
though it's uh maybe even exactly what we don't want

97
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:40,140
but this sense of like oh yeah this this this has potential here I can feel that

98
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:47,279
this is the way forward and often it is kind of like a feeling like our intuition kind of acknowledges okay yeah

99
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,480
this is the way forward

100
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,500
so I'll say that for me uh I would unknowingly would do a certain

101
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:04,019
amount of this of this what we might call spiritual bypassing is just because

102
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:09,720
this mind for whatever reason can get settled

103
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:17,160
I have stories about why that is maybe I'll just say just my professional training and stuff was just a lot of having to

104
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:22,320
focus a lot of focus you know just the years and years and years of having to focus

105
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:30,000
and just kind of bled into my meditation practice so I kind of like use concentration as a

106
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,160
way to like numb myself from you know difficulties some

107
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:40,500
of the emotional turmoil or confusion especially in my early Retreat practice

108
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,959
I would go on all these Retreats and get concentrated

109
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:51,480
there was some relief there but and it wasn't all bad of course there were some

110
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:58,680
useful things too but I didn't notice how I was often not being mindful

111
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:04,380
but just being concentrated getting concentrated instead so kind of maybe

112
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:10,500
not as sensitive to what else was happening like my environment or my inner life but instead I was kind of

113
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,959
like concentrated you know I found my way through that

114
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:22,920
but uh it took me some time because I just to recognize oh yeah

115
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:28,200
it was a habit that had fallen into that maybe it wasn't I could have there could

116
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:34,860
have been worse habits of course right but this idea I thought I was being Mindful and I thought I was following

117
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:40,500
the instructions and turns out I wasn't in the way that maybe would have been

118
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:46,320
more helpful I also know there's a

119
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,560
somebody was reporting to me they were describing their practice and we were

120
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:59,639
talking about loving kindness practice and this individual was saying yeah I'd love to do loving kindness and I do it

121
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:05,399
all the time and I thought oh that's fantastic that's great and we were talking about it a little bit more and I

122
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:11,540
said well maybe you could describe to me you know what your love and kindness practice is

123
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:18,300
and essentially boiled down to whenever she was angry or annoyed with somebody

124
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:25,200
she would just no I said the gender I meant not to but this person would say

125
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,980
may you be happy may you be healthy but you know it was kind of this contrived thing just to

126
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:37,560
help her not feel the annoyance and frustration and anger and she was doing

127
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:43,500
it a lot all day long so she was feeling like oh yeah I'm really spiritual and doing love and kindness practice

128
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:48,720
I don't blame her of course because loving kindness sometimes does

129
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,720
open our hearts and make us feel this connection and warmth towards people

130
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:01,560
and we practice it with difficult people so of course it makes sense to be doing it in this setting but in this way it

131
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:08,700
was kind of like a sledgehammer or something like to maybe just make the situation go away

132
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,920
or make what she was feeling trying to go away

133
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:23,220
so spiritual bypassing also can be related to attachment to views

134
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:30,300
it's like holding on to views beliefs practices

135
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:37,380
thoughts we might think that they serve like spiritual thoughts or spiritual views or

136
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:45,120
spiritual ideas and therefore we should hold on to them but there's a way in which

137
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:52,199
you like maybe I'll say this that integral to like Buddhist practice is the even the idea that you practice

138
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:58,800
but with meditation practice with with speech livelihood

139
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,199
with our actions following the precepts ethical Behavior right there's all these

140
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:09,660
things that we do as opposed to just have beliefs or

141
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:16,440
thoughts that we're just holding on to and so and seven factors of Awakening

142
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:22,680
one of the key elements here is investigation to like be engaged with what's happening and to be open to

143
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:29,279
learning about it being open to learning something new it's really integral to practice these

144
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,320
ideas of investigation and practicing

145
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,420
but there can be some way of between spiritual practice in which kind of the

146
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:44,459
investigation and the practice is kind of like gone to the side

147
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:52,019
and instead we have these you know dogmatism or fundamentalism or like no

148
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:57,779
it's this way and somehow there can be this feeling

149
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:03,000
like it's like maybe it's comforting to like okay I know the truth

150
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,720
and I'm right and everybody else is wrong and I don't have to bother with all that pesky meditation practice it's

151
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:17,100
hard I don't like it I get to feel like I'm the right and everybody else is wrong

152
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:22,920
but of course of course the kind of it I mean I want

153
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:30,180
to say of course we do this to different extremes about different ideas

154
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:38,040
a friend of mine was telling me about a small little suit to study group that got created and people were really

155
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:45,360
dedicated to practice loved studying the suit does and they would get together and read them and talk about them and

156
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,240
you know have and said some of them one person like read Paulie so could like

157
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:58,019
look at the language and talk about it and talk about how meaningful and fun and to be with like-minded people and to

158
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:03,019
engage with them and until

159
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:09,480
it came to a particular suit that really emphasized this one particular

160
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:16,380
teaching and one person said yeah I I don't know I'm not so sure about that I'm not

161
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:21,780
really going to emphasize that and one other person said no you have to

162
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:28,199
you how can you be a Buddhist practitioner you have to believe all of this and you're not a real Buddhist

163
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:34,740
practitioner if this person happened to be the person who said this isn't important for me right now was a teacher

164
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:39,840
right who had dedicated their life to being to the Dharma but you could see where you know this

165
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:47,400
one individual had this one idea and then that group kind of ended up falling apart and there was like a lot

166
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:53,760
of kind of lament like it was so rich and fun and

167
00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:00,480
engaging and kind of opening up some new ideas but because one person had this idea these are these particular things

168
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,539
that are in the suit does and you Orient your life around them and if you

169
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:08,720
don't

170
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:19,799
so instead of this kind of like engaging with or investigating kind of like

171
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:25,559
sliding into some fundamentalism and I know Gil and I in our majama class

172
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:33,179
that we teach the suit to study class that we teach we talk about this a lot how the last thing we want is for some

173
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:39,660
fundamentalism or dogmatism so we often are looking at okay what are the poly words here and they can be understood

174
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:47,100
this way and they could be understood this other way it's kind of translators choice of how they interpret this or

175
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:53,460
emphasize it and really want to recognize that there's some ambiguity

176
00:18:53,460 --> 00:19:01,320
there last thing we want is to just cling and say this is the absolute truth

177
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,780
that's not freedom that's not freedom

178
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:12,360
if you feel like you have it and nobody else does then you have to

179
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:17,460
prop it up like no no that's true because x y z and then you have to like

180
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,440
not be as open to other people

181
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:30,780
so there's a sway in which holding on to views as a way of maybe spiritual bypassing

182
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:39,120
and views maybe I'll say that or underlying beliefs or Concepts or

183
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,580
thoughts Notions that we have and often they're hidden

184
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,740
like we don't even really know that we have these views until

185
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:56,340
we bump up against something that's really against our views or makes us feel uncomfortable

186
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:02,000
and then it becomes highlighted oh yeah

187
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:08,280
that we may not be come clear about our views until they are threatened Maybe

188
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:15,620
by a crisis we may think that we

189
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:23,160
understand in permanence until the left one gets a terrible

190
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:28,440
diagnosis and then we realize oh yeah I did kind

191
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:34,559
of have this Hidden View that lots of things are impermanent but

192
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:42,539
somehow there's a sway that we kind of thought there were some exceptions when we say it out loud it

193
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:49,020
doesn't make any sense but we didn't realize that we kind of thought maybe relationships go sour

194
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:55,260
okay I thought oh no I thought that this was something that stable it was going to be a lasting

195
00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:02,700
source of happiness or maybe we may not even know about some

196
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:10,980
of these deeper views that we have until they're reflected back to us by teachers or friends or maybe even sometimes the

197
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:17,580
most difficult people in our life they're difficult because they're highlighting for us something that we

198
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:23,460
don't like about ourselves some idea that

199
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:30,419
maybe we have this view that um we must be productive

200
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:37,740
like that's what it means to be a good quote unquote person is to be productive

201
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:43,559
and then we spend all of our time you know trying to just do things

202
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:50,779
and then maybe something happens we're not able to be productive we get sick

203
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:58,980
or maybe we lose our employment or maybe we have to stop doing what we

204
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:05,159
usually do to take care of somebody or maybe we retire

205
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:11,520
and then we start to realize oh wow now that I'm not productive in the

206
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,860
way that I was I didn't realize how I had this view that my value somehow was

207
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:23,220
associated with this and not recognizing that we have value

208
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:28,740
of course we do it's not dependent on how much we're

209
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:36,240
doing I know this is a little bit of heresy

210
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,580
especially here kind of like in Silicon Valley where we really pride ourselves and working working working and I

211
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:47,520
certainly went through phases in my life I did that too and you know I still have some vestiges

212
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,860
of that now but what are some of these like

213
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,600
underlying views that we have

214
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:06,200
maybe I'll also say that something about views is that they're

215
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:14,100
resistant to change often even if we have some information

216
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:20,640
that says that they're oh maybe this doesn't make sense they often have this kind of

217
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,520
embeddedness or this inertia to them so that we can't

218
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:33,120
just change them and of course we know this right in the

219
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:40,320
past couple of years this has really been highlighted that there might be this Persistence of a view or a belief

220
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:47,340
because we're getting all our information from just a very highly select sources that just

221
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:55,100
can reaffirm our views we don't have we're not exposed to any

222
00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:00,120
alternative or ideas or even this idea of confirmation bias

223
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:05,340
right where we might see some clear information that is

224
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:11,640
not the same as our views we might have this maybe this underlying view that

225
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:18,539
the world is not safe and then we have to like feel like we're

226
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:23,940
always being vigilant might be perfectly legitimate reason why

227
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:29,400
a person doesn't think that the world is safe I don't want to diminish that

228
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:37,200
but sometimes they are overlooking the times when they are feeling safe

229
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:44,840
when they're maybe at home with their loved ones under a blanket watching TV

230
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:50,880
or when they're petting their dog or you know something like this

231
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:57,360
so even though there might be some data that's coming in that there is times that are that were safe

232
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:03,600
I don't want to diminish that we have these views it's just human nature that

233
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,700
we hold on to them and that we're impacted by earlier experiences in our

234
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:14,039
life so we don't want to have this idea of like oh I shouldn't hold on to views

235
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:19,440
okay now that I know that I'm going to just drop all of them I have to honor and respect our

236
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,960
experience and just to recognize oh

237
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:31,799
okay this is a view I have it feels integral to how I navigate the world it feels integral to

238
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:36,840
how I conceive of myself and it makes sense

239
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:42,720
right now it's how I navigate right now it's how

240
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:49,620
I'm making sense of what it means to be the person that I experienced myself to be right now

241
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:56,960
and have this little openness to that instead of this feeling like nope this is how it is

242
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:04,679
but there's also a way in which sometimes we might be holding on to views

243
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:10,200
just because we don't like the ambiguity we feel a little bit uncomfortable we

244
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:15,240
want there is something reassuring it's just about finding something to land on

245
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:20,340
and stand on like nope this is it this

246
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:27,080
trying to think of like one that I wanted to say the Earth is flat

247
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:33,419
really right there was a long time when people still believe that even though you know all the scientists are and I

248
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:40,740
guess the the people going on the ships were coming back around you know years later saying actually it's not flat

249
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:47,279
but there's a way in which I don't want we just want to have something decided

250
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:53,820
so we might hold on to it and we don't want to address it again like nope I just decided this once and I'm not going

251
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:59,220
to come back around or maybe there's just this idea of

252
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:04,520
stubbornness to I don't want to change views because

253
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:09,539
they don't want to acknowledge that maybe they're influenced by others or

254
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:17,640
maybe that's somebody else had a better idea or that's maybe it's what implies that

255
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:23,840
maybe their idea wasn't the best idea something like this

256
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:31,200
so clinging to views is a part of I'll say

257
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,840
maybe maybe a part of spiritual bypassing

258
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:45,919
but I would say so it's not like we have to abandon all our views we don't go to the opposite extreme we might think of

259
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:52,140
views and our relationship to them happening along a spectrum

260
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:57,720
so in one way is which we're holding on to ideas that

261
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:03,179
I believe this and everybody else who believes anything different is wrong and

262
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:08,279
I'm not going to change my mind and then there's something in the middle

263
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:14,340
about like views are helpful and supportive and I'm holding them a little bit lightly

264
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:22,159
a good example of this is uh Right View wise view as I mentioned earlier

265
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:28,919
or that Buddha he recognized the importance of use because it influences our actions and influence our

266
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:36,059
aspirations it influences just other the way our thoughts are

267
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:41,640
priorities has such an integral way in which we navigate the world

268
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:47,700
and so he offered Right View at the beginning of the Eightfold Path

269
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:54,000
one way we might understand or work with Right View is just using it as

270
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,340
a framework to say okay there's suffering

271
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:05,039
and there's a way to the ending of suffering we could simplify right view

272
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:10,200
in this way as a as a framework in which to view our

273
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,779
experience does this lead to suffering or away from suffering and that could be

274
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:20,899
really helpful to be sensitive to that

275
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:29,159
but we can also hold on to the Buddhist teachings

276
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:37,220
as a way that to recognize that cling interviews is still clinging

277
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:42,419
and clinging does not lead to Greater Freedom it's just

278
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:48,120
thinking that leads to suffering so that doesn't mean that we should like

279
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:53,880
get rid of like right view or something like this but instead

280
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:59,460
we can maybe building on the simile of the raft is that the teachings

281
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:07,260
are a raft that brings us from this Shore in which there's suffering and difficulties and

282
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:13,679
over this expanse of water to the other Shore where there's the ending of suffering

283
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,960
so we use the teachings right to help as a raft that brings us to the other side

284
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,240
and for those of you who are familiar with this assembly of the raft you'll know that

285
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,940
Buddha gives the teaching when you get to the other side you don't think like wow that was so

286
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:37,320
helpful I don't think I could have got across without that raft now I'm going to carry this raft wherever I go on my head and shoulders

287
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,960
has this little detail in the suit does on my head and shoulders just in case I might need it

288
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,960
no that's like clinging to views it's like we hold it when it's helpful and let it

289
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:56,279
go when it's not helpful so this opposite is kind of clinging

290
00:30:56,279 --> 00:31:01,919
and then so that's maybe I'm talking about this spectrum so we have this really clinging

291
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:08,880
like using views and as a way to bring more freedom and ease Peace Love

292
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:15,120
goodness into our lives and then we might say there's this other

293
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:20,640
side which maybe in some ways we would even say is not on the Spectrum but just

294
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,460
on the opposite to end and this is this um

295
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:32,880
freedom from the attachment of views and awakened completely awakened people who

296
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:40,799
has overcome all attachments it's part of what Liberation is

297
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:47,820
is just recognizing that things are arising and passing they arise due to conditions

298
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:53,580
and some way there's no reification of anything

299
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:58,620
say like I like this I don't like that it doesn't happen because there isn't

300
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:03,919
the self in the center that is

301
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,020
different or distinct from whatever's arising different than what's all the

302
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:15,360
conditions it's just part of the conditions that are arising and there's

303
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:22,799
no need to hold on and grasp to a view have a view when it's helpful and put it

304
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:28,020
down when it's not helpful and then part of so that's maybe I'll

305
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:35,279
say the end of this end of the spectrum and so the Buddhist position is not that all

306
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:41,159
of you should be discarded it's just that we're flexible in how we

307
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:46,440
use them and the movement towards freedom is all

308
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:53,520
clinging or holding on to them less and less and less until there's just maybe more like a

309
00:32:53,520 --> 00:33:00,559
flowing of experience or conditions coming and going

310
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:08,820
so this idea of spiritual bypassing is a way in which we might use spiritual

311
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:15,720
teachings or practices as a way to help us avoid what's uncomfortable

312
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:21,179
so what was supposed to maybe we started the Buddhist practice for meditation practice because we wanted to find more

313
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:28,140
ease in our life and then we discover that it doesn't necessarily help us but in the way that

314
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:33,299
can is onward leading but just helps us avoid

315
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:39,120
and then one of the ways this spiritual bypassing is happening is by clinging to

316
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,940
views it's like I know the truth or or not being willing to have this

317
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:50,480
beginner's mind or this an open mind to some other ideas

318
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:58,799
so maybe I'll end there and open it up to see if there's some questions or

319
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:06,360
comments about a big spiritual bypassing or clinging to

320
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,898
views

321
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:31,980
yeah thank you oh what I was thinking about as you

322
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:37,560
spoke which is kind of it kind of overlaps with what you were

323
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:44,878
talking about is um the comfort of delusion

324
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:51,658
which is kind of what I've been reflecting on lately like there's some delusion that's really uncomfortable we want to get out of it quickly

325
00:34:51,659 --> 00:35:00,900
but there's also a lot of comfort in delusion and then the motivation to resolve it is

326
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:06,740
is tricky and so as you were speaking I was thinking like

327
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:14,280
overlaps with what you're talking about you know because when I know what my opinion is then I

328
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:21,480
know who I am and there's comfort in knowing who I am

329
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,780
and um it's more uncomfortable

330
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:34,079
to abide in that uncertainty of not having a set identity sometimes you know

331
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:39,540
not being so fixated not so clearly formed right

332
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:46,099
sometimes it's more uncomfortable that uh

333
00:35:46,099 --> 00:35:52,560
uh a knowing and less definite

334
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,599
um place

335
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:03,540
so I would like to ask you said when we have this like I know and

336
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:10,020
but I have that that's the truth and I'm it's the self-righteousness that uh comes up sometimes right we all do this

337
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:16,740
we all love this word but is it maybe in that moment it feels good right because there's this up surge

338
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:22,440
of energy and but there's this sense of disconnection too right so yeah sure

339
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:29,760
ultimately it's it's uncomfortable and even the yeah absolutely and it's divisive and it's um there's so there's

340
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:36,420
a lack of connection because I'm opposing um absolutely

341
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:41,640
um but also the the comfort of

342
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:46,519
delusion is even just like

343
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,960
falling asleep in the chair watching the

344
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:01,578
TV show on a Saturday afternoon kind of just falling into

345
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:07,800
um you know it's very comfortable yeah yeah

346
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:14,460
um and sometimes we need this though I want to say sometimes humans need to kind of like disengage and recharge is

347
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:19,740
that yeah absolutely I mean well we need it until we don't need it but

348
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:25,140
we convince ourselves we need it this is part of practice is to figure

349
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:30,240
out right yeah I mean again

350
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,760
why would we you know

351
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:43,260
the comfort of delusion is all these different nuanced levels sometimes it's it's clinging to a strong view sometimes

352
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:48,599
it's having no opinion sometimes it's [Music] um

353
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:59,280
just spacing out sometimes it's you know but there's this stickiness which is

354
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,500
um the on I mean you know the language gets

355
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:09,660
nuanced because we it's it's we can say it's the unwillingness to see

356
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:14,820
clear but it's not the unwillingness you know it's just there's delusion right

357
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:20,400
um so um anyway it's been my reflection lately that

358
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:26,640
um yeah the comfort of delusion and how to overcome that sometimes it's clearer

359
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:33,660
than others and and then you know there's just delusion yeah I guess I wouldn't use the word delusion

360
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:39,180
though there's a delusion right it has a little bit pejorative flavor to it

361
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:46,760
um at least in my ears it does but sometimes swears we like are unknowingly

362
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:51,900
disengaging because we don't feel like we have the energy or the capacity or

363
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:58,140
the wherewithal to meet with what's happening and I feel so much about practice it's about just increasing our

364
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:03,420
capacity to be with whatever is arising so we don't have maybe the capacity

365
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:12,020
right now but maybe we have more capacity than we used to and maybe we'll be able to hold those uncomfortable

366
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:17,820
experiences or thoughts or something like that yes absolutely the word

367
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:24,119
delusion is just the word that's used so it's not I'm not using it in a critical sense in

368
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:30,720
the moment but it's ignorance or whatever it's the word that's used to

369
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:37,800
in the classical sense right so just where we aren't enlightened we aren't clear we

370
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:44,420
are with it right until we become awakened we all have that right but uh

371
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:49,280
and we're not quite motivated to overcome it

372
00:39:49,579 --> 00:39:54,720
well you probably wouldn't be here if there wasn't a part of you that was smart

373
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:03,680
um yeah thank you anybody else have a comment or

374
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,760
a question

375
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:24,300
okay okay so thank you thank you for your practice and for being here and wishing you a

376
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,200
good rest of the evening
