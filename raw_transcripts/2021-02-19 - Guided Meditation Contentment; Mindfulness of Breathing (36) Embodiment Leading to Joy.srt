1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,639
so good morning and welcome to the meditation session

2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:15,759
one of the very supportive qualities for meditation and for the

3
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:24,400
buddhist path is contentment and the image of contentment is that of

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:32,960
a bird flying unburdened with its wings

5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,600
so a bird doesn't really carry anything with it luggage and kitchen sinks and the idea of an

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,120
unburdened wings that we fly we move we

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,239
are free is the reference point for contentment

8
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,239
and there's nothing about renunciation in this classic teaching of contentment

9
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:02,719
but rather it's a teaching on being content with what one has

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,600
and uh to be content with the situation one has maybe

11
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,799
for this minute or for this hour and that it's not a moral imperative to

12
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,640
be content but rather it's a pointer

13
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,759
to a way of being that supports our ability to be present discontent

14
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,240
is a support for being not being present for wanting more or being anxious or thinking ahead or

15
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:44,960
hoping and all kinds of things and to avail ourselves of the contentment

16
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:52,240
that's here that's reasonable at this time to be content

17
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,799
with one circumstance to be content classically the buddha talks about content with the clothes one has the

18
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:05,520
robes and monastic has to be content with the food that one has

19
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:13,040
to be content with what to to look for where it's reasonable to be

20
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,360
content and if we combine that with the first

21
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,680
beginning of mindfulness or breathing which is very much body centered

22
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,599
then the contentment can be be an embodied contentment

23
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:39,040
a contentment which is not a thinking so much only thinking but a contentment

24
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,920
that is felt somatically is a contentment that feels that comes

25
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,000
along with the relaxation that

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,040
starts off this practice of anapanasati

27
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:08,720
and perhaps it's a contentment found in the relaxing even in the simplest muscles that relax

28
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:17,200
that there can be some feeling there of contentment or ease or well-being and to

29
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,959
be attuned to that and that's an antidote to being attuned

30
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:30,959
to our fears being attuned to our desires our thoughts our stories it's

31
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,720
shifting the paradigm of where we find our home

32
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:44,239
and finding our home here in this body breathing contentedly

33
00:03:44,239 --> 00:04:01,840
being present so assuming a meditation posture

34
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:14,879
a posture which allows us to be to be alert but also

35
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:22,320
a posture that is just comfortable enough that there's space

36
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,639
for contentment so not collapsing or slouching in the

37
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,040
couch

38
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:45,039
it's hard to feel contentment if the body is in a lot of discomfort

39
00:04:51,360 --> 00:05:01,280
gently closing the eyes and taking a few fuller breaths

40
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:08,880
breathing in and a long exhale

41
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,759
and maybe for three times to have a much longer exhale than

42
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,600
usually do maybe with a little maybe internally in

43
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,800
your mind when that wonderful mantra

44
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:39,840
the mantra of contentment

45
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:21,360
and then letting yourself breathe normally and to do a progressive relaxation of

46
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,639
the body but to do so each time you're able to

47
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,639
relax some part of the body to feel whatever

48
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:39,280
positive feelings that comes with that maybe it's contentment

49
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:47,440
maybe it's relief maybe it's ease or a feeling of goodness

50
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,960
or feeling of rightness

51
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,639
beginning with the muscles of the face

52
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,280
as you exhale relaxing the forehead

53
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,319
all the way around to the temples

54
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:23,440
relaxing around the eyes if the eyes are trying to see

55
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,800
see if you can let the eyes rest in their sockets with the eyes closed there's nothing to

56
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,638
see or to understand

57
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,840
relaxing the muscles of the cheeks and the jaw around the mouth

58
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,960
softening and around the shoulders

59
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,560
releasing the shoulders to the pull of gravity

60
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,840
maybe a softening around the shoulder blades

61
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,839
and softening around the chest

62
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:55,839
around the heart

63
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:23,839
and then what happens if you release your belly soften in the belly

64
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:36,800
sometimes softening the belly is complicated but perhaps there's also some feeling of

65
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:51,839
positive feeling in doing so

66
00:09:53,519 --> 00:10:01,680
and it might also be possible to relax the whole body

67
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:08,639
to release the way that we're braced against life or contracted

68
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:19,839
a deeper settling

69
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:26,959
and to be here now with some contentment

70
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,839
there may be things in the world which

71
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,160
there's discontentment about maybe for the time being to put those

72
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:47,360
aside and appreciate what there is to be

73
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:55,120
content with right now here in the immediacy of this moment

74
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:05,839
within the experience of this body and mind

75
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,639
an embodied feeling of contentment

76
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:29,839
or of ease

77
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,839
which maybe comes along somehow with the

78
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,839
breathing

79
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:57,839
and to begin sensing the body breathing

80
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,839
and is there any point in the cycle of breathing in and out

81
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,399
that contains within it some more distinct feelings of

82
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:25,839
contentment of ease

83
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:40,720
where it feels okay just to go along with it to be satisfied with this moment of

84
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:57,120
breathing maybe it's during the exhale

85
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,199
content just follow along to ride the exhale

86
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:12,000
or maybe the inhale content to be carried and lifted

87
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:21,839
by the inhale

88
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,639
and then relaxing the mind

89
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:34,079
softening quieting the activities of mind thinking

90
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,399
so there might also be some contentment of mind

91
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:48,160
a contentment to just be here with the present moment

92
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,720
with what it whatever's in the present moment that

93
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:01,120
allows you to be content just to be alive just to breathe

94
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:16,399
putting aside your burdens they can be for later and for these

95
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:27,839
minutes content to just be present unburdened

96
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,199
maybe like a bird flying

97
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,839
your wings catch the updraft of the inhale

98
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:55,839
and glide on the exhale one breath after another

99
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:10,720
maybe to notice the contentment that's already here

100
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:19,120
maybe that's unnoticed it lives in the body

101
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:26,320
or maybe you recognize it more as calm or subtleness

102
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:36,000
some positive feeling of satisfaction or well-being and no matter how small it

103
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:44,240
might be let that support your breathing

104
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:52,480
maybe it comes along as you breathe or you breathe with it or through it

105
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:13,840
as a way of encouraging you to be more embodied in this practice

106
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:58,400
and then as we come to the end of this sitting take a few moments to feel more

107
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,680
whatever way that you feel more settled in your body

108
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,200
or that you feel more content or calm

109
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:18,800
if your knees ache or you feel need to readjust your posture

110
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:35,359
to feel more settled and content please do so

111
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:42,800
and feeling some ways in which you are more settled or content

112
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:50,319
now imagine that you're meeting with someone else

113
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:00,720
and you meet them without your need without impulse to interfe interrupt or

114
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,720
to speak over eagerly but that with your contentment and

115
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:13,280
subtleness you're more ready to listen

116
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:21,839
more inclined to really be present for someone

117
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,839
without asserting oneself on them

118
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:33,759
maybe also with not without closing down or pulling away

119
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,960
and it becomes a gift we can give others if some of these qualities of subtleness

120
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:51,359
calm and contentment that has happens in meditation

121
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:59,838
is shared with others and how we are present for them

122
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,440
and may it be a gift of our meditation

123
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:16,640
that we're able to create a safe place for people to be themselves

124
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:22,880
and we listen and we're present

125
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,078
may it be that we learn how to be a gift for our world

126
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:40,160
in offering presence and attention and safety to others

127
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:46,160
and in this way may some of the benefits and merit that

128
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:52,839
comes from our practice be for the welfare and happiness of

129
00:43:52,839 --> 00:44:00,240
others may we practice so that

130
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:07,200
we we support the happiness of other beings

131
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,720
the safety of others

132
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,560
that others may experience peacefulness

133
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:27,440
that they may have room to be unburdened unlimited

134
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:37,838
by our presence so they have room to be free

135
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:46,000
may all beings be happy may all beings be safe

136
00:44:46,000 --> 00:45:05,839
peaceful and free may all beings everywhere be free

137
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,599
so

138
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:32,319
i think many of you have heard from me and maybe other buddhist teachers and

139
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:37,760
teachings the value of being embodied

140
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:43,680
so much so that i sometimes will with kind of imagine that it would have

141
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:50,880
been nice if we had translated sati not as mindfulness but as

142
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:56,400
uh body fullness it's such an important part of this practice

143
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:02,640
and in the two classic buddha teachings by the buddha on mindfulness

144
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:09,440
practice in the discourse the four foundations of mindfulness and the discourse on

145
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:18,160
mindfulness of breathing it begins with an emphasis on mindfulness of the body and

146
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:24,400
now one of the reasons for this is that the body the more present we are

147
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:30,000
for our body the more we're aware the more there's awareness that's alive and

148
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:37,040
and kind of available through the body the more the body becomes an instrument

149
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:45,200
for the growth of meditation practice it becomes the vehicle in space for some of the deeper feelings

150
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:52,880
some of the deeper qualities of meditation that begin to arise it's kind of like as the body

151
00:46:52,880 --> 00:47:02,318
receives some of the benefits of meditation those benefits are augmented or or um

152
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:08,560
not augmented but those those benefits grow and fill out and we get the most out of them

153
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:14,319
so what i'm talking about here partly is that as the body becomes more alive

154
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:20,000
and more sensitive and more of an instrument of sensations and experiences and feelings

155
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:28,480
it's not just feeling the body itself but it's also start the body becomes the the sensor

156
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:33,760
for feeling some of the goodness that comes from meditation and i would use the word goodness in a

157
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:40,559
very abstract vague way like just like maybe like the word all the some of the positive feelings

158
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:47,440
that can come with meditation so um classically it's joy and happiness

159
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:55,040
but it could also be contentment i like the word ease quite a bit there can be

160
00:47:55,040 --> 00:48:01,680
gladness there's deep feelings of equanimity deep feelings of

161
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:06,960
of confidence that can arise even feelings of being of inner

162
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:13,440
cleanliness and inner purity that really are embodied feelings that kind

163
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,640
of course through us so all these qualities are felt more fully

164
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:25,040
when they're felt throughout the whole body felt with the body if the body is not available then it

165
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:30,160
becomes a mental thing and sometimes that's quite wonderful and and

166
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:35,200
profound in its own way but it's really uh especially in the beginning stages of

167
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:41,040
meditation it's really a way of um being quite limited in the experience

168
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:47,680
and it gives us a different impression of what meditation is about um and different orientation which if

169
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:52,720
it's too much towards the mind it doesn't really help us

170
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:59,440
develop the wholeness the unification of all of ourselves

171
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:05,280
which is ideally what we're looking for in buddhist meditation

172
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:12,480
i think it's one of the meanings of samadhi is unification bringing it all together here present

173
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:19,359
so the so again the body is not just a you know a bunch of physical stuff that

174
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:25,359
we have to carry around with us the body is a is a significant

175
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:32,800
uh repository of nerve endings significant uh location for

176
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:38,960
uh the emotions the feelings the the goodness of meditation to course through us or to fill us

177
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:44,160
and be here um

178
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:50,400
the um the so to begin tuning in being relaxing the

179
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:59,680
body sitting in with the body feeling the body is uh one way in which we begin to

180
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:06,800
open up to this repository of goodness as i said classically what comes next

181
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:12,480
after the first four steps of anapanasati what comes next as a practice deepens is

182
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:20,559
some feelings of well-being joy or ease or gladness and something like and so

183
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:26,319
to know that that's coming to know that's part of meditation it can and then encourage us to be a

184
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:31,599
little bit more sensitive to when they start uh appearing the hints of them appear

185
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:38,079
and we start feeling a little bit the these good feelings that come sometimes it feels like pleasure in the

186
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:44,319
body or tingling at places a sense of lightness that comes and

187
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:51,839
it's not that we're trying to make it happen so much or or searching for it or striving for it

188
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:58,640
but when it begins to show show themselves a little bit there's an art to opening to them

189
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:03,760
to relaxing with them to include them so they go along with the breathing or the

190
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:09,359
breathing goes along with them so we're encourage us to become even

191
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:15,200
more embodied to feel these in our body and as we feel this goodness

192
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:20,839
to kind of breathe with it and open with it and continue this process of feeling and sensing and

193
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:26,559
developing as we go along and

194
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:34,640
so the contentment is part of this to feel contentment allows

195
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:40,880
it isn't like again a moral obligation to feel content but it allows for this filling out of

196
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:47,520
the practice and really being rooted and centered here in this body feeling more and more

197
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:52,800
the same thing with this idea of being in the present moment and not thinking about the past and

198
00:51:52,800 --> 00:52:00,240
future it's not like a moral obligation we have to do that but when we're no longer caught up in

199
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:07,119
the past and future in thoughts it allows for possibility of filling out more into the wholeness of this moment

200
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:13,680
that includes so much more of us and it's kind of like a momentum a movement towards becoming

201
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:20,480
really whole and present with all of who we are and part of that comes along with

202
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:25,599
relaxation and and uh tranquility calmness is a

203
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:33,040
more and more space for uh delight a joy well-being a sense of pleasure

204
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:40,720
and just being alive and being here and i think of this joy of meditation as being a joy that has

205
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:48,240
no opposite it's just a joy that exists kind of in its own way if it had an

206
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:54,480
opposite then you know it's we can swing from one to the other but it has no opposite so

207
00:52:54,480 --> 00:53:00,000
certainly we can not have it not be there but it isn't that it swings it's not part of a pendulum that goes from

208
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,440
one to the other so for example if your joy is dependent

209
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:11,520
on praise the opposite then is blame and then the pendulum can swing because

210
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:18,318
dependent on getting something or if your joy is dependent on

211
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:24,640
success then there can be failure if it's dependent on physical pleasure

212
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:31,920
it can be dependent on things being uncomfortable and so but the joy of meditation does not have

213
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:39,359
an opposite it just has this wonderful simple and clear quality of surfacing and

214
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:44,880
arising and being here without really in a sense not depending

215
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:50,559
on the things that come and go in the world so much but is a wellspring that flows within

216
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:56,400
the body and so the more we can kind of center ourselves in the body relax be

217
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:03,920
present the more we will be

218
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:10,400
you know starting to open up to our potential our capacity

219
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:17,680
for well-being for joy for happiness and um and that's a wonderful thing and

220
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:24,480
it turns out that meditative joy and happiness is a wonderful it continues this process

221
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:32,240
of unification of wholeness bringing more and more of ourselves into the picture so that we can

222
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:37,119
continue on a path to liberation
