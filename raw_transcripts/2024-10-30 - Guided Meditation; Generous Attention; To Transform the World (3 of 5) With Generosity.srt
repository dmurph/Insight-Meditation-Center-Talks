1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:07,360
hello and welcome and I Delight in the greetings in the

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:14,759
chat the YouTube chat and both the greetings and uh all the locations that

3
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,039
people are connecting from and um I feel

4
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:26,160
kind of this a radiating field of

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:34,279
Goodwill from all these locations and so thank you for being part of

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:43,559
this uh many years ago I was very inspired

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,840
or encouraged by a and and and

8
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,960
uh a little bit Amazed by a very little simple Zen

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,359
teaching there's a Zen they have a lot of stories of

10
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,600
of uh practitioner students uh asking the Zen master a

11
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:13,840
question and someone asked um the Zen master uh what is the Gate of

12
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:21,520
Zen and I think on the surface of the question what is the entry way to to

13
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:28,280
Zen and uh and the teacher answered

14
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:35,240
generosity and that's it that's the end of the story and uh but why it struck me it

15
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:42,520
struck me two ways one was that generosity is the often seen as the entrylevel

16
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,640
experience uh practice Buddhism it's at the stage for everything

17
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,399
else and also because generosity because a gate is also the way you

18
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:00,840
leave you enter and leave a monastery through the gate and so you enter and

19
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,000
leave Zen you enter and leave Buddhism through the gate of

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,239
generosity you enter being generous and you leave being generous and this is also encapsulated

21
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:23,720
in a fantastic way that um that many of the kind of words for the great

22
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:31,640
relinquishment the great letting go we say in English uh that in poly in the

23
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:40,239
ancient language the word the word for letting go is more like giving away

24
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,720
it has the word generosity in it and actually there's a series of words for

25
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,920
the final deep release of

26
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:58,319
Liberation that uh has a double meaning to also mean generosity and uh to give something we

27
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:04,599
have to let go of something and uh we don't give and then hold

28
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:12,280
on and so the Gate of practice is generosity giving something giving some

29
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:19,319
releasing something so we'll sit with that today the idea of

30
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:25,440
generosity and um that we offer something that we

31
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:32,120
give and sometimes we give our love sometimes we live oura give our

32
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,720
care sometimes we give our Smiles sometimes we give uh

33
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,480
safety sometimes we give space sometimes we give

34
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,159
attention and all these forms things to be given are things given in

35
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:56,879
meditation we give our attention we give

36
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:03,000
space we give our respect we give our

37
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:10,079
care we give our generosity for each step along the

38
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:17,120
way to see it as an act of generosity not as an act of

39
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:25,919
accomplishment of getting something of attaining something or making something

40
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,720
happen so to assume a meditation process

41
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,599
posture and to gently close your

42
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:51,960
eyes and to sit here first evoking in

43
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,320
yourself the very best associations

44
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:03,960
feelings memories that you have for

45
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:11,800
generosity for being the recipient of a generous act for being

46
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,400
generous with someone

47
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:26,240
else and imagine that your generosity comes from

48
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:34,680
a from deep within you in a place inside which is

49
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:42,199
stable steady warm and

50
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:52,680
open and as you take some deeper breaths relax and settle

51
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,960
into some deeper place within

52
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:11,360
that's the foundation from which generosity is inspired

53
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,440
relaxing settling

54
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,039
in letting your breathing return to

55
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:03,160
normal and then to offer your body's experience of

56
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:11,960
breathing to offer it space provide breathing room for your

57
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,680
breathing so that the way you attend to the

58
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:27,919
breathing is not forceful not sharp and

59
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,520
pointed but light

60
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:43,479
gentle being generous to make room for the experience

61
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:49,919
of breathing welcome

62
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:21,400
and is there a generosity that's not of the mind it's

63
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,919
not something you have to think about but it's a

64
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:34,518
state of feeling the quality of the

65
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:41,680
heart or quality even deeper than that of the Torso or the

66
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,440
belly for

67
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:56,279
and whatever comes up into awareness whatever you know or

68
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:02,360
experiencing to take a metaphor step

69
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:10,040
back and have your attention to it be an act of

70
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,760
generosity as if seeing

71
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,079
knowing listening to what's

72
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:34,360
here is an expression of care care and good will

73
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,480
generosity where the practice is less about being

74
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:54,399
Mindful and more about offering a spirit of

75
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:01,240
generosity to all things that are present

76
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
for

77
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,240
for for

78
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:32,079
for

79
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,959
for for

80
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
oh

81
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,880
for for

82
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

83
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,760
for for

84
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

85
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,600
for for

86
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:10,000
if mindfulness is an act of

87
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,000
generosity how would you be

88
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,520
mindful e

89
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
for

90
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
for

91
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320

for for

93
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,120
and as we come to the end of this

94
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:02,679
sitting to consider as an thought

95
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,760
experiment if your biggest gift to the world the biggest benefit that you can

96
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:18,399
provide everyone including yourself is to spend the

97
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:24,640
day being generous with a spirit of generosity

98
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,440
everywhere you go

99
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:37,120
and where the generosity is

100
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:43,360
enacted with smiles of generosity

101
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:49,080
care opening doors for people making room for

102
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,360
people saying hello to

103
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:02,440
people but the whole day a day of generosity day of

104
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,320
giving how would that be for

105
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:15,840
you how would you end the day when you go to sleep a

106
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:25,360
day in which you abided in a state of generosity

107
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,080
may all

108
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:39,640
beings be put at ease with our

109
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:48,360
generosity may all beings feel safe in our field of

110
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:56,000
generosity where we don't want anything from anyone else

111
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:04,320
may all beings be

112
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:11,720
happy experiencing generosity as the

113
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:16,640
obvious first way in which they are

114
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:22,640
met May The Way We Walk Through This

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:30,039
World touch everything that we encounter

116

safe may all beings be peaceful may all beings be

free and may we contribute and environment that makes this

120
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,799
possible an environment of

121
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:18,869
[Music]

122
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:24,450
generosity thank [Music]

123
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,960
you

124
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,960
e e

125
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:41,639
so welcome to this third talk of a series titled to transform the

126
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:49,080
world and may it be that The Way We Walk Through This World contributes to it being um

127
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:55,960
becoming a better world and uh one of those

128
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:01,240
transformative steps that uh I think somewhere in all

129
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:06,919
cultures all religions emphasize the value of

130
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:13,320
generosity of giving and a marvelous Jaa tale kind of

131
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:21,440
a fable Buddhist Fable involves a um a little

132
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:28,799
parrot and um in the forest that the parot live lives in there starts a

133
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:34,519
gigantic forest fire and the animals run from the fire

134
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:39,720
but they run towards this huge body of water a lake where they can't

135
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:46,320
swim and uh so they become trapped between the they're going to be trapped between the fire and the

136
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:53,279
water and the parrot of course can fly but sees all this and a something has to be

137
00:32:53,279 --> 00:33:01,000
done and so the parrot flies into the water to wet its wings and then over

138
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:09,279
this gigantic forest fire it flies above it and shakes its wings to the drops

139
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:15,559
fall on the fire and the

140
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:23,600
uh and so the um and over and over and over again this

141
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:29,320
uh parrot went and ripped these drops on the Fire

142
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:35,279
and so this was a great Act of generosity of compassion of care that uh

143
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:44,000
had such a cosmic effect that it warmed the Throne of the great God

144
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,480
Brahma and uh the the kind of great God Brahma said who is doing this wonderful

145
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:58,320
act that should warm my Throne so Brahma turned himself into an eagle and flew

146
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:04,159
down to Sea and found this parrot do over and over again sprinkling

147
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:10,358
water on the huge fire and the the as an eagle Brahma said

148
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:16,919
what are you doing and um and the parot said well I'm trying to

149
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:23,760
put out the fire to save all these animals in the forest and the eagle

150
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:29,679
said isn't that ridiculous that uh uh how could you with

151
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:39,118
just a few little drops over and over again have any impact on the fire and uh and the parrot said

152
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:46,800
um um uh it doesn't matter uh what matters is that I have to

153
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:54,280
do something I have to try to make a difference and um and this was so uh

154
00:34:54,280 --> 00:35:00,720
this inspired Brahma to and so Brahma then created a big rainstorm and put out

155
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:07,400
the fire so this idea that to give even when

156
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:13,599
maybe giving or caring seems impossible and

157
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:21,160
um there's many stories in the that I've heard of um people the and instructions

158
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:30,160
when that there's conflict give give a gift don't give anger give a gift

159
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,280
there's a 50 years ago I read of um a community that lived high in the

160
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:44,119
mountains in the Philippines that have been living as they had done for many centuries and uh the custom of this uh

161
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:49,400
this community was when they wake up in the morning at breakfast they would tell

162
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:56,000
each other their dreams they had and if there was a dream about somebody else in

163
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,960
the community that that was um you know was somehow there was a conflict in

164
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:07,599
the dream of any kind something scary or difficult then uh the custom of the

165
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:15,079
community is that you would go and give a gift to that person and uh and this community

166
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:21,520
apparently was known to being a peaceful community known in the other neighboring

167
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:29,280
territories is living you know up in the mountains peacefully never causing any uh trouble for anybody else

168
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:36,240
and maybe this act of generosity was was what did it or there are stories of U uh

169
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:45,920
fables also of um of uh U you know an old poor woman coming

170
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,599
to um to you know

171
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:58,520
the maybe The Three Princesses of a royal family asking for some

172
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:04,319
arms and two of the older sisters give nothing but the younger sister gives

173
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:12,040
something and uh and that giving then transforms the the the fortune of the

174
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:17,319
younger sister in some dramatic way so there's many stories like this that

175
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:24,040
giving has a tremendous power but that of the parrot we give even if it's

176
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:30,040
hopeless we give because it transforms the world who knows who's watching who

177
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:38,480
knows the impact it will have uh to care for someone to offer something it's a uh

178
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:45,119
giving is a social lubricant giving is a way of

179
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:53,920
establishing safety warmth Good Will to others and often uh giving to the people

180
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,560
we're challenged with uh can disarm them it's

181
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:04,680
um it's uh uh you know it puts a crack in their

182
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:10,599
defense in their armor puts a cracker in their anger that uh it's hard to be

183
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:18,160
angry with someone who's given you a gift and it could doesn't have to be a big gift but here have this maybe it's

184
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:24,880
some cookies we baked at home maybe it's offering them a place at the table maybe

185
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,920
it's all kinds of things and um and uh

186
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:38,200
and why be generous one reason is that the opposite of generosity to be closed

187
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:43,599
to be closed to be held back to be

188
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:49,359
certainly to be miserly but to be just closed and tight or shut down from this

189
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:55,400
open-handed way of of uh living is actually harmful to ourselves it

190
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:03,440
actually limits ourselves diminishes our ourselves and so part of the reason to be generous is that it's good for us if

191
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:10,319
we give gener if we are generous in a healthy and wise way it doesn't have to

192
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:17,680
be giving away all our things it doesn't have to be big Act of generosity it can be done with gestures it can be done

193
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:23,599
with smiles it can be done with our attention it could be done

194
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:28,880
with uh you know things that uh uh you know don't cost

195
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:37,119
anything and um here can I bring you some water uh but to live generously so that

196
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:42,720
we feel a kind of release we feel a kind of handing over we don't hold on to

197
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,440
grudges we don't hold on to being closed it's a powerful act to be

198
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:55,560
generous and uh and it turns out that one of the many of series like three or

199
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:01,640
four of the different words that uh ancient Buddhism uses for to describe

200
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:07,400
the profound release of Liberation uh is um has a have dual

201
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:15,119
meanings not just one word but several word the most famous is the word chaga that means both uh letting go or

202
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:25,800
relinquishment and it means generosity to give so this uh uh this uh uh kind of uh

203
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:31,599
inseparability of Letting Go and

204
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:38,640
giving and letting go of whatever we're holding on to attached to through the

205
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:43,680
acts of generosity so uh we live in a difficult

206
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:48,960
world we live in a world where there's a lot of animosity a lot of fear a lot of

207
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:56,760
tension and it's not obvious you know the solution to the divisiveness of our

208
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:02,800
times but uh the viess of our times is the forest fire that we live

209
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,839
in and um and maybe each of us is a

210
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:13,680
parrot and maybe there's something that listens to the small parrot with its

211
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:19,280
little drops being generous in it in the best way only way that it knows how to

212
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,640
do it maybe something's listening profoundly listening that will come in

213
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:30,480
support and help this world of ours maybe a neighbor will notice maybe a

214
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,880
colleague will notice and maybe some of their anger some of their hostility will

215
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:43,280
diminish as they go home to their own family and maybe they're kinder to their

216
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:51,599
kids and that kindness to their kids maybe uh is the is the very thing that

217
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:59,240
prevents that kid to grow up in angry and bitter as well just as the parent did maybe

218
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:04,560
uh we don't know the effect of our acts of generosity and Goodwill on the people

219
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:11,800
that we encounter it might be profound the Ripple effects trust it and that's what the

220
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:18,079
story of Brahma this you know uh God uh that Lit that comes down to his

221
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:27,319
throne is warmed by the parrot's actions speaks to for me that there is um

222
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:35,359
that there is um something profound and unseen that we can't

223
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:41,359
see that is the consequence of how we live in this world in with our

224
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:47,559
generosity may it be that each of us acts generously no matter how strong the

225
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:52,800
fire is so that the ripple effect of

226
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,839
that results of which we might never see Trust TR those Ripple effects trust the

227
00:42:58,839 --> 00:43:05,119
way it reaches out into the world be a parrot offer what you

228
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:13,440
can to make this world a better place thank you
