1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,120
so welcome everyone we'll go ahead and get started it's delightful to be

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,679
joining all of you this week this week that will take us through the new year

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:18,240
and I'm happy to see so many of you here so this time of year the turning

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,359
over of a new year is a time when people reflect and consider what changes they

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:32,840
might like to make and that's kind of arbitrary of course you know the turning of the New Year it's it's all a

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,840
continuous revolution around the Sun but uh you know not completely so this time

7
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:45,719
of uh dark and quiet is a natural time to go Inward and consider what we would

8
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,559
like to encourage to come forth when we have the renewal of

9
00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:56,760
spring and sometimes when people reflect like that it's about uh letting go of

10
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,800
something you know let something that we could be doing less of and other times it's about cultivating

11
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,840
or creating or starting up something so this week we're going to talk about

12
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:15,640
various aspects of the Dharma that support or surround or provide context

13
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,439
to the actions of Letting Go and cultivation and we'll say more about

14
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:28,360
that after the sit that's a bit of a a taste so let's go ahead and get started

15
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:36,360
with our meditation together finding a posture for for sitting and settling

16
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:44,799
in allowing yourself to arrive mentally for

17
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:53,439
meditation and if you'd like to you can close your eyes to bring the attention

18
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:01,840
inward softening the attention bringing it in to the body

19
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:14,720
maybe taking a long slow deep breath and on the

20
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:21,599
exhale allowing the body to settle down maybe bringing attention

21
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:28,480
consciously down into the heart area and even down into the belly

22
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,519
sometimes this time of year is actually quite a busy one with guests or other

23
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:45,050
activities and just allowing yourself to release any sense of that kind of energy that may be

24
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:53,360
[Music] lingering we don't have any rush in

25
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,800
sitting here

26
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:12,040
inviting some softening into this posture

27
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,920
softening the face the forehead around the

28
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,120
eyes the

29
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,599
jaw softening the neck the shoulders

30
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:37,400
sometimes I imagine a little space between the very top of the spine and the

31
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,449
skull so there's a little dropping of the [Music]

32
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,640
chin letting the shoulders

33
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:59,200
soften maybe Imagining the shoulder blades sliding down the back

34
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,159
relaxing the arms and the

35
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,440
hands and then all down through the Torso chest

36
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:25,138
area [Music]

37
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:36,759
diaphragm down into the Bell B and including the muscles of the low

38
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,840
back and as all of that gently releases to the degree possible we can feel the

39
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,840
weight really settling into where we're sitting chair or

40
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,880
cushion or maybe you're lying down that's fine

41
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,120
feeling the weight settling into what's supporting

42
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,880
us and allowing that to happen really feeling the contact with

43
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,439
where you're sitting and the stability it

44
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:33,440
provides and also softening and releasing the legs all the way down to the

45
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,440
feet feeling the relative Stillness or

46
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,360
being in a sitting meditation posture

47
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,319
as you release into that seeing if there's a way that the body will

48
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:22,960
straighten itself up

49
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,880
naturally when we hold ourselves into certain positions which we do all the

50
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:38,319
time in subtle ways the body can lose touch with a

51
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,360
natural sense of

52
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:50,360
uplift what as we soften and Trust what's holding us up in this

53
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:57,879
moment there can be a feeling that the head gets pulled upward spine

54
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:03,960
naturally straightens without any strain just seeing if that's available

55
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,560
for you it works even if you're lying down

56
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,800
the spine will straighten out

57
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:32,319
soften and if there are parts of the body that are sore today

58
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:41,879
or have other issues you can just let them be bringing a sense of it's okay however

59
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:51,120
the body is right now body works hard for

60
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,440
us just inviting it to be included as it is

61
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:21,159
perhaps sensing the breath coming in going out natural breath

62
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:39,959
just temporarily let's direct the mind to bring

63
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:47,440
up some sense of intention or inspiration or

64
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,279
motivation for your practice it doesn't have to be anything

65
00:08:53,279 --> 00:09:00,680
Grand it could just be today's sense of why are you meditating here right

66
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:06,800
now or it could be something larger if that's what comes to

67
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:14,200
mind but just tuning in to that wholesome

68
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,120
motivation however it is for

69
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:34,720
you and in particular today let's really let that register in the

70
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:41,360
body one way to do that is to breathe breathe it

71
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:47,880
in or maybe you can just sense how the body

72
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:53,690
feels while the mind is attuned to this

73
00:09:53,690 --> 00:10:00,160
[Music] inspiration doesn't have to be any particular way but just registering what

74
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,640
it is in the body maybe you already do that or maybe it's novel to bring the

75
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:15,600
body into this otherwise mental activity let just see how that is

76
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:41,000
perhaps you can feel the goodness of a skillful motivation and let that register also in

77
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,240
the

78
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,880
body now we can release this deliberate thought or directing of the

79
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:11,730
mind and just return to mindfulness of things as they're

80
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:19,279
[Music] unfolding if you like to connect with the breath or the Body Sensations as

81
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:26,160
your normal object you can bring that in

82
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:40,279
just being with the flow of experience in a natural

83
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
way

84
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,160
e e

85
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:21,600
and when you find the Mind drifting off or caught

86
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:28,959
up in thought which is very normal

87
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,440
you may want to just touch in again briefly to the

88
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:44,839
inspiration or motivation or intention that you had earlier not at all as a way of

89
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:51,920
reprimanding the mind but actually as a way of supporting

90
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,959
it encouraging

91
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:05,639
it maybe Feeling Again that sense of uplift or what you felt in the body with

92
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:12,279
it and using that as a something that attracts the Mind back

93
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:17,600
to the present moment and then just go on with the

94
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:31,000
meditation sometimes the mind is like a small child and that it's easily distracted

95
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,920
but also easily comes back when reminded and

96
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,800
redirected to the present

97
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
moment

98
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

99
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

100
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

101
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

102
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

103
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

104
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

105
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,760
e e

106
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:38,039
sometimes the mind can even develop a little bit of momentum around

107
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:44,120
this inspiration or motivation kind of like when we have

108
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:50,919
momentum on a bicycle small deviations from

109
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:58,159
being perfectly balanced will rebalance themselves

110
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:04,080
spinning wheel will move back toward the center if it's spinning fast

111
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:12,440
enough in the same way if we're in touch with this goodness of

112
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,559
practice it can actually be like when the Mind goes off a little bit it

113
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:25,559
naturally moves back in that doesn't always

114
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:30,640
happen but sometimes we can tune into that

115
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:37,320
energy and if it's not present then just bringing it back each time with the

116
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:44,919
reminder of our inspiration strengthening that very

117
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
quality

118
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

119
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

120
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

121
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

122
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

123
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

124
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

125
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

126
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,320
e e

127
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:29,080
in the last few minutes of this meditation

128
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:39,840
we may wish to tune [Music] in to any effects that might have come

129
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:46,840
from being more consciously connected to your intention or

130
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:54,320
inspiration during this sit is there a different

131
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:00,480
feeling in the mind in terms of mindfulness or

132
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:07,000
alertness or ease or happiness is there a different feeling

133
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,840
of energy in the body it may be a subtle

134
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:19,840
effect or it may be quite noticeable or maybe you don't notice

135
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:27,880
anything the invitation is just to see if there's been any effect

136
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:48,640
and perhaps consider if even if there isn't a direct

137
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:55,159
feeling is there some way that this seems clearly supportive for you

138
00:27:55,159 --> 00:28:00,679
beneficial to have connected in this

139
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:10,880
way is there any sense of nourishment or care in the heart that it

140
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,960
brings and just tune into that

141
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,919
and as we are coming to the end may consider also

142
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:46,240
that what we're carrying in our heart and mind as to what we're doing and why

143
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:52,159
we're doing as we're doing our various intentions also affect

144
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:59,159
others even without saying them or having to do anything obvious

145
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:06,799
the very thing that we're carrying inside does affect the way that we interact with

146
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:12,159
people there's a way that they can kind of feel that at some subconscious level

147
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,720
so it does matter it does Ripple out into the

148
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:24,240
world going to the grocery store with the intention of just getting all the

149
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:30,720
stuff you need as quickly as possible so you can get out is different than going to the grocery

150
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,679
store with the intention to find all the things you need but to also be aware of

151
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:45,600
those around you or supportive of other people in the store that has a different

152
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:55,640
effect so what we're carrying in our mind in terms of intention does

153
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:01,080
matter can be highly beneficial okay

154
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:47,559
okay so as I said just briefly before the

155
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:53,679
sit this is a time of year when people are often reflecting on the prior year

156
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:59,880
and considering the upcoming year and often there is a

157
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:07,120
sense that we could be letting go of or doing less of certain things and maybe

158
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:13,480
also picking up or cultivating or doing more of certain things it's kind of a

159
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:20,279
natural time to reflect in that way and there's a suta from the dapada that kind

160
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:26,480
of captures these movements I'll give Gil's

161
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:35,039
translation doing no evil engaging in what's skillful and purifying one's mind

162
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:42,480
this is the teaching of the Buddhas so maybe we could say not doing what is

163
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:49,159
unskillful engaging in what's skillful and cultivating the mind um you know

164
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:54,840
this is the basic teaching that all the Buddhists have offered and I think it's

165
00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:01,639
offered in other spiritual Traditions also so these verses kind of capture what

166
00:32:01,639 --> 00:32:06,679
many meditators are trying to frame in our so-called New Year's

167
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:15,399
resolutions I hesitate to use that word a little bit it's a kind of a cultural idea that we have here about doing that

168
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:21,200
um because sometimes we can really create Dua in our relationship to these

169
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:27,320
kind of year and ritual and you know it doesn't always come out so well when we

170
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:33,240
um set some Grand goal for ourselves that's not really achievable and you

171
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:38,880
know we fall off of it within a week or two and then feel bad and somehow

172
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,000
stumble on into February so we don't want to be we don't want to be getting

173
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:51,519
caught in that cycle so we have to be wise in our actions of Letting Go and

174
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:58,399
cultivation and um we can notice also that you know that dap verse is very

175
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:03,679
general it's about just you know being careful about being unskillful and

176
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:10,279
wanting to be skillful and developing our mind so it's not really about anything special of the New Year it's

177
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:16,200
also just about how we walk the path so even if you're your mode is I don't Enga

178
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:23,440
I don't engage in any of that new year stuff that's great these uh what we'll reflect on this week will also help in

179
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:29,679
just our normal walking of the path doing the practice in our daily life so

180
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,760
this week we're going to talk about several key Dharma topics that support

181
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:42,080
or surround or provide context to these ideas of Letting Go and cultivation and

182
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:50,159
so you know maybe we'll put it'll provide some tools and perspectives that help us approach these activities in a

183
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:57,799
wise way so these are things that will help make letting go and cultivation

184
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:04,159
more effective more likely to actually go in the direction that we want um and

185
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:12,320
we'll talk about them overall five days so you could think about using these five days as a way to explore around the

186
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:18,398
different ways that you engage with letting go in cultivation in your own practice however that looks for you

187
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:23,878
whatever phase you're in of that sometimes our actions in that area are

188
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:30,240
are in the realm of relationality we're thinking about working on our uh connections with others sometimes

189
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:38,599
they're more about personal habits that we want to change sometimes we're not into the kind of external cultivation at

190
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:45,200
all and we're thinking about you know how can I structure my life so that I can go and Retreat more how can I fit in

191
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:52,398
a one month Retreat during this year all of those things are things that we need to uh engage with in terms of things

192
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:58,280
we're going to let go of things we're going to bring forth so wherever you are in your practice

193
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,440
I think these five days will be of benefit the Dharma does not care that

194
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:09,240
you have a clear exact well articulated resolution on December 31st at midnight

195
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:16,040
so relax about that and just uh just take all five days as a kind of a unit

196
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:21,240
can spread it out so maybe one thing to First

197
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:28,320
recognize about these activities of Letting Go and cultivation is that they are very intertwined

198
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:34,920
you know it's they seem like opposite movements um but they're actually highly

199
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:41,720
connected and in particular sometimes um well I want to take both sides both

200
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:47,920
sides of a uh of a proposition the first is sometimes I think we need something

201
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:54,160
in place before the heart is willing to let go things that we have cultivated or

202
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:00,200
put in place sometimes are needed to give us the strength to let go so if

203
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:07,800
you're having trouble letting go of something consider if there is something that might need to be cultivated

204
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:13,640
first okay so that's one way we can start to be wise about this I remember

205
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:19,240
that there was a time when I wanted to let go of resentment that I had toward a

206
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:26,800
certain person it was so clear that I needed to let go of that it was only harming me it was kind of continual in

207
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,240
my mind I could see that I really wanted to release this resentment I was

208
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,520
carrying and I did have a certain amount of meta for this person so I felt like I

209
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:44,480
should be able to uh to let go of that but um they kind of these thoughts kept

210
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,640
persisting and finally I discovered uh through meditation practice it kind of

211
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:56,720
came to me in an Insight that I actually needed to forgive this person um first

212
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:03,160
and when I did that once I had cultivated I deliberately turned to cultivating forgiveness instead of

213
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:08,760
cultivating meta and trying to let go once I cultivated forgiveness and that

214
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:14,079
really came through in me it was so easy to let the resentment go so I wasn't

215
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:20,920
able to let go until I had cultivated this other thing okay so that can happen

216
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:26,680
sometimes um because of the intertwining of Letting Go in cultivation it goes the

217
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:32,280
other way also so there are times where we can't cultivate something until

218
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,440
something else lets go so if you're having trouble cultivating something

219
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,640
maybe consider if you're grasping onto something that is preventing that and it

220
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:48,079
needs to be let go first if your hand is closed around something it might need to

221
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:55,960
release that before it can pick up what you're trying to cultivate so the classic example that

222
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:01,200
goes with this is people want to cultivate concentration or somat a lot

223
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:08,040
of people would like to have that on the cushion and so they sit down and they try very hard to be on the breath to

224
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:15,680
cultivate concentration they're told just be on the breath be on the breath and somehow they've forgotten

225
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:21,480
that concentration happens when we've let go of the hindrances that's actually when

226
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:27,119
concentration comes it's actually more about letting go so we're often uh

227
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,160
caught up in the hindrances and one reason that we can't release them is

228
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:38,880
that we actually we're grasping them we like the hindrances that's one of the issues with them that would be a whole

229
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:47,359
separate discussion but just as a small example there's a way often that we grasp onto aversion or unhappiness or

230
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:53,960
you know something negative in our life and we've grasped on to that we think we think it's important that we oppose that

231
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:59,119
or that we we've identified somehow with our dep depression or our unhappiness in

232
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:06,800
some way and until we release the idea that that's necessary for us to have and

233
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:13,200
to keep going back to we won't be able to be happy enough to be concentrated so

234
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:19,920
sometimes we have to let go of something and really turn toward it and figure out how to release it before we can

235
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,160
cultivate what we wanted to cultivate and that's a you know that's a

236
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:32,319
sort of a technical meditation example but um also I recently watched a

237
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:39,079
documentary um that included a story about a a woman who had been told for a

238
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:44,240
long time um that she couldn't do math you know she was kind of pushed aside

239
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:51,440
and said well you're just not a math person you know you can't really do that and she wanted to pursue a a job that

240
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:58,079
required her to take some math classes and pass those in order to to get this degree um

241
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:04,240
but she had been told her whole life that she wasn't really a math person and so she was carrying a false view that

242
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:10,160
this was just impossible for her very difficult she would have all kinds of aversion and struggle every time she had

243
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:19,000
to learn math and eventually she realized that this was just a view that she had been told um and so she worked

244
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:25,160
hard instead to release that idea about herself and she also had you know some

245
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:31,560
support from teachers who cared about her and once she released that view she discovered that she could actually do

246
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:37,319
math and she didn't want to be a mathematician but she had to pass these math classes in order to get the degree

247
00:40:37,319 --> 00:40:44,160
to get the job she wanted and she did but she had to let go of a view of

248
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:50,440
herself before she could achieve that no matter how hard she tried she couldn't

249
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:56,800
until she let go so we may find that in ourselves also is there some view

250
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:03,359
perhaps about yourself that you're holding but you can't cultivate something until you let it

251
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:08,800
go so these are very intertwined and sometimes you know we can't just choose

252
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,920
to let go of something or to cultivate something we might have to do the other one

253
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:21,440
first sometimes our personality favors uh one of these movements over the other

254
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:27,359
like it's easier for us in general to let go um and not as easy to cultivate

255
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:36,400
or it's easy for us to cultivate and go out and pursue and develop but not as easy to let go so um check that out in

256
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:42,720
your own mind and because we're going to have to learn both of these skills at some point and gain wisdom around

257
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:48,280
balancing them so

258
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:55,800
um let's also mention today the um in addition to this uh idea of how these

259
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:02,560
intertwine uh that the Dharma mentions that there are three wise or skillful

260
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:09,000
intentions in our practice uh and I want to just name them so that we can see um

261
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,520
how they relate to these ideas of Letting Go and cultivation uh one thing about the word

262
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:22,760
intention I mean of course all these words are translations um I I hope that the word intention even

263
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:30,280
though it sounds kind of future oriented um the way I think of the difference between say an intention and

264
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:36,839
a goal or resolution is that goals and resolutions are about the future they

265
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:42,559
they put a pin into the future and say that's the point I'm aiming for whereas

266
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:47,839
I feel like an intention is something that I'm putting in the present I don't

267
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:54,559
know exactly where it's going to go in the future but at the moment I'm pointing myself in a particular

268
00:42:54,559 --> 00:43:01,040
direction when I walk there I don't know quite what I'll find so it's a little bit different I think of intentions as

269
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:09,200
being in the present and goals as being in the future and so intentions are really what we have in this practice um

270
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:16,079
you know more present oriented the three wise intentions are named as number one

271
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:22,480
is renunciation we're letting go so there we go right there it's named as a wise

272
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:28,880
intention the second is a non-ill will that's how the PO is listed it's non-ill

273
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:34,839
will sometimes it's turned into Goodwill or meta something as the positive

274
00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:40,359
movement and the third is non- cruelty and sometimes that's turned into

275
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:47,520
compassion although we'll talk more about that that term later this week so we have letting go and then the

276
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:56,440
cultivation of something that's in the realm of non-harming trying not to harm in some way so we see right away that in

277
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:03,480
the three skillful intentions uh we have letting go and cultivation of certain

278
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:09,960
qualities so those will maybe frame as we go forward in the week so in addition

279
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:17,720
to the um the quote I gave at the beginning about not doing what is unskillful doing

280
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:22,960
what is skillful and cultivating or purifying the mind we can bear in mind

281
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,079
one other Su quote I want to just finish with which is that the Buddha

282
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:34,920
said it is possible to abandon what is unskillful if it were not possible to

283
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:40,240
abandon what is unskillful I would not say to you abandon what is

284
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:46,800
unskillful and on the other side it is possible to cultivate what is skillful

285
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,520
if it were not possible to cultivate what is skillful I would not say to you

286
00:44:52,520 --> 00:45:00,040
cultivate what is skillful so this is all quite doable able this is all quite doable but we do

287
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:05,440
have to understand the Dynamics of the process we have to be wise about

288
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:11,680
balancing these and doing them in the right way and at the right time so that's what we're going to get into over

289
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:18,079
the next several days of this week and I hope you'll you'll join and find some

290
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:24,839
application of it in your own life and practice so thank you
