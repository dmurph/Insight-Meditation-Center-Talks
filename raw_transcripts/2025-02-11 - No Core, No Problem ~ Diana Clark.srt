1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:08,440
welcome welcome good evening nice to see you

2
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:16,920
all so tonight I'd like to talk a little bit and in a way of just like throwing

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:25,800
some seeds out and in some way maybe the seeds will take root and germinate and Sprout into

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,359
something and maybe they won't or maybe maybe it'll take some

5
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:37,239
time maybe they have to sit in the darkness for some time or

6
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:45,000
maybe uh there has to be more rain or more sun or something like this until the seeds

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
sprout so just this idea of I'm doing this with my hand kind like just throwing out seeds and uh see if they

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,079
land and produce something partly I offer

9
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:04,680
this just as an encouragement to maybe uh to see what's being said here and

10
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,280
maybe just feel into it and if it feels like I don't know can you just hold that

11
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,400
I don't know can you just hold that and take what's helpful and just leave

12
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:21,280
behind what's not helpful and I want to start by talking

13
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:28,560
about thoughts like what are thoughts like what are they for me this

14
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,000
is like such a fascinating topic like what are they made out out of where do

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,759
they come from I think we all know there are like these mental events that kind of like

16
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:50,600
arise and pass away there there's temporary appearances that just show up on

17
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,680
occasion but it happens that they show up more often than just occasion I'm fascinated by this that U I saw that

18
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:07,079
there was a study that said that people have up to 60,000 thoughts a day I'm fascinated by

19
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,879
like is somebody going click click click one two three four five you know like how do they measure this I don't know

20
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:19,080
I'm kind of curious about this but I think actually just the act of being

21
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:25,000
curious and wanting to like count one's thoughts means that they're not lost in

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,360
them but instead they're observing them and that in itself could be really powerful

23
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,120
but so we have up to According to some scientists 60,000 thoughts a

24
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:45,159
day also to these same scientists between 90 and 95% of them

25
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:52,280
repetitive either because what they had earlier that day or maybe they're the same as what you had the previous

26
00:02:52,280 --> 00:03:00,280
day that's a lot 90 to 95% and then 80%

27
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:07,480
of all of them are have this negative tone things should be different I should

28
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:13,680
be different why are they doing it that way it should be done this way who's responsible for this I have to go fix it

29
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,840
and tell them or you know all these different ways that these negative thoughts show up I'm not good enough

30
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,680
this isn't good enough there's cold air coming out of this vent I'm not sure

31
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,200
why in the winter but you know today the microphone had a little thing and HVAC

32
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,080
system's been a little weird it's just the way it

33
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:43,959
is so we have a lot of thoughts but there's something that

34
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:49,760
they're repetitive they're arising and passing away and like what so what are

35
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,879
some of the things that are these 60,000 thoughts sometimes we are worrying about

36
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:01,360
the future how am I going to handle this or maybe there's a little bit of

37
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:08,239
planning in there oh in order this thing's going to come up and so I better be prepared for it so okay I got to

38
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:14,159
remember to uh bring this to work today and tell this person that and you know

39
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:21,120
whatever it might be are these like the certain amount of planning or big uh

40
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,639
huge uh component of thoughts is a self judgment is this idea of like I should

41
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:34,479
be doing better or I should be better or I'm inadequate or at least I'm doing better

42
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,680
than that Bozo over there or maybe there's this sense of

43
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:47,840
like well why can't I be more like this person who has X Y and Z or seems to be

44
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,240
a b and c why can't I have a physique like this person why can't I be as smart as that

45
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,919
person why can't I be as um spiritually mature as such person or whatever it

46
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:06,240
might be it's amazing how much of this kind of

47
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,680
is part of our thoughts or also maybe part of in our fantasies sometimes I

48
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,720
find myself doing this a lot like H I wonder what would be like to live here you know as I'm kind of like driving

49
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,880
through some place or I wonder what it be like to have this job you know as I'm

50
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,000
interacting with different people in different uh professions like I wonder what it's like

51
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,600
to have that job to be a bar [Laughter]

52
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,360
so there's all kinds of things you know that we think about these 60,000 thoughts that we're having a day not

53
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:50,400
only are they temporary just arising and passing away but we don't control them they just

54
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,199
arise when they arise they leave when they leave right if we could control our

55
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:03,319
thoughts you would not need a meditation practice you would just only think about certain things and be done with it not

56
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:08,479
think about other things they're uncontrollable we're not

57
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:15,039
making them arise nobody knows why they arise nobody knows why they go away they

58
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,759
just do this is the nature of thoughts is that that we don't control them this

59
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,840
is part of the human experience it's just having thoughts arise thoughts that

60
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,960
we don't want thoughts that we're trying to not think

61
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,599
arises anyway I'm sure you've noticed

62
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,280
this there's also this thing about thoughts that they don't have a core

63
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:50,000
substance to them they are like insubstantial in some kind of way they

64
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,400
they are like clouds and rainbows you know they appear when

65
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,199
there's certain an example of cloud and rainbows right there certain atmospheric

66
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:07,720
conditions are there clouds arise but clouds don't have like a something in

67
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:13,319
the center that's like this core or Essence it's just a diffuse

68
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:18,800
Cloud Rainbows are the same way right they don't there isn't one thing that you could pull out and say oh okay

69
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,080
here's the rainbow instead it's just a an

70
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:31,800
experience a process that's arising when we could say when rain and sunlight

71
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:38,400
are there so there's this way that they have

72
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:45,080
this real insubstantiality we don't control them and they're coming and

73
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:53,199
going and it turns out that so much of the building blocks of our stories our

74
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:59,520
dramas our suffering our thoughts so these things that are ins

75
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:05,599
substantial and uncontrollable are so much are kind of creating the stories we

76
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,680
have about ourselves the stories we have about what is good what is bad what is

77
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:17,879
the meaning of life what I should do with my life what I shouldn't do with my

78
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:23,199
life and there's a way in which we could consider that we spend so much of our

79
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:29,479
time going from one little mini Daydream to another

80
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:37,599
is so much of what our inner life is about it's kind like being lost in these

81
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:44,240
insubstantial mental events that are coming and going

82
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:51,080
repeatedly but there's one particular way in which we sometimes these stories

83
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,240
or these dramas these um big uh

84
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,320
sufferings difficulties in our lives which all all of us

85
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,760
have are intimately tied up with our thoughts the thoughts we have about

86
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:14,800
what's happening the thoughts we have about what it means to me as an

87
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,040
individual makes me a good person makes me a bad person makes me look good makes

88
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,560
me look bad or maybe it's just doesn't match the

89
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:33,399
idea we have about ourselves I want to be people to think think that I'm kind and when somebody is complaining about

90
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:38,480
me it just doesn't feel good and I have to

91
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,160
defend myself or support myself in some kind of way with more

92
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,720
thoughts these insubstantial incontrollable

93
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,160
things there's so

94
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:02,800
much there's so much about our sense of self that is just really tied up with a

95
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:10,600
sense of our thoughts I want to talk a little bit more about this but first I want to

96
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:16,320
say a little bit about what do I mean when I talk about this sense of a

97
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:23,839
self I mean we have this Common Sense uh model this notion of what a self is we

98
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:30,040
have like there's this core there's this Essence at the center

99
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:38,880
to which you know other things happen I talk about this you know sometimes in Dhat talks I'm pointing to

100
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:45,480
this and certainly our society and the way that we're raised in um our culture

101
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,959
really promotes this you could even say like this whole idea of a horoscope because you're born at this

102
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:59,399
particular location this particular time you'll have these qualities and that's part of your essence or your core or you

103
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:06,240
might say well we have these personality tests Myers breaks or anog or I'm I'm

104
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,920
sure there's others say no no no this really is your core your

105
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,560
essence for me I have something uh I thought back when I was a research

106
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:25,440
scientist SP in my days in a laboratory I um was thinking like oh it doesn't feel quite right for me I don't know

107
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,240
what to do with myself this is a little aside I took Myers Briggs

108
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:38,399
and the it came back that oh you might want to be a spiritual teacher I thought that's so crazy I'm never going to do

109
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,839
say anything like that for me that's just a funny thing to think

110
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:50,399
about inconstant one worldview not knowing what our future holds

111
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:57,279
right or there's also ways in which I remember also when I was a teenager I used to love to do

112
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:04,240
this there'd be magazin and there would always be like a quiz what is your learning style and then you'd Circle

113
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,480
Like A or B or C then however many A's you got means your learning style is

114
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:17,199
this or what's you know whatever whatever I was measuring so we certainly have this idea

115
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:24,639
that supports this uh notion that there is this Core Essence that we are and it

116
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:30,560
can be described with a personality test or the results from some kind of a test

117
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,600
or something like this or our

118
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:43,560
horoscope so there's this idea that this core this Essence this um way in which

119
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:50,320
we think that there's maybe this um this quality this inherent

120
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:57,839
quality that uh we have and we say that it accumulates

121
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,120
these different experiences that is maybe it has these memories maybe it has

122
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,959
uh memories and these memories are kind of like what's part of this core but

123
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:15,519
memories are thoughts in a way there's mental events

124
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:22,959
and these are insubstantial coming and going

125
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:28,760
uncontrollable we have desires it's part of uh we might say is

126
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:34,120
the experience of having a self and for example more cookies more

127
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,440
well-being but those are also thoughts which are also insubstantial we have

128
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:46,040
beliefs about the meaning of life what happens after death what it means

129
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,199
to vote one way or

130
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:58,279
another these beliefs are also thoughts they often are a little bit quieter and

131
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:05,079
maybe perhaps hidden and not obvious but those are also just

132
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:10,199
thoughts we have knowledge maybe we're trained in a specific field but those

133
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:16,040
are often just thoughts too Concepts right the knowledge is

134
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:22,320
often Concepts things that we learn and

135
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:30,639
memorize and work with and these are just thoughts too

136
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:36,360
so there actually isn't this core or this

137
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:44,040
Essence the center doesn't exist it's a model it's a common sense

138
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:50,880
model we feel like there is but so what is there if there isn't

139
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:59,240
these uh this Essence here there's a way in which there's the

140
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:06,160
components we might say of our experience is

141
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:14,440
connected they belong to one body and brain so

142
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,480
they they're not happening to somebody

143
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:27,160
else but there's a way in which we might say that the sense of self is a

144
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:32,600
narrative it's a way in which there is this sewing

145
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,959
together of different events into a

146
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:44,639
story there's a way in which we're linking things together the

147
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,920
linking is happening with our thoughts the events are just happening

148
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:56,279
the memories are just happening the sensations are just happening they're

149
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:04,079
coming and going we can't control them and then we want things to make sense

150
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:09,519
and to be neat and tidy in some kind of way so a narrative gets created oh this

151
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:15,319
happened because of that but that's a

152
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:21,199
thought thoughts are insubstantial uncontrollable coming and

153
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:32,519
going and there's a way in which we say well things are connected also means that well we do

154
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:38,759
things because of other things maybe we could say that what we desire is related

155
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:44,720
to what we believe our beliefs our

156
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,399
thoughts maybe what we desire is a certain amount of

157
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,920
well-being happiness peace

158
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,399
freedom and then well we're doing something because we have that desire

159
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:08,798
but the way that we think that we're going to achieve this well-being or Peace and

160
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:16,199
Freedom our thoughts which are insubstantial coming

161
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:19,798
and going and we can't

162
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:30,120
control so there's all these things these beliefs

163
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,200
desires experiences and they're all related to each

164
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:42,679
other and there's just a way that this connected things

165
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:51,440
are you you might say or a self we might

166
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:59,520
say so that's different than having a core or an essence

167
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:05,960
it's more like well there's just maybe this Cloud

168
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,520
here that is a

169
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,120
self and then often when we hear things like this I know this certainly was the

170
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:24,760
case for me there's a certain like puzzlement like what H and there's often

171
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:31,720
some like disbelief because like I don't really just I mean of course there's a self I mean I'm here and I'm not there

172
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:37,400
and I'm this person I'm not that person what is she talking

173
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:46,440
about so when we hear these things often we have this experience of maybe um we

174
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,600
want to dismiss it because it runs counter to our experience it runs

175
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:57,720
counter to kind of like what Society is pointing to and promoting

176
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:08,799
and so I'm just planting seeds I'm just throwing seeds out there it's perfectly fine if they don't uh sink in and

177
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,960
germinate but I'll say and probably you know this too that so much about this

178
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,760
practice is about maybe having a sense of uh

179
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:26,280
inquiry or curiosity or investigation of

180
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,640
hm I don't know

181
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:38,799
maybe investigation is a factor of Awakening and this is part of what gets

182
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:45,559
investigated like what is this sense of self the sense of

183
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:52,520
identity that we have how does it feel what is it made

184
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:58,720
out of when is it really strong when does it seem like it's not so strong

185
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,480
when does it even feel like it's completely

186
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:13,080
absent this Spirit of inquiry this Spirit of H maybe willingness to not

187
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:20,159
completely dismiss it but just uh have some openness to the

188
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:28,200
notion that there isn't this core so this isn't so much a belief to

189
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:34,679
adopt this isn't a uh Doctrine to sign up for

190
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:41,120
instead it's a invitation to investigate be curious

191
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:50,919
about be open to and maybe you know poke around and uh

192
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:58,159
and see in feel I'm using this maybe like feel into are there times when there's a

193
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:04,280
really strong sense of self and often the way that we can tell this is when

194
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:12,240
it's countered with a other me versus you US versus them when there's a real

195
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:20,120
strong sense of oh my gosh they are a problem implicit is I am not the

196
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:26,440
problem and that's when there's a strong sense of self so just get curious how does that

197
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:33,159
feel when you have this sense of of uh righteous indignation or saying somebody else is

198
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:40,679
wrong this also means that this this me I'm right dang

199
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:45,760
it and just feel how and sometimes there's a sense of energy and maybe that

200
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,799
feels nice maybe to feel like I'm in the right and everybody else is wrong maybe

201
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:56,640
that feels nice in some kind of way but wowe is that

202
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:04,520
limiting it's really Li limiting cuz really what we are is so

203
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:12,919
big and expansive and this flowing and generosity and

204
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:19,960
freedom and peace and well-being as opposed to this I'm right

205
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:26,640
and now I have to make sure that everybody else knows that I'm right and now I have to make sure that people uh

206
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,559
treat me the right way and if they're or not then I have to push away all those thoughts that make it think that looks

207
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:39,080
might look like I'm not right or that I'm not here or

208
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:48,799
something to maybe illustrate this uh idea what is it mean to be a sense a

209
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:56,120
self like to borrow this idea that I this is terrible I didn't write it

210
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:01,799
down and his name is slipping my mind right now it's a an American philosopher I

211
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:10,120
think his name is Julian bini I want to say it'll come to me in a moment probably but I um and stealing this idea

212
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:16,320
from him he gave this in a TED Talk a number of years ago I think it's I just love

213
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:24,480
this he said let's take the idea of the notion of water H2O 2 H is one o H2O

214
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,080
protons two protons and a oxygen H2O we're all familiar with this

215
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:37,120
that water is this for water we don't take this word

216
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:44,080
water this concept this idea this thought of water make it be the essence

217
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,320
make it be the core and then we don't like stick a h here an H over here and

218
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:57,400
an oxygen an O over here and say oh okay water is H2O doesn't we don't have

219
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:04,039
like this thing water in the center that then has an h and an h and a o no of

220
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:10,039
course not it's a collection of two h's and an

221
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:16,720
O and then later we kind of like put a lay a label on top of it but it doesn't

222
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,080
need that label these two h's and an O H2O perfectly fine doing whatever it is

223
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,399
that they're doing without this label getting put on top of it it's just this

224
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:36,158
collection of atoms that are in a particular formation that we call

225
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:44,278
water or the same for way the

226
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:52,159
microphone microphones have a diaphragm in them that uh vibrate in some kind of

227
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:57,799
way and they have magnet and coils and wires and I don't know all the things

228
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:04,120
that are in mic mhone somebody does though and so a microphone is just a

229
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:11,480
collection of all these little bits of wires and coils and microphones and diaphragms and stuff like

230
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:17,480
this and when all these bits are collected in a particular way associated

231
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:24,840
in a particular way we call it a microphone but it doesn't need that name microphone it's just this collection of

232
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:33,398
things that happens to function in a particular way it it'd be perfectly fine without the

233
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:43,919
label so these are collections of

234
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:50,720
bits for a microphone that's a diaphragm and a magnet and

235
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,919
stuff for water it's protons and oxygen and then we later we put a label

236
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:03,799
on top of it but that label is extra sense of self is the same

237
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:10,919
thing it's a collection of we might say mental events

238
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:16,039
experiences that are just happily doing whatever they're doing and then we put a

239
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:23,760
label of self on top and we might say

240
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:30,159
well but it's is it real [Laughter]

241
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,799
is it not

242
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:43,440
real it's this microphone is real we're not saying it's not real

243
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:49,559
we're not saying that it's doesn't

244
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,559
exist and the self isn't different than anything else in the universe and I mean

245
00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:02,799
like neuros science shows us that there isn't a portion of the brain like okay

246
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:10,200
there's the self right there and then psychology they often aren't talking about this I'm not a

247
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:17,240
neuroscientist nor a psychologist but so this is my understanding they're not pointing to

248
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:25,279
yeah there's all these psychological patterns or there all these uh neurochemical or reactions and then

249
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:33,559
here's the self that's you know right here and has these particular uni things they're not saying that at

250
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:40,600
all so this doesn't mean that we don't exist that would be

251
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:48,000
silly to say that that we don't exist instead we're just saying that

252
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,880
there isn't this nucleus this core at the center instead it's a collection

253
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:01,320
it's a process it's the cloud it's not clearly defined doesn't have

254
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:08,840
like clear edges in the way that we think it does and there's this way

255
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:17,399
that acknowledging this or being tuned into this allows for some growth and some

256
00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:25,159
change allows for some sense of Freedom allows for some liquidity maybe

257
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:30,799
in the way that we think about ourselves or the way that we think about the

258
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,559
world that can really support

259
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,279
freedom and we could even say that this whole entire practice this mindfulness

260
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:47,440
practice the Insight practice concentration practice loving kindness

261
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:53,440
practice listening to Dharma talks reading Dharma books all of this we

262
00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:02,360
could say all of it is point to this that our

263
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:07,679
identity is not necessarily what we think it

264
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:15,880
is and that greater Freedom goes with the um the more

265
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:21,080
uh um ease we have with this sense of

266
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:27,720
identity this sense of self that we have and we could say like Awakening

267
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:33,399
Liber a these types of things I'm move I'm doing this with my hands CU this like imagining that maybe like it's a

268
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:39,200
road that goes over here it's not quite like that but often how it gets

269
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,080
conveyed we could say it's just this shifting shifting of this

270
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:51,640
identity so it's not that we have to get rid of our s it's not that we have to

271
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,679
transmute our self into some beautiful thing it's not that we have to transcend

272
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:02,080
of self and there's spiritual teachings that point this way but this tradition

273
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:09,200
is just to notice yeah it's just not there the way that you thought it

274
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:16,360
was that's all that's all you have to do and there's this wave this

275
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:21,559
recognition often if it's been again and again and seen in a particular way this

276
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:28,200
is not something intellectual it's not something that you'll get having just hearing a dma talk

277
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:35,519
but it's a an experience then that's what brings

278
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:43,000
greater and greater Freedom this recognition like oh this

279
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,720
uh there's this letting go that can happen of this sense of I need to be

280
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:54,840
this way and the world needs to be that way

281
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:09,039
so one way that we can practice with this a I mean it's often on meditation

282
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:14,399
Retreats when the mind is a little bit more quiet that we start to notice all

283
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:19,480
the ways in which we're creating ourself in which we're some ways thinking

284
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,760
ourself into being I don't want to make this be wrong

285
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:32,919
I don't want to make this be a big gi problem this is what most humans are doing but here's just an opportunity to

286
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:38,200
think like H maybe there's another way these are things that we're just

287
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:44,919
assuming the thought or like the thoughts about the self we're just assuming there's a self there and

288
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:51,960
viewing the world viewing our experiences through that framework it turns out that that's extra

289
00:31:51,960 --> 00:32:00,039
this framework is extra and one way we could work with this is just to

290
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:07,440
notice thoughts just notice your

291
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,960
thoughts often not so easy because we're lost in them but if you can even just

292
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,720
for like you know two minutes at a time and say okay I'm going to count

293
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,279
maybe one minute maybe 30 seconds just count like okay how many thoughts and

294
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:31,679
then you'll have like oh wait was that a thought oh that's a thought that that's thought okay then you know just but the

295
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:38,159
fact of just observing them and then it becomes easier and

296
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:44,159
easier to observe them and then we start to see their insubstantiality and uncontrollability

297
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:51,320
and then just seeing this again and again we start to see how oh they are

298
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:56,600
making this self they're creating this

299
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:03,360
self that's one way in which we might uh work with this work with this notion

300
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,880
that uh notion that we have that there's this

301
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:16,120
core this Essence when in fact it's just a collection of

302
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:22,039
experiences and often what's stitching them together are

303
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:27,120
thoughts which of course are insubstantial how many times have I said

304
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:34,519
that today this is my new favorite word so maybe I'll end there but maybe

305
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:40,919
before I end I'll say there's a lot that we could say about not self this is just

306
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:47,000
you know I just took one Road in there's so many different things we can say I am

307
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:54,519
not expecting that having heard this you'll be totally convinced

308
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,919
um and I know that the first first time I heard this teaching I kind of got

309
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:09,200
mad what are they talking about I I thought this Buddhism thing was going to be good but what is this I don't know I

310
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:14,919
just I found myself irritated and

311
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:20,079
and that's okay irritation is okay too

312
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:26,440
so I just want to offer that um take what's helpful and leave behind what's

313
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:32,040
not helpful and now maybe I'll open it up to see if

314
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:36,440
there's some questions or comments thank

315
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:49,158
you so there I mean like in to BM especially

316
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:57,839
there's a lot of talk about reincarnation so if there is no self what reincarnates I know right this

317
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:04,280
such a great question I have no idea

318
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:12,280
yeah because it almost seems to contradict yourself right you know like they talk about the five Aggregates and

319
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:18,760
then there's no self then okay it's very peaceful when you very still but then

320
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:25,240
what reincarnates I don't know if it's helpful I'll say in this tradition we

321
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:33,040
don't use this word reincarnation didn't we use rebirth with more the idea that uh what

322
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:39,920
gets reborn if such a thing exists it's impossible for me to know that uh it

323
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,720
would be like the momentum of some of the mental patterns that we've had or

324
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:51,319
habits or something like this the the momentum maybe but that that this is

325
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:56,079
what I can offer yeah

326
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:10,640
um had kind of a a comment but then also just to uh touch on um question you just

327
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:16,160
or or the comment you just brought up um because big part of why I started coming as well was trying to unpack this

328
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:22,240
concept of nonself and one thing I was able to gather from a talk and perhaps you know

329
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:28,800
feel free to correct me but there was a talk um uh on this about year ago Spirit

330
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:35,560
Rock and it was on the concept of no self and the thing that I gathered was that it turns out to just be a really

331
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:40,640
awkward translation um turns out in the Buddha

332
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,040
was saying was not that there is no self he wasn't metaphysically proving that oh

333
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:54,079
we don't exist and there is no actual self uh not that but the actual like suta and the teaching is that think look

334
00:36:54,079 --> 00:37:00,800
at your thoughts observe your um your physical habits the Aggregates do you

335
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,880
control any of them and if you don't control them there is no self there so

336
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:12,359
the idea of self is tied up a lot with the control is what I had gathered and that's merely what the Buddha was saying

337
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:18,480
and so to meditate on non-self is to realize like we just have like a modum

338
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:25,800
of control versus a self that can control you know our thoughts and all these other things so that was actually very

339
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:31,800
helpful and it was like um but it also pays to like read more and go to these these talks that that

340
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:38,800
really clarified it for me though it was just tough translation great great thank you that's

341
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,520
right that at the time of the Buddha there was other spiritual teachers and they were saying oh no there's a self

342
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:52,560
and here are the characteristics of it and one of the characteristics was is that you could control it so thank you yeah and he say no no no

343
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:57,800
we don't control try it and it turns out you can't yeah uh and then just to

344
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:03,800
comment on I really appreciated the talk tonight and um one thing that I I think

345
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:11,319
is a barrier it's tough when we hear things like this is just linguistically you know we grow up and for me it's like

346
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:17,000
we there are nouns and there's verbs right to keep it very simple and nouns

347
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:24,000
are are everywhere in fact Concepts become nouns and we're like this is yeah is this and so one exercise I try to do

348
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:31,240
and it feels just impossible I occasionally try and do it is take something that comes to us as a noun but turn it

349
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:39,319
into verbs yeah like this is verbing or this chair it's actually a bunch of verbs it's chairing it's chairing yeah

350
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:46,400
what are the atoms inside or whatever we want to describe um or some you know ideological ISM that we we say is

351
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:53,319
happening like it's actually just this thing that's verbing U I found that to be helpful but it's really tough to

352
00:38:53,319 --> 00:39:00,880
break I feel like every time I hear this concept that what's the essence it's uh

353
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:06,760
Linguistics is a huge barrier to it yeah very nice thank you I heard uh lee braon

354
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,520
want to say there are no nouns they're just slow

355
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:17,480
verbs it's kind of a playful way to think about this just slow

356
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,240
verbs so I was remembering about 30 years ago um the do Lama came to

357
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:37,560
Shoreline Amphitheater I don't know if anyone else was there but he gave a 4-day talk on and I wrote it down the

358
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:43,200
concept of self is empty of objective reality and I understood the first five

359
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:51,760
minutes of the four days um yeah I wasn't I wasn't ready for that but what

360
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:58,440
you were describing was something I kind of stumbled on to about 5 minutes into tonight's sit

361
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:06,000
which was that what I do about thoughts when I'm meditating is I energize them I

362
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,800
think it's when I do that that I turn them into

363
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:17,280
self and there's a sensation when I'm energizing them and if I'm paying

364
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:24,040
attention it's not pleasant so I have a motive for not doing that anymore and then sometimes I'm you know supposed to

365
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:30,400
be meditating so I shouldn't have thought so instead of pushing them I'm trying to stop them and that's

366
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,880
unpleasant in a different way uh and what I was trying tonight was just stuff would arise and it's not like

367
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:42,359
that's the intermission between the good meditating um that's doing it right and

368
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:49,000
I would just greet these thoughts with love and would be like sit next to them in the sun on a park bench and hear what

369
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,400
they have to say and then and then they go away and it was um it was quite

370
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,440
lovely thank you can you say a little bit what you mean when you say

371
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:06,760
energizing the thoughts yeah so the thought is telling me this and then this and then he said

372
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:13,920
that um and it's like there's this other part of me that's going for sure for sure and then actually this other thing

373
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:20,680
yeah and it's as if I I get involved with it yeah yeah getting involved I

374
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:25,760
kind of like the word get tangled up in them somehow yeah yeah great thank you

375
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,079
thank you Phil

376
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:47,078
anybody else have a comment or something they'd like to say I have I back

377
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:56,440
here I'm super new here so I don't know much about the Traditions um but I was wondering what

378
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:03,000
your thoughts are on prayers as

379
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:09,319
thoughts can you say a little bit more prayers is thoughts um because it's not

380
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:16,040
about yourself it's about um can you hold the microphone

381
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:21,440
just a little bit closer thank you yeah I mean it's not necessarily a replay of

382
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:27,839
what's happened to you um it's not commentary necessarily about you

383
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:34,400
but it is about what you would like or what your intention

384
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:41,200
is so I know very little about prayers but I This Is My

385
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:48,640
Idea um is that praying is

386
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:55,640
um there's still mental events and it's about

387
00:42:55,640 --> 00:43:01,440
uh like a wish for something or an intention for something is that true

388
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:09,839
would you say yeah I mean I would have called it an intention yeah yeah so in some ways it is related to yourself in

389
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:15,680
that it's like an intention that I wish for world peace for example or I wish

390
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:26,119
you know for everybody to have enough food whatever it might be that uh it's um related um wait so your question is

391
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:31,520
about the relationship between prayers and thoughts or prayers and well when

392
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:40,000
you talked a a lot about um thoughts they seem to be very

393
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:48,920
inwardly directed or about your self or about how you relate to the

394
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:56,920
world but sometimes your thoughts are not about yourself yeah that's true the majority

395
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:02,240
of them are self-referential and I don't know what happens in people's prayers so maybe

396
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:08,800
they're not self-referential there I imagine many of them are though that you know I am

397
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:16,200
praying for something in particular and there's this fact that I want this so that X Y and Z and the so that part is

398
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:22,079
often uh related to somebody's wishes and desires

399
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:29,319
um so there are thoughts of like okay so um um the pasta is going to be done in

400
00:44:29,319 --> 00:44:36,200
two minutes so maybe I should put the sauce in now so that it's done at the same time as the pasta right has nothing

401
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:42,280
to do with actually you know ourself and that's just um thoughts that are just

402
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:48,760
arising and passing away and solving the present moment what's arising or what's being

403
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:55,839
experienced at that moment so those aren't self-referential and

404
00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:03,119
they're not a problem is this helpful at all what I'm saying here I'm I'm getting a

405
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:09,680
little lost

406
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:17,640
um it's just that you know when you talked about thoughts it was like these are not yourself right and I kept

407
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:23,720
thinking well of course those are not myself because that's not I wasn't thinking like myself had nothing to do

408
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:31,760
with those thoughts does that make sense like I have a friend with

409
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:37,800
cancer and I hope she heals and I hope her

410
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:44,359
treatments work yes and I pray for her health but that has nothing to do with

411
00:45:44,359 --> 00:45:50,720
me or how I would relate it to me so this is what I mean

412
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:58,318
by thoughts that don't have to do with self at all

413
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:08,359
are you sure yeah I feel pretty confident about

414
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:17,720
that then [Music] um yeah so I'm trying to feel into the

415
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:23,440
best way um to talk about

416
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:28,640
this there's a way in which

417
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:37,280
maybe I'll just use this uh language in which we get uh Tangled Up no is that

418
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,720
that's not the right word

419
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:54,240
um who is it or what is it that's wishing for your friend to heal

420
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:04,599
what what what what is what is it who is it what is that experience of wishing

421
00:47:04,599 --> 00:47:10,318
your friend to heal that's maybe the

422
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:28,079
question and this doesn't have a easy answer this is uh sometimes a question

423
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:33,760
that people work with for a long time because they come up with one thing and

424
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:41,359
they go oh wait no that's not quite it but it's it can be interesting to just explore well what is it

425
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:47,800
exactly and it's helpful to say this word what what is what is this what is this

426
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:54,559
wishing for my friend to heal beautiful wish

427
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:04,240
what what is a wish what is a prayer is that the question

428
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:11,160
or like what's what's where is it originating from where is it what what is it coming out

429
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:18,280
of and you would say not the self no this is something to

430
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:27,280
investigate what is is there uh what's inside here that FS that's fuel

431
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:32,040
that that's giving rise to this

432
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:41,800
wish it's not an easy answer it's not something that you're going to find this moment or if you do you might but then

433
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:47,960
you can just say am might continue to work with it or something like this Love

434
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:54,119
Like Love there you go love is nice

435
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:03,240
is love

436
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:12,280
self what is love combination of stuff it's a combin

437
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:21,359
yeah it's a little bits of stuff I guess yeah yeah that we call love

438
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:28,960
