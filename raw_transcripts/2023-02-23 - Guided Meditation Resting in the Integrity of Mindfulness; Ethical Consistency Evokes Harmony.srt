I just love seeing all the greetings

9
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,400
sorry about the echo there it is an imperfect process using

10
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:32,540
technology to connect with the rest of the world but gosh it has some beautiful beautiful qualities to it doesn't it

00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:41,040
so I'm just waiting to hear if the sound is okay so when you get a chance please

12
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,900
um give me a sound check to make sure it's no longer looping or distorted on your end

13
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,720
foreign

14
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,560

15
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,280

great wonderful so the invitation is to

17
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:23,640
um I don't know how it feels to be helpful giving feedback with this found

18
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,819
and notice how it feels to be in Connection in connection with this

19
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:34,200
far-flung virtual Sangha that this community is built

20
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,459
over these past years

21
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:48,140
and then drinking that in Gathering it up

22
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:55,760
and when you're ready bringing it into your heart and softening your eyes

23
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,840
perhaps closing them

24
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,920
doing whatever works for you to settle in settle into meditation

25
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:19,099
perhaps one or two slightly longer slower breaths

26
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,140
allowing your belly to relax

27
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:36,720
really allowing the exhale to release let go

28
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,120
any excess tension

29
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,340
anything extra took to get here

30
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:56,060
maybe like me you had to play with the technology to get it to work right

31
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:04,980
just relaxing noticing noticing your surroundings

32
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,980
perhaps distant sounds outside your window

33
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:16,079
or the soft hum within your home

34
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,979
or room

35
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:32,040
noticing the immersion the immersion of your body

36
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,139
your heart your mind in the moment

37
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:47,100
contact of your feet against whatever they're resting on

38
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,620
grounding if you're setting the contact of your

39
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,380
hip points and buttocks in the chair or cushion

40
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,639
the contact of your skin on call

41
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:16,040
air perhaps your hands or some other part of you is touching

42
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,340
noticing how that feels on the outside of your skin

43
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,580
and then noticing how it feels to be present inside

44
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,979
all the ways we know we're alive

45
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,259
foreign

46
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,800
and perhaps noticing the Integrity of your skin

47
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:26,000
and the strength of your spine and your bones

48
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,960
they hold this body upright

49
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,520
allowing your muscles to relax around the bones

50
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,639
allowing your belly and your chest to soften

51
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:58,860
in your life's breath to move unimpeded

52
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,758
in and out

53
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:20,600
that we settle in noticing too

54
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:27,440
quality the inner posture the mind the heart

55
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,500
and setting the intention of kind

56
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:49,160
generous awareness to be kind generous discerning

57
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:55,259
with whatever arises even if your thoughts are a bit of an

58
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:58,520
echo chamber this morning

59
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,280
are you okay it's okay

60
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13,580
to step back and rest

61
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:20,180
rest in present moment experience of breathing

62
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,259
body or sound

63
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:38,779
even resting in the present moment flow of awareness

64
00:09:51,420 --> 00:10:00,680
you notice your mind has wandered seeing how kindly and generously

65
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:08,519
can greet the re-emergents of awareness the integrity

66
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,480
of mindfulness

67
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:28,760
in the last moments of this meditation

68
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:34,139
the invitation is

69
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:42,299
gather up notice any little moment

70
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:45,740
or a long stretching

71
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:56,279
pleasure or positive quality any little glimmer thrust

72
00:29:56,279 --> 00:30:02,700
peace mindfulness concentration

73
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,980
kindness generosity many other gather it up

74
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:18,679
and soak in it be nourished by it

75
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:33,919
appreciating this practice we've done together

76
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:46,220
and then casting your internal gaze gaze of your heart outwards in your life

77
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:51,860
Wherever You Are whoever you encounter

78
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:58,740
and if it feels right generating the aspiration that they too

79
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:04,820
May benefit from the fruits of your practice

80
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:26,779
be others in our lives be happy safe peaceful and free

81
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:36,559
and may our practice our actions in some small way help support that

82
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:56,450
thank you [Laughter]

83
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:25,200
thank you for the sincerity of your practice [Music]

84
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:34,200
oh good morning good morning Sangha light to be with you

85
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,360
and a special welcome to those who tiptoed in a little bit late into the

86
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:47,519
live stream room today I'm going to continue the theme of

87
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:54,179
this week which is qualities of mind and heart conducive to inner and outer

88
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:59,299
Harmony we've covered so far this week

89
00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:05,340
mindfulness and um wisdom kind of applied to benefiting

90
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:10,500
ourselves others ourselves and others in the broader

91
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:18,480
world we covered that on Monday and then on Tuesday we covered

92
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:25,200
how the cultivation Retreat of kind kindness good will

93
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,898
can be a huge support for our progress in maturation of

94
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:36,419
meditation and spiritual practice and in our relationships

95
00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:41,820
and then yesterday we covered the quality of sharing or generosity

96
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:47,460
and how that too is a profound support in the path and in daily life in our

97
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:56,300
relationships in today's topic is the value of consistently showing up

98
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:03,780
consistently showing up with persistence ethically with ourselves internally and with

99
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:11,460
others externally it's walking our talk and again this is one of a number of

100
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:16,980
principles qualities the Buddha taught in the Sarah Nia dhamma often translated

101
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:24,300
as the principles of cordiality like so many things the Buddha taught

102
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:29,880
cultivation Inward and cultivation outward

103
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,380
both are beneficial

104
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:41,460
this principle in particular this way of being consistency of showing up

105
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:48,420
is something that the Buddha says creates love and respect showing up ethically creates love and

106
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:55,619
respect both internally and externally and there are a wide range of the

107
00:35:55,619 --> 00:36:02,339
ethical virtues that the Buddha talks about in the ancient teachings far too wide to cover in one little

108
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:08,400
15-minute talk many of you are familiar with the basics for those of us who are not boarding

109
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,920
gymnastics the five precepts they were covered in detail a few weeks ago in the

110
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,560
7 A.M talks in brief just to recap they include not

111
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:26,160
killing not stealing abstaining from sexual misconduct

112
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,099
and not lying or engaging in harsh or divisive speech

113
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:38,520
and finally not engaging in heedless Behavior due to intoxication

114
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:44,300
so we could list many many more including this week's

115
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:50,700
practicing with wisdom keeping our own benefit and the benefit of others in mind kindness

116
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:57,300
sharing and generosity so my invitation is for you to call to

117
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:04,500
mind reflect in your heart on what you consider virtuous is there anything you'd like to add

118
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:10,460
list just reflect on it firmly

119
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:20,339
hmm regardless regardless of how we Define

120
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:28,079
them expressing virtue consistently with persistence is key it builds beneficial

121
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:34,560
habits internally and externally and it builds a momentum a momentum in relationship and a

122
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:42,300
momentum in practice so that quality of persistence consistency itself is a kind of virtue

123
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:50,940
or can be if wisely applied showing up over and over is the

124
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:57,920
fundamental prerequisite for gaining skill in anything really

125
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:04,619
including meditative and spiritual progress right it's just like going to the gym and

126
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:10,619
working out if I go lift weights or if I go running once a year

127
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:16,440
I'm not going to be a very big difference but every other day three times a week

128
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:22,980
every morning something begins to shift to change

129
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:29,040
even within a meditative session as Matthew pointed out last week beginning

130
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,500
again starting over returning consistently

131
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,720
that's a profoundly helpful action

132
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:46,859
another way that this kind of quality is really helpful

133
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:54,180
and this is a completely classic practice is to internally silently reflect on and value

134
00:38:54,180 --> 00:39:01,760
your own good qualities your own virtues any and all of them

135
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:10,200
it's considered to be kind of a preparatory practice especially for practicing meta or Good Will meditation

136
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:17,280
and virtuous behavior in general is associated with progress on the path

137
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:28,520
in fact it's one of the key factors associated with Readiness for awakening as well as expression of Awakening

138
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:36,320
this comes from a discourse entitled the practice for a trainee

139
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:44,460
the Buddha is quoted as saying and I'm paraphrasing here for Simplicity

140
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:50,040
just as a hen has eggs she covered incubated rightly

141
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:56,040
even though she might not wish or intend for her chicks to break out through the eggshells

142
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:03,180
still it's likely that the eggs will hatch in the same way when a practitioner is

143
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:09,480
consonant consistent in virtue and develops meditative skill and

144
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:15,780
concentration they too they will break through to Freedom

145
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,859
to Awakening

146
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:26,460
one of the ways this works is by building confidence and Trust in the

147
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:31,700
practice and in our own hearts and Minds

148
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:37,800
and it's also true and this again this is probably obvious

149
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:43,560
but it's worth saying out loud consistently and persistently showing up

150
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:51,859
with others ethically also increases our own confidence and that of others even more

151
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:59,520
Robert Anton Wilson writes the conduct of Our Lives is the only proof of the sincerity of

152
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:07,700
our hearts the conduct of Our Lives is the only proof of the sincerity of

153
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:15,900
so this persistent kindness aren't you generosity is specially under pressure

154
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:23,280
it's a repeated theme throughout the Buddhist teachings and the teaching Stories the myths the fables that

155
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,920
evolved later so it's not just when things are easy

156
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:36,060
but rather when things are tough times are tough that's when our strength shows

157
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:41,220
when things aren't going well showing up with consistency virtue

158
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:48,800
kindness it can really build an unshakable confidence with others

159
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:58,020
if others also value Integrity ethical Behavior it can also build a really deep

160
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:05,280
appreciation and reciprocation deep bonds I've seen this in my own work

161
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:12,359
when one of us experiences a really difficult time in the hospital

162
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:18,480
the way we show up and the way others show up with us help cement these

163
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,119
beautiful beautiful bonds of trust

164
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:34,380
the Buddha is um quoted in the numerical discourses saying I think it's a verse in poly but

165
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:40,740
in English the rhyming doesn't come through generosity kind words

166
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:48,300
beneficial help and consistency in the face of events in line with what's appropriate in each

167
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:53,940
case in each case these bonds of Fellowship function in

168
00:42:53,940 --> 00:43:00,500
the world like the linchpin of a moving cart

169
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:08,460
the linchpad a linchpin that holds our friendships

170
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:14,540
our bonds our communities together

171
00:43:14,819 --> 00:43:23,040
I recently heard a psychologist a research psychologist I believe Dr Marissa Franco say when we are around

172
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:28,140
other people they're kind of like an advertisement for ways we can show up in

173
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:34,079
the world and it's true perhaps even more to the point for

174
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:41,040
practitioners or spiritual aspirants is this

175
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:46,880
that when we are around other people we are a kind of advertisement

176
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,079
Exemplar for ways others can show up in the world

177
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:59,579
people notice our Behavior more than we think and pick up on it

178
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:06,599
just like emotions are contagious virtue is contagious too

179
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:12,720
or to put it another way we teach other people how to be with us and how to Simply Be

180
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:19,760
in the way we act in our attitudes our frame of mind

181
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:26,280
so to bring together these internal and external benefits

182
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:32,579
to Harmony of showing up with ethical consistency just a brief anecdote and this is from

183
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:37,680
ancient Buddhist Legend kind of an introduction to the Legends

184
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:43,560
called the jatica tales and the myth says that the Buddha to be

185
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:48,839
the Buddha that we always talk about shakyamuni Buddha many Millennia ago

186
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:54,599
encountered the Buddha of that time and he was so inspired that he decided

187
00:44:54,599 --> 00:45:01,619
that he was going to practice not just to Awakening but to full buddhahood

188
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:06,839
the ancient Buddha saw this in him and gave him one piece of advice

189
00:45:06,839 --> 00:45:13,380
to hold to Virtue to hold the truthfulness and move consistently through the world

190
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:19,640
it said the way that the star of Venus moves through the sky

191
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:26,339
to move through the world the way the star of Venus moves through the sky

192
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:31,980
I really like this little anecdote it points to the combination of aspiration

193
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:39,540
persistence consistency of a kind of dieting constellation as a way of moving through

194
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:47,000
life moving through our worlds

195
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:55,200
and as a Venus has a connotation for us the underpinning of that at some level

196
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:02,700
It's a Kind of Love so tomorrow if you wish to

197
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:09,060

198
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:15,300
might the qualities of consistency persistence and whatever

199
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:21,960
virtues kind of behaviors that you feel drawn to

200
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:28,800
how do they benefit you how do they benefit your practice how do they impact the others around you
