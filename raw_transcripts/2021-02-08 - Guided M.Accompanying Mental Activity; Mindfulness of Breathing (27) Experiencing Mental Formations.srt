1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,280
so good day everyone

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,840
and welcome to our meditation time together and beginning of the week

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,119
and as a very brief overview of this practice of mindfulness of breathing

4
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,640
it begins with a training in attention and in a sense attention or

5
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,239
awareness sits at the middle of this practice

6
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:48,320
and that establishing this attention this mindfulness then in helping establish it more

7
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,360
consistently more thoroughly more fully

8
00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:00,320
that awareness is centered on breathing breathing stays at the center attention

9
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:07,200
and breathing attention on breathing stays at the center and as the capacity to stay more in the

10
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,840
present moment more continuously with the breathing then either

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,520
intentionally or as a byproduct of that settling of attention

12
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:27,200
the attention begins to expand and open up to include more and it includes then the body

13
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,320
and the feelings of the body and eventually the mind and there's a kind of a natural order to

14
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:41,040
it that kind of moves outwards all along we're staying with the breathing we're

15
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,640
keeping breathing at the center it's like having a a home base or having

16
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,880
a secure place from which to be free to not get wrapped up in things

17
00:01:52,880 --> 00:02:00,000
cotton things and to stay with the natural rhythm of breathing where we have to let go constantly and

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,439
and accept the new in-breath and let go of the old breath we're learning to kind of keep

19
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:13,520
the mind the heart relax soft free as we begin to open up into areas

20
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:20,000
of our life that might be more difficult and we're more likely to get caught in and entangled in

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,959
so the continuity of saying with the breath is a way of having an effective attention to the

22
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:33,040
rest of our minds and the rest of our being attention to the body being centered in

23
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,120
the body makes it easier to be attention attentive to the mind and so forth

24
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:46,080
and so with this week we'll begin with uh moving into more more closely into

25
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,800
aspects of the mind and um so to begin

26
00:02:52,959 --> 00:03:03,120
to uh establish oneself in your place of meditation

27
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:10,720
really take a few moments to really feel maybe sway back and forth rock a little bit

28
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,080
to really feel the contact where your body is supported

29
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,480
from the pull of gravity and to be in that contact in a way that feels

30
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,920
supportive and solid

31
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,799
and then to gently close the eyes

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,159
and because attention and intention can be closely related

33
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:52,560
it's helpful at the very beginning to do some intentional breathing just for a little bit not the whole time

34
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,879
not really loud or anything but just a way of beginning to orient oneself to the breathing and

35
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:06,319
beginning to let go of other things so very gently maybe

36
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:13,360
let yourself breathe more deeply maybe three quarters full

37
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:20,239
they don't know how to fill your lungs entirely two-thirds full three-quarters full

38
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:26,800
whatever feels kind of easy for you to do but to take a fuller breath than usual but

39
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,600
not too much and then as you exhale

40
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:42,000
exhale slowly not too slowly but just exhale slowly so

41
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:57,840
the exhale is longer than the inhale

42
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:14,320
and as you inhale a little more deeply fully let the attention let that filling of

43
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,320
the lungs also be kind of a feeling of attention

44
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,840
in different places of your body where there is tension

45
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:34,160
in the long slower exhale let that be a draining of that tension

46
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,560
so letting your attention roam around your body as you breathe in

47
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:48,638
filling awareness into places of tension or holding

48
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,840
and relaxing as long exhale

49
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,680
especially can be useful to soften the

50
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,840
shoulders

51
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:18,479
and the belly so the belly hangs out tanks forward a

52
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:35,840
little bit forward and maybe down

53
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,160
and also as you exhale

54
00:06:50,160 --> 00:07:03,840
maybe there can be a global relaxation of the whole body

55
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:27,440
and then continuing with taking an in-breath which is maybe a little bit

56
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,840
more full than usual doesn't have to be two-thirds full or

57
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,840
three-quarters full just a little bit more and with an exhale that's a little bit

58
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:46,960
more intentionally slow and long just a little bit

59
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:58,400
and then begin to count your exhales up to 10.

60
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,599
and as you count one two the difference for each one number for

61
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,879
each exhale

62
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:14,000
maybe you can say that number in the way that you would delightfully

63
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,160
and happily say the word yes to something

64
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:28,479
that tone of voice softly quietly but kind of an uplifting

65
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:36,159
happy intonation of one one

66
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,320
two and if you lose count no worry just

67
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,560
start over again at one and doing this counting is a way of

68
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,440
beginning to settle the attention down into the experience of breathing

69
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,959
and the counting is a way of giving the thinking mind something to think

70
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,000
so the rest of your thinking can become quieter

71
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:23,839
can fall away

72
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:15,680
and then if you'd like you continue with the counting but let the breathing be now really

73
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:22,560
natural or you can let go of the counting

74
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:31,920
and as you breathe feel the whole body as you breathe

75
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:38,480
in whatever way the global experience of body is easy to experience

76
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:45,920
it doesn't literally have to be all of it just as globally as is available

77
00:13:47,600 --> 00:14:03,839
maybe as if breathing is a massage that moves through this global body

78
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:23,520
and as you experience the global body become aware also of any

79
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,880
thing that's pleasant or enjoyable

80
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:37,120
that comes from doing the meditation and it could be very mild

81
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:43,200
sometimes in meditation there's nothing but if there is

82
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,559
breathe with that include that in the breathing

83
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,600
the breathing that moves through the global body

84
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,840
breathe with the pleasure the enjoyment

85
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:32,400
feeling a present moment well-being that encourages the mind to become quieter

86
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,880
thinking less and more able to experience

87
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,840
what's happening here and now in the body

88
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:52,000
breathing breathing with the contentment of the

89
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,840
body the calmness

90
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:52,240
and then as you're breathing now on this basis of being rooted in your

91
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:58,080
body maybe feeling some well-being

92
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:08,480
also now become aware of the sensations associated with

93
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:14,400
the mind with the activities of the mind

94
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:22,320
in particular with thinking so there might be some sensations of

95
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:30,000
tension or pressure contraction

96
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:41,039
maybe an ache or maybe it's agitation or excitement

97
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:55,120
or maybe the mental activities is characterized by some emotion or mood

98
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:03,200
whatever sensations characterizes the mind

99
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:11,200
how the mind is active and involved let it completely be that way

100
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:20,400
no need to make it any different but let that be known

101
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:28,000
as you breathe with it stay rooted in your breathing

102
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:36,159
and in a simple easy way know the sensations connected to the

103
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,039
thinking mind

104
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:59,840
breathing through those sensations

105
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:55,360
staying rooted in your breathing breathing with the sensations

106
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:02,159
of body and mind being unconcerned with the details of

107
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:07,840
what you're thinking or what you're feeling any concern with the

108
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:13,600
why just for these simple minutes

109
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:20,559
breathe with the sensations the physical sensations of thinking and

110
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:26,880
feeling and emoting as if those sensations have complete

111
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:47,840
permission to be there and you just breathe with it

112
00:26:52,559 --> 00:27:00,960
instead of thinking about or fixing anything with

113
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:13,120
mindfulness or breathing is just to breathe with what's here with a kind of intimacy or closeness

114
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,919
a calm careful willingness to just breathe with what is

115
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:25,600
here trusting that that's enough

116
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:32,840
for these few minutes just breathing with the sensations of body sensations of

117
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
mind

118
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:57,279
and then as we come to the end of the sitting and turn our attention

119
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:02,799
to the world outside of us ourselves

120
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,640
one of the profound things we can do for others

121
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:16,159
is to accompany them and if we learn to accompany ourselves

122
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:22,480
just breathing with our experience allowing our experience so whatever it

123
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,600
might be to be there

124
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:35,360
to unfold itself the way it wants to unfold but just accompany it

125
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:42,799
maybe it also teaches us how to accompany others without getting tense

126
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,840
or activated

127
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:55,760
to be able to offer a kind supportive presence

128
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:02,000
that allows others to relax cause others to be themselves

129
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:14,000
it allows others to be more attuned to themselves

130
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:23,840
so that they can move to greater health

131
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:31,840
and may it be that as we end this meditation that we dedicate the benefit and merit

132
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:39,200
of this practice to accompanying others

133
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,360
with our goodness our calmness

134
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:51,840
our friendship

135
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,520
without being too complicated or

136
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:09,039
too ambitious about what we can do for others company it can be one of the great gifts

137
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:16,960
and as we learn to accompany ourselves may we better accompany others

138
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:26,000
with the wish the aspiration that all beings may be happy

139
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:33,840
all beings may be safe

140
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,960
all beings may feel respected

141
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:45,440
beings may be peaceful

142
00:31:45,760 --> 00:32:01,840
and that all beings everywhere may be free

143
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,840
so

144
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:43,919
so before we move into the talk i would like to

145
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:51,600
make a few announcements and first

146
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,840
is that

147
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:06,960
that on friday i said i would post we would post

148
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:14,399
some of the things that i read last week the simile for the jhanas for the states of absorption

149
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:20,399
samadhi and also i posted the little passage from the buddha's teachings

150
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:27,039
with the 16 steps of anupanasati and the easy place to find that is at

151
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:32,559
on imc's home page on the home page there's a little

152
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,919
in the bottom right corner in what's new section and in there there's a little

153
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:45,200
line for reflections from gill and in there that's where you'll find

154
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,639
those passages and

155
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:59,440
and the other is that next week so starting from next monday the plan is to have for one week have

156
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,880
this early morning sittings be 45 minutes meditation be 45 minutes rather than 30

157
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,079
minutes and we'll start 15 minutes early so we'll start at

158
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:17,919
you know whatever time your time zone is 15 minutes before the hour in california at 6 45

159
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:25,200
and you're welcome to join at seven if that early time doesn't work for you uh just that you know um you should

160
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:33,280
probably um tiptoe into the meditation room when you when you join us and

161
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:39,599
and the reason for this longer sitting is i think that it would be after all this time of sitting some of you've been sitting for months this way

162
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,638
with me in the morning i feel like we're kind of deepening and going further

163
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:50,320
and to be able to sit longer is one of the ways to experience more the benefits of this

164
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:57,440
path to kind of let it unfold more deeply in the course of of the sitting so we'll try it next week

165
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:03,839
and maybe in a few weeks we'll do it again next time i do a retreat

166
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,480
panasati practice involves 16 steps of mindfulness of breathing in and

167
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:40,000
mindfulness of breathing out and the eighth step between the eighth

168
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,320
and ninth there's kind of a transition that goes on and the transition is we go into the ninth

169
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,920
we're staying in the first eight we're still staying very closely in

170
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:59,520
intimately involved with our embodied experience and uh and then uh that's always a

171
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:05,359
foundation for the the second eighth but um now we're in the second eighth we're going to open up

172
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:11,119
more to the uh realm of experience which maybe is not so

173
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:19,440
directly related to the body to work related to the mind and and so we're still in this

174
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:28,560
body section of the first half and so in the first tetrad

175
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:34,720
it's about just learning to develop a continuity with the breathing and beginning to experience and sense

176
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,760
the body and the and especially how the body is activated by the mind

177
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:46,800
the tensions of the body and to learn to relax that as that relaxes it frees up a good kind

178
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:54,640
of energy in the body and as the concentration deepens it also awakens a kind of um

179
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:01,520
meditative joy and happiness well-being that comes with calmness subtleness

180
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,359
contentment that comes just sitting here and being here and with that as a foundation a certain

181
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:12,640
kind of meditative well-being it's only then that this instructions

182
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:20,240
then is opens up to becoming aware of

183
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:25,520
um becoming aware of um

184
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:33,920
aspects of the mind and uh so in the step seven the instructions

185
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:42,880
are breathing in one experiences the mental formation

186
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:48,800
breathing out one experiences the mental formation so a few things about

187
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:56,400
this the word experience the pali word for it as maybe the english does has a lot to

188
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:03,040
do with the uh the physical direct experience of the sensation and it's almost like this word that's

189
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:11,119
translated as experience could be translated as one senses when senses for oneself

190
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:17,920
the sensations of the mind of the mental formation and here it's a singular the mental

191
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:23,359
formation so it's not necessarily going and looking at the detail little detailed

192
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:30,320
aspects of uh the mental formation but the whole the whole thing somehow how

193
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:35,599
it's experienced so the mental formation are

194
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:43,280
those experiences associated with the mind mental activity that we can sense and feel so it's the

195
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,400
mental activity that has some impact

196
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,440
on the body that senses i think of sensation as being very much part of the

197
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:59,119
body and and so the sensations of the mind also

198
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:05,280
so it could be for example something is clearly physical that if we're afraid our shoulders might

199
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:11,280
be up it may be tense and tight and that's a physical formation but if

200
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,400
our if we're if we're afraid and our mind feels contracted

201
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:24,800
feels small or tight that's the mental formations the mental expression of the fear

202
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,480
of that activated state so it's feeling the mental activity

203
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,560
so if particularly associated with thinking if we're thinking very intensely we

204
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:42,800
might feel it physically as you know maybe the forehead is all bunched up and scrunched together

205
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,880
and that would be the bodily formation but if you look kind of more deeply into the area around where we're

206
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:54,000
thinking if we think in the area of the brain for example you might feel that kind of

207
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,320
behind the forehead in this in the area of the brain that's not particularly associated with muscles

208
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:06,560
that have tightened up there's still sensations uh there's might be a feeling of

209
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,119
contraction there might be a headache there might be

210
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:19,040
agitation there might be a sense of pressure or pushing there might sometimes i feel like there's a magnetic pull

211
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:25,520
gravitational pull for me towards thinking or thinking towards me and there's some

212
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:31,599
something that feels like a pull or a tug going on that's

213
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:37,680
in relationship to the thoughts there's a leaning in in the mind sometimes the center of

214
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,720
gravity of my thinking is a little bit ahead of my body

215
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:49,440
somehow i'm like i'm leaning forward into the future a little bit so it's possible to start feeling

216
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:56,800
something that resembles or is sensation like associated with the mental activity we

217
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,000
do and that's those will be called mental the mental formations the mental

218
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,560
activities that we can feel and and so then

219
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,880
um the um so what's interesting here is a variety

220
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:22,640
of things is certainly we have a lot of mental activity let's look at thinking for example thinking is a mental activity and the

221
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:30,000
instructions here are to feel that the physical the kind of the physical experience of thinking

222
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,920
and and it's only feeling the feeling it it's not thinking better or

223
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:42,800
understanding what we're thinking or analyzing what we're thinking it's not about recognizing even what

224
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:49,440
we're thinking it's simply recognizing the physicality or the sensation level

225
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,640
of the thinking itself so in the shorthand i like to think of this

226
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:00,319
as feeling the the thinking muscle

227
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:07,440
and and so the ways in which we feel i'm thinking it feels energetic or tight

228
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:15,520
or constricted or there's pressure or there's a hurry or there's a kind of

229
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:24,240
low energy uh there's sometimes you feel swampy in the mind it can't lack of clarity there's um uh

230
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:30,560
you know so so a whole realm of things that are how it feels for us as opposed to what

231
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:36,240
it's about and partly this is a wonderful support and aid

232
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:42,839
to not get caught up with permission during meditation to not have to fix our thoughts fix the

233
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:48,000
world understand what's going on analyze what's going on we're here we're

234
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,040
only asked to feel it and feel an aspect of what

235
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:58,319
the mind is doing the mind is very important but a particular aspect which is the

236
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:03,839
sensation level of it so we're connected to it but we're not

237
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:11,359
being pulled into the storyline in a sense and so and we're trying to do this

238
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:17,839
based on the foundation of the of step

239
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:24,240
5 and 6 which is feeling this sense of well-being so until we have

240
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:30,000
some feeling of well-being then we don't really start actively taking in

241
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,119
what is going on in the mind what the mental activity is about

242
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:41,920
perhaps so that there's a container there's a context of well-being for looking at an area of our life which

243
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:48,480
is often quite difficult and so we're not you know trying to do a spiritual bypass we're not trying to

244
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,680
avoid our inner suffering or challenges that we have

245
00:43:53,680 --> 00:44:00,640
but maybe we're touching it with a breath with an awareness with a

246
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,760
with emotions that are supportive that have a goodness to them that have a

247
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:11,280
calmness or kindness in them that have a kind of generosity to them

248
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:16,319
some something like that it's on the building on the foundation of what's been done earlier

249
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:23,359
in these these steps of mindfulness of breathing and so the context for becoming now

250
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:29,440
aware of the mental activity is one of kindness of goodwill

251
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:37,119
or even joy it's one of the great um maybe peridot

252
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:43,440
wonderful paradoxes when i first discovered it that one can exp one can experience suffering

253
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:50,800
in oneself and suffering in the world and at the same time have a lot of joy and in fact my ability

254
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:56,720
to go deeply into the practice of vipassana where there are times we experience a lot of our

255
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:03,440
personal suffering was was supported by having cultivated meditative joy that

256
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:10,720
could hold that suffering so it isn't one or the other but it can be both there and all this is

257
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:16,960
it involves a disidentification from being locked in or

258
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:23,760
overly preoccupied with what we're thinking and what we're emoting and doing like that so that we

259
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:30,800
can just hold it and be present for it in a different way than we usually are and that's one of the opportunities

260
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,440
here with with with

261
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:43,040
this anapanasati is mindfulness of breathing so breathing in one experiences

262
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:48,240
the mental formation one isn't even trying to parse out the details of it

263
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:53,680
just the whole gestalt the global feeling the sensations of what they're going on in the mind

264
00:45:53,680 --> 00:46:01,680
breathing out one experience of the mental and then because we're breathing

265
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:07,839
in and breathing out this is again like a support for not getting wrapped up in not being caught

266
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:12,960
by as long as the breathing stays relaxed and smooth we tend to have a more

267
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:20,160
open freer relationship to what we're including in that awareness to what we're accompanying with the

268
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:26,800
breathing so i hope that makes sense uh and we'll do more of this over the next few days

269
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:33,760
so if it didn't make full sense don't worry about it too much and and just maybe there's just enough that

270
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:41,839
when i go on for the next days and become clearer so so for now

271
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:48,720
uh maybe you can spend the day this next 24 hours reflecting practicing this idea of

272
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:54,079
accompaniment that we're accompanying things we're accompanying ourselves

273
00:46:54,079 --> 00:47:01,359
we're accompanying our hearts our minds and we're accompanying other people what does that mean to be a companion

274
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:07,280
that way so thank you and i look forward to

275
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:10,880
tomorrow
