so welcome to IMC for all of you who are here in person and welcome those of you

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:12,519

finish here we'll have a uh as usual the Second Sunday of the month there's a tea

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:24,960
or kind of social time to hang out to have tea and chat and then at um 11:30

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,359
those of you like to stay will have uh the beginning of the year Refuge ceremony

6
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:37,559
where we uh chant the refuges I'll talk a little bit about refuges and the precepts and we'll chant the refuges and

7
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:44,600
precepts together and and it'll include a um a uh what's called a refuge cord

8
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,480
that like I have here in my wrist little red cord you tie on your wrist or some people put it around their neck and um

9
00:00:51,480 --> 00:01:01,920
and so that'll be given to you and and U so if you want to stay for that ceremony you're welcome to stay and and um

10
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,799
so so for the talk so it's uh the custom

11
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:15,080
for me at the first Dharma Talk of the Year here at IMC to talk about the four

12
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:22,880
noble truths and this is my first full Dharma talk here and I found myself uh quite

13
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:29,439
happy walking down here today thinking about this is the topic and um so you

14
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,640
know it's a a little bit of a paradox to be happy to be talking about

15
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,520
suffering so uh because it's such a deep part of the Buddhist tradition this Four

16
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,799
Noble Truths some people say it's really at the heart of it um I want to uh just

17
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:55,439
maybe for my sake just say um the the central words of the for Noble Truths in

18
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,960
poly and then say them in English and then give a talk about it

19
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,680
so in poly uh it's um

20
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:16,040
Dua samudaya nirod and Dua

21
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:25,200
nirod so in English I translate this as suffering the first Noble Truth arising

22
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,560
the arising of suffering the second Noble Truth the

23
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,280
cessation the cessation of suffering the third Noble Truth and then the practice

24
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:42,879
leading to the cessation of suffering and

25
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:50,080
um the um and there's many so these four noble truths are both

26
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,400
a teaching and a practice and as such especially since there there a teaching that's meant to

27
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,519
be practiced and practice is very personal and each of us it's our task to

28
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,840
understand the teachings and practice and personalize it in sense understand how it applies to us and our

29
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,400
circumstance our life and how it can support us and so there's many different

30
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:19,319
uh meanings of the Four Noble Truths there many as there are people here today there's that many

31
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:25,400
meetings or applications of them and um and so they're quite Rich

32
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:32,519
what they can be understood in many levels and ways and what I like to do today uh is to talk about three levels

33
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:38,920
of understanding the four the four noble truths and um and so there're kind of

34
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:44,959
more the Mind level the Heart level and the belly level so we'll go through take

35
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,560
you through this and they all work together that's one is not supposed to be better than the other but they

36
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,599
integrate together so U there was a um Buddhist

37
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:04,920
monk at the time of the Buddha who came to the Buddha complaining that uh he had not uh

38
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:12,280
demonstrated any Miracles and then any self-respecting Guru maybe back there in ancient times

39
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:19,600
was supposed to kind of demonstrate Guru Miracles because that was somehow proof of something

40
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:27,040
wonderful and uh the Buddhist basically said well I don't do this and not for this

41
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,440
purpose and uh at some point point this monk disrobed because he was so

42
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:40,120
discouraged in the Buddha the Buddha did say when he asked for miracles he said did did I ever tell you to become a monk

43
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,639
in order to become for the sake of Miracles and he said

44
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:51,479
no and um so anyway at some point it was it was so discouraging for this monk

45
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:57,000
that he disrobed and then he went went to town went to city and he was going around

46
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,960
disparaging the Buddha and he would uh tell the town's people that all the

47
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:10,120
Buddha teaches is the end of suffering and um and so the news of this

48
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:18,680
came back to the Buddha and uh and he said even though he's thinks he's disparaging me he's actually praising

49
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,160
me so you know it's that you know the the end of suffering is really the heart

50
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:31,479
of Buddhism and there might be other worthwhile Endeavors in life and there might be other worthwhile

51
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:36,919
spiritual experiences attainments to had in this life but uh from a Buddhist

52
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:42,160
point of view um uh don't short Change

53
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,479
yourself around suffering really get to the bottom to the heart of suffering and

54
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:54,319
bring it to an end uh and don't let other experiences other attainments come distract from

55
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:59,479
this fundamentally Deep thing and if anything let let these other possib

56
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:07,160
abilities if they're important for you let them uh be the cream on the cake and the cake is this wonderful

57
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:14,000
thing this phenomenal thing the peace the well-being The Joy the happiness that can come when uh we're free of

58
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,520
suffering and that's where the and knowing this is possible is a happiness producing

59
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,680
thing so many years ago when I was a news end student I knew a u an other's

60
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,720
end student who was a um uh stained

61
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:38,360
glass artist and that's not really important part of the story but she

62
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,919
um she had very bad knees and she was uh supposed to get

63
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:49,360
knee surgery I think knee Replacements and um but what she did was

64
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,120
she started paying very careful attention to her knees and the pain in

65
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:01,120
their knees and by tracking the pain the slightest little ache slightest

66
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,560
little something that felt off she started walking differently and and

67
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,639
slowly the pain and her challenge around her knees went away and she didn't have

68
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:21,560
surgery so so I'm not maybe that sounds like a miracle story but it's a story of someone who

69
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:27,960
paid really careful attention to pain really gave rather than trying to

70
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:35,599
avoid it or trying to fix it in some kind of medical way which sometimes necessary but but uh and I was really

71
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:41,120
struck by that that wow that that was the first time I met someone who used

72
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,039
pain as a teacher as a guide and that really you know you know taught me

73
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,800
something deep and as a result of this uh she decided to become a doctor and

74
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,000
applied for medical school and was accepted and I lost touch of her touch with her but

75
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,599
um um I thought this is fantastic that someone like this is a

76
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:09,039
doctor so um and then I have a friend who was many

77
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,560
years ago who was teaching mindfulness-based stress reduction a wonderful uh protocol that comes out of

78
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,960
this practice and out of Buddhism in America and was applied clinically to

79
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:27,840
people with first in hospital settings people with mostly acute pain and when uh when uh the medical

80
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:34,640
world couldn't really help them with their pain and and had adop adopted this kind of pra adapted this practice so

81
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:41,800
that it could address people's pain otherwise couldn't be helped and um they had a high Su success

82
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:48,279
rate partly because they screened people to be mo who were motivated but my friend was teaching it

83
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:53,399
here in small City most small town here in California and probably there was no screening for high

84
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:58,720
motivation and or something but uh there was this um he as

85
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:06,360
he described it this really um maybe it's not fair to describe it this way but Burly

86
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:11,880
Macho older police officer who had a lot of

87
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:19,120
back pain that was not helped by Medicine by doctors and uh so he came to he was

88
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:26,360
assigned by the doctor you should do take this 8we mindfulness base of course and uh so they came to the first

89
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:32,640
lesson and my friend was teaching it and then and gave the instructions uh pay uh

90
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:39,079
bring your attention to the pain and uh and the guy got

91
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:46,279
Furious I'm here to not experience the pain not to feel it and he left and he

92
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:54,480
never came back so one person that there you know the first person focused on the pain and

93
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,360
found a way out of it the other person ignored the pain and well certainly

94
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,720
wasn't helped that way maybe he found some other way then later here in

95
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:15,079
Buddhism we want to be wise about our pain and when the time is right it's

96
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:20,360
really important to be honest about it and to face it and to study it to be

97
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:26,279
present for it and I use the word pain purposefully because the the mean the

98
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:31,600
word Dua which is the poly word that's usually translated as suffering in our

99
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:38,600
circles literally means pain and it kind of has a little different feeling if you think of it as pain but it's used to

100
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:45,399
apply to the deepest existential sufferings we have and the deepest emotional sufferings and the slightest

101
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:50,920
little irritations we have the whole range everything you know things that are a

102
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:58,399
pain and um and I've certainly uh considered that my com my laptop is a

103
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:04,720
pain and uh and you know it's not literally a

104
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,839
physical pain uh and the laptop is not causing me anything for me to blame the

105
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,240
laptop for that pain is uh is to miss

106
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:24,399
what's you know my responsibility my role my frustration my attachments my desires my you know you know all kinds

107
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,959
of things going on in me so if I spend my whole day kind of

108
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:35,079
blaming my computer shaking it throwing it against the wall hoping to get you

109
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:41,160
know yelling at it you know whatever the computer is not going to care it's not going to listen to that and I might even

110
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:48,000
break it but if I don't want to stop suffering I have to stop blaming the computer I

111
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,079
have to take a good look at myself and I have to feel that pain feel that discomfort and really get to know it

112
00:11:55,079 --> 00:12:01,920
really study it and find out what's going on and find out what I'm doing that's extra what's not needed what's my

113
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,480
responsibility what's my role in that what I call the computer is a pain that

114
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:14,360
would be the way so in Buddhism the four noble truths are a call for us to be

115
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:20,000
honest that there is suffering in this world there's suffering in ourselves

116
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,600
there suffering in others and some people get so happy when they hear that Buddhism teaches this because they grew

117
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,839
up in a situation in circumstances maybe family maybe communities where there was

118
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,880
a lot of avoiding of suffering a lot of uh pretending it wasn't

119
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:45,120
there uh and they were very confused they felt like there's all this suffering your suffering my family

120
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,120
suffering people are suffering but no one's admitting it everyone's putting on a smile everyone's being distracted all

121
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,360
the time and and you know this doesn't seem right to live in this kind of

122
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:01,800
sometimes that some people have reported to be a lie this avoidance of

123
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:08,199
it and then they come to Buddhism and they hear um this say yes there's

124
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:14,560
suffering categorically yes there's suffering there's no we don't want to avoid it we want to name it we want to

125
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:22,320
say it's here it's it's part and parcel of The Human Condition it's completely part of it and

126
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,480
so much so that one of the orientations that we have in Buddhism is to

127
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,600
understand that we don't have to take it so personally um it is personal in a way

128
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:41,320
that you know the the the pain of the computer is personal you know I'm I'm involved with that causing that pain but

129
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:48,160
it's just so human to have this frustration it's such a common phenomena that we're maybe built in certain ways

130
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,360
to have frustration and pain and suffering and grief and and these kinds

131
00:13:53,360 --> 00:14:01,800
of things that there's a kind of way in which we can be honest about it and begin studying it but not identify it

132
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:07,600
too much closely not to Define ourselves by it this is who I am or this is this

133
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:14,880
is being done to me or something but rather what we do is we begin to look at

134
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,560
suffering and stop so that my bumper stiner if I had one was I stop for

135
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:28,120
suffering and um and theya okay let's take a look at this let's really be with it this emotional pain that we have with

136
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:35,320
and then what we're doing partly here in Buddha in Buddhist practice is learning how to do this in a wise way it's not

137
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:41,519
easy to be with our suffering it's not easy to be with um The Suffering that

138
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:49,880
you know conventionally and reasonably we say it's been caused by the world around us people grow up in war zones

139
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:56,240
and there war zones are a pain and uh and to say well you know you

140
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:04,440
got to look at yourself the bombs are going off and look at your frustration look at your fear you know uh that's uh

141
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:10,040
you know disrespectful it's harmful to do that so we want to be very careful

142
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:16,000
about the time and place but at some point sooner or later we have to turn

143
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,399
and look inside and for some people who have known uh there clearly was conventional

144
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:28,319
causes of it in the external world but at some point all that was left for them

145
00:15:28,319 --> 00:15:35,440
to do do was to look at themselves that was the only way forward uh I known people who thought

146
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:42,040
they were dying and the conditions outside that were causing them to die were clearly outside of themselves but

147
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:48,720
at some point they just uh realized this is I'm I give up remember one man who told me this

148
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:55,199
many years ago was in the mountains and caught in an

149
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:02,800
avalanche and um under layers of snow or something and um and at some point he

150
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,759
realized I'm going to die here no one knows I'm here or something and um and

151
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:14,959
uh and when he let go when he admitted this and kind of really saw it um you know he wasn't blaming the

152
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:22,319
snow uh he he experienced this profound peace and then he says a strange thing

153
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:30,480
happened that um at some point my arm punched upwards and he broke through the

154
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,639
snow and then he was rescued but uh that was life-changing

155
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:40,920
for him to have this profound letting go that happened because he thought he was

156
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:48,079
dying so when we really when we finally ready to stop and look at our suffering

157
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:54,519
in a deep way is uh is a is something we need to consider well and one of the

158
00:16:54,519 --> 00:17:00,959
purposes of medit meditation in Buddhism and mindfulness practice and love mean kindness practices and concentration

159
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:07,438
practice is to provide us with the inner resources the inner stamina the inner

160
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:13,880
skills the inner strengths so that we can really turn towards our suffering in

161
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,400
a useful and meaningful way we can turn towards it to find the freedom from it

162
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:25,720
and find our way through it and some people are ready for that right away some people are ready for that after a

163
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:31,280
while of practice but this this idea yes there is suffering

164
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:37,720
here and then a very special thing happens and that is uh that at some

165
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:44,120
point when we don't take the suffering personally in some kind of attached way

166
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:50,559
when we don't uh stop blaming the world outside of us when we stop complaining

167
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:58,679
when we stop to really take a good look at some point the way that we look

168
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:04,520
becomes the secret becomes the treasure to be able to see and recognize

169
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:11,039
suffering without attachments without identification without resistance to

170
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:17,520
have a a Clarity of seeing where in the seeing there's kind of a freedom in the

171
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:23,799
seeing there's a kind of the Delight maybe can exist sometimes on a clear day

172
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:28,880
Blue Sky day and the windshield reir got

173
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:36,039
completely clean you think you can put your hand through it it's so clear and so nice maybe after a long time of

174
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:41,320
having smudge and so to have your ability to oh

175
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,799
this is this is suffering this is my suffering with that kind of clarity with

176
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:52,559
that kind of ease and lack of clinging this provides a very different reference

177
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:58,760
point for how to go forward in life how where the where the freedom is found

178
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:04,480
that freedom is possible it's possible not to be defined by the suffering it's

179
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:11,039
possible not to have the challenges and difficulties of our life which can be huge it's possible to have them not be a

180
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:16,159
burden we carry they have things we have to address but they don't have to be

181
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:25,080
addressed as a burden as a drag as a wind drag so the four noble truths

182
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:32,679
are suffering which we want to turn toward and know and understand

183
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:40,120
deeply there's the literal word of the second Noble Truth is the arising of suffering is really to be present for

184
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:45,280
the appearance of it but often it's called the cause of

185
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,840
suffering and uh and then the third Noble Truth is the

186
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:57,640
cessation of the suffering cessation of the cause and then the fourth Noble Truth is

187
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,760
the practi is sometimes called the path of practice the practices which lead to

188
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,960
that so um and and and are a result of

189
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:13,679
that so the three levels first is the mind the mind is a little more the

190
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,919
cognitive level and that's where we can uh study the cause of suffering and this

191
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:26,280
is a brilliant thing to do that uh to understand that suffering is not just

192
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:32,360
Without a Cause to understand that suffering is not just something that we have to live with because it's inherent

193
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:39,400
in human existence and there's no no possibility of changing it but the sufferings we have when we're able to

194
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:45,799
see the particularity of it we'll see that it always has a

195
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:53,480
cause and uh and sometimes the cause is external and sometimes we can address the external cause if it's appropriate

196
00:20:53,480 --> 00:21:00,559
sometimes we can't address the external cause but what we're trying to do in Buddhist practice is to take

197
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:06,120
responsibility for our contribution to our emotional

198
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,760
pain and uh chances are uh often there's

199
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,120
a contribution you make even if 90% of it comes externally from external cause

200
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:25,039
the 10% that you contribute that's what the contri that's the part of it that you probably have the most ability to

201
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:31,520
change sometimes it's it's hard to change the external world and make it you know behave

202
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,240
properly and uh but maybe you can do something about yourself and that's

203
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:44,000
where kind of the you know the the work of Buddhism kind of really is is uh at

204
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,200
at its heart so one of those things is to look what are the cause and one of

205
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,760
the fascinating uh ways of understanding their suffering and the cause of

206
00:21:54,760 --> 00:22:02,120
suffering is to switch it around by by realizing that in Buddhism the cause is

207
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:07,840
always SE to be a certain kind of thirsting for something and they use the

208
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,600
word thirst in the ancient language so it's kind of a metaphor the C it's a metaphor to

209
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:21,120
describe the cause and so it's for you to fill out the metaphor what does it apply but usually people who want to be

210
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,960
more lit more kind of not so metaphorical will uh translate it as

211
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,520
craving sometimes as clinging the there's some kind of

212
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:39,240
compulsion of thirsting a compulsion of craving that goes on so sometimes I like

213
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:46,360
to translate as compulsion because it has a life of its own you can't drop it E le like it's sometimes that compulsion

214
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:53,039
craving thirsting has taken over and now we're addicted now we're driven now

215
00:22:53,039 --> 00:23:00,799
we're kind of no wonder we can't end our suffering because there's this powerful drive that keeps it going so the cause

216
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:06,600
is to look at that drive to look at that cause so to turn these uh first and

217
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:14,120
second Noble Truths around I like to say if you

218
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,559
cling you will suffer or to another way if you want the

219
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:24,919
bumper sticker um uh clinging is

220
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:31,520
suffering craving is suffering compulsion addiction is

221
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:37,600
suffering and so to look so the to to looking at the cause then is to look on

222
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:45,279
where is my compulsion where is my drivenness where's my what am I attached to here because as soon as I get

223
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:50,880
attached then we're fragile as soon as we're attached we're stuck as soon as

224
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:57,600
we're attached we're contracted and and and we start contributing stress to our

225
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,720
whole psychophysical system I think I would probably suggest

226
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,919
I've never done the statistics but I would say that probably

227
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:14,000
90% of human stress has its Genesis in

228
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,240
in uh this clinging thirsting compulsion of the mind and um and you know maybe I'm wrong

229
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:28,720
about the exact percentage um maybe more of it is maybe less of it is but it's a it's a I think

230
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,840
a very significant statement to make that 90% is has a birth in are

231
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:41,320
clinging because uh then if when you feel stress don't blame the world take a look

232
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:46,600
at yourself what can be done and people who meditate a lot will find often that

233
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:53,120
meditation is one of those things that can quiet calm relax the mind and as the

234
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,720
mind gets relaxed the physical stresses we carry begin to settle away

235
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:05,559
and you after a while it becomes a very clear connection what goes on in the mind causes physical stress causes the

236
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:12,520
headache that I'm having detention headaches and

237
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:19,600
um so to look at the cause is what the mind can do the mind is bright sometimes

238
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:25,559
it's clear uh the your mind only has to be as intelligent as it actually is you

239
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:30,720
don't have to have any more because whatever ever intelligence you have um

240
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,200
that's the intelligence uh that uh brought you your

241
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,960
suffering and so that's enough intelligence to find your freedom from it so just be happy you know it's not

242
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:48,600
like it's you know you can do it and once we see our suffering is born

243
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:57,120
from clinging it isn't that we can let go of it easily which is a third Noble truth but there's practices we can do

244
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,440
that support rep us prepare us for the day it can something can be released and

245
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:10,039
let go and so these are ethical practices living in ethical life is Central to this there are practices that

246
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:16,480
where we begin paying attention to our mind and begin training our mind to be able to be focused and mindful and clear

247
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:24,320
and see what's going on and there are practices of intentionality of purpose and there's

248
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:30,559
practices of of focusing choosing to focus F us on the perspective to be oriented

249
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:37,679
towards uh suffering and the end of it so the second uh level so this is

250
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:44,200
more the Mind level which is very helpful is to drop down deeper into the

251
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:50,559
heart and for the heart to register your

252
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,720
suffering and one of the surprises for me in doing Buddhist practice was I in

253
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:00,799
the beginning of practice I suffered a lot lot every meditation session was a

254
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:07,039
session of suffering but I I kind of was I was given with the practice I was

255
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:14,520
taught in Zen was a practice of just sit with your experience don't do anything about it and that worked out really well

256
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:20,320
for me because I I didn't complicate it with analysis I didn't complicate it

257
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:26,600
with fixing and what happened slowly that as I relaxed and settled into my

258
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:32,600
suffering my heart awoke up it was kind of like I had uh the

259
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:39,320
meditation was the like meat tenderizer for my heart I had this crust hard crust around

260
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:45,919
it and it began to soften and soften and at some point what awoke in me was

261
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:53,760
compassion and I was able to meet my suffering with compassion to meet it with love and care

262
00:27:53,760 --> 00:28:00,279
and to soften and meet it and the capacity to to be open to suffering and

263
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:06,600
allow it to to meet it with compassion with care not with anger not with

264
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:12,320
resistance not with fear but with this beautiful quality of the heart

265
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:18,519
compassion so the second phase of noble of the four of the Four Noble Truths is

266
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:23,679
um again you have to turn towards it and allow yourself to not just study it and

267
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:30,919
feel it and analyze it maybe even you want to stop that because that gets in the way at some point from allowing

268
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:39,519
yourself to feel what's going on in some deeper way feel below the reactivity you have

269
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:47,679
or maybe you have to feel the reactivity as part of the complex of suffering to really make room for you to allow

270
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,840
yourself to be how you are warts and

271
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:59,320
all suffering at all and just learn to breathe with it and make space for it

272
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:07,760
and not try to fix it not try to make it go away just be patient with it and and

273
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:14,360
and this beautiful thing can happen where the heart can meat it maybe you

274
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:19,679
can't it's too hard for you to do but your heart has the capacity this

275
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:25,240
emotional Center that I call the heart it's a wise part of us it's part of our

276
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:33,000
deeper I would say subconscious just operating M milon kind of there's always

277
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,799
mamillion um functions that we share with other mammals of care for their

278
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:43,880
young and care for others and these beautiful stories of animals will come

279
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:49,960
to the rescue of humans I'm particularly fond of the dolphin ones when people are

280
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:57,360
kind of drowning at Sea and the dolphin will come and carry them and um and I like the stories of

281
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:04,360
you know Predators taking care of their prey sometimes if occasionally you hear the stories like you a lion is helping a

282
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:10,440
deer or something but at least they take care of their young usually and so this

283
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:16,600
mamillion so it's something more than just kind of just the what we think we are but something deeper and built into

284
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:22,840
our genes almost maybe and so this capacity to feel suffering and let the

285
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:30,000
heart respond and you'll be surprised how much the heart knows how to process this and be with it and the benefits

286
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,960
will come and then we have the third level and then we and I like thinking of these

287
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:42,760
you're going deeper and deeper to yourself and I call it the belly in Buddhism it's sometimes called the

288
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:49,320
source the literal uh meaning the word in P is Yoni and sometimes that's

289
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:56,880
translated as womb but it doesn't quite mean womb it means like the The Source where something is born so like the the

290
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:02,039
egg is the Yi for the chicken they don't you know they don't have wombs I suppose

291
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:10,639
they have the eggs and then there are things that are water born in Buddhism and so that's their Yoni so the

292
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:16,120
source and um so to drop down to some deep place where there's something

293
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:21,880
that's operating within us a knowing a way of thinking a way of perceiving a way of

294
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:28,679
feeling a a a creativity an intelligence that's has more an emergent

295
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:36,240
quality where it's something that's emerging from deep inside as opposed to something that's coming from the the

296
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:44,039
usual maybe uh thinking mind egotistical mind self-centered mind that's I have to

297
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:49,480
do something I'm happen to me that's a kind of eye that's usually caught up in

298
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:55,679
its own little drama kind of dissolves as we drop down and we're not trying to

299
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:03,399
make something happen but we're beginning to allow something to happen and the difference between making and

300
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:09,440
allowing and so they're dropping really deep down and what happens there was we

301
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:16,200
we have have an opportunity now to allow all experiences to just be there without

302
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,519
interfering with them and without overlaying our judgments and our

303
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,600
Concepts and our stories on top of our experience this is a phenomenal thing to

304
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:33,720
do to quiet the projections we have on life it's a very wonderful thing to do

305
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:41,600
for your friends to quiet your projections and be able to see others and you know

306
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:47,080
unfiltered by all the bias we might have or projections or preferences or

307
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:52,600
something but to do it for ourselves and and towards ourself and

308
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:58,639
then be there in the rawness of the present moment experience

309
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:05,080
the place where because we're allowing things to unfold things are appearing and

310
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:13,000
disappearing they're coming and going and this is where the meaning of the second double truth being arising the

311
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:20,840
word samoda means to the arising now we see the appearing the coming and going

312
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:26,360
of our suffering we see the rawness of it just like we see the uh Surfer sees

313
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:33,480
the coming and going of the waves and the surfer doesn't get attached to any one wave you know it's just that's just

314
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:40,600
the wave of the moment and um and so but and and in that is able to ride the wave

315
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:49,159
sometimes so to ride the experiences that are coming and going within us to be very close to see to feel to

316
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:57,120
experience that in the moment a moment experience the rawness of experience there's more than just suffering there's

317
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,399
also in the moments there's also the ending of suffering there's a coming and

318
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:08,118
going the appearing and disappearing nothing is static nothing is constant

319
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:13,638
nothing is stuck and that's the advantage of dropping down to this deep emerging

320
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:20,599
place is to find the way of being unstuck where everything is flowing and

321
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:25,960
Buddhism uses a lot has a lot of references to the the metaphor of a

322
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:32,079
river where everything is flowing and most people have been to the river with

323
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:37,398
a bucket or two or a thousand and they scooped up the water

324
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:43,358
in their buckets and they go around saying look I have the river and it's my

325
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:48,599
River you don't have the river anymore if you have a bucket full of water if we

326
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:53,878
cling we've lost the flow of the River of Life and so drop down to the place

327
00:34:53,879 --> 00:35:00,320
where the River of Life is flowing and us the coming and going the rising and passing the

328
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:06,000
the the ups and downs of the waves of thoughts and feelings emotions

329
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:14,320
clinging and to experience there the gaps the gaps when we're not thinking

330
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:20,760
thoughts the gaps where we're not in our anger the gaps where we're

331
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:27,320
not in our craving and desires the gaps where we're not holding on or resisting

332
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:32,400
the gaps where we see oh there's a peace here there's a freedom

333
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:38,599
here there's a well-being here and to begin then seeing that and relaxing

334
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:44,640
seeing that and letting go seeing that and kind of allowing this emergent

335
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:52,079
possibility of peace to show itself at such a point where the theoda

336
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:58,599
the sensation of suffering is not a letting go we're not doing doing it but

337
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:05,920
the sensation of suffering the third Noble Truth is a profound

338
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,760
releasing that you can't take credit for it's a something deep releases

339
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:17,720
inside of something something deep and lets go and

340
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:24,440
then this belly this Source this imerg and quality within us begins to have a

341
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:31,359
greater life in for us and that this is part of the Great

342
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:38,119
potential that we have that Buddhist practice is supposed to bring us to it can bring us to is this point where the

343
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:43,560
release is strong enough that there begins to

344
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:50,000
emerge the eful path whereas the eful path is not so

345
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,800
much practice as we do anymore but rather a state of Life state of being

346
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:05,440
that we begin to make room for and live by more and more so if we're not practicing ethics we become ethical and

347
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:11,160
ethics doesn't become a choice but rather it's an expression of the freedom that we

348
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:17,240
have mindfulness is uh not no longer something we have to do but it feels

349
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:24,359
more like something we allow for it's like part and parcel of who we are in the Deep emergent way even concentration

350
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:32,720
can feel like it's not something we have to do and strain for but it's more a letting go and allowing of something to

351
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:38,760
settle and then um uh the other aspects of the eful path all that are these

352
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:46,520
emerging qualities and something begins to grow within us or we start to kind of really feel

353
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:52,079
like we're flowing in a river that's moving through us and going

354
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:58,440
through so Four Noble Truths

355
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:04,680
they're invaluable teachings they're more than

356
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:12,440
teachings they're a framework to explore our life it's an

357
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:17,920
orientation the perspective with which to step into to see ourselves in a new

358
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:24,079
way to not see ourselves through the usual Concepts that Society wants us to

359
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:30,359
live by but to see our eles through the through the framework of our

360
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:36,319
suffering the cause of it or more deeply where how it

361
00:38:36,319 --> 00:38:44,200
arises to see the end of it the letting go of it the cessation of it and to understand that there are

362
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:51,000
practices to engage in practices and states to allow for that really allow

363
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:58,480
for this freedom and joy and happiness to become part of of our life this is

364
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,720
the four noble truths of the Buddha and

365
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:10,640
um and it's a happy thing so don't get so happy that you

366
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:16,359
don't don't get too happy so you don't look at the

367
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:21,920
suffering but maybe get happy enough that you're say okay I'm ready to take a

368
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:28,440
good look at this suffering now be honest be present for it

369
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,720
so thank you and um so in a few minutes we'll I
