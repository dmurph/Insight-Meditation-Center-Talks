1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,020
greetings everybody I'm touched to be

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:15,660
arrogant with all of you I've been a participant in this

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:24,320
Forum ever since it started and um it's really quite something that

4
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,820
that gill created here and that all of you and all of us

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,820
have helped to create this this family of

6
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,820
practitioners

7
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,260
so to begin the meditation

8
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,600
take your meditation and posture

9
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,880
upright a little bit more upright than usual may

10
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,040
be but even more important relaxed

11
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,720
to the extent possible

12
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,280
lowers your eyes

13
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,360
and take a little trip inside your body

14
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,640
starting with the feet

15
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:07,619
and wherever you scan through see if you can also uh when becoming

16
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:13,220
conscious of something like the feet relax the feet

17
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,319
and the legs

18
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,920
the hips

19
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,480
the belly

20
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,319
moving up to the Heart Center

21
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:01,860
and feel what the

22
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:11,239
predominant flavor of the heart center is right now

23
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:21,780
it might be open and receptive it might be anxious

24
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:28,879
fearful or lacking in confidence

25
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:36,780
or it might be brimming with joy or

26
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,640
it might be grieving

27
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,940
as you well know however it is that's just fine

28
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:53,599
because that is our lived reality

29
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:00,620
and if there is a key to Awakening

30
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:10,819
the key is to be able to cultivate

31
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:19,979
our lived experience and as you know our lived experience

32
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:25,160
occurs only in the present moment

33
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,979
we can't live in the past we may want to remake the past or dwell

34
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:42,780
in the past or uh recriminate

35
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:52,259
but that's not the door to Awakening and if we're an anxious type we might be

36
00:04:52,259 --> 00:05:01,880
planning or thinking of what we're going to do next or you know preparing for the next thing

37
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,259
and so living in the future as you know

38
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:11,900
is not the door to Awakening either

39
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:19,080
so the simple profound ask

40
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:27,139
in front of us as we meditate is to just be here

41
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,199
with whatever arises

42
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,080
in the last series that I gave in February

43
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:49,280
the theme was opening the Dharma heart

44
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:56,639
and in my own experience this opening of the heart

45
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:06,979
has not been easy has not been terribly straightforward

46
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:15,080
and has taken a long time and still has a ways to go

47
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:23,580
so again you know don't uh sit on a realistic expectations for your

48
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:30,419
meditation uh saying that there's something wrong with you if you can't

49
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:37,560
just stay in the present moment this is a

50
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:44,039
a sort of wisdom really that we have to cultivate

51
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:48,380
because it is not innate

52
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:56,160
unfortunately what is innate in US

53
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:04,139
is reactivity either we're grasping

54
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:11,699
and wanting more of something that's Pleasant or we have a version that we're turning

55
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:18,680
away from something we don't want to experience

56
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:26,120
and the only way to

57
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:33,300
be able to make the choice of living even if it's just for a few

58
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,000
seconds in the present moment

59
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:46,020
is to um have well cultivated

60
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:52,979
mindfulness so that uh

61
00:07:52,979 --> 00:08:00,620
our mindfulness as we cultivate it it comes

62
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:08,160
more and more continuous but when we're beginners

63
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,560
um you know it this kind of uh

64
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,960
awareness real awareness in the present moment not

65
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:25,500
someplace else not on the thought drains not in their recriminations

66
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:33,479
or the fantasies just being satisfied enough

67
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,940
with this moment that's the key

68
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:45,240
to be able being to learning to be able to um

69
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:52,339
have awareness mindfulness that is more continuous

70
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,940
and that's what allows us to go deeper in meditation

71
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:10,500
so we were doing a body scan and uh we've been in the Heart Center for a

72
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:16,140
while so now let's continue um

73
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:23,100
with the shoulders or any tension in the shoulders we might

74
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:29,339
be able to let go of or if it's

75
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:36,860
not possible to let go to soften around it

76
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:43,200
and going down the arms the elbows

77
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,240
the forearms the wrists

78
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:57,259
and the hands what might we let go of here

79
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:08,420
and now coming into the head area

80
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,640
take a moment to see if the head is

81
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,519
easily supported by the spinal column not

82
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:26,399
grouping forward not leaning back

83
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,740
because or to one side or to another

84
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:37,980
because if the head is not well centered uh with our

85
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:45,480
um source of gravity that creates additional tension which

86
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,540
makes it harder to be present

87
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:05,600
and now taking a long deep inhale

88
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:14,220
followed by a long complete exhale

89
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:23,180
and now following the cycle of the breath

90
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:30,660
I like to think of the cycle of the breath as um

91
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:37,320
an oval this is not uh Buddhist but I've found

92
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:45,140
it useful and the oval begins uh at the perineum

93
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:52,019
and goes up the back and then continues

94
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:56,839
over the head and over the

95
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:04,440
the fontanelle which is that little space between the bones of the skull

96
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:12,600
which is still an open Gateway and then down the front

97
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,779
slowly so at whatever rhythm

98
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:25,920
is your rhythm doesn't matter if it's fast or slow or medium

99
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:33,660
follow your natural breathing and if you like the idea of trying out

100
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:41,760
this oval going up in the back over the head and down in the front and

101
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,579
then returning to the perineum and starting over again please feel free

102
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:54,660
to try it out and if that's not your cup of tea

103
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:59,120
just do it your way that's fine

104
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:23,600
though Our intention for the rest of this meditation

105
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,700
is to um the extent possible

106
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:38,399
stay with the breath on the whole cycle of the inhale and the

107
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,820
exhale

108
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:52,459
and if a slight smile should come to your lips

109
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:00,139
that may Express the flavor of joy

110
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:10,160
which is nourishment for staying here in the present

111
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:37,740
in the last few minutes of this sitting

112
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,919
the invitation is to

113
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:49,799
discern or get in touch with the flavor

114
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:55,460
of your experience In This Moment

115
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,400
maybe it's sweet salty

116
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,120
bitter

117
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:15,860
however it is sour

118
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:30,080
let that be known and accept it

119
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:37,100
so we breathe in our

120
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:44,360
internal reality with things just the way they are

121
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,419
we don't need to change anything

122
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:57,559
to appreciate being alive

123
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:58,520
and as we come to the end of this sitting

124
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:05,640
let's take a moment to

125
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:12,299
offer the benefits of our practice

126
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:18,259
through all beings everywhere without exception

127
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:29,940
we have had the Good Fortune to embark on this beautiful path

128
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:35,059
and of course it has its ups and downs

129
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:47,700
but little by little we become more and more

130
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:55,799
able to be aware to dwell in our awareness in the

131
00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:02,299
present moment and to be satisfied

132
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:07,880
with the gift of the breath

133
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,778
not needing anything else

134
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:20,340
so by the goodness of our practice

135
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:25,440
we open our hearts and radiate

136
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,919
good wishes to all beings

137
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:38,658
may all beings be happy may all beings be safe

138
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:44,399
may all beings be peaceful

139
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:50,120
and may all beings everywhere be free

140
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:54,559
[Music]

141
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:06,319
[Music]

142
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:19,880
[Music] foreign

143
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:33,500
[Music] thank you

144
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:39,960
greetings everyone it's a a genuine Delight

145
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:47,940
to the back here practicing with all of you many of you uh

146
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:54,360
have been in this Dharma group since its Inception

147
00:30:54,360 --> 00:31:03,360
uh in the spring of 2020 uh as I have been and um

148
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:09,779
I think it's it's remarkable um The Meditation community

149
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:16,559
that we've been able to create together and I do mean together

150
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:24,840
uh of course you know we owe everything to Gill who've initiated this

151
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:30,960
but the way this meditation group has evolved

152
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:37,380
has been in response to all of the participants all over the world

153
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:43,799
so um I would just like to honor uh everything that all of you have

154
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:51,020
brought to this community and continue to bring to this community

155
00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:05,000
when I um was standing in for Gill in February

156
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:12,380
I talked about opening the Dharma heart

157
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,720
and um

158
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:24,419
and I made some reference to my own path and my own difficulties

159
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:27,919
and opening my heart

160
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:36,059
and um I I would just like to share with all of

161
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:42,240
you that if you find this practice not so easy you're not alone and I I'm with

162
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,700
you on that um

163
00:32:54,299 --> 00:33:01,140
it takes up for some of us it takes a long time for some of us you know some of us are

164
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:08,039
Naturals and you know we uh become free rather or at least the the

165
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:16,140
initial stages of Freedom we can manage to do that relatively quickly

166
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:23,159
but for many of us um it takes

167
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:27,860
not just years but in my case decades

168
00:33:29,419 --> 00:33:36,840
so it's really important not to set the bar too high

169
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:43,039
um because if we do we'll get frustrated and

170
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:53,539
we won't um we may be discouraged and we may quit

171
00:33:53,940 --> 00:34:01,200
but I think all of you who have been practicing for some time if you look back on

172
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,440
how you were before you started practicing and then

173
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:14,898
how you developed over time chances are

174
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:24,000
um you've learned some things and chances are you're a little bit more comfortable in

175
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,240
this body and mind and at ease in this body and mind

176
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,819
then you may have been before you started

177
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:46,158
so for this coming week um a theme that I've chosen

178
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,560
is tastes of freedom

179
00:34:53,339 --> 00:35:00,480
and freedom is a big word and there are many degrees of freedom

180
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:07,920
there's a whole gamut of a little little smidgens of freedom and

181
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:15,540
then something a little bit more substantial and then maybe a little bit deeper or

182
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:23,060
maybe a little bit more embodied and Lasting

183
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:30,320
um but for most of us it does take time

184
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:39,839
but I do believe strongly that even as relative beginners if we

185
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:47,880
can taste something of the freedom that's in store as

186
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:55,560
we can see in the suttas from Buddha's own experience and the

187
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:04,680
experience of all the arahans whether they're monks or nuns or laymen

188
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:12,119
or lay women or gender free you know

189
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:14,299
um

190
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:24,300
it is very very valuable to have even the tiniest Taste of freedom

191
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:31,740
so uh my program for the week is is kind of ambitious and I'll do my very best to

192
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:37,740
uh be as inclusive as I can and make it as

193
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:45,119
accessible as possible but we are going to look in look at

194
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,460
um this week four of the

195
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,578
um

196
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,380
and relatively advanced advanced I guess we have to say it Advanced states of

197
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:08,579
meditation that support our practice they support the seven factors of

198
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:16,760
Awakening they support especially our meditation

199
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:23,880
and in the suttas

200
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:30,020
um it is clearly

201
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:36,060
described that um Enlightenment doesn't come as a

202
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:41,640
thunderbolt out of the sky it comes from dedicated meditation

203
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:50,220
practice that is so uh artfelt and

204
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:58,339
continuous that we little by little make progress

205
00:37:58,339 --> 00:38:04,980
in letting go of our attachments letting go of grasping

206
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:12,540
through what we like and what we want more of and letting go of being aversive

207
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:17,599
to what we don't like and want to push away

208
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:25,079
and finding our peace in this body and mind the way it is

209
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:29,839
right here right now in this moment

210
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:38,480
so I was um

211
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,839
pleased to listen uh to some of Ying's

212
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:53,480
teachings last week and uh the theme that

213
00:38:53,480 --> 00:39:00,780
she uh spoke about uh namely the the multi-dimensional

214
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:07,020
multi-faceted um realm of practice

215
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:12,780
uh practice that includes much more than just meditation practice that includes

216
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:18,060
all of us all of our life and um

217
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:26,960
she's there shared some lovely stories from Gill's little uh Treasury

218
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,720
of stories called the monastery Within

219
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:39,960
and this is this is a lovely thing and in fact

220
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:45,980
it um Segways beautifully into

221
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:52,579
what I had chosen to talk about this week which is tastes of freedom

222
00:39:53,460 --> 00:40:00,359
the monastery within um I think we can

223
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:06,780
we can say that the monastery within is who we are it's us it's

224
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:14,460
it's inside here uh it's not you know someplace else

225
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:21,440
and what that means is that

226
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:27,900
as our meditation deepens and we are able to little by little

227
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:33,560
step into States of samadhi

228
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,060
that's the monastery Within

229
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:45,140
that's what opens the doors to Freedom

230
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:52,740
and um you know as I as I drilled on in

231
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:58,020
the meditation and mentioned at the

232
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:03,359
beginning of this talk um

233
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:13,339
we need to be we need to cultivate patients to be able to really enter into that Monastery Within

234
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:20,099
and then um I was

235
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:26,400
um corresponding with Kim Allen who's going to teach next week

236
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:32,160
and she asked me what my theme was going to be because she didn't want to overlap and I told her

237
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:39,240
and she said oh that's great um I think that'll that'll work with mine nicely and so I asked her what her

238
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:44,880
thing was going to be and hers is savers

239
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,400
so mine this week is taste tastes of Freedom Savers or freedom

240
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:56,280
and next week you'll get a lovely I'm sure um

241
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:03,960
five days of teaching on the emotional tones of a teaching the the word in in

242
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:11,700
Pali is Raza and that means tastes are savers

243
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:20,660
so um with that I would like to

244
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:26,520
[Music] um express my appreciation

245
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:31,680
or the practice that each of you brings to this community

246
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:39,480
and that each of you all of us offer to everyone we come in contact with

247
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:47,220
and that radiates out of that Circle to wider and wider circles like a pebble

248
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:51,380
being dropped into a calm lake

249
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:57,720
so with this bow I

250
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:04,140
express my gratitude for your practice and end this talk

251
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:08,420

254
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:41,119

255
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:11,660
given you do the selection please sure we'll do Okay so we've got Luna

256
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:19,160
hey Luna you can go ahead hi

257
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:26,940
um thank you for offering this morning um I just had a little Flash

258
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:33,060
when you were talking about patients how how patience and Equanimity feel very

259
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:38,339
similar um but it's just a body feeling and I

260
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:44,579
don't know how so I wonder you have any thoughts on that

261
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:50,760
uh I think you hit the nail on the head um

262
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:56,099
you know they're in in this uh this volume of teachings there are many uh

263
00:44:56,099 --> 00:45:02,460
dharmalists um one of them is the seven factors of Awakening

264
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:07,800
and um in that Equanimity comes at the very

265
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:13,619
end because it's the it's the highest of them all and in fact in every list that

266
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:22,140
Equanimity is part of it's always at the end because it's the ultimate in the Brahma viharas

267
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:30,359
um the four flavors of love whether it's meta or

268
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:38,220
um whether let's just say whether it's friendliness or Compassion or

269
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:47,579
sympathetic Joy or equanimity and there's also another list of the 10

270
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:54,660
parameters in which patients is highlighted as very

271
00:45:54,660 --> 00:46:01,920
important quality to cultivate and for many of us it's not it's not so

272
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:11,220
natural you know it's easy to get ahead of ourselves it's easy to you know want some kind of

273
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:17,940
success earlier rather than later and so every time we find ourselves

274
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:23,040
becoming impatient or maybe actually if we've gone too far and we've become

275
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:30,720
impatient then we we can say oh welcome welcome in patients I know you

276
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:36,480
um I think I'm not going there right now kind of like you know if you meet Mara

277
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:43,319
the tempter um you you you slow down enough so that

278
00:46:43,319 --> 00:46:52,760
you can recognize that you're impatient and then you can say no thank you

279
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:56,420
is that make any sense

280
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:05,660
yeah totally thank you so much pleasure

281
00:47:06,839 --> 00:47:14,040
okay Hugh you can go ahead and unmute thank you Mark

282
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:20,480
um make uh early in your talk here said that um

283
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:27,420
a fontanelle is still an open Gateway

284
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:35,900
I've heard of some say that the Foster Mill closes in early adulthood

285
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:40,920
that you expand a a little more on that

286
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:48,540
sure um so what you say is correct if we're talking about physiology

287
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:53,640
so when we were babies we all had fontanels were wide open you know

288
00:47:53,640 --> 00:48:00,960
and as adults there's still you know a little a little opening in there but I

289
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:06,780
was referring to and when I started talking about this I said this is not these are not Buddhist teachings this is

290
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:14,700
different so you want you won't find anything about this in the Buddhist scriptures about the chakras and you know the

291
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:19,920
openings to the cosmic energy and to the Earth Energy um

292
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:28,260
but I've done a lot of uh Qigong practice and have been very influenced by the

293
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:35,040
idea of um you know if if you really do sit up straight and your head is not you know

294
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:40,560
flopping forward or you know off to some angle and you're centered

295
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:46,040
and your perineuma is open and your fontanelle is open

296
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:51,440
then the energy the cheat

297
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:58,140
which by the way is one of the seven factors of Awakening um viraga

298
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:06,000
uh no Viria excuse me Viria um that can flow easily

299
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:13,400
and when that energy starts to be unobstructed it has a very uh

300
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:19,560
calming and purifying effect so you know when I'm talking about the

301
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:26,460
fontanelle or the perineum I beg your forgiveness because I'm I'm Gil would

302
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:33,920
never talk about this stuff all right thank you thank you very much

303
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:43,140
eat Gill Oasis no Meg I don't want to do Chico you don't need to teach Qigong

304
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:49,640
during the Retreats I just want to keep things simple anyway [Laughter]

305
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:57,560
I appreciate it I've been thinking about seeing quite a bit and thank you for trying to then

306
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:08,520
did I miss what you said thank you uh I've been uh member of Tai

307
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:14,160
Chi studies so I've been thinking oh yeah great thank you quite a bit and she

308
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:19,859
kind of is almost one half of my an important

309
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:26,640
part of my practice so but it's seldom talked about in our meditation group so

310
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:34,200
thank you for tying it in and and you know when I was trying to introduce this this meditation way of

311
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:41,520
staying with a breath where we stay with the whole cycle of the breath as this uh sort of oval of energy

312
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:48,680
going up the back across the top of the head and down the front and then back through the perineum to the

313
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:56,099
that is um called the Grand circulation in Qigong

314
00:50:56,099 --> 00:51:01,319
and Qigong is the ancestor of all the martial arts

315
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:08,119
oh so the including Tai Chi

316
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:14,700
so the the she after it enters the donkey in and passes through the body it

317
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:19,859
comes out if onto now it returns back and comes back in the the donkey and

318
00:51:19,859 --> 00:51:25,140
again yeah and you can you can feel it coming I mean a venerable analia when he

319
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:30,480
does this sort of introduction to meditation he invites people to to you

320
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:37,380
know uh straighten his mind but feel it coming up the back

321
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:44,099
and then it's up to each of us to to to know where we're most comfortable

322
00:51:44,099 --> 00:51:49,880
uh concentrating our energy it might be in the Dan Tien the belly

323
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:55,760
and the advantage of the of that is that you can never overdo it

324
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:01,920
and for people like me it's off in the heart

325
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:07,260
but you know you have to be a little bit careful there because you know you can go overboard

326
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:15,359
and for a lot of people who don't practice you know everything's happening up here in the head and uh that's really

327
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:24,260
easy to overdo so you don't want to try to invite too much Chi into the head Center

328
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,880
okay after that

329
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:38,400
Megan I think we have one last question from um this came on YouTube uh if you

330
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:44,359
find it increasingly difficult to meditate should you continue to try

331
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:50,300
ah well

332
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:56,000
I mean it it depends um

333
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:03,780
I think I'm going to try to answer that for you this week by hopefully

334
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:12,180
giving you a few tastes of Freedom the freedom that comes when we stick with it for a long time

335
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:17,760
uh it does work and many people do get discouraged

336
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:22,980
because it's it's so difficult and you know honestly we are not programmed for

337
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:30,260
this our DNA is telling us oh watch out there's danger don't go there

338
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:36,960
it's you know it's there's a lot of uh there's a lot of

339
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:45,359
work to do to let go of that intuitive uh programming of being reactive

340
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:51,480
and clinging either to getting rid of something or getting more of something the clinging

341
00:53:51,480 --> 00:54:01,020
is what perpetuates our suffering but to be able to start letting go of that clinging

342
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:08,280
we need to practice and you know if you're if your problem is that is difficult for you physically

343
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:13,380
you can try other positions um

344
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:21,500
but I would gently encourage you to stick with it and see where it takes you

345
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:31,500
does that work for you and she said uh thank you on YouTube

346
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:38,579
okay alrighty okay Meg I think that's all the questions we have for today so

347
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:46,220
um yeah thank you very much for your teachings my pleasure thank you all for being
