1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:11,040
so i'll start over and say good day and warm greetings

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,359
and in this buddhist meditation practice that we do the mindfulness practice

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,760
it involves a really a great appreciation

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,720
of the present moment certainly appreciation of the potential here but also of the richness

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,840
of this experience now of course the past is important and

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,719
without any um connection to our history

7
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:49,120
our story our past life is pretty truncated and i see it now that i spent time at a

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,239
memory care center and seeing what's like for people who have no really long term and sometimes

9
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,399
short-term memories and and of course the future has its

10
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,080
role in anticipating the future imagining the future

11
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,680
you know is a huge important part of human life and has its important place

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,960
but compared to the importance of the past and the future they pale in significance to the present

13
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,320
it's almost as if the present moment is three-dimensional and the past and the

14
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,920
future is two-dimensional and to really enter into this three-dimensional four-dimensional

15
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,479
kind of rich area of the present moment and it's kind of like stepping into a

16
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:43,920
gate into a new garden into a new place and you really get into it fully

17
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,960
and and so to really appreciate the present

18
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,439
moment and to do so to have the skill and the ability and and the focus to do it for a period of

19
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:02,159
time like for these minutes we're going to do meditation and um and then

20
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,160
in some ways it makes the past in the future that when it's useful and to be involved in those

21
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,000
thinking about them it makes them richer actually and enhances it rather than detracts from it

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,760
to be really in the present moment really know how to be here and now

23
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,760
and of course you'll get pulled into thoughts about the past thoughts about

24
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,920
the future about fantasy reflections and um

25
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,040
and the art of it is to really really recognize

26
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:44,080
and that can't underscore how important the recognition is it's almost like waking up oh

27
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,160
wake up oh this is present moment phenomena i'm thinking about the past and the

28
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,760
present i'm thinking about the future in the present i'm fantasizing or

29
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,000
abstract ideas in the present it's like a wake up oh is that powerful

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,560
oh like you open your eyes oh that's what's happening and in that kind of the present moment

31
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,800
that's what's happening here then we're no longer swept into the future swept into the past or into

32
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:23,040
fantasy and this is where the whole um beginning of uh of waking up

33
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,680
occurs and in that clear recognition we find some of the qualities of

34
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:36,799
great awakening we find qualities of letting go not clinging not holding on

35
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,480
so perhaps in this sitting you can be we can begin to

36
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:49,760
begin but maybe you can gently without striving or being too agitated

37
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,599
about it give yourself a greater appreciation of

38
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,760
being here turns out you are here anyway in the present moment this is actually

39
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,599
where you are so join it really be in it

40
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:15,040
feel it sense it breathe with it moment after moment so taking a

41
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,680
alert relaxed posture

42
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,840
and gently close your eyes

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,759
and gently slowly take some

44
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:46,960
longer breaths in a long release with the exhale

45
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:57,520
long slow inhale and release

46
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:11,840
with the exhale

47
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:29,039
and letting your breathing return to normal and relaxing

48
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:35,440
more of your body on the exhale but a relaxation that is in your mind

49
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,680
maybe you think of it is relaxing into the present into the

50
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:53,840
present moment experience here in the body

51
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:22,400
and then letting your letting go of relaxing and

52
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,759
gathering yourself in the present moment with the breathing

53
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,280
with the breathing as the center of your universe

54
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,120
more so than your thinking mind

55
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,680
that kind of gathering of attention

56
00:06:49,680 --> 00:07:03,840
around the experience of breathing

57
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,800
and here

58
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:17,840
the breathing being a touchstone to the present moment

59
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,960
in the present moment a touchstone

60
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:35,520
to our direct experience our lived experience

61
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:44,479
the experience we have moment moment that is a manifestation of being alive

62
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,599
and here and now

63
00:07:53,199 --> 00:08:00,639
staying close to the present momentness of whatever comes into

64
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,919
awareness the present momentness of thinking about

65
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:13,840
the past and the future see it all as present moment

66
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,399
your breathing is always in the present moment

67
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:02,880
riding along with your breathing breathe with whatever else is happening

68
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,880
breathe with the mind thinking about the future about the past

69
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,480
breathe with your emotions

70
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,760
breathe with so that the present moment experience of breathing

71
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:29,839
keeps you in the present

72
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,960
are you recognizing

73
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:50,559
that you are in the present moment that your thoughts are present moment

74
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,840
experience

75
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,840
so

76
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,640
one of the wonderful things about the present moment

77
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,279
is that we all arrive there at the same

78
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:01,760
time we share this living

79
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:08,080
vital lived experience of here and now

80
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,120
if we're present for it

81
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:25,840
if we allow ourselves the opportunity to really be here

82
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:39,840
and as we come to the end of the sitting this deep allowing of the present moment

83
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:48,240
allowing ourselves to be there becomes a way of being present for the

84
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:55,679
people in our lives it's a way of being present for

85
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,720
others as well

86
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:10,640
and to be present for others without being caught up in the past or

87
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:17,120
thinking about the future what we want but to really be here to feel and sense

88
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:24,080
and know another person and to know ourselves

89
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,840
in the presence of another person

90
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:42,240
then there is an avenue for care for respect

91
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:51,039
for kindness friendliness for appreciation

92
00:27:51,600 --> 00:28:00,240
and for caring for each other may what we learn in meditation

93
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:06,480
about being present be applied to being present for

94
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,840
and with the people we encounter or the people we communicate

95
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:17,840
with in whatever way we're in touch

96
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:26,480
and may it be that whereas we're present that we offer the world our respect our

97
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,840
appreciation our kindness

98
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:40,080
so that our way of being with others

99
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:46,799
manifest or enact even in the smallest ways

100
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:54,159
the wish that others may be happy

101
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,840
that others may be peaceful

102
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,240
that others may be safe

103
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,840
that others may be free

104
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:20,080
may all be all beings

105
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:27,840
live in this present moment life free and happy

106
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,600
so today i want to tell a few stories from a little a storybook that i wrote called the

107
00:29:53,600 --> 00:30:01,279
monastery within and many of the stories have to do with the abbess of the monastery

108
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:08,240
and the first one i'll tell is that the abbess one day

109
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,360
called together all the new monastics of the monastery

110
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,880
um who'd been there for less than six months and maybe at a time when maybe they

111
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,720
start getting a little bit restless or a little bit wondering why they're there or maybe

112
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,720
even they've gotten used to the routine and maybe starting to get on board and remembering their

113
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:37,440
life before the monastery and you know its allures and pleasures

114
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:44,559
and she called them together and said pack your bags because i'm going to take you on a

115
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:51,120
pilgrimage to the holy sites of buddhism now these monastics knew about the holy

116
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:57,519
sites in india the place where the buddha was born where he was enlightened where he first taught and where he died

117
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,559
these are considered the most holy spirit places and for theravadin buddhists and

118
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:10,240
people do pilgrimages there and visit and so they oh great we're going on a trip so they packed their

119
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,000
bags ready for travel and and so they climbed onto the

120
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:23,760
monastery bus and off they went and first the abbess took them to a hospital

121
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:30,960
where they visited the sick and they were surprised by all the different kind of sicknesses that people were

122
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,000
struggling with there and some pretty severe they had a chance to go through the icu

123
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,679
and even the emergency room and it was kind of almost mind-boggling to

124
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:47,440
see the extent of injuries and illnesses

125
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:55,519
and then back on the bus and they went to a old age home and

126
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,720
they saw what for them most of the monastics were young what seemed like their ravages

127
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:07,840
old age of people who could no longer care for themselves and who some of them couldn't walk

128
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:15,039
anymore and some of them had all kinds of you know challenges and decreased

129
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:23,120
capacities of all kinds and and it was pretty impressive for this young monastics to see

130
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:30,399
and then they went back on the bus and the abbess took them to a hospice

131
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:37,519
where they saw people in the stages of dying and and some of them scared of dying

132
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:44,320
some of them kind of disconnected from the whole experience some of them not really present anymore

133
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:50,559
and semi-aware semi-conscious and all kinds of challenging ways of

134
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:56,480
dying and and some that already died and they spent time in next and one

135
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,640
next to a bed where a corpse was lying recently dead person

136
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:09,760
and then the men the the habits took them back to the monastery and the monastery had an infirmary where

137
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,880
there was one old sick monk

138
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:23,039
and i spent time with the sick monk and who seemed very present and had a certain kind of

139
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:29,039
seemed very tired in the illness he had but he seemed very calm and seemed like

140
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:34,640
he was kind of very engaged in his practice as buddhist practice that he spent years doing and

141
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:40,799
he was just continuing in bed and they could feel the sincerity and the intentness of

142
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:46,399
his engagement with his practice in his life and he seemed like he was just as content to

143
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:52,159
practice in bed as he was anywhere else and then they went to

144
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:58,559
um visit a very old nun and 96 years old and um

145
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:03,760
in a wheelchair and but there was a sparkle of uh

146
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:09,599
in the eyes of joy and that kind of kind of they looked closer and seemed like her eyes

147
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:17,200
were kind of marveling at the mystery of it all and that the light of it almost like she was surprised to be alive and delighted and

148
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:24,638
and had no fear and no regrets and just was there and content way and this deep contentment

149
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,520
was palpable for the new monastics

150
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:37,200
and then they went to um the um hospice of the monastery

151
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:45,440
and there in fact there was a monk who was uh who's dying and um and there was such

152
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:51,760
peace and it was clear the monk was in some pain but there was so much peace and

153
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:58,079
they entered into the room and it was so peaceful and so calm that everyone got quiet and

154
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:03,520
everyone felt like they just should bow deeply there was something reverent and profound

155
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:10,240
about the presence of this person who'd spent decades in the monastery practicing and the

156
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:16,800
level of peace and there was no iota of fear

157
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:23,839
and then the abbess took them back to the courtyard of the monastery and they sat down there and under a big tree

158
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:31,839
and the abba said now you have seen the sacred sites of buddhism

159
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,520
knowing these practice well

160
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:46,800
plunge into the monastic life plunge into the practice you've come to do and you

161
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:54,000
too will become the sacred sites of buddhism

162
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:01,920
so that's one story and so it's

163
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:08,400
kind of sacralizes something that's common in almost every

164
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,880
day sickness old age and that can both be a catalyst for

165
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:22,720
practicing for really getting to the bottom of what it means to be alive and get to the bottom of the just

166
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:30,640
the origins of our suffering that we have in this life that we live and can really also be the catalyst for

167
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,039
waking up and finding our freedom and our peace

168
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:42,880
the second story involves a monk who was known for

169
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:49,440
having a very deep seemingly deep peace and acceptance of life and and a deep

170
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,480
trust in just that in life itself and this monk one day

171
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:02,560
one time we went off to the edges of the monastery edges of the wilderness and the forest away from the others

172
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:08,079
where the monastery had a few meditation huts and monastics will go out there to meditate

173
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:14,079
for weeks at a time and so he went out there and as uh

174
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,640
and um and um

175
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:24,400
and there was a kind of a clearing in the woods with a kind of a grass meadow

176
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:30,320
in front of his meditation hut and one day he heard a deer crashing

177
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:35,359
through the woods and collapsing on the meadow in front of his

178
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:42,160
his hut and clearly the the deer was injured and and just kind

179
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:48,839
of collapsed there but soon behind the deer there came a

180
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:56,640
lion uh and then i said oh said the monk uh you know this this line

181
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:01,920
i guess is maybe that's why it's injured it's attacked by the line the lion's gonna eat it

182
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:09,040
and the lion came along and the deer seemed completely relaxed at ease and just kind of there accepting

183
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:14,079
its condition almost just there and could see the lion but was

184
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:20,800
not afraid was not trying to get up to run away and just just was seemingly just there

185
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:26,000
and the line came along and the lion proceeded for the next two days to stand

186
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,240
guard over the deer to keep it safe from other predators and whatever's there

187
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:38,560
so the deer could heal well enough to get up and to you know walk away and and

188
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:44,720
that was a pretty impressive thing to see and so the monastic said oh yeah this is this was

189
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:50,160
an affirmation this was like proof that my practice of deep acceptance of

190
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:57,440
everything and if i just accept life as it really is then um then the life will provide the dharma

191
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:04,160
will provide things will arise and and but the art of it is to really accept

192
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:10,640
so some weeks later there was a nun who was staying at a hut

193
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:16,079
not very far away and uh for some reason um the hut caught

194
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,200
on fire and um and the monk saw that and he said

195
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:28,640
oh look at that and first it was just a small little fire on the roof and then it got bigger and then he's amongst

196
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:34,640
it because he was into this acceptance things and just allowing things and letting things arise from

197
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:40,880
just uh watched and was a little curious but just watched what was happening and the fire got bigger and bigger and

198
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:46,160
then he saw the nun come out of the hut and try to get some water and tried to put the fire out

199
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:53,119
and she got a little injured in the process and but uh to no avail and the whole hut

200
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:59,359
burned to the ground and just with ashes when it's over it happened very quickly and so by time

201
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:06,079
that it was burned the it was only after it was burnt that the the monks nuns the abbess came to see

202
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:11,440
what was going on and and so the abbess came to the to the monk and said what happened here and he

203
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:17,200
explained what happened and and then the habit said why didn't you help

204
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:24,800
oh well i was really inspired i saw you know how profound it is to just accept

205
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:31,200
things and he saw what happened with the deer it explained what happened with the deer and the tiger

206
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:37,359
and the abbess got angry and said and basically said

207
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:42,160
it's time for you to leave the monastery and return to the world

208
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,960
sometimes it's important to be the deer and just accept your condition and

209
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:56,560
sometimes it's important to be the lion so you have to leave and only come back

210
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,160
when you know how to be the lion

211
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:09,359
so naive acceptance sometimes we have to accept the fact

212
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:16,160
that we are lions here to protect the world and care for the world with our strength and our power and our

213
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:22,240
abilities and that to have a policy of just acceptance and

214
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:29,760
allowing and just being at peace with everything is really uh to live a truncated life and denies a

215
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:35,839
whole part of who we are in a sense we're both the deer and the lion

216
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:44,240
and don't be afraid to be either one but to do have the wisdom to know

217
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:50,640
which one is appropriate at any time so

218
00:41:52,640 --> 00:42:00,880
may you discover your monastery within meaning your wisdom inside your place of practice

219
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,920
and and may that be a gift that you give to the world

220
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:13,359
thank you oh and then for next week right now i'm

221
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:19,359
thinking that uh in some ways i'll continue with this stories for next week

222
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:24,960
but a whole different genre of stories and that is to their stories from the buddha's life

223
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,720
that uh um you know our teaching stories or the context for the buddhist teachings

224
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:36,800
and so i thought maybe we'd pick some of these stories from the buddha's life that in

225
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:44,800
which appear some of the important teachings that he gives as a way of kind of combining the teachings and and the ancient kind of

226
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:55,920
stories from the canon so that's that's what i'm thinking now and i look forward to our time next week
