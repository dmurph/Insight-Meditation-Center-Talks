1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:09,840
okay folks yeah welcome I appreciate

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:17,160
um being together tonight so

3
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:27,039
um that's uh that's uh that's it I'm my you know my talks I plan out my

4
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:33,120
talks carefully do not plan out the guided

5
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,480
meditation at all but um we just see what happens yeah

6
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,399
and I I sort of presume you have something some way one at least one way

7
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:51,440
of practicing that feels native to your heart and

8
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,920
um it can just lapse into that uh if I

9
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,198
do anything bad

10
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:12,159
okay on that inspiring note let us uh let us dwell in the dama together

11
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:06,200
let us uh take good care the uh Karma of the

12
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,720
day or the the week or the

13
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,400
life it's all come to this

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,360
the heart made so

15
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,360
vast that everything has its place

16
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:19,200
there no more sorting out what we want and what we don't

17
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,760
want e

18
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,720
just putting down the melodrama of

19
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,000
self the gridlock of I

20
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,720
amness e

21
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,800
we pour our awareness

22
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,039
into the

23
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,680
senses e

24
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:35,960
just each moment uh becoming more

25
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:46,639
alive how alive can you be in this

26
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,560
moment e

27
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,879
maybe pick up your

28
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:05,159
breath is a way of refreshing aliveness in each moment

29
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,279
the more we hold on to the moment less alive we become

30
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,320
don't even look for

31
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,360
ground e

32
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,800
this moment doesn't exactly care about this

33
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:27,560
life we learn to tolerate at not caring

34
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,720
we come to trust that

35
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,560
taking good care of this

36
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:51,480
moment uh leads to a rich

37
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
life

38
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

39
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

40
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

41
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040

e e

44
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:40,759
poem wrote something like um that's what the minute said to the hour without me

45
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:43,480
you are

46
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:56,600
nothing that's what the the moment set to the

47
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
life

48
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

49
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
for

50
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

51
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,840
e e

52
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,520
to uh be fully Alive we have to put

53
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,039
in a sense put down our

54
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:15,158
life sticky melodrama of self and

55
00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:23,159
project this includes uh

56
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
aliveness

57
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,679
for e

58
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:59,480
don't hang on to all the familiar reference points

59
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,640
that's not what keeps us safe anyway

60
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:38,120
just come to trust that

61
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,320
um there's safety in the

62
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,158
falling the

63
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
groundlessness

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:43,799
all phenomena remind us of our

freedom

[Music]

77
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,080
e

78
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,480
okay good to sit with

79
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:59,799
you so a quote I saw this week from uh arent

80
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:05,480
aito uh as it is based upon dispassion and

81
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:11,080
cooling the realization of nibana cannot arise from getting heated up about the

82
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:17,799
host of Mara or from denying its existence comes from replacing the

83
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:23,559
compulsive movements of craving and ignorance with mindful energy and

84
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:29,720
insight niana is the experience of space in the Mind where

85
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:38,799
previously everything was densely stuck together in regenerative

86
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:43,880
congestion in that congestion a self is imagined that now and then longs to

87
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:49,000
escape from the oppressive host of inner voices feelings doubts and

88
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:55,639
desires so to one who practices Insight the idea that nibana is a selfish goal

89
00:30:55,639 --> 00:31:01,440
doesn't make sense because the Mira The Mirage of self

90
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,440
evaporates as the fires cool and the means of bringing this

91
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:13,519
about is the selfless eight-fold path as a practice this means

92
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:20,919
cultivating a purer and wiser response to faults and attachments than the Counterattack or

93
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:28,200
defense moods adopted by the self view rather than fight the host or get

94
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:34,679
away from them you have to liberate the host from Mara the embodiment of

95
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:40,760
suffering Mara have to liberate the host of Mara from all

96
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:49,919
delusion from all the hatred and fear and belief that binds them with self

97
00:31:53,399 --> 00:32:02,639
view so aent s of course is a u as a monk

98
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:11,720
uh but you get a sense of how profound the path turns

99
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:20,559
inwards and this is a a path that's really not about helping my life

100
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:30,440
along and the whole notion of my life is a symptom rather than the

101
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:38,919
centerpiece and the austerity and devotion of of that spirit

102
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:47,159
is um kind of startling and I see a quote like that

103
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:56,600
and I have to reflect okay do I do I want that I would say I have some some

104
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:01,720
ambivalence um sometimes I feel like I I kind of want

105
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:08,360
the middle path between nibana and some Sara

106
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:14,000
right and uh like that you know from the

107
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,279
confessions like give me Chastity but not yet Lord give me Chastity but not

108
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:26,600
yet maybe and I think we lay practitioners

109
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:31,840
are still in very early stages of translating the the

110
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:39,080
kind of radical gesture of relinquishment for Lay

111
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:47,639
life so the host of Mara that is an interesting

112
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:54,919
phrase the host of Mara me my project My Views ideas this

113
00:33:54,919 --> 00:34:03,120
is the host of Mara and Mara visits and our so-called life

114
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:10,599
becomes the host and in like biology a host you know

115
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:16,760
uh provides the kind of nourishment for the visiting

116
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:22,240
organism and uh how how do I provide

117
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:28,800
nourishment for Mara philosopher Mets singer says um

118
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:35,000
biological evolution is not something to be glorified it's unknowing driven by

119
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,320
chance and has no mercy it's a process that exploits and

120
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,638
sacrifices individuals for millions of years Mother Nature has talked to us

121
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:51,520
through our reward system and through the emotional layers

122
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:59,800
of our self model our phenomenal self model um we have to learn to take a

123
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:05,040
critical stance towards this process to view our experience as a

124
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:11,560
direct result of it we have to stop glorifying our own

125
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:18,200
neurophenomenological status quo face the facts and find the courage to think

126
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,359
about Alternatives in a rational

127
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:30,359
way so much of my life you know is

128
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:35,960
essentially the ruthlessness of my evolutionary

129
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:43,480
conditioning just kind of bullying me mother nature speaking through my reward

130
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:50,838
system speaking through sakya DTI the self

131
00:35:53,520 --> 00:36:00,119
model denying Mara is one of Mara's tricks you

132
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:05,680
know so we practice radical openness to the truth of this

133
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:12,079
moment failing to listen to Mara means that we will obey

134
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:19,040
Mara we have to see and hear Mara respectfully

135
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:26,599
respectfully for not to host them

136
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:34,720
generative congestion that's that's like the opposite of you know you

137
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:41,680
just cramped cramped the opposite of space gridlock you know and congestion

138
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:49,800
is a metaphor but it's also not in a way like suffering often seems to involve um you

139
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:56,640
know energy and by that I mean like you you know very subtle layers of feeling

140
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:03,480
experience um involves energy not flowing somehow

141
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:08,680
contracted whirl pools like you know

142
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:15,160
hyperintensities the whirl pools where things feel stuck

143
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:22,839
regenerative congestion compulsivity always feels dense you know like if we were like

144
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:31,280
Imaging our spiritual body or something like that compulsivity would be like uh

145
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,720
would show up on the image you know kind of

146
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:44,280
density and compulsivity and

147
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:49,400
ignorance aito says ignorance we we

148
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:56,359
forget we forget the dhma we forget our wisdom and suffering in a in an

149
00:37:56,359 --> 00:38:02,240
important sense is a kind of forgetting and it may be worthwhile to

150
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:09,800
ask what do you forget uh when you

151
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:19,400
suffer that word nibana gets used different in different different ways in

152
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:29,160
different Moments by different Traditions different teachers um and uh here uh uh as as the

153
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:37,599
experience of space in the mind and how how vast can the mind be

154
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:43,760
how empty and open unfixed you

155
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:53,480
know and um the movement in you know towards more well-being in this life is

156
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:59,359
um I don't think it can be fully characterized as a move from contraction

157
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:04,799
to spaciousness but that captures a lot of the heart's

158
00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:10,040
movement and suffering and space tend to

159
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:16,079
be inversely correlated you know suffering is a kind of

160
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,160
claustrophobia the vastness um is

161
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,960
uded and so dispassion and cooling aan

162
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,319
says so much of suffering clinging involves a

163
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:38,880
certain kind of you know psychological terms like

164
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:45,680
hyperarousal maybe maybe all of craving is a kind of hyper arousal a kind of

165
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:53,520
heat right the the eyes are burning the ears are burning everything's

166
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:59,880
burning heat the Heat of

167
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:07,400
clinging and Tranquility is not numbness Tranquility is not numbness it's alive

168
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:17,400
it's the aliveness that I was alluding to in the sit but without the kind of whirlpools that capture the

169
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:29,880
attention I says a lot in that paragraph So the ego the ego sense of of um self

170
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:37,920
it's almost the ego is almost endlessly Innovative crystallizing around anything

171
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:43,240
like a kind of amoeba including spiritual practice you

172
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:49,760
know and the word nibbana or Enlightenment is sort of catnip for the

173
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:55,880
ego but this is not a story about the self getting

174
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:04,880
better that's just more congestion and the idea that freedom

175
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:12,119
freedom is a selfish goal doesn't make sense The Mirage of self evaporates as the fire is

176
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:17,599
cool the whole notion of the self as

177
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:25,240
kind of like possessing something some attainment that it it it possesses that

178
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:31,599
becomes kind of um just silly absurd

179
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:37,680
um vudi Maga s today is like I am not

180
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:42,440
anything belonging to anyone

181
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:53,800
anywhere and we could say nothing could ever belong to Freedom or own

182
00:41:54,599 --> 00:42:00,520
freedom freedom is so often kind of envisioned as adding something like a

183
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:06,359
kind of autant of the self but it's

184
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:11,039
subtraction a profound state of non-

185
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:19,079
territoriality and so liberating um from

186
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:29,119
all the hatred and fear and belief that that binds binds them with self View

187
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,720
um the sense of self sometimes I have this image of the sense of

188
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:44,119
self as like uh as like a hologram you know like uh the creation of

189
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:49,920
um you know some figure by like arranging light in a particular way and

190
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:59,119
the lights creating the impression of self are made you know of of of you know

191
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:05,520
fear clinging and

192
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:11,599
so uh the dissolution of self if it's

193
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:16,280
genuine can only lead us to Care

194
00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:24,400
More and when the self system is no longer the sight of endless

195
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:31,960
curation what's left is the rest of life very

196
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:40,359
open and the self re arises but we

197
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:48,440
know a little more deeply how innocent it

198
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:59,880
is it's not a host for Mara in question the same

199

way so I offer this for your consideration and uh please pick up

200
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,760
