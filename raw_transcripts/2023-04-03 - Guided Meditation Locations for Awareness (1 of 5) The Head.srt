00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:08,700
say hello everyone and warm greetings from Redwood City

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,059
from the inside Meditation Center I've been away for a week and it's nice

3
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:21,240
to be back and nice to be back here in this early morning somewhat early

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:26,480
morning way of starting the day

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,740
so um thank you for being here

6
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,540
so um when I first came to Buddhism I studied

7
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:47,520
Zen when I was instructed to sit in meditation

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,920
one of the peculiar instructions that I didn't understand at that time

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:59,879
was to put myself in the meditation posture and

10
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:09,299
and be with the breathing and to put my attention in my hands

11
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:15,000
the hands were together in a kind of mudra kind of one hand Atop The Other in front of my belly

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,259
and instead of putting my my attention or my mind in my hands

13
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:29,040
and sometimes in Zen had told me to put my mind in my belly in the Hara in

14
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,799
Japanese the spot about two inches below the belly button maybe about an inch in

15
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,500
from the skin so kind of in a similar place the hands were kind of right in front of that

16
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,259
place and this idea of putting my mind there it was a little bit different than

17
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:53,520
putting the attention there maybe and uh but over the years I've learned

18
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:03,840
that we have many capacities for perception awareness sensing knowing

19
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,340
and that uh it's a little bit of choice of the mind

20
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:15,480
not necessarily your choice if you're not conscious of it of where the where

21
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:22,860
where we identify as the locus the center of our attention where is attention you

22
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:29,819
know up in the head and are we looking down on the breathing or the attention in the breath is it par

23
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:35,640
is awareness part and parcel of the experience of breathing not separate from it

24
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:42,300
is the awareness um somehow disembodied kind of above and

25
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:49,980
behind us watching the whole experience is it in our hands is it in our belly

26
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:55,760
is it in the Torso and in fact it's a little bit optional

27
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,900
where we feel the locus the center of gravity of where of awareness of

28
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,500
attention where where we um

29
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,800
we identify in a sense the center of attention and that itself is sometimes what we

30
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:20,940
follow along with where we identify ourselves Me Myself and I so it's a little bit optional we can

31
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:26,220
move around and kind of let different things be the center because it's a

32
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,680
little bit of a choice of the mind to to kind of prioritize rest in that

33
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,620
particular part of the body for where awareness is aware

34
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:43,080
so I don't know if this makes sense to you it didn't make sense to me when I first started sitting but I think it's a

35
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,120
very helpful idea and and we'll talk about more more about this later

36
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,840
so for now to assume a meditation posture

37
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,720
and gently close your eyes

38
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:15,239
and spend the first minute or so of your meditation relaxing your body as much as you can

39
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:24,620
while letting the body be have a certain quality of alertness

40
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,379
being alert

41
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,780
relaxing in the shoulders

42
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:50,520
bring your attention to your arms and your elbows and your hands

43
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:56,540
can you move or reposition them so they're more relaxed

44
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:10,220
so the elbows are not pressed in towards the body but are hanging loosely

45
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:21,660
and to relax in the belly

46
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,039
a soft belly

47
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:56,120
and when you're and then to kind of sit quietly for a few moments

48
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,979
with the rhythm of breathing

49
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:12,800
as you exhale to relax a thinking mind

50
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,320
quiet you're thinking

51
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:58,819
and then for a few minutes

52
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:08,660
heighten your awareness of the body's experience or breathing

53
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:14,660
really let your awareness

54
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,580
kind of like it dials in

55
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,819
tunes into the breathing more fully

56
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:24,120
and as you're aware of your breathing where's the place from which you are

57
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,479
aware

58
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:38,300
is it in the head if it is in the head where

59
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:46,219
around the eyes behind the forehead

60
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:54,899
between the ears is it the upper hip half of the head or

61
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:58,100
the lower half of the head

62
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:13,440
and if we locate a place just a minute here so to where else

63
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:21,500
might it be might it be somewhere in the neck in the voice box

64
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:37,940
right the place from which you know and are aware is in the chest maybe in the heart

65
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,980
the solar plexus area

66
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,800
is the location for awareness of breathing

67
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,540
in the breathing itself

68
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:23,899
there's no sense of knowing or being aware in some other place than the breathing

69
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:53,180
is the place of awareness might it be in the belly

70
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:16,160
in whatever place if there is a place where is the place from which you're aware

71
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:23,600
what does that place feel like were the sensations

72
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,079
that are present there

73
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:37,519
may be a Sensations associated with being aware

74
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,500
being aware of the place from which you're aware

75
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:41,880
maybe breathing with that place

76
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:49,440
breathing through it having the experience of breathing

77
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,220
be received into the location

78
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,899
from which where you're aware

79
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:12,860
wherever your location is from which you're aware

80
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:23,179
imagine that it's an easy chair that you can relax back into

81
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:29,600
settling back into that soft receptive chair

82
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,399
so that your awareness

83
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:42,059
relaxes softens

84
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:33,919
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

85
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:43,039
to switch the location from which where you're aware

86
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:48,720
to your heart as if there's a chair an easy chair in

87
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:55,260
your heart and you can settle into that chair

88
00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:00,799
that the heart is a place to relax it's home

89
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,880
safe

90
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:14,360
and to imagine that you look out upon the world from the heart

91
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:20,580
you look out upon the world from a place of safety in

92
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:28,140
nothing's required of you not for the time being nothing is

93
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:35,820
challenging you or dangerous for you the heart is at ease

94
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,860
looking out upon the world

95
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:46,700
with eyes of kindness and care

96
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,240
and if it

97
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:04,380
you if you find that there is some kindness some care some love compassion

98
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:10,279
in your heart that you can spread across the globe

99
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:14,419
spread wide and far

100
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:22,500
may all beings be happy

101
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:28,200
may all beings be safe

102
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:35,220
may all beings be peaceful

103
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:40,039
may all beings be free

104
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:47,460
and they the way in which we look upon others and on the world

105
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:56,720
may they may that gaze that look be soft kind and compassionate

106
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:07,020
may we spread our kindness in the way in which we gaze upon the

107
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,140
world

108
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:23,868
[Music]

109
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:33,559
[Music]

110
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:38,159
yeah so warm greetings on this Monday morning

111
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,640
as we begin another week of this 7 A.M

112
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:51,659
Community practicing together and a new week of teachings

113
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:57,360
in my mind in my heart the teachings for today are going to

114
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:03,720
um kind of continue from two weeks ago when I talked about compassion

115
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:09,120
the different elements of compassion and I want to have I have more and I

116
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:15,539
want to teach about compassion but there's an interlude for this week because the medium

117
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:21,600
for compassion is our awareness our attention to be

118
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:30,799
aware of the suffering of others Beware of the suffering of oneself is the medium is the the means by which

119
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:37,620
compassion can arise and so I want to spend this these five

120
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:43,140
days looking at different ways to be aware

121
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:50,100
because if we have a greater repertoire of how to be aware then when we're present with suffering

122
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:55,200
our own Suffering The Suffering of others we have different options about

123
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:02,880
how to be aware of it how to connect to it how to know it if we only have one option of how to be

124
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,580
aware and we never thought about those different ways of being aware

125
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:16,679
then it's very easy to sink into suffering to somehow be entangled with

126
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:21,960
it or it's easy to be impacted impacted and

127
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:27,539
impacted by it in ways that are even detrimental they're not helpful

128
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:34,200
for this kind of sweetness and Clarity of compassion itself

129
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:42,299
so to learn that there are different ways of using awareness and that we can shift modes of awareness

130
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:49,460
at different times is very helpful so if one mode of being with suffering

131
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:54,840
is not really working for you you find yourself sinking into it or

132
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:01,080
excess will be impacted by it someone else's suffering becomes your own suffering in a way that actually is

133
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:08,600
quite painful to feel and look overwhelming then you might want to question the the

134
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:15,059
way in which you're aware of that suffering and see if you if you have a repertoire of different ways of being

135
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:21,600
aware you can switch it to another way and um

136
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:28,320
and so what I like to do for this week is to maybe discuss five different ways

137
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:35,159
of being aware and a lot of this has to do with locations from which we're aware

138
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:41,340
um and um so we know we'll go find our way through it this week

139
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:47,580
and but this first this principle that I just said that when any situation is

140
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:52,860
difficult for us I've been trying to find our way with the situation

141
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:59,700
one of the variables that we can consider is the way in which you're

142
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:04,860
aware of this challenge and often that's not questioned often we

143
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:11,638
the challenges are we absorb the challenge and absorbed in the difficulty and we're kind of kind of absorbed kind

144
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:16,679
of entangled or caught in it or concerned with it so strongly that we

145
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:24,419
don't step back and say well is the way that I'm concerned the way that I'm attending to it is that the best choice

146
00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:30,358
is there other ways of attending to it that might be more useful at this time

147
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:35,940
just that question itself changes the ecosystem it's like having

148
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:42,839
an ecosystem and you introduce a new element to it then the whole thing morphs and changes accordingly

149
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:48,020
so to introduce this question is there another way of being aware of this challenge

150
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:55,200
is Beginnings it's the beginning of creating a new ecosystem and one that's probably is

151
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:01,260
much more going to be much more useful and healthy and for one half for because when you

152
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:09,420
ask the question is there a different way now to be aware of this just that is beginning to loosen the

153
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:16,560
attachments the clinging that grasping that pushing the tightening contraction around the challenge you know no I got

154
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:23,099
to take care of this and that gives space then to be able to kind of see it more clearly and relax a

155
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:28,560
little bit around it so um

156
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:34,260
one of the ways um that uh some you know and and this is

157
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:41,579
very different for different people how they're aware where they're aware from the first mode of of how they're present

158
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:47,940
with awareness so um so as you hear these teachings this week

159
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:53,640
um just be aware that uh uh it's not like um

160
00:35:53,640 --> 00:36:00,119
your way is wrong but rather to discover what your way is

161
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:07,079
and then to have that learn the capacity to fluidly relaxedly change that mode

162
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:12,540
when it's useful to do so so

163
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:19,079
um so for today I just want to talk about being aware from the head

164
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:24,839
there are some people who live from the neck up and everything is taking you

165
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:30,240
know the center of locus the center of gravity the center of everything is in

166
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:36,000
their head and um and usually that means that they

167
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:43,579
spend a lot of time thinking there's a lot of thoughts and ideas and that the way that they're aware is

168
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:50,040
or the place that they're where from is the thinking itself

169
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:57,960
so maybe it doesn't have exactly a location that thoughts or maybe they do but uh it's so strong the thinking that

170
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:04,320
that's that's where awareness is kind of that's what you know that's where we think awareness is that's who we think

171
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:10,440
we are I think therefore I am and identification with thoughts are so

172
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:16,800
strong that for many of us we are our thoughts

173
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:24,900
and so to be aware through the lens of thinking from the lens of of um of thought or the

174
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:31,380
place in which thinking happens is almost like saying I am that place

175
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:36,720
where thinking is happening that's the locus the center the the Nexus of who I

176
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:43,320
am and um and so to be aware that oh mostly my awareness is in my head

177
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:49,740
and might not be through thinking for some people it's through the medium of their eyes and we're not the eyes

178
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:58,800
literally but the mind's eye but somehow they kind of live close to their physical eyes the very I I focused uh

179
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,140
people and so not necessarily thinking Focus but I focused so even with the

180
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:10,500
eyes closed their physical eyes are engaged like their look almost like they're looking at the breathing with

181
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:18,240
her eyes and that looking that the eye Century kind of way of being a attention that's

182
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:26,099
the place in which we're aware and um and um

183
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:34,020
and some people where they're aware from is um is maybe related to thinking is the

184
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:39,480
place where the voice is projected or the speaker system where

185
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:45,960
the speaker is for the voice of the mouth is for The Voice or where the projector is for the images

186
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:53,040
that we're seeing maybe almost like a screen in front of us or we're aware through through those

187
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:59,760
images on the screen and that's part and parcel of experiencing being aware is having

188
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:06,000
images that kind of come up and somehow inform us what's happening or relate to

189
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,240
what's happening or something and so the awareness is partly rooted in

190
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:18,240
these images in The Voice in the seeing

191
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:24,720
sometimes there's tension in the head someplace and and that tension is uh the

192
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:31,859
place where we kind of would identify with that's who where I am that's the locus of me or that's the locus from

193
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:38,339
which I'm aware it's not wrong to be aware from the head

194
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:46,500
often in our Buddhist circles it's like somehow they're not supposed to do that or something not wrong it's one mode of

195
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:51,839
being aware one place from which to be aware and all these places have a time and

196
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:58,980
season there's no one way which is the wrong way one but if one way is the only way we

197
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:04,440
have then we're quite Limited so first we want to become aware of you

198
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,839
know how are we aware and if you're aware if your center of awareness the

199
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:15,859
place you're aware from if um is in your head then

200
00:40:15,859 --> 00:40:22,560
see if you can find ways to soften that place like imagine that you feel the

201
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:29,220
place where you're aware from it might be the place where you're thinking from or you're seeing from

202
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:34,440
and see if you can kind of like settle back into it like it's in a nice relaxed

203
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:41,160
easy chair and then you might be able to benefit more from that way of being aware than

204
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:47,760
if you're you know tense in that kind of spot if being aware from the head is not what

205
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:54,680
you do try it anyway see if you can

206
00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:00,480
and partly partly what's been a can be beneficial being aware from the head is

207
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:06,240
that sometimes it does remove us from our experience it kind of pulls us

208
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,760
away like say there's a emotional pain in the sometimes in the Torso by being

209
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:17,880
aware in the head there's a kind of distance from it and some people will automatically

210
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:25,740
assume distance is wrong but distance actually is one of the modes of being aware which has its benefits and I'll

211
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:32,460
talk more about that tomorrow but uh for now I just want to see see if

212
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:39,240
you can a little bit uh get to know uh your mode of awareness where you're

213
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:46,800
aware from and if there is no place is it in your little toe

214
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,380
is it in your heel is it near Pinky

215
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:58,560
are you mostly aware you know as it turns out if you ask those questions it actually begins coming in closer it's

216
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:04,619
yes it's in the whole torso and then is it if it's a whole torso is

217
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:10,980
it uh in your back is it uh by your tailbone or is it in

218
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:17,220
the back of your neck some people when you ask those questions say oh no it's mostly in the front of the Torso

219
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:22,920
people who very quickly will say how much there's no place location for me to be aware

220
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:30,359
if they start coming from the from the most wide out and starts working their way in they

221
00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:36,180
kind of uh by a process of elimination find that the oh I'm mostly aware in the

222
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:41,579
chest in the middle of the chest or mostly your way here this is a location

223
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:51,500
and when you find that location or close to it relax the attention wherever it might be

224
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:57,660
so um so this will be a beginning and um I'm

225
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:03,060
very aware that this might be seem a little esoteric for some of you so if

226
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:08,460
that's the case this this week of awareness and where it's located I ask

227
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:15,900
your patients with it and um and uh and I don't think it'll be harmful and

228
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:21,720
and hopefully they'll you'll benefit a little bit from it that when we turn our

229
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:27,900
attention to compassion again that you'll see the Richer options of how to

230
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:33,420
be compassionate so thank you and I look forward to being

231
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,838
here tomorrow
