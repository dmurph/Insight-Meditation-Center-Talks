1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:07,359
so continuing with this series on

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:16,198
Samar so one of the important approaches to meditation has a

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:24,720
lot to do with how you approach meditation how you approach how

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,000
you utilize your capacity for attention for

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,480
for awareness and for

6
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:42,640
mindfulness for knowing what's happening in the present moment for feeling what is happening in

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:49,640
the moment for observing what's happening in the moment and I use all these words not

8
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,199
to confuse you with too much to do but for you to appreciate that we have these

9
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:02,440
different attentional capacities and different people are oriented towards different

10
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:10,520
ones and they're all good they're all useful for helping us be here in the

11
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,880
present moment but how we engage it is

12
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,040
important the idea is not to engage it with

13
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,520
strain not to engage it with uh

14
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:33,280
uh pushing or force

15
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,960
or expectation or strong desire for something to happen or not to be

16
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:48,000
there there's a a lightess of being and if we if you're willing to go

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,479
along with kind of this almost a metaphor that our ability to be

18
00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:02,640
aware has no weight the ability to have to hear a

19
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,759
sound the hearing has no weight to see with your eyes the seeing

20
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:16,480
has no weight the cognitive capacity to Simply know

21
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,560
and recognize what's happening has no weight some of it can occur

22
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:30,040
without even any intention any wanting to do it

23
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:36,519
so much of the attention we have that's operating through the day happens without

24
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:42,720
self-referencing without trying and there's plenty of trying to

25
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,239
be aware strain there's a straining of the eyes to stare at

26
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:58,159
something there straining to hear straining to understand straining to be

27
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:05,440
mindful and uh um there can be a lot of willpower involved or

28
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,760
self and the idea is to feel your way into

29
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:16,319
Where Your Capacity your way of being

30
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:24,599
aware can return to where it has no weight where it's almost like the weight

31
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:30,400
of air or the weight of a butterfly that lands on

32
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:39,400
a flower where you almost are not doing

33
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,480
it but rather you're allowing

34
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,080
it almost like you're holding your hand open so the butterfly can

35
00:03:52,319 --> 00:04:01,079
land or you're pulling the curtains so that your eyes can see what's outside

36
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:08,079
without needing to look so this simple light way of being

37
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:16,239
aware and then but there is a kind of deliberateness there is a kind of a

38
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:23,680
devotion maybe for some people it could be called play for some people it could be called

39
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,240
a loving commitment for some people maybe it's a

40
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:35,840
a preference and I like to call it an orientation we Orient

41
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:43,600
ourselves to something which is the primary home for

42
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:50,760
awareness maybe we can call it the nest if awareness is a very light

43
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:56,960
[Music] bird that can float on the

44
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:04,479
updrafts the bird keeps returning to its nest and maybe at night gets cozy there

45
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,479
doesn't leave and so breathing can be that Nest

46
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:16,000
The Body Sensations of breathing may be in the resting place

47
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,759
the nesting Place deep inside so there's a preference to stay there and so

48
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,759
exactly how much how that how to sustain that

49
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:37,039
through time without any tension is the art but there's a

50
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:44,160
sustaining entering into the nest staying there so for this meditation I'd like to

51
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:51,680
propose this idea of applied and sustained attention vaka and

52
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,160
vichara be used in the cycle of

53
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:06,840
breathing that when the in inhale begins you you connect apply you the

54
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:14,120
butterfly lands on the flower of breathing or you settle into the

55
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:20,360
nest of bre of the body sensation of breathing in the resting spot the

56
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:27,960
grounding spot where it's all

57
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:34,639
rooted and then stay lightly

58
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:42,759
softly ride the inhale stay all the way through the

59
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:47,080
exhale sustain without

60
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,599
tension without pressure but really stay there Orient

61
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:01,520
yourself organize yourself to be right

62
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:08,080
there there's a settle settling and then do it

63
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:14,199
again with the inhale begin and Ride The

64
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:23,520
Wave in next inhale connect and be maybe like

65
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,560
a like a butterfly

66
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:40,199
that's Gathering the the nectar from the [Music]

67
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:46,199
flower throughout the breath and then it goes to the next flower for the next

68
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:54,159
beginning of the inhale so to assume a meditation

69
00:07:54,159 --> 00:08:01,560
posture and gently closing your

70
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:10,120
eyes maybe so the eyelids are soft and relax floating over

71
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:17,159
the curve of the eyes and the eyeballs are resting in

72
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:22,840
their sockets maybe imagining your eyes are

73
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:30,840
looking backwards and down not not looking out words at

74
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,560
all the eyes take a rest from

75
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,919
looking and no matter

76
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:53,920
how much weight you feel in your body is there a place where the you feel

77
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,079
lightness in your body

78
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,279
maybe the lightness of your

79
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:18,600
fingers maybe some lightness somewhere in the Torso

80
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:31,519
softness then as you exhale to relax into the the base of

81
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,680
your breathing

82
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,880
body maybe softening your belly as you do

83
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:57,839
so as you exhale without trying a lot just almost

84
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:05,240
like you're allowing it to happen and as you exhale let there be a softening through

85
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:13,399
your body not an ambitious

86
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:19,000
relaxing just a almost like letting the body

87
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:28,320
soften together with any tension and holding there might be it's all okay

88
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:50,639
with the exhale maybe a wave of calmness through the mind and

89
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:04,000
body a wave of calmness through whatever is not come it's

90
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:29,680
okay and then at the end of the exhale maybe deep in the Torso wherever

91
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,399
You' come to the grounding place the settling place of

92
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:42,519
breathing at the end of the exhale pause for half a

93
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:50,519
moment to allow room for relaxing

94
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,720
settling as settling around around the end of the

95
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,880
exhale and then with the lightest possible

96
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:34,079
way connect to the inhale as it

97
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,279
begins and sustain the

98
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:48,079
attention continuously through the full

99
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:55,639
inhale and riding the exhale all the way to the end

100
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,920
we're connecting and sustaining the

101
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,440
attention it's not so much happening in the control

102
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:32,920
tower but it's a very very nature

103
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:46,240
very working of the body breathing

104
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:56,600
itself breathing feeling itself the breathing body

105
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,240
experiencing the lightness of

106
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:12,279
attention breathing in and breathing

107
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
out

108
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

109
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

110
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

111
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,920
for for

112
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:17,839
and as you feel the inhales and exhales as you know

113
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:24,438
it as you sustain attention if there's

114
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:30,480
any Pleasant Sensations pleasure

115
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:37,960
in the breathing in the sensations of breathing in and breathing

116
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:43,360
out let that be the nectar of

117
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:53,640
sweetness that you feel and sense that you take

118
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
in

119
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

120
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

121
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

122
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,679
e e

123
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:03,320
the weight of a awareness

124
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,799
resting on the sensations of

125
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,120
breathing and as you

126
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,400
exhale letting the thinking mind become

127
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,000
quieter so there's space in the

128
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:41,960
mind to share with a pleasure of

129
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
breathing

130
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

131
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

132
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

133
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

134
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
for

135
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

136
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
for

137
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
for

138
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,278
e e

139
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,520
and then as we come to the end of this

140
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:20,720
sitting to appreciate or

141
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:28,600
feel whatever way awareness attention

142
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:35,720
has no weight has no strain in

143
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:44,679
it a sound arises and it's no effort to hear

144
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,640
it some Sensations arise in the body and there's no

145
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,480
effort for it to be known

146
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:05,039
some thoughts arise and maybe it's effortless to know

147
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:14,840
the thought is there there might be added strain or

148
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:21,320
reaction but in the beginning it's just effortless

149
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:26,519
light and to stay in the lightess of

150
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:32,080
awareness to stay stay close to the lightess of

151
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:43,799
being and to then open your awareness open your

152
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:51,399
imagination to the world that you'll encounter after the

153
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:57,320
meditation maybe locally the room you're in the building you're in the

154
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,039
neighborhood

155
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:10,200
and to understand that it's a gift you give to the world around

156
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:18,879
you the gift of the lightness of your being the lightness of

157
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:27,640
awareness that knows what's happening without reactivity without

158
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:35,360
tension without an automatic call to

159
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:41,679
action giving room to All

160
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:50,919
Things allowing each person the space to be who they

161
00:29:53,840 --> 00:30:00,159
are so perhaps your response to the world can

162
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,320
come from a deeper

163
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,279
place where love

164
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:18,080
kindness can arise with the same lightness as a lightness of

165
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:26,519
awareness may we enter the world

166
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:35,440
offering it the gift of a light awareness a light

167
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:43,919
kindness the lightness of Good Will May all beings be

168
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:49,360
happy may all beings be

169
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,799
safe may all beings be

170
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:59,919

[Music]

175
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:44,519
thank

176
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,880
you e

177
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:58,519
so hello and welcome to this now 30 second talk on samadi

178
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:04,120
and um this week the orientation is a little

179
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:12,000
bit of a review and part of the way of presenting this is that uh

180
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,120
when you're practicing meditation especially samade but

181
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:24,039
anything it's really valuable to always think of yourself as starting over as a

182
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:30,120
beginner don't come with a lot of expectations that you know what to do you know how to meditate and you're

183
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:39,039
going to just sit down and do your thing uh it better not come with any expectations of and maybe realize that

184
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:45,919
we're often just beginning again and that we're all beginners and sometimes uh it's the

185
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,039
beginning steps of meditation that we have to repeat over and over again and

186
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:57,799
it's invaluable to do that uh we're actually transforming ourselves changing

187
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:04,200
ourselves in the background by just starting over and over again it's like getting a massage something's being

188
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:10,878
worked and relaxing and opening and uh and learn to be

189
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:16,000
gracious learning to be relaxed and and uh willing to be a beginner over and

190
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,440
over again is how uh we can be an experienced

191
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:28,679
beginner and one of the little secrets of an experienced beginner is that that

192
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:36,720
uh is expressed in this little saying that the fastest way from a to be

193
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:42,440
is to be fully at a and um and so just to really be

194
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,919
willing to be here with how you are is away and it turns out that we're not

195
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:53,040
going anywhere in meditation we're it just we're going from a to

196
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,320
a um but we're really going almost like we're going deeper into a

197
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:07,240
we're just really being here and um and um and so we start where we are

198
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:13,760
and allow that deeper settling to happen so part of very important part

199
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,920
of the kind of beginning of really starting to enter into the world of

200
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,160
somebody is that the attention starts to be

201
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:31,839
continuous in the present moment and with with some kind of a place that it's

202
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:41,040
the nest it's the home base it's the primary place where we really stay

203
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:47,119
connected and uh classically that's the breathing there can be other objects um

204
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:52,160
practicing loving kindness and the feelings of love that come up can be

205
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:59,680
another alternative one and um but with breathing the idea is is to um to have a

206
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:05,599
uh to be able to sustain attention over time and to expect you can't really just

207
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:11,240
kind of lock in um you know as we start from the beginning the idea is that

208
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:18,200
there's a gentleness where we persist we sustain the attention there and

209
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:23,359
um and then to um um and part of that is

210
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:28,800
this massage this rhythm of connect Ing

211
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:36,680
and sustaining connecting and sustaining and um the

212
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:43,000
um and uh maybe it's like a bird that maybe only has to flap its Lings Wings

213
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:53,839
once to catch the updraft and it Soares and then does it again and Soares um maybe it's like a um a

214
00:36:53,839 --> 00:37:00,800
u you know a a a a bee that lands in a flower and it just

215
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,280
walks around looking for where the nectar is kind of there's this the

216
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:13,079
classic metaphor is that of taking a cloth to polish a bowl and you connect

217
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:19,040
the cloth to the bowl and then you gently kind of there rubbing it and then you do it again in different

218
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:25,240
part and um so this sustaining this connecting and

219
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:30,440
sustaining and I've offered you in that meditation a lot of different metaphors

220
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:36,119
for that I apologize if the metaphors are too many uh but the idea hopefully

221
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:41,920
is that one of those will work well for you and uh sometimes a metaphor in

222
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:48,960
imagination um helps the imagination helps us be connected more to the practice the Buddha used a lot of

223
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,880
metaphors um to help that uh the mind kind of really feel or sense how to

224
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:01,720
enter into the world of meditation and um and then the idea is to

225
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:07,280
sustain and uh and I suggested in the meditation that uh connecting with the

226
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,880
beginning of the inhale and then sustaining it through the whole cycle of breathing in and breathing

227
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,920
out sometimes that's too long sometimes what works better is to connect to the

228
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:23,560
inhale ride it really stay there sustaining the attention however long it

229
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:30,880
is the inhale and then um and then do it again connecting to the

230
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:39,040
beginning of the exhale and riding all that all the way out uh one way that uh an interesting

231
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:46,960
way to uh help this sustaining and connecting connecting and sustaining with the breathing is um and you have to

232
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:53,720
do this very gingerly very carefully gently um just enough not too much maybe

233
00:38:53,720 --> 00:39:01,400
slightly you know less than and that is to um the end of the

234
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:08,400
exhale let there be a a little pause that allows the exhale to maybe relax

235
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,760
further or the whole body to relax into the experience and because you're

236
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:20,200
pausing at the end of the exhale it there's a little bit in the body that gets interested like where is the next

237
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:25,880
inhale I should be breathing but not with any distress just a gentle kind of

238
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:31,079
oh I'm waking up almost okay relax it the pause allows to

239
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:36,119
something to relax to let go that maybe it wouldn't do that if we

240
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:41,359
go immediately to the inhale and then um also you could do

241
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:47,800
that sometimes at the uh at the end of the inhale is just pause and let there

242
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:53,440
be a relaxing and opening and then release into the

243
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:59,119
exhale and uh so this is like the massage this is kind of the working need

244
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:07,839
the classic the metaphor is kneading kneading a kind of powder with water making it moist um so we're working the

245
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:14,119
we're working the breath in a very light soft relaxed way no strain in the

246
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:20,040
attention but just enough um uh there's

247
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:25,160
in the muscles there's difference between tense muscles and taut muscles

248
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:31,480
the tautness of a muscle and the many of the muscles are taught that's what their nature is to be taught the muscles

249
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:38,720
holding up the back for example and um and so but they relaxed enough and so

250
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:45,880
kind of a simple tness or uh commitment or interest just stay

251
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:51,720
interested um or love or a inspiration

252
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:58,119
something stay there stay with the whole flow if you sit down to meditate

253
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:04,160
sometimes the breathing can be quite fast and it's just really quick breathing in and out and that idea of

254
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:11,440
sustaining is not really you're not really ready for it but as we settle and get calmer and calmer and the breathing

255
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:17,440
begins slowing down and the inhale and exhale are become longer that's when it

256
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:24,400
starts to work better and better to just stay with the whole thing and

257
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:30,960
um and uh so sometimes it's the awareness that's connecting and

258
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:39,359
sustaining and sometimes you can turn it around and um and uh and feel it's the

259
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:48,359
breathing that's doing the work of meditation that the breathing is connecting to um

260
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:55,800
awareness and sustaining it that this the sensations of breathing and the

261
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:01,040
sensing of those Sensations are one and the same thing so whether

262
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:07,720
you're the one who's staying there sensing or whether it's a sens

263
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:15,040
Sensations that are coming into the sensing it's just a kind of it's It's a

264
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:22,200
you know you can it doesn't a little bit hard to separate them out so you can say it either way so sometimes the attitude

265
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:29,280
of that the breathing is coming into awareness um uh the breathing is what's

266
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:36,079
connecting and sustaining can make it lighter can take kind of the the the

267
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:44,160
habit of being the doer and the one who's trying something to H make something happen U take a

268
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:50,000
rest so Thea is play with it play with your attention find the lightness find

269
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,440
the sustaining and connecting uh really kind of settle in

270
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:05,200
and then to feel feel the pleasure of it if there's any even the slightest sense that it's Pleasant to take that in as

271
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:12,720
well and once you start feeling some of the pleasantness the sweetness that comes with meditation

272
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:19,720
then it might be easier to let go of your thinking so that the there's more

273
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:26,400
relaxed the thinking mind and let go of the thoughts so that the the Mind itself

274
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:34,000
the space in the mind becomes larger and can somehow receive or take in or share

275
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,119
in some of the pleasure of the meditation a quieter

276
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:45,599
mind is a is a mind that can feel more

277
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:52,200
pleasant so I hope these uh all this uh gives some of you

278
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:58,720
some some uh all the ideas of today are too but maybe there's just few of them

279
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:05,839
that really help you be an experienced beginner here and um as I said yesterday

280
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:15,559
um if at all you're able to meditate a second time today um even 10 20 minutes um I think

281
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:21,079
that uh and then maybe without guided meditation try and do some of this on

282
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:26,800
your own and be very accepting of however you are and

283
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:32,160
however easy or difficult it is um assuming just sitting and meditating is

284
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,559
enough don't be too uh measuring how

285
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:43,359
well you're doing so thank you and um look forward

286
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:46,920
to being here tomorrow
