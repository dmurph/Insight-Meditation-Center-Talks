1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:06,480
so hi everyone good to see you welcome wherever you are

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:14,480
in the world so for today's happy hour in practice

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:22,480
i wanted to invite us to consider the practice of forgiveness

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,680
forgiveness which is one of the beautiful practices of the heart

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:34,480
it's an act of generosity of the heart when when the heart lets go let's go of

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,559
rocks a rock that it has been carrying and in some ways we can think of

7
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,079
actually gener forgiveness practice is another aspect

8
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,520
is another dimension of meta loving kindness

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:58,160
household so if you consider meta loving kindness

10
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:05,920
cultivating good will as as the generosity of our heart

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:13,840
as generosity of care towards ourselves towards others

12
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:21,600
this act of generosity can explain itself can can express itself in

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,040
a generosity of letting go of something that has been carried when

14
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:35,360
the time is right when the time is right to know that forgiveness cannot be rushed

15
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:42,079
cannot be pushed cannot be forced but it can be cultivated

16
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:49,840
the same way that kindness and good will can be cultivated they

17
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:57,360
can't be forced but they can be cultivated as we turn our minds gently towards kindness

18
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,560
turn gently towards generosity of good will

19
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:09,200
ah it tends to become as the buddha says the proclivity of our

20
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,360
minds whatever you ponder upon whatever you ponder upon frequent

21
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,520
frequently becomes the tendency the inclination of your mind says the

22
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,520
buddha so we can incline our minds our hearts

23
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:35,120
towards kindness good will trusting that oh it will become

24
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:42,080
the proclivity of our heart our minds the same way with forgiveness we incline

25
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,400
our mind our heart towards forgiveness not forcing not saying okay now forgive let

26
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:56,080
go now you have to that's not the idea that can become really forced

27
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,319
whereas if we incline if we turn our mind may it be possible you

28
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:09,760
know can is it possible to let go is it possible to forgive in this moment inclining

29
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:17,280
inclining our minds our hearts to make it more possible

30
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,640
it is said that there is this saying that is said for awakening that awakening is

31
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,239
an accident and meditation makes you more accident prone

32
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:37,120
so in the same way we can think of forgiveness kindness love all of these

33
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:44,400
can be accidents that just the heart opens up to right their heart can open up to forgiving and

34
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,840
this meditation these cultivation practices make us more accident prone they set the

35
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,519
conditions for for these beautiful

36
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,840
gifts to occur on their own

37
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,000
one last thing i want to say before we practice is there are different

38
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,079
dimensions to forgiveness and we will explore a subset of them today

39
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:23,120
maybe we'll do more in the next sessions there is forgiving ourselves there is forgiving

40
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,759
others there's asking forgiveness from others in our hearts

41
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:38,080
maybe not in person but in our hearts and then the fourth aspect is offering forgiveness to the causes

42
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,479
and conditions that brought us brought

43
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:50,080
you and another being or another group of beings an entanglement in some kind of entanglement so

44
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,479
forgiving the causes and conditions that you can't control so off so and that's

45
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,919
a that's where wisdom really the wisdom practice comes in with the forgiveness

46
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,120
practice is acknowledging that yep not not all of these cause and

47
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,960
conditions are within our control so so we'll explore

48
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:20,639
perhaps one or maybe more of them today we'll see how it goes because i want to leave a lot of silent space

49
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,880
also for our settling and arriving today as we practice

50
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:34,240
so without further ado let's engage let's engage with our

51
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,320
practice so to invite you to get into your meditation posture

52
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:47,440
whatever your body needs in this moment sitting upright

53
00:05:48,479 --> 00:06:06,240
ah or lying down shifting moving whatever the body needs

54
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,280
but first we arrive with the breath

55
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:19,120
with the body just settling tilling the soil before we turn our attention

56
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,319
the topic at hand just to arrive

57
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:35,520
just to settle turning our gaze inward

58
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:49,840
connecting with the breath

59
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,280
letting go letting go

60
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,120
as much as possible offering up

61
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:18,560
the thoughts the cares the worries the activities that have come before

62
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:25,599
all the words and just connecting with the breath

63
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:31,840
in the body in this moment taking refuge

64
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:40,960
the simplicity and the beauty the grace of this moment of being alive

65
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:47,680
and just sitting and breathing being breathed this

66
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,560
is enough this is enough

67
00:07:53,199 --> 00:08:13,840
in this moment just this breath is enough

68
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:41,839
just this in-breath is enough

69
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:09,279
and in the enoughness there's a sacredness beauty

70
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:23,839
as if entering this moment this moment's experience with all

71
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,560
we're all alice's in wonderland

72
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:43,360
this breath this moment's experience is a wonderland this breath

73
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:51,839
breathing itself not to be taken for granted

74
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,839
and if thoughts are arising it's okay

75
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:46,959
noticing noticing the balloons of thought

76
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,320
it's fear opening your hand letting go of the strings let them float

77
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,040
away letting go releasing

78
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,120
ah feeling lighter

79
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:14,720
and if the thoughts feel heavy like rocks can we not hold them weighed down by

80
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:23,120
them but just respectfully lovingly put them down for now thank you

81
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:29,200

82
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:49,839

judged as much as possible in this moment as much as it's available to me

170
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,800
i forgive you i offer you forgiveness

171
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,880
fully knowing the causes and conditions

172
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,440
of your life of this life with my life that you've been doing the best you've

173
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:18,319
been able to i offer you i offer myself forgiveness

174
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:26,079
see which direction works better for you you can better connect with

175
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:41,839
i'll stick with you

176
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:53,920
i let go as much as possible and forgive

177
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,680
for all the ways i've been harmed

178
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:09,839
not seen fully not appreciated fully

179
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,440
making peace with you making peace with

180
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,839
myself

181
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:09,359
you know you've been doing the best you've been able to

182
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:19,839
if you could have done any better you would have

183
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:47,839
as much as possible in this moment i forgive you

184
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,119
and for the last moments of this practice

185
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:42,320
however this practice period was whether there was sleepiness distracted

186
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:49,760
thoughts judgments ah releasing offering forgiveness to

187
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,880
yourself it was exactly as it had to be

188
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,240
releasing letting go

189
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:25,838
may all beings be free including ourselves

190
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,839
thank you for your practice

191
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,560
so

192
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,359
so forgiveness forgiveness

193
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:07,839
so the practice we did tonight today

194
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:15,280
is perhaps the most important aspect of this practice which is the relationship

195
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,319
to ourselves forgiving ourselves asking forgiveness

196
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:26,319
to ourselves and of course we can do this practice may i love and forgive myself just as i

197
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:33,200
am forgiving ourselves which is lovely we can explore that later and this other way of actually seeing ourselves as this

198
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:39,680
beloved other with capacities with beauty with grace that we often don't kind of see when

199
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:45,200
we're looking inside but seeing another like wow this being that is me there is so

200
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,560
much light in this being and then asking for

201
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:56,720
forgiveness relationally and then turning and looking at ourselves from this perspective and

202
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:04,880
offering forgiveness can be quite powerful can be for some can be very powerful

203
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:13,280
some may not connect to it like any other practice so i offer it um in this way

204
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:19,200
yeah i think what this brings up is a shift in perspective because again we

205
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:26,079
take ourselves for for granted whereas this allows it invites another way of seeing

206
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:32,560
another way of seeing ourselves which we usually don't which we usually don't

207
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:39,680
may not be available in our common way of relating so

208
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:45,359
so happy to hear your reflections what insights came up what you

209
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:51,040
discovered if you like to share or any questions you like to ask

210
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:57,200
you can type them in chat if you type them to me privately i won't

211
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:04,720
say your name one of you just typed loved it you're welcome another one typed thank you thank you

212
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:10,560
that was great lovely i am so glad i'm so glad that

213
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:17,040
it worked for those of you who connected with it and of course you can raise your zoom hand if you like to share your

214
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:22,960
your reflections insights and questions if it's your physical hand i may not see

215
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,319
you i'll take your pause again if you type it

216
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:34,720
publicly in chat i'll say your name if not it'll be private

217
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:44,880
um yeah harley says that was powerful but also challenging

218
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:52,880
tough to forgive oneself yes yes it is it is

219
00:43:52,880 --> 00:44:02,640
actually forgiving ourselves is often the most challenging category it is absolutely

220
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:08,640
neil says i found myself hugging myself ah comforting myself for all the ways i've

221
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:15,520
harmed myself it was lovely oh thanks for sharing that neo oh i want to hug myself reading that oh

222
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:21,359
so much tenderness there ah linda says very refreshed and was

223
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:28,560
able to visualize me forgiving myself and accepting the offer beautiful

224
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:34,960
another refract reflection private it was hard to stay there so that makes

225
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:41,839
me think it was very much helpful beautiful and i invite you to consider this practice again

226
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:47,760
if the mind stuff especially didn't want to be there another reflection private i noticed i

227
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:54,640
become distracted and irritated when faced with forgiving myself yeah similarly if there's something

228
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:59,680
there if irritation is arising and distraction and irritation the mind doesn't want to go

229
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:06,240
there it's be kind be gentle that's the pointer that there's definitely something there to stay with

230
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:11,359
this practice kyla says conceptually very difficult

231
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:17,680
at first a meta stretch yeah yeah it can it absolutely is thank you

232
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:24,640
for that reflection melissa says this was beautiful thank you i felt myself as beloved

233
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:30,319
other feeling love and compassion toward the part of myself asking for forgiveness beautiful

234
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:36,000
thank you for that reflection melissa fm says this visualization also made me

235
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,560
think of all the ways i've supported and cared for myself too beautiful and recognized that there's

236
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:49,599
gratitude for myself at moments as well as forgiveness yay that's lovely that is just so lovely that

237
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:56,720
insight that comes up for appreciation gratitude beautiful bill says this practice would have been

238
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:02,960
harder a year ago but doing meta over the past year has allowed me to forgive myself to an

239
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:08,560
extent yay yay i celebrate that with you bill yay

240
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:15,200
the practice of meta really cultivating and one more reflection jerry says helpful to have moments of

241
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:23,119
kindness to myself and was enlightened even today of how i may have harmed myself in my

242
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:28,880
racing periods today in a meeting oh that's that's wonderful to

243

247
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:01,920
hi um my comments kind of similar to two of them in the chat around um

248
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:08,000
yeah i was like looking in my recent past for a moment to like forgive myself for treating

249
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,400
myself badly so i was looking for like okay what's something i've done recently where i was like berating myself or like

250
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:20,720
doing something against my values or somehow betraying myself and i couldn't find anything very

251
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:26,319
readily and i was like wow that is a big difference than me

252
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:32,160
really at any other point in my life um so yeah like what bill said about

253
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:38,240
like the difference of doing meta for a year like i really

254
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:44,000
don't have as like i'm just not betraying myself as much as i used to it's like well-being is like

255
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,839
it's created its own momentum um like a ship that's now like heavy enough that it's not so

256
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:57,040
easily like blown off course and i saw this thing on gratitude the other week that was like don't forget

257
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:04,640
how badly you once wanted what you have right now and i'm like wow yeah i didn't

258
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:12,559

helpful i was telling my partners in the small groups

that i was working on forgiving myself but i still had some

286
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:40,960
tightness in my stomach and they were

287
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:49,040
quite lovely and uh and then when we came back i realized it

safety and vulnerability of the range um and the small group that's lovely the

294
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:35,920
psychological safety that you're talking about and i think this is what allows this the softening
