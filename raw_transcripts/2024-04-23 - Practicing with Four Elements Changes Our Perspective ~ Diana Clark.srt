1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:09,440
good evening welcome welcome everybody nice to see you all practice

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:17,920
together it's a beautiful thing and happy Earth Day today's Earth

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,880
Day and it's like so beautiful outside have you guys noticed like I noticed

4
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:31,640
like oh there's flowers growing and and uh Le last week I went to

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,760
Arizona and to teach a retreat and then afterwards I went to some national parks like of course I did while I was in the

6
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,120
neighborhood and it was just so great you know just to see these national parks so I'm kind of filled up with the

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:52,359
beauty of Nature and these things so kind of on that theme I wanted

8
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:58,320
to talk about uh maybe nature a little bit but I'll start with this

9
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,478
poem and this poem was by gway kennel who is an American poet he was the Noel

10
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:11,600
laurate of literature in 1983 and this is just a a short poem

11
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,359
that it's pointing to some of the same things I'd like to point to in this

12
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,960
talk the poem is called Daybreak and it's by gway

13
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:32,960
kennel maybe I should say that um I listen listened to a recording of gway

14
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,119
kennel um speaking this poem was really great he did a great job i' love really

15
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:45,439
loved how he read it but he mentioned that um he wrote this poem after spending some time on the Barrier Reef

16
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:52,560
the great bar Reef you know outside of Australia and then um I guess he would go for walks on the

17
00:01:52,560 --> 00:02:01,000
shore so just to give a little bit of context so Daybreak by gallway kennel

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,879
on the tidal mud Just Before Sunset dozens of starfishes were

19
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:16,640
creeping it was it was as though the mud were a sky and enormous imperfect Stars

20
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,599
moved across it slowly as the actual Stars cross

21
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:28,840
Heaven all at once they stopped and as if they had simply increased their

22
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,280
receptivity to GR gravity they sank down into the

23
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:41,480
mud they faded down into it and lay still and by the time pink of sunset

24
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:49,359
broke across them they were as invisible as the true stars at

25
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:56,599
Daybreak so he's just very simply describing he saw a bunch of starfish

26
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:03,319
that were moving across the mud and he's a poet so he kind like starfish stars in

27
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:12,040
the sky but there's a few things that he's pointing to in this poem and one is a

28
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:19,360
real change in perspective usually when we think of stars we think of stars up in the sky but he's talking about how

29
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:27,400
like they're crawling up on the mud and like the sky so there's this value in seeing things from a different

30
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:34,519
perspective and there can be great value right we see things differently when we look at them from a different

31
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:40,720
perspective and he's also kind like linking these starfish with stars in the

32
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:47,239
sky not only do they have the same name but you know they're doing some of the same thing there's this movement across

33
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:52,400
the heaven or this movement across the mud and maybe in the same way as the

34
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:59,439
starfish are sinking into the mud maybe there's a way that the Stars kind of like sink into the sky as Daybreak

35
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:06,400
around es so some of this commonality of these like really disperate things usually we

36
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,879
don't link aquatic creatures with the what's in the

37
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:17,959
heavens but here he does he makes this connection and in the Buddhist teachings

38
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:24,720
there's also these types of connections what first this value and really looking at things from a different

39
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,080
perspective and not only that to see some of the commonality some of the

40
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,639
things that are shared with just about everything and this can be a certain

41
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:44,600
particular practice and this shift of perspective and seeing things uh in a similar way

42
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:52,360
seeing what's common about them what's similar about them turns out can be really powerful can be really

43
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:59,160
powerful and so part of the way that we can see this is in the

44
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:05,639
Buddha's teachings on the four elements so there's can be different

45
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:12,360
ways in which we can describe the Human Experience there's so many different ways so many different perspectives so

46
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:19,080
many different lenses we might use in the same way that we could describe the

47
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:26,039
weather today outside in Redwood City we could say it was pleasant that's one way

48
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:33,919
we could say we could say it's was 73° Fahrenheit or 23° C or you know these

49
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,280
are all different ways to express or maybe to look at things but it's all

50
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,800
pointing to the same thing like how the temperature was the feeling the

51
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,520
experience of the temperature today and we can use different ways to talk about

52
00:05:50,520 --> 00:06:00,440
it and different people and different parts of the world use Fahrenheit or use Celsius or use different language

53
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:07,639
it's all okay right it's all describing the same thing it's not like one is the truth and the other aren't the truth

54
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:13,840
they're all the truth they're just different ways and in the same way with our minds

55
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,120
with our uh psychology with our inner lives what is happening there's these

56
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,240
different perspectives of modern psychology we can think about the Mind

57
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:32,360
differently there's this psychodynamic perspective that Freud brought you know the ID and the ego and the super ego or

58
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:41,120
there's this like behavioral perspective that I think it's BF Skinner maybe like this idea of the dogs uh pav love I

59
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,440
guess is though the dogs salivate when they hear the Bell just this idea of you

60
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:52,560
know these patterns these habits that we get into or maybe there's a way we could look at inner life with cognitive

61
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,800
processing this uh like the how we think about things and let we could train

62
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,400
ourselves to think about them differently to have different thoughts or may there's also like a biological

63
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:11,360
perspective what are the neurotransmitters and what is the whole nervous system doing so those are all

64
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:19,000
like different lenses of looking at the inner life and in the same way we different

65
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,360
lenses that we can look at this bodily experience what it's like to be a human

66
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,479
in a body what it's like to

67
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:39,000
be to have a body and so this in the Buddhist

68
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:47,800
tradition there's these four elements earth water air and fire earth water air

69
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,199
and fire and in modern times we might kind of like scoff at like oh isn't that

70
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,280
cute how that BR is thousands of years ago they thought about these four

71
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:05,280
elements whereas you know in modern day right we often we think about elements

72
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:11,879
or those of us who are trained as chemists we think often like you know

73
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:17,560
well there's the periodic table there's the number of protons in the Adam right those types of things

74
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:25,400
right but the Buddhists they were the Buddha I should say they were

75
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:31,319
um thinking more about like the Buddhist philosophy Maybe would say is how could

76
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:38,599
they use this idea of elements as a support for greater Freedom greater ease

77
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:45,320
greater peace Awakening Liberation how can they use this idea of

78
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,640
elements which they had at that time as a support for

79
00:08:53,560 --> 00:09:00,399
practice and so one way that they did this is to of course they recognize

80
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:07,600
uh earth water fire and air but more specifically they kind of like expanded

81
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:15,519
the definition of these elements to talk about particular principles or

82
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:23,680
qualities that is in everything all things and that can be expressed by the

83
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,760
Earth element water air and Fire and Air

84
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:35,800
for example the stiffness the solidity the

85
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:41,920
softness or hardness of something can be expressed by the Earth

86
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,360
element you know like how solid something

87
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:55,839
feels and then there's this sense of fluidity or cohesion both of those with

88
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,880
the water element fluidity I think we accustomed to that with that mean know

89
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,800
water and fluidity makes sense but cohesion if we think about for example

90
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,160
um flour you just put some flour in a bowl you have flour in a bowl but you

91
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,880
add water and then all of a sudden it sticks together and you can get a dough

92
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:24,519
ball and you know you can make dough and make bread from it or in the same way I have this little

93
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:31,320
suction cup thing on my kitchen sink and uh it doesn't stick unless I put water water between that and the side of the

94
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:37,880
sink right suction cups they kind of like need water to help with this cohesion or there's a way that water

95
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:44,360
when it's not wet just these sheets of paper can slide against one another but

96
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:51,360
when there's water there they glump together so water is a part of this

97
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,760
sense of cohesion this the things holding

98
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:04,920
together and then fire element is this idea of temperature like the degree of

99
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:12,079
heat whether it's hot or cold is can be described by the fire

100
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:18,880
element and then this idea of motion or movement or vibration or oscillation or

101
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,800
something like that can be described by the air

102
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:31,200
element and so of course if we think about this that's not it's not possible

103
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,279
for these qualities to exist in an

104
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:42,320
object singularly like all all objects all

105
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:49,720
things have a little bit of all four of these but one of them may be predominant

106
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,839
for example if we think of a tree I think well that's pretty

107
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:05,360
solid but of course there's also sap and the tree some cohesion or some liquidity and

108
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,680
the cohesion as you know zo xylm and FL those people know about uh botney right

109
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,480
that the water has to move up from the roots right up to these really really tall trees some of them so of course

110
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:23,600
there's this movement and there's a degree of warmth or coolness in the

111
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:31,680
tree probably it's not too different than what the external temperature is but so all things have all of these

112
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:38,680
elements to them it's just a different way of looking at them or considering

113
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:46,199
them what is the degree of movement in something like this or what is the

114
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:53,040
degree of a temperature is it warm or cool or is it in

115
00:12:53,120 --> 00:13:00,040
between so this the early Buddhist analysis of this matter into elements

116
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:06,040
was more concerned about uh qualities than actual like this is the

117
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:11,760
truth of the universe or you know this is early physics it's not what's being pointed to

118
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:21,240
here instead is this recognition that oh if we think about for example Earth

119
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,560
element we can think about well almost all things have a sense of

120
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:34,519
like resistance or sense of solidness or something that can be pushed

121
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:42,880
against and there's a way in which this kind of like unites things oh this is something that things exist I mean that

122
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,959
they share in modern times you would say yeah they probably you know have some

123
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:56,519
carbon and hydrogen and some oxygens or something like this but instead this is pointing to the

124
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:02,320
qualities and there's something that happens when

125
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:09,800
the mind starts to pay attention to qualities of things rather than just the

126
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:16,000
label for things rather than just you like

127
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,120
chair of course a chair has a lot of solidness to it and maybe the movement

128
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:29,279
isn't obvious you know at this level but if we were to zoom way in

129
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,800
I'm reaching here a little bit but right we do know that uh there's a lot of space and there's movement right when we

130
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,000
get down to the atoms and it has a certain amount of

131
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,440
temperature and it has a cohesion right it's not flying apart into different

132
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,399
pieces maybe that's a silly example but there's a way in which we can do this with

133
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:57,440
everything and then when we start to consider things by the qualities that

134
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:03,959
they have then our relationship to them

135
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:12,519
shifts instead of seeing the chair as something that I sit

136
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:18,720
in something that Jim very nicely moves around on the Monday

137
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,680
evenings and these particular chairs the seat's a little bit tall for me so I have to put a you know something so like

138
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:30,079
I have a story with these chairs so all of a sudden I have a relationship that has to do with me and what it's like to

139
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:36,720
sit in them and I'm not the person that put them there somebody else put them there it's like so all these stories

140
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:44,759
kind of get tied up with it but it's different if I'm thinking about the qualities oh the hardness of

141
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:50,000
the rims versus the softness of the cushion there's a difference different

142
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,440
Earth

143
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:00,759
element so elements these elements or elements or elements right it doesn't

144
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:08,399
matter whether it's in a chair it's in this spell it's in me it's in you and

145
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:14,240
the wall behind me and this uh microphone that I'm speaking

146
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:22,079
into elements or elements or elements qualities or qualities or qualities and so there's something that

147
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:30,480
happens when we start to consider like the body our own body

148
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:36,759
because there's this difference there's

149
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:43,880
this there's these advantages of when we consider our own bodies in term of the

150
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:50,120
elements and there's practice discussions directing this some of you may know this in the Sati patana suta

151
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:56,839
like one of the primary discourses of the Buddha that um mindfulness instructions come

152
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:03,640
from and the instructions [Music] a person reviews their

153
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:09,678
body however it is placed however disposed by way of the elements

154
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:16,558
thus in this body there is the Earth element in this body there is the water

155
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:23,640
element in this body there is the fire element and in this body is the air

156
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:31,000
element and then a little bit later it says in this way they abide contemplating the body body

157
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,559
internally externally and both internally and

158
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:43,640
externally so not only considering how this body has these properties of

159
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:51,280
solidity cohesion temperature and movement but how things out there also

160
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,280
have

161
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,840
solidity fluidity or coh eion and

162
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:09,559
movement and temperature so then we can ask ourselves this division we tend to create between

163
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:17,559
the these elements in this body is something that I

164
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:25,760
am and manifestations things that are out there are something different than I am of course they are on some

165
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,240
level but also of course there's some way in which well we

166
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:37,200
share these qualities just like the starfish on the beach kind of like the stars in the

167
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,600
sky they shared movement I don't know if the stars move maybe it was more the Earth moves but

168
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:52,679
you know poetic license here and sinking into the mud or disappearing into the

169
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,760
sky so we might ask ourselves like literally at what point does the food we

170
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,280
eat which of course is coming from you know literally the Earth and literally

171
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:11,840
water and literally air and literally it has to be the right temperature but we can also think of it

172
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:20,799
just as you know these qualities of solidity and cohesion and temperature and

173
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:27,159
movement at what point do we consider that the vegetables at one point there

174
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:33,280
are carrots there in the ground we eat the

175
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:39,600
carrot and then it becomes a part of this body that's why we

176
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:47,280
eat so where is the distinction precisely between what's external what's

177
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,640
internal between what's not me and what is

178
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,799
me the carrot we often think is like it's not me but is it when we start to

179
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:07,279
chew it and swallow it does it just all of a sudden get transformed as me something that's part of

180
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:14,080
me and if we really start to think about this that we discover that we can't really find a clear distinction that

181
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,360
everybody can agree on like oh okay it's it's something else and then precisely

182
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,240
at this moment it transforms into this

183
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:34,080
body and you know the same could be said with the opposite process when is it no longer the body is

184
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:42,320
like when it's uh has gone into the intestines or when it's gone into the toilet or you like this process of

185
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:50,480
elimination when is it no longer the body it was part of the body before and now it no longer

186
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:56,080
is so there's this way in which this division that we tend to create between

187
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:02,039
what's external and what's internal maybe it kind of puts into question and

188
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:08,679
isn't so clear or isn't so

189
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:16,520
obvious because the elements are the elements are the elements and then you might ask well why does this matter

190
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:22,720
Diana well one way this helps us to feel connected with nature helps us to see

191
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:30,440
how of course we're part of nature we are nature we are not different

192
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:39,640
and there's something about that that kind of helps soften the sense of like me and me being so

193
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:45,440
important and it's all about me it's kind of like self-centeredness that

194
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:52,120
humans often have we could start to see oh no I'm just part of nature just like

195
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,640
the carots and the trees and the ocean and everything else that's out there

196
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,799
everything that's been many manufactured by humans as well as everything that's

197
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:09,559
hasn't been manufactured by humans so it helps us to feel connected

198
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:15,880
to our environment not so distinct as well as diminishing this

199
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:21,480
strong sense of I and me and this strong sense of I and me is

200
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:28,240
the source of a lot of our attachment of our clinging we're trying to promote this sense of eye or defend this sense

201
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:34,080
of eye make it look good or make sure that people see it the way we want them

202
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:40,520
to see it so we're having to say things or do things or trying to make sure they don't see the certain aspects of

203
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:47,480
ourselves all these ways and these these ways we kind of pretzel ourselves into

204
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:53,240
kind of protecting the sense of ey making sure it looks good and that

205
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:59,440
it's consistent with the way that we want to see it or feel it

206
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:06,440
but when we start to say oh no we're just part of nature too then that can

207
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:15,360
soften and then there's this way in which when we start to consider the qualities of the body

208
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:25,600
these elements how many times have I said this a solidity fluidity temperature and

209
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:33,120
movement when we start to consider them in the body when we start to do the practices that the Buddha recommend and

210
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:39,039
that is to like do a body scan which is considering the Earth

211
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:44,760
element often that can be like with a clenching one's teeth kind of like this

212
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:52,559
like that's very strong and then the kind of the liquid we can like the saliva in the mouth the temperature we

213
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:57,960
can just um consider the temperature of how our hands are when they touch one

214
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:06,360
another and the air is like the movement we can consider the how the body moves as it

215
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,720
breathes so you can do a body scan just kind of like tuning into these different

216
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:19,400
elements and as we do that as we start to tune into like the

217
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:25,480
experiences the movement the temperature the fluidity or

218
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:31,799
cohesion then that's a shift in perspec perspective about our

219
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:39,919
bodies and that shift in perspective also tends to like minimize this sense

220
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:48,520
of thinking that the body is this stable constant separate thing that somehow we

221
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:56,679
can control or somehow is beautiful or not beautiful as the case may be whatever we might think instead of those

222
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:02,600
types of ideas which are only

223
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:09,399
ideas they're only ideas it's all in the

224
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:16,840
mind actually what the body is right it's this collection of experiences that's all it is the mind is putting

225
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:22,240
saying oh this is separate from everything else or it's special or it's

226
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,360
a stable and doesn't change or you know something like this but if we move away

227
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:35,760
away from the ideas the Notions the beliefs the views that we have about our

228
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,919
body and other people's bodies and bodies in general move away from that to

229
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:48,320
the actual experience the tingling in the hand the

230
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,520
pressure of the cushion or the chair against the body the feeling of the

231
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,159
coolness against the skin

232
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:05,480
then there's this way of which we can really tune into our experience and we

233
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:13,679
notice that it's changing of course it is it's always

234
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:19,080
changing and there's this when this we deeply recognize the changing nature of

235
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,159
the experience all of our experiences and we see this repeatedly

236
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:31,440
and we experience this repeatedly then there's this way in which the mind mind kind of like does this Letting Go

237
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,600
it no longer wants to hold on to this body because it sees that oh no it's

238
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:44,480
just a collection of changing experiences this idea of a stable

239
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,440
constant body is just an idea it's a useful idea and we need to use it in our

240
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:57,399
daily life but it's not the only perspective there's this other perspective that leads to Greater

241
00:26:57,399 --> 00:27:03,120
freedom this other perspective that leads to Greater peace and

242
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:10,120
well-being because often what happens when we have this concept of the body in particular my

243
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:18,039
body what happens this goes like almost simultaneously or goes together my body

244
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:25,760
gets compared to others bodies or maybe it starts the other way seeing others bodies gets compared to my body this is

245
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:32,200
what humans do they compare and this

246
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:37,320
comparing is part of this like this deep pattern that humans

247
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:43,960
have the Buddha had a word for it called mana and it's this way of which there's

248
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:50,200
this deeply rooted sense of uh I

249
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:57,399
am or I was or I will be this gets the sense of I gets

250
00:27:57,399 --> 00:28:02,000
solidified when bodies are compared to other

251
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:09,519
bodies this sense of I am is one of the last defilements to go away before Awakening so it's something that until

252
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:15,240
you're completely awakened is one that you have but when we are comparing our

253
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:22,320
bodies notice how often there's these thoughts that arise they can be this Myriad of

254
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,840
thoughts or there can be emotions that uh get triggered when we are comparing

255
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,960
like oh I should go to the gym more oh I should eat less cookies or oh I should

256
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:39,080
go to the gym less or I should walk more you know whatever it is whatever it is

257
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:47,039
these ideas that we have about our bodies when they're compared to others but if instead if we just see the

258
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:53,679
body as this interplay of the elements then this conceit this Mana of

259
00:28:53,679 --> 00:29:00,000
I am gets softened and all these thought patterns and emotions that are related

260
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,480
to comparing ourselves to others can fall away there can be so much less

261
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:13,240
dooka so much less Dua in our lives so again I'm not saying this is

262
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:19,799
the only way to consider the body right there are useful times to consider okay this is my body it's distinct and

263
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:26,679
separate from everything else there I'm talking about a shift in perspective and looking at things

264
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:32,399
differently this a practice that we do and can be enormously

265
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:38,039
helpful helpful to let us let go of some of the attachments that we have help us

266
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:44,080
let go of some of the ideas we have about how we should be or how others

267
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:52,159
should be or should not be or something like this there's so much DOA so much suffering associated with

268
00:29:54,120 --> 00:30:01,760
this so maybe I'll just say that uh one way that the Buddha talked about

269
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,519
this is um well maybe I'll start with uh one way

270
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:13,760
that anali have talked about this and some of you may know he's a scholar monk

271
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,480
he's a an amazingly productive uh scholar and

272
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:25,399
he's like an lot of like you really delving into the poly Canan as well as

273
00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:30,440
the parallels that are preserved in other languages and kind of like teasing apart well what

274
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:35,880
are the meanings here and I really appreciate the way that um he talks

275
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:41,200
about practicing just what it's like to practice with the the elements looking

276
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:47,240
at the elements whether it's a solidity fluidity temperature or

277
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:53,519
movement he says that it's like receiving a parcel that is meant for

278
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:59,000
someone else so you get this box you look at it like oh it doesn't have my

279
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,120
name on it so there's no need to open the box and look at it and have

280
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:13,159
emotional response or thoughts about it and all this kind of stuff instead you just look at the address label realize

281
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:19,000
oh it's not mine and then return it to the male person so it's kind of like what we can

282
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,360
do kind of like with the experience of the body instead of having say like oh this is mine and I'm going to compare it

283
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:32,559
to everybody else's like oh no it's not mine give it back I kind of like this idea of this

284
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:39,480
way of working with the how the elements can help us what we might say like disidentify with the body and again I

285
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:45,720
don't want to say like there is no such thing as distinct bodies or anything like this I'm talking about a very

286
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:51,720
helpful perspective to use that can lead to greater and greater

287
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:58,360
freedom and in the same way the Buddha he used a uh simile

288
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:04,760
that's sprinkled throughout the poly Canon so maybe pointing to the same idea

289
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:10,919
but using something different which actually in modern times I kind of find to be a little

290
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:17,639
gruesome and very un Buddhist we might say and um so the Buddha he gives this

291
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:27,159
simile of a butcher who Slaughters a cow and uh butchers it and sells it so

292
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:34,120
this is a little bit offensive but he's was just using the ordinary experience of probably what was there in you know

293
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:44,919
Society at that time but there'd be vendors that would be doing this but he's pointing to while the cow is still

294
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:51,559
whole we consider it a cow whether the cow's alive or dead if it's long you know it's a

295
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:57,679
cow but as soon as the butcher this is gruesome um you know starts to butcher

296
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:04,760
it into little pieces all of a sudden it's flank steak and T-Bone I don't know what these are

297
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:11,559
you know these different things that are a right there it's no longer cow so in the same way in which kind of

298
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:21,000
like using this perspective of looking at the elements is a way to help us kind of loosen our identity with our with our

299
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,279
body which is a way that can help support more and more freedom to soften

300
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:31,559
this sense of self so that we don't always having to be

301
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:39,519
protecting it or defending it or hiding behind it or something like this so maybe in the same way as gallway

302
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:45,240
kennel was talking about these uh starfish that are moving across the

303
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:50,279
mud like the stars that are moving across the heaven like this really

304
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:57,320
different perspective and yet they're both kind of like you know stars in some kind of way and they share right they're

305
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:03,039
both moving they have this a certain amount of solidity Stars much less

306
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:09,480
solidity than uh starfish some cohesion Stars again right

307
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:17,079
they're kind of like moving out I guess I'm not an astrophysicist but but you know starfish have cohesion

308
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:24,158
as well and uh temperature they of course have temperature so they kind of they have these things the same so maybe

309
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:29,800
in the same way here's a poet and the I think I don't know exactly when he wrote this

310
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:35,599
poem I think it got published in the 1980s so he wrote it sometime before

311
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:40,800
then he's pointing to something similar what the Buddha is pointing to and kind

312
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,919
like maybe where we can have this shift in perspective that can help bring some

313
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:53,000
more freedom and ease to our lives so I'll end there and uh open it

314
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,560
up for some questions or comments thank you

315
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:22,520
and thanks for the talk uh so when I first um came here today I kind of like

316
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:29,880
struggled to kind of like you know um sit and like meditate um um and um one

317
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:37,040
of the talks that we had a few weeks back was like um trying to like turn to mundan and like see um or see it in a

318
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:43,680
different perspective right and I remember um I heard like uh someone sneeze um and it made me kind of just

319
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,720
like be conscious of the fact that um you know like uh we're all like sharing

320
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:55,640
the same a um which is kind of funny that like you know like the talk today is about like the four elements cuz like

321
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:00,920
um that concept of like sharing the air um like coupled with like um shifting

322
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:08,200
perspectives helped me really kind of like remember that like you know I'm not Al alone and like we're all here um to

323
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:15,520
practice together and um even if like we're all coming from different like circumstances or contexts and after this

324
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,760
we go our separate ways like as we're all here like at this very hour um it's

325
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:27,440
kind of cool that like uh you know like be in that sense of like goesan and sharing that same movement of the breath

326
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:33,920
um um and it helped me like really feel Not Alone um and also like helped me

327
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,760
like settle in my into my practice because like I know everyone else is like you know settling into theirs um so

328
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,880
I just found that to be very um timely so thanks for that nice nice thank you

329
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,359
thank you I actually had in my notes to talk about this how it kind of helps us feel connected to others right because

330
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:58,240
of course all humans have the same the same elements that we do so thank you thank you for saying that

331
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:05,079
anybody else have a comment or question or something they'd like to

332
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:23,400
say maybe I'll just read this poem then as a closing it's kind of nice to hear poems again after

333
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:30,440
you've heard more about them this is called Daybreak by gway

334
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:37,160
kennel on the tidal mud Just Before Sunset dozens of starfishes were

335
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:43,599
creeping it was as though the mud were a sky and enormous imperfect Stars moved

336
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:51,720
across it slowly as the actual Stars cross Heaven all at once they stopped and as

337
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:57,560
if they had simply increased their receptivity to gravity they sank down

338
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:02,720
into the mud they faded down into it and lay

339
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:09,040
still and by the time pink of sunset broke across them they were as invisible

340
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:14,599
as the true stars at Daybreak I I just I love this poem kind

341
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:19,880
of it's just a there's some tenderness or sweetness about it I kind of like

342
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:26,160
so I'll end with that thank you and wishing you all a wonderful rest

343
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:29,440
of your evening thank you
