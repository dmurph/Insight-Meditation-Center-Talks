1
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,639
and so good morning um it's morning good morning to you all

2
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:18,060
sweet to see the names I know a lot of these names you all are um

3
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,359
YouTube chat famous at this point

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,939
um yeah very sweet

5
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,399
um okay Let's uh

6
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,620
do that whole meditation thing

7
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,220
so uh

8
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:26,240
just sense in what you think you're supposed to do when you start meditating

9
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,700
in many ways you force yourself into a kind of slot of

10
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,600
one kind or another

11
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:02,600
and let's just see how natural we can be

12
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,280
in these uh first couple minutes

13
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,560
foreign subtly

14
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:52,320
we can be trying to prove something

15
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,639
to ourselves

16
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:03,680
to the teacher to the Buddha to someone

17
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,440
but you don't have to prove anything

18
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,280
in your practice

19
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:18,199
and so we relax truly relax

20
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:30,020
and then if tension remains we let her remain

21
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:42,600
but we relax the the energy that turns

22
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,100
us into a project

23
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,879
the energy that turns us into the project manager

24
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,560
and we sit together

25
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,780
maybe it's skillful to

26
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:22,759
highlight some phenomena with the attentional

27
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:28,740
Spotlight breath body sound

28
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,020
Darkness behind your closed eyes

29
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:54,660
but we attend not in a kind of brittle way not attempting to prove anything to

30
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:59,539
ourselves we attend

31
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:06,560
knowing that the ingredients of waking up

32
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:14,660
are more present than we might imagine

33
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:05,540
um to try and prove something to ourselves to another

34
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:13,680
entails that we fixate ourself we

35
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:20,060
subtly Imaging sense of Who We Are

36
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:25,620
of a kind of trajectory of where it's all going

37
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:32,640
what will be when we get there or what we

38
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,500
will be if we don't

39
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,720
we kind of sandwich ourselves in time

40
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,040
the dizziness of time

41
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,260
but we don't have to prove anything

42
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:50,220
Stone seduced by The Mirage

43
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,480
of the future

44
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:04,500
true the future is coming but it never comes exactly in the form

45
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:11,539
we imagine we never arrive in that moment

46
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:21,900
when it does come we realized that uh

47
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,299
wanting is always different than getting

48
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:50,000
and so we say enough this is good enough safe enough

49
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:58,320
we surrender into the bottomlessness

50
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,419
of the present

51
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:04,460
phenomena many are egoically titillating

52
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:22,980
but we don't need to spin out into the outer

53
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:29,369
orbits of the egoic machinations [Music]

54
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:38,059
if we can just absorb the body blow a phenomena

55
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:49,580
just this Pleasant unpleasant

56
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,360
it can just stay

57
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:22,100
resting back and uh the openness of awareness

58
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,158
foreign

59
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,278
foreign

60
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:44,820
okay as um yeah it's good to see with you

61
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:51,500
I think I'm really accustomed to uh YouTube

62
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:57,140
situation here um

63
00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:01,760
yeah so thanks for thanks for having me

64
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:09,299
so um yesterday um introduced this theme about uh

65
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:15,840
different Dharma pleasures and uh spoke specifically about um

66
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,240
the pleasure of having a path the pleasure of having a path

67
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:26,779
and today it's the pleasure of

68
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:34,039
of sourcing our motivation from Love

69
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:41,580
so when I was um it was just out of college and I worked

70
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:49,260
in this uh I was not qualified for this incidentally but um when they pay nine

71
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:54,720
dollars an hour you kind of you get me so I was working in a

72
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,340
residential treatment center um and for uh

73
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:06,360
severely you know severe psychiatric you

74
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:12,620
know adolescent boys with serious psychiatric stuff you know that was

75
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:21,179
acute enough that they couldn't be in um in homes and um and so is residential

76
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:27,200
treatment and it was six kids in the house and in a

77
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:35,880
um just an ordinary house in the middle of LA and um and it was um such intense and beautiful

78
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:44,059
work and um and as a counselor my job was to

79
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:51,000
uh yeah to run groups of one kind or another do fun things together play cook

80
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,399
for them take care of them and and Implement a behavioral

81
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:06,240
modification program yeah whereas like good point you know points points for good behavior and the

82
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,760
loss of privileges from bad behavior and

83
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,800
um and you could see how

84
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:23,820
um you could run the behavioral modification program on fear

85
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:29,760
or love and at least initially and I remember

86
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,858
you know working with a whole like cast of characters all of us you know

87
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:40,800
counselors uh um fear at least initially could be more

88
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,919
effective yeah um that uh it was easier to change the

89
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:52,320
behavior of the children if um there is some measure of fear of the

90
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:59,640
counselor but uh in the end yeah uh I think love

91
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:05,760
wins out if if our Behavior if their behavior

92
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,040
is going to change in a sustainable way

93
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,579
it's going to be a function of of love

94
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:23,400
conditioned by love shaped by love and um

95
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:28,619
my question for you is uh

96
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:35,460
what what kind of Behavioral modification program are you running on yourself

97
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:42,060
yeah kind of program are you running on yourself where where do you Source your

98
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:49,500
motivation from um we have to Source our motivation from

99
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:54,900
somewhere we want to change and grow

100
00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:00,180
right that that line from uh Suzuki roshi you're perfect just as you are and

101
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:06,960
there's room for improvement right yeah we uh

102
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,420
there's much we want to do we want to

103
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:19,200
yeah to love more fully to be less neurotic to take good care of our body

104
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:24,420
to to minimize the harm we do to others

105
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:29,640
to ourselves we there's a lot yeah

106
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:36,960
and um how do we actually motivate ourselves to grow and evolve to make

107
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,480
progress and the Dharma pleasure yeah that I'm

108
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:50,400
speaking about is is coming to Source our motivation from love and care

109
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:56,400
rather than self harshness or fear

110
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:02,960
or the kind of egoic machinations of proving

111
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:09,900
self um self-hatred has maybe many functions

112
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:15,359
some of which are actually soothing um

113
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:22,200
but one of the functions is is is a kind of Behavioral modification program we

114
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:29,940
run on ourselves and it's all stick no carrot

115
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:37,200
and it's this kind of commitment to okay I'll punish myself to motivate myself to

116
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:44,220
achieve something that I think is Worthy and

117
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:52,500
in that framework we often get very preoccupied with the gold stars and with the kind of imagine how we'll feel when

118
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:58,500
we actually get the gold star but getting the gold star never feels

119
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:04,680
like wanting it and never ever really uh I don't know it's almost the sense of

120
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:12,660
like well I'll be a grown-up once I do that once I grow in this way but no one ever feels like a grown-up as

121
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:19,980
far as I can tell and um and we repeat the habits of

122
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:25,140
self-harsness in our practice um uh

123
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:32,820
we can be harsh or even even sometimes really kind of cruel as we come up against our

124
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:41,339
limitations yeah when we no we need to let go but we cannot

125
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:48,060
when we're trying to be tranquil but we're agitated yeah when we're

126
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:55,380
trying to be equanimous we're trying to be okay with something but we're really not

127
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:01,800
we come up against certain certain moments of limitation

128
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,920
and um and we

129
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:14,280
are trying to kind of shape ourselves through mechanisms of fear and harshness

130
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:22,338
and that system of motivation can fall away almost completely

131
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:33,720
um one one meditator could touch me she said um uh I realized my inner critic loves

132
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:39,500
me yeah they're just confused something like this yeah

133
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:45,960
um when when are limitations and our Neurosis are no longer a kind of

134
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:51,720
commentary on Who We Are when we're at least a little bit free of

135
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:58,020
the these egoic pressures of proving proving

136
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:06,240
oneself proving the object of self to someone even if that audience is just us

137
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,220
when that starts to Fall Away

138
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:19,200
our Neurosis becomes a source of curiosity and humor rather

139
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:26,640
than shame yeah yeah we know we still have to grow we

140
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:33,060
have habits that get us into trouble but our Neurosis becomes a source of

141
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:38,000
curiosity and humor rather than shame

142
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:48,599
I'm one of the I don't know features of practice one of the things I've noticed is like it really has become such a

143
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:55,440
delight to laugh at myself you know like to laugh deeply and to laugh deeply I'm

144
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,780
not talking about like that little habit that's like really kind of innocent and

145
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:09,060
no I'm talking about like laughing deeply in the face of a real problems real Neurosis yeah

146
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:14,579
and in that laughter that kind of laughter it's it's like I can almost

147
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:21,480
feel what might become self-judgment or some shame inflected

148
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,520
state or something just releases

149
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:33,660
yeah we do we do want to grow and mature but

150
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:41,460
the the uh the desperate urgency of ego is gone

151
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:49,760
yeah that is not where we're sourcing our motivation from

152
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:57,960
and um the the poignancy of our of our

153
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:06,420
condition you know of The Human Condition is so is is etched deeply into our being

154
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:13,140
and so that's there for us to and um and we begin to Source our

155
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:19,020
motivation from Love from tenderness and care and sympathy sympathy with

156
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:25,760
ourselves with the plight of suffering

157
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:31,020
and uh and there's this sense of like oh yeah

158
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:36,240
there's nothing there's nothing left to prove to

159
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:42,240
ourselves to others we're not we're not growing and changing

160
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:48,980
in order to prove something

161
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:54,300
yeah and then

162
00:42:54,300 --> 00:43:02,040
all of our our projects you know are whatever that is our exercise schedule

163
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:08,000
or meditation commitment or you fill in the blank whatever

164
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:15,900
comes from care yeah comes from care and comes from this very uh
