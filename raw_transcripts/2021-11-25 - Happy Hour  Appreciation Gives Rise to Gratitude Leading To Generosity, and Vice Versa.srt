00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:06,000
hi hi welcome to happier

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:14,400
so this week we're dedicating our practice to the beautiful practice of gratitude

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,720
uh given that in the u.s it's thanksgiving tomorrow thanksgiving holiday

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,320
again a holiday with with complicated history um

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,719
and i appreciate that um many of us have in the hellos before

6
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,320
it got recorded they acknowledged the lands being unseated

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:45,600
um and and a part of this this reflection

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,120
uh in this holiday i have to i'll share an anecdote actually um so when i came to

9
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:58,160
the us when i was 16 years old i came from iran and um

10
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:05,439
and um not knowing the history at first of what the solid it was but just hearing that oh this new country of mine

11
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:11,920
at this holiday called thanksgiving it's a day people give thanks wow what a cool

12
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:18,000
thing to have a holiday for to have a day that you just give thanks so i like

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,040
to bring that beginner's mind that that

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:30,479
naive perspective and just share that because there's there's a uh there's a goodness how can let let us

15
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,840
co-opt it in this way and yes it is a day it is a week it is it's a great

16
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,560
opportunity every day every moment to give thanks to give thanks for so much that we have so much that we

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,560
take for granted and

18
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:55,520
there are so many studies that link gratitude um appreciation i like

19
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,799
actually the word appreciation because sometimes gratitude feels heavy like as i think ben was bringing up on monday

20
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,640
there is a sense that for some folks this feeling that you should be grateful

21
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,000
well you have so much good things going on in your life you should be grateful ouch and that

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,239
sense of should a finger wagging that either the society seems to do inadvertently or we tend to do for

23
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,360
ourselves or others like you should be grateful it's actually

24
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,879
can suppress can suppress a sense of gratitude whereas

25
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:37,120
a sense of appreciation just appreciating appreciating what's good

26
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,879
turning our mind to it and relishing uh relishing really taking a moment to

27
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:49,280
take delight and appreciation and letting gratitude if he wants to come up on its own to come up

28
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,959
without any shoulding without any forcing of

29
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,519
ourselves that's very very important and if at any point doing the practice

30
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:07,519
you don't feel grateful that's fine drop it go back to relishing go back to being

31
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,440
with the breath just keep it simple there's no should in this practice

32
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,760
and to continue that train of thought there are many many studies that connect

33
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,360
authentic appreciation authentic gratitude to gladness to happiness

34
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,959
and to generosity and that's another thing that i've been contemplating lately which is beautiful

35
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:42,000
also studies connecting how connecting gladness happiness to generosity

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,799
that when we give actually there's a study that if we spend and participants were given some

37
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:55,120
money to either spend on themselves or spend it on someone else and people felt happier when they were generous when

38
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,959
they spend it on someone else which is pretty cool and there are other studies that show that

39
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,400
you can train yourself to derive more

40
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,400
joy more delight out of generosity

41
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,519
so that uh when you're actually generous you feel happier just

42
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,680
gives you more more of a helper's high more of a hit let's say and the way you can train

43
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,600
yourself to do that is guess what practicing appreciation practicing

44
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:37,759
gratitude for what you have actually makes you enjoy generosity more which i think is a

45
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:44,240
really interesting exercise so um the study so again don't take any of

46
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,880
these on faith try them on for yourself see if this is true in the laboratory of your

47
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,479
own mind you're a human being you have a laboratory called your mind heart body

48
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:02,000
try it out for yourself so with that oh i want to say one more

49
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,680
thing you know on monday we practiced uh and the guided meditation was about

50
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,840
gratitude for things we take for granted and i just wanted to share a practice report with you and wondered if you had

51
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,880
the same concern later because i noticed oh my mind

52
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,000
turned into gratitude more this week for things that i take for granted and it

53
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,560
was lovely i just enjoyed it so much so thank you all for for

54
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,080
being part of the sangha and this opportunity for us to practice together so

55
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,000
so with that let us turn our hearts our minds incline a little

56
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,320
more invite ourselves um to appreciate to appreciate and maybe

57
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:54,400
invite just shyly if the gratitude is shy just invited like a little kitty you want to

58
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,759
come out you don't want to come out that's fine and but just be very gentle with this

59
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,280
practice with similar to other other practices so

60
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:12,639

00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:27,680
as best as they are able to letting go letting go

166
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,160
any judgment

167
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:43,599
and just grateful for this you're showing up in this moment

168
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:48,400
you've shown up that's enough that's enough

169
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:59,839
perhaps having an image of people in your path

170
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:06,720
having gratitude for you as you've had gratitude for them

171
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:14,720
them having gratitude for you for this being who is unique

172
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:20,519
only the way you can be with your particularities

173
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:36,160
as if they bow to you they give you out

174
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,800
they say thank you as you say thank you to them

175
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:51,680
offering offering your goodness to yourself

176
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,640
to all beings everywhere

177
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:10,079
may we wake up to our own

178
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,480
and everyone's unfathomable goodness

179
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,720
may we awaken with grace

180
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:47,119
thank you all thank you for your practice

181
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:51,078
the gift of your practice

182
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:05,040
so if you are willing if you are moved if

183
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,920
you wish you like to share

184
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:17,119
some gift from your practice today

185
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:26,160
with the song go what came up for you what have you noticed what was it like discoveries

186
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:33,720
challenges anything is is okay joe

187
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:40,240
just that i really like the option of using

188
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:47,838
appreciation in place of gratitude because gratitude is a lot of work

189
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,599
and appreciation is uh is kind of a simpler level

190
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:59,280
it's like gill's use of anacompa care

191
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,960
as an umbrella term that includes compassion because care is really easy to grasp

192
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:12,079
and so anyway uh anyway i like uh i like appreciation thanks great wonderful thank you for bringing

193
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:17,440
that intro i really appreciate your reflection yeah and

194
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:23,359
yeah interesting that uh to think of it as an umbrella term because in the way it is the same

195
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:29,520
appreciation is the same as gratitude but yes gratitude can feel so heavy sometimes so much work for his

196
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:36,480
appreciation it's just oh yeah it feels naturally i appreciate this and well guess what i'm grateful for it too but yes

197
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:44,800
yeah that's great thank you for that joe other reflections of their

198
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,440
um [Music] thoughts

199
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:58,880
yeah dave says i'm most grateful for this emphasis on gratitude because i've been through

200
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,960
an arches jobs route that had me focusing on how much i don't have

201
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,160
and didn't i think there's more to that chat coming but yes thank you it is so

202
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:17,040
important yes turning the mind to what is good what is here and focusing especially gosh

203
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:22,800
yeah job search can be so challenging looking looking searching by definition

204
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:29,599
is is an act of wanting in the world mima i see your hand please

205
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:39,040
i am had never seen the the correlation between the generosity of someone when you were

206
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:45,920
speaking about that and how the gratitude is kind of like it goes together when there's an interaction

207
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:52,000
and i remembered my son my grandson is now going to be 18 but when he was about

208
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,240
seven years old he came to me and he said to me um grandma i have three hundred dollars and i don't

209
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:05,520
have anybody to share it with he said i asked my mama and my step papa if i could buy them

210
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:12,319
something and they don't need anything and he asked mr anything you need

211
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:17,920
and his favorite store was barnes noble and so i told him you know i saw a little speaker

212
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:26,400
i really really liked it but i couldn't get it that day hey grandma please let me buy it for you

213
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:33,119
and i remembered uh with this meditation i remembered that experience how it was a give and take because he was being

214
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:38,960
generous but i was so appreciative even now of the experience with him

215
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:45,760
and so i'll never forget the day he came over a couple of weeks later with a little bag and he was elated

216
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:52,720
grandma i bought your speaker and he and i still have it i will not get rid of it because that

217
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:58,640
experience that i remember him doing it was from the sweetness of his heart he wanted to share

218
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:06,160
and i could not i don't i could have bought it myself but i didn't want to deprive him of that yes

219
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:14,000
that's slowly that's beautiful mima and and as you highlighted in the story there's so much giving and receiving and

220
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,319
and when we actually give another person the opportunity to give

221
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:26,079
it is so um it's that it's such a gift that is such

222
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:32,079
a gift right to let them be kind oh it's it's it's such a gift instead of

223
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:37,760
going oh no too much trouble do it for it's just no it's

224
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:44,560
beautiful that you let yourself receive and it's still to this day it it brightens your heart it brightens

225
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:51,680
your mind oh that is beautiful thank you for letting me share that oh thank you for sharing this video this is so sweet

226
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:57,440
yeah it reminds me i'll share it a little story too which actually happened this past week i

227
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:04,240
was actually um i was writing there was

228
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,520
some reflections and generosity and and a friend texted who lives about

229
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:15,599
10 minutes ago saying that oh i've made a batch of soup can i drop some off for you and i

230
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,160
thought oh it's trouble and then i thought wait

231
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:25,920
as part of my act of generosity she wants to so yes please i would love to

232
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:31,599
eat your soup so she came and brought it and it was just it was both lovely to receive and also the same thing that you

233
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:36,800
were sharing with with your friend uh with with your grandson yes the giving

234
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,839
others the upper chances of saying oh no to you know don't too much trouble you know it's like we're blocking we're

235
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:49,040
blocking general we're blocking kindness and that flow of gratitude and connection so yeah

236

257
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:17,359
abraham are you still up for it whatever you wanted to share before is it relevant thank you i appreciate it uh just many

258
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:22,480
many years ago what people were sharing about uh how the giver

259
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:29,200
wants to give and for you not to receive what they want to give is

260
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:35,119
is not a skillful thing to do or can not be skillful i had a teacher

261
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:40,880
many years ago when i was in the midst of a career change and i didn't have a lot of money and

262
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:48,720
the first year i applied for a bursary so i could attend a retreat and it was wonderful and the next year uh he said

263
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:56,240
why haven't you applied for the bursary and i said i can't do that every year somebody else needs the opportunity he said you know

264
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:02,960
somebody has offered the money for a student to go why would you want to take away their karma the possibility

265
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:08,800
for them to earn good karma uh by not accepting it and i realized

266
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:15,760
when he said it that he had put the money in the bursary fund and wanted me to be on retreat but i thought that was

267
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:21,200
a really interesting take you know like why won't you allow people to express

268
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:26,880
their goodness that's interesting that's beautiful

269
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:34,160
thank you abraham i love that i love that twist yes exactly why not let them

270
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:39,359
express their goodness their block their wholesome karma from ripening yeah

271
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:44,720
that's lovely appreciate that reflection yeah

272
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:50,079
the other reflections we have a moment anything else that came up for you from this practice

273
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,800

00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:02,160
eileen please okay

275
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:08,319

276
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:15,440
the butterfly of awareness because i've always tried hard to be mindful and what i understood today was that

277
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:22,559
gentleness works and trying hard like that doesn't work

278
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:29,119
so that was all i appreciate that very much nikki beautiful thank you aileen that that is

281
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,599
really works this is the sense you know butterfly of awareness is flying just

282
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:50,800
sitting on your belly it's like oh yeah getting up and down with every breath just so
