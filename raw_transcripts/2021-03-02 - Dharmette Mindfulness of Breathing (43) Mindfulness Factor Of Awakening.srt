1
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:04,480
so good morning

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,919
and welcome to the

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,840
beginning of the week and a new theme

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,280
for these morning teachings

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,520
and the theme is the seven factors of

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,439
awakening

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,439
and it's following

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,240
the practice and the teaching of

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,679
experiencing the mind

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,200
experiencing the mind state the mind

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,520
state or the mind being

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,480
a broader experience of our inner

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,960
interiority our inner life

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,360
than noticing the particular activities

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,200
of mind that are operating for example

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,559
thinking

17
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,680
or particular emotions going on

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,559
and the state of mind is kind of like

19
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,199
the mood or the atmosphere or the

20
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,480
general state of uh

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:05,120
way we are our b state of being almost

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,119
and and so as we become

23
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,840
experience a state of mind more fully

24
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,720
we start becoming aware that there are

25
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,200
different

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,479
states of mind that we can experience or

27
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:20,960
different

28
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,360
qualities different characteristics

29
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,400
features of the state of mind

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,119
and these seven factors of awakening can

31
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:31,840
be seen

32
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,240
as both as particular practices we do

33
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,360
and also as a state's

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,920
qualities or characteristics of the

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,680
state of mind

36
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,040
or the state of awareness that as that

37
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,960
state of awareness state of mind becomes

38
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,720
more highlighted

39
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,640
and becomes more noticed and something

40
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,439
we can rest in and feel

41
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,079
then we can start noticing

42
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,479
these qualities of awareness these

43
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,399
qualities of our state of mind

44
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,119
state of awareness and um

45
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,280
the um so there are seven of them

46
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,480
and the first is usually in english

47
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,720
translated as mindfulness

48
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,840
the second in english usually is

49
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,239
investigation

50
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,879
then effort joy

51
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,800
tranquility samadhi

52
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,680
usually translated as concentration and

53
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,280
equanimity

54
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,040
and these are considered the crown

55
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,040
jewels of buddhism

56
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,519
they are sometimes actually likened

57
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,519
apparently in ancient india

58
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,360
a a monarch had seven jewels that kind

59
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:47,840
of

60
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,840
were the represented the monarchy

61
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,440
and uh and may and so in buddhism those

62
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,879
seven jewels

63
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,319
are the seven factors of awakening

64
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,800
kind of a curious metaphor that's found

65
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,480
in the ancient texts

66
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,239
is that the um it's like this

67
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,440
a monarch that uh

68
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,040
has seven special sets of clothes

69
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,720
suits to wear at different occasions and

70
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,319
and so in the same way that a monarch

71
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,360
has a special maybe affluent

72
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,480
sets of clothes to wear

73
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,120
so buddhist practitioners as they

74
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,680
develop

75
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,400
in practice have these seven factors of

76
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,840
awakening

77
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,519
as their suit it's a kind of strange

78
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,599
metaphor but i think that

79
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,480
maybe what's suggested by it is a suit

80
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,080
is something you wear for a while

81
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,680
instead of clothes you wear it for a

82
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,640
while

83
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,319
and so these different factors of

84
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,000
awakening

85
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,840
at different times different ones of

86
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,560
them represent the state of mind we are

87
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,280
in

88
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,040
and we kind of wear that state for a

89
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,680
while so there can be a time

90
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,400
when mindfulness involves a great sense

91
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,439
of

92
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,400
clear awareness and the clear sense of

93
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,680
awareness stands out

94
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,760
and that's the state of that's the

95
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,680
primary characteristics of our state of

96
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,280
mind

97
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,120
other times it might be that there's a

98
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,320
great sense of tranquility or a great

99
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,360
sense of joy

100
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,600
or great sense of unification or samadhi

101
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,360
or a great state of equanimity that

102
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,160
stands out of these sec seven factor

103
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,639
awakening each one can stand out

104
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,400
and be the primary characteristic

105
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,320
or it's possible to be aware of all

106
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,680
seven um

107
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,919
kind of imbalance kind of all kind of

108
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,080
working together in a certain way and

109
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,960
we can recognize them together and and

110
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,840
or maybe

111
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,280
see how we need to bring them into

112
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,960
balance

113
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,280
and many years ago when i sat a long

114
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,880
retreat

115
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,880
at some point in the practice these

116
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,880
seven factors awakening stood out in

117
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,080
highlight

118
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,400
and which they can and when the mind is

119
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,320
really settled and at peace

120
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,479
then these become the some of the

121
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,479
primary characteristics of what

122
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,320
we notice in mindfulness because

123
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,080
everything else is kind of abated and

124
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,479
gotten quiet and still and peaceful

125
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,360
and these seven factors are what remains

126
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,280
and i found myself that i was kind of

127
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,720
balanced i was actually instructed to

128
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,919
balance them

129
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,160
bring them into balance and at some

130
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,160
point the teacher said

131
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,800
i've noticed that when you talk about

132
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,520
bringing these

133
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,160
seven factors of awakening into balance

134
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,039
you never

135
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,680
talk about equanimity it seems like

136
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,560
you're always

137
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,520
tinkering with them and uh and then i

138
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,720
realized yes

139
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,400
i was always kind of thinking i had to

140
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,320
fix them and get them just right

141
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,960
and i had no equanimity around whatever

142
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,560
state i was in

143
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,400
and that helped me kind of to settle

144
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,840
back and become more equanimous

145
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,600
so the first of these seven factors of

146
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,840
awakening is um

147
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,360
ancient pali word for it sati

148
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,840
and translated a number of different

149
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,440
ways and

150
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,120
mindfulness is the most common in

151
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,560
english

152
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,000
and um but the way that

153
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,960
mindfulness practices come to the west

154
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,960
there are many things that are

155
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,440
called mindfulness all of them may be

156
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,960
appropriately so

157
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,319
but sometimes what mindfulness is uh is

158
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,120
referred to as a clear recognition of

159
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,080
what's happening

160
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,400
so it's a cognitive act act of

161
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,520
recognizing

162
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,280
hearing if you're hearing my voice right

163
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,560
now or

164
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,520
or recognizing there's pressure on your

165
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,759
butt if you're sitting on a chair

166
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,360
or that the recognition oh

167
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,720
my hand is cold but my torso is warm

168
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,479
and so there's the clear recognition of

169
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,880
things and sometimes that's represented

170
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,800
by

171
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
using mental notes where that

172
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,160
recognition is a little bit more

173
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,440
highlighted

174
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,240
and and focused with the mental noting

175
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,639
sometimes what's called mindfulness is

176
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,560
feeling experiencing sensing experiences

177
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,199
and some teachers really emphasize not

178
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:23,599
uh

179
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,080
these languages of feeling feel your

180
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,240
your breathing sense your breathing

181
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,360
experience what's going on and um and so

182
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,160
it's set more

183
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,560
sensory and so we're kind of resting in

184
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,440
the sensory capacity of the body to be

185
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,479
to be mindful to be aware

186
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,280
and sometimes what's uh emphasizes the

187
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:43,759
power

188
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,080
observation and and uh

189
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,560
and what's the just simply observe

190
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,000
what's happening

191
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,680
and but don't interfere with it

192
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,280
and all those three recognition

193
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,560
feeling and observing are emphasized by

194
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,160
the buddha

195
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,840
as practices that we can do but it's

196
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,400
but it's not necessarily what he calls

197
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,240
sati or mindfulness

198
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,919
he calls these other words for those

199
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,440
activities

200
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,199
and and but what those other activities

201
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,160
are they're part of

202
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,199
mindfulness practice

203
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,319
because they're the practices that lead

204
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,599
to

205
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,280
sati lead to a state of awareness

206
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,800
and what we're looking for is we

207
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,560
practice these things clearly

208
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,399
recognizing what's happening

209
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,279
focusing on the breathing feeling the

210
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,200
experience more fully

211
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,680
um observing the experience as it's

212
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,880
happening

213
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,080
is what we're moving towards is a state

214
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,240
of awareness

215
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,640
and uh the sometimes it's been

216
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,800
translated when it becomes a state

217
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,279
pikabody sometimes used the translation

218
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,440
of lucid awareness

219
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,160
and there's a sense of lucidity a

220
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,279
clarity an

221
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,160
openness a luminosity

222
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,240
it's all these metaphors that people try

223
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,360
to use to describe

224
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,440
the the state of mindfulness

225
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,200
and it's not easy to be there it's not

226
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,680
easy to rest in that state or be with it

227
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,839
and that's why in the process of

228
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,240
anapanasati deepening practice that with

229
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,240
time we get a sense of

230
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,519
of this the state of mind we can also

231
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,200
then become aware there's a state of

232
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,560
awareness that's

233
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,720
almost coterminous with the state of

234
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,080
mind it's almost

235
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,720
almost the same thing or occurs within

236
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,519
the same domain

237
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,200
and so sati mindfulness as a state

238
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,000
that we allow for and so i think that

239
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,760
the word english word awareness

240
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,560
is my preferred way of then translating

241
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,680
sati

242
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,440
and um we can and we are aware

243
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,839
we say i am aware and

244
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,279
and so to kind of paraphrase descartes

245
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,200
i i am aware therefore i am

246
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,560
and um and the and the word i am

247
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,880
uh almost applies kind of almost an

248
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,399
identity

249
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,720
uh like this is this this kind of

250
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,240
defines me

251
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,920
so this i am aware kind of suggests this

252
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,600
broad kind of way of

253
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,720
being or just existing in a certain way

254
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,279
existing in awareness

255
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,399
not easy to rest in or be with

256
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,279
but it is possible and one of the ways

257
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,680
to

258
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,360
get to that is to begin

259
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,000
living at the speed of mindfulness

260
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,440
and this is a particularly

261
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,720
valuable to do while on a retreat where

262
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,240
you know nothing really has to be done

263
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,360
there's no hurry to do anything

264
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,160
hopefully and and where there's more

265
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,519
time to take it easy

266
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,680
and just kind of do things maybe at a

267
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,839
slower pace than usual

268
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,079
and so to practice at the speed of

269
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,519
mindfulness

270
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,320
means to or say it differently to

271
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,839
practice at the speed

272
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,279
of awareness and what i mean by that

273
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,839
is to

274
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,680
do things whatever you're going to do do

275
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,360
them at the speed

276
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,040
that keeps you close closely aware

277
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,720
of being aware that that you're

278
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,760
cognizant of yourself being aware as you

279
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,079
do

280
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,680
it in whatever way awareness is for you

281
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,279
in a particular time through

282
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,800
the recognition of what you're doing as

283
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,279
you're doing it by sensing and feeling

284
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,480
it as you do it

285
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,959
or simply observing it quietly from the

286
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,800
kind of in the

287
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,959
back of the mind or something that um

288
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,639
you um you sense it and feel it so

289
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,720
so um the um

290
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,040
so you so you the speed of mindfulness

291
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,079
speed of awareness

292
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,399
is to stay close you know you're doing

293
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,440
it you know you're

294
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,519
part of it you're allowing something to

295
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,360
register in the present moment

296
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,680
around the experience as opposed to

297
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,440
doing things so quickly

298
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,040
that you're ahead of yourself you're

299
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,480
into the next thing you're more

300
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,800
thinking about the next thing and then

301
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,800
just really beating for each thing you

302
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,920
do

303
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,560
and so it doesn't necessarily mean you

304
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,160
have to do things slowly i

305
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,800
i was a fast order cook after i came

306
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,480
back from

307
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,959
three years in a zen monastery and i

308
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,600
learned to be very aware

309
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,519
spinning around and doing many things at

310
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,800
once in the kitchen working fast

311
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,760
in some ways i found it easier to be

312
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,800
aware there because

313
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,040
i would just let go of all my

314
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,200
distractions just be in the dance of the

315
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,440
kitchen

316
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,120
so it doesn't necessarily have to be

317
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,800
fast as slow

318
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,959
but generally especially on retreat

319
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,040
generally for most people that's the

320
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,000
kind of beginning the access point for

321
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,639
that to happen

322
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,760
so the mindfulness

323
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,560
the first factor of awakening and

324
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,720
sometimes seen as a particular activity

325
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,440
of mind

326
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,920
practice we do and sometimes as a state

327
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,360
of mind

328
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,519
and hopefully the activity of doing it

329
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,399
the practice

330
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,440
leads to this lucidity of awareness the

331
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,760
state of mind a state of being mindful

332
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,920
state of being aware

333
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,680
and that you'll feel the goodness of

334
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,120
that and the freedom of it

335
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,519
and the benefits of doing that

336
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,880
so thank you and

337
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,079
and we'll continue

338
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,120
these morning talks with the factors

339
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,720
awakening tomorrow
