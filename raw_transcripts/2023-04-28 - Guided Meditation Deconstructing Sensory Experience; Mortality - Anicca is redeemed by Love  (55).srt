1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:08,820
so uh so welcome folks good morning to most of you again

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:15,420
afternoon to uh to some maybe uh so Thailand in there too so uh welcome to

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,420
you wherever you are um

4
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,800
yeah there's always a little bit of a dilemma for me about how uh precise or

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,000
impressionistic to be in giving instructions and I

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,640
feel like I almost always err on the side of uh the impressionistic

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,640
kind of element of of just dropping Dharma thoughts

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:55,739
into the mind that catalyze a certain kind of view but um there is a place for

9
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:02,840
um yeah for precision and uh attentional Direction

10
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,540
and we can do that I feel without uh

11
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:16,680
incarnating a meditator self that is it's cramped

12
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,720
tricky but we can do it so anyway I thought today it would be a

13
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:29,040
little um more technique-y and um share something that's been

14
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:36,180
meaningful for me from my teacher I sat with her a long time since then Young

15
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:43,979
I don't his technique is always evolving and so I don't even know if I'm representing it appropriately as he kind

16
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:52,259
of tweaks and develops it but um uh yeah the the kind of core of

17
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:58,340
it is discriminating between three core sensory

18
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:05,280
events namely visual thinking so my eyes are closed but I've got the computer

19
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,739
screen got the room outline of my body

20
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:18,300
no simpler no no more complex than that there's words in our own mind auditory

21
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:24,660
thinking we can actually sense a kind of spatial location to thinking

22
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:32,700
and so if I told you to say your name silently in your own head you would actually hear it somewhere

23
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:38,780
it wouldn't actually be happening there but there would be like

24
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:47,519
I don't know if it's echolocation or or something but it's almost like this sense of it happens in a place the way

25
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,980
that almost like holographically arises in a place usually in the head between

26
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:59,599
the ears somewhere like that and then there is affect in the body

27
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:05,959
emotionally charged Sensations and

28
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:12,480
different from kind of physicality of okay I'm tapping on my chest that

29
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:19,379
sensation is quite different from the sensation I would feel at the same place if I suddenly heard a loud noise the

30
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:26,159
startled I feel a jolt of sensation but it would be emotional in nature

31
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,940
responsive in nature kind of

32
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:39,659
essentially wordless surveying of threat and opportunity Moment by moment

33
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:46,739
very kind of foundational to animal body

34
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:55,080
so they're seeing there's hearing there's feeling and we begin to discriminate between

35
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:01,860
those three sensory events paying attention to their arising and passing

36
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:09,900
and there's really no distress if we're we have like a mindful relationship with

37
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:16,739
those three sensory Gates um there's not really much place for

38
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:26,639
distress to arise outside of them so the Panic the dissatisfaction the

39
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:33,740
longing the the suffering suffering

40
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:42,600
has to have its fingerprint here and we bring our open heart to it

41
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,600
and

42
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:58,759
this is uh this is Zia's phone so let's uh let's sit together

43
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,800
relaxing everything that can be relaxed

44
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,860
the spine extending

45
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:18,120
to the heavens the rest of the body just hanging loosely

46
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,919
from that Central column

47
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,639
and we practice surrendering

48
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:12,139
surrendering to imperfection surrendering our willfulness

49
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:22,460
surrendering the subtle violence of self-improvement

50
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,740
Vinnie Ferrara says foreign

51
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,780
there's not much time left

52
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,940
time to let go

53
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:25,740
and so for a minute just sensitizing to the visual aspect of thinking behind the

54
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:33,258
closed eyes against the kind of blank mental screen

55
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,740
images memory

56
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:48,320
maybe an image of my face even if your eyes are closed

57
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:58,519
an image of the outline of your body or the room

58
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:11,839
sometimes the images are photographic but often melting and morphing

59
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:34,200
and when we direct attention for example to our breathing or our body generally

60
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:40,519
it's often aided by a subtle visual thinking

61
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,519
it's bound up with proprioception

62
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:10,279
Imaging our body World Moment by moment

63
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,300
the mental notes it's very simple

64
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,720
seeing

65
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:59,279
and if upon noticing noting

66
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:06,560
visual thinking it melts away we notice the

67
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:12,920
blankness for the Tranquility that replaces it

68
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:33,420
now putting that down and bringing attention to auditory

69
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:36,380
thinking

70
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:05,160
normally we just call that thinking with the words the senses the phrases

71
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,920
the voice over the narrator

72
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,459
this constellates in the this auditory thinking world

73
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:35,480
and our default is to

74
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:43,140
endow our auditory thinking with Incredible Trust

75
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:55,639
every thought pinging or being

76
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:05,880
every thought and subtly or dramatically adjusting the parameters of our body

77
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,360
mind

78
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:19,980
but now rather than obeying the voice in our head as if it were God

79
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:25,500
we just listen to it as The Voice

80
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,639
in our head

81
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,839
and so we we're very vividly

82
00:14:52,820 --> 00:15:03,139
examine the drama and melodrama of identification

83
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:18,260
the ways we incarnate in a thought and you know becoming identified

84
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:26,600
take birth as a protagonist

85
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:03,120
from within a thought we lose all sense of attentional

86
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,120
autonomy

87
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:17,839
then we wake up the sentence ends the paragraph and

88
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,199
we're reborn as a meditator

89
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:38,220
the mental note is simple hearing

90
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,459
and if at the end of

91
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:54,019
in making the note or a sentence coming to an end

92
00:16:54,019 --> 00:17:01,519
there's just silence we listen to The Silence

93
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:20,298
and then lastly feeling just the tuning to

94
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:30,059
emotional circuits in your body the building blocks of motivation

95
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:37,640
urgency affirming and objecting

96
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:53,220
sometimes we know what's arising or it's easy to give a

97
00:17:53,220 --> 00:18:01,820
name to the feeling to the affect arising sometimes it's just a vague something state of arousal state of

98
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,779
pleasant or unpleasant

99
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:15,860
sometimes it's happening in one part of our body sometimes more broadly

100
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:29,779
sometimes intense but sometimes subtle and subtle is significant Shenzhen would always say

101
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:45,799
the note is feeling

102
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:05,059
and so now we we can practice opening to all

103
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:13,860
three sensory experiences not necessarily at the same time

104
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:20,700
but uh the attention may be drawn to a visual

105
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:28,520
thinking to auditory thinking to feeling in the body Body Sensations

106
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:35,100
charged with emotion and of course more than one may be

107
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:40,440
arising at the same time but we just choose one to focus on doesn't matter

108
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:49,679
which maybe we stay with that arising

109
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:55,440
for a few seconds maybe it vanishes before that we just

110
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,020
notice it's gone

111
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:17,100
maybe you use the mental notes could just be as simple as see

112
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:23,059
here or feel

113
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:11,419
sometimes I'll simply cycle through these three sensory spheres

114
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:21,480
is checking in with the CNN

115
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,039
for a few moments

116
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,299
hearing

117
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,480
healing

118
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,520
and then around again

119
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,919
and pouring mindfulness equanimity

120
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,860
into each moment

121
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:13,820
the tango of I am-ness

122
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,240
begins to untangle

123
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,020
foreign

124
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:33,200
okay it's good to uh good to sit with you

125
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,539
um foreign

126
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:51,360
so uh uh roomy

127
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:58,380
if you bake bread with the wheat that grows on My Grave you'll become drunk

128
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:06,299
with joy and even the oven will recite ecstatic poems

129
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:13,080
if you come to pay your respects even my gravestone will invite you to dance

130
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:18,200
so don't come without your drum

131
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,640
I want to uh want to die that way

132
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:35,340
if um Anita

133
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:41,120
doesn't soften us it it'll break our heart

134
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:51,140
when when we don't meet Anita with with wisdom

135
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:59,960
the kind of default tendency will be to cling more tightly to double down on

136
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:07,320
fulfilling this craving or that craving and it might work a tiny bit but it

137
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:14,659
doesn't really work and so so what does it mean

138
00:32:14,659 --> 00:32:23,299
what does it mean to meet uh to meet Anita with wisdom

139
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:31,460
I think it can look a lot of ways it can look a lot of ways sometimes it's a very

140
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:37,880
cooled out State very equanimous

141
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:44,279
there is this sense of death being huge and it also being not a big deal not

142
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:50,100
such a big deal let us not be grandiose

143
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:58,679
right it's like a certain times when I especially when I see animal suffering you know

144
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:04,080
I know we're different from ants or something but just

145
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:11,820
um I don't know it's like uh this huge quality of death feels like

146
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:21,360
um largely a testament to my grandiosity and my enormous ego you know like I do

147
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:28,740
sometimes think of myself as a kind of overgrown intelligent

148
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:36,360
insect with an enormous ego basically

149
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:43,620
okay I may not be grandiose the just utter

150
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:52,398
naturalness of birth and death drain some of the melodrama

151
00:33:53,519 --> 00:34:00,200
and sometimes wisdom meeting and each looks like uh looks like gratitude

152
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:07,380
this is a Amy cross Rosenthal writer after very

153
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:13,378
serious diagnosis she says when I'm feeling dreary annoyed

154
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:19,858
generally unimpressed by life I imagine what it would be like to come back to

155
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:24,960
this world for just a day after having been dead

156
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,419
I imagine how sentimental I would feel about the very things I once found

157
00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:38,398
stupid hateful or mundane oh there's a light switch

158
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:45,480
I haven't seen a light switch in so long I didn't realize how much I missed light

159
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:53,339
switches oh oh and look the stairs up to our front porch are

160
00:34:53,339 --> 00:35:00,540
still completely cracked hello cracks let me get a good look at you

161
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:07,260
and there's my neighbor standing there fantastically alive just the stain

162
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:13,140
still punctuating her sentences with you know what I'm saying

163
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:19,380
why did that bother me it's so endearing

164
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:28,099
it's easy to acclimatize to goodness

165
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:34,880
and uh we want to wake up to it

166
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:41,880
sometimes wisdom um meeting a Nietzsche looks like

167
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:47,220
grieving it's like grieving and

168
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:53,880
classically grieving is is sort of in the clustered with the afflictive

169
00:35:53,880 --> 00:36:01,079
emotions same category is anger something like this

170
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:06,740
but um I I

171
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,760
Elevate grieving in a way doesn't feel at least certain species of

172
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:21,119
it does not feel in any way afflictive and it's very hard for me to imagine

173
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:29,520
ourselves as moral creatures capable of causing harm capable of

174
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:34,560
Rippling love very hard for me to conceive of how we

175
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:42,480
can look at the carnival of greed hidden delusion and not feel some grief

176
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,060
and we all um have our

177
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:55,260
our archetypes and our our visions of Freedom or what we aspire to

178
00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:03,440
and it's not shared by all by any stretch but for me I do want my Buddha

179
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:10,280
to uh to grieve that um

180
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:19,320
that uh kind of elevated response to the poignancy

181
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,400
The Human Condition

182
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:31,740
so on this last day considering the uh the Council of mortality it's about

183
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:37,200
grief and love the real Redemption

184
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:44,339
of mortality is uh is more love

185
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:50,660
More Love deeper wider

186
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:58,200
and um how is how is how is grief redeemed you

187
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:05,820
know in this realm of loss how is grief redeemed and uh I don't know I'm sure we all have

188
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:12,960
our own answers but to my mind it's art and love this these are the redemptions

189
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:22,200
of grief Norman Fisher says when you love uh when

190
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:28,079
someone you love is gone that person can't do anything anymore

191
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:35,940
this means you have to do something or you have to do something differently somehow you were connected to that

192
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:42,960
person have to do what they can no longer do you have to ask yourself now that this

193
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:50,700
has happened what will I do what will I do in place of my friend

194
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:57,660
there is always something to be done when we stop creating the unnecessary

195
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:02,760
suffering we can notice all the real suffering around us

196
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:10,740
are the fake unnecessary suffering is actually distracting us protecting us in a way

197
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:16,920
from the real suffering around us the real suffering is much more

198
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:24,720
intractable it's horribly painful but it connects us to everyone else in

199
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:31,020
the world and so in that sense the real suffering is okay

200
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:36,839
we become numb an isolated because we want to avoid the suffering

201
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:42,599
but it's the numbness and isolation that feel the worst

202
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:48,720
when we break through the necessary suffering and connect with others it's

203
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,180
hard it's painful but it's also better

204
00:39:54,180 --> 00:40:03,560
when we open to the real pain of caring for others we do feel better

205
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:14,400
um what will I do in place of my friend

206
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,920
that is a a very worthy question it's a very

207
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,000
worthy question

208
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:29,839
and uh

209
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:39,500
so much of um of anxiety

210
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:44,880
uh anxiety sometimes described as the the

211
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:53,579
uh the intolerance of uncertainty so much of the anxiety is about

212
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:59,820
our anxiety is about not knowing the agitation that arises out of

213
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:07,520
not knowing out of uncertainty and um

214
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:16,160
but we already actually do know how the story ends

215
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,940
Everything Changes

216
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:31,740
and so the kind of anxiety and frenzy and

217
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:38,460
numbness that can be drained out

218
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:43,560
and it's just kind of heartfelt connection

219
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:51,660
The Human Condition and for sure it's hard it's painful we

220
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:57,500
call that grief but it's also better

221
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:04,339
so much better

222
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:22,338
a lot lot of room for uh for love

223
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:35,660
so I offer this for your consideration and uh

224
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:43,200
please pick up what is useful or what um

225
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:51,020
feels uh native to your own heart and leave the rest behind

226
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:55,820
uh we all have to find our way
