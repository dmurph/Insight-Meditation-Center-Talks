8
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,920
sit

9
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:09,280
just uh breathing in a way that Smooths

10
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,800
out the uh energy in your

11
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:31,760
body we're not trying to make what is painful Pleasant

12
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:44,239
we're just integrating the felt sense of the

13
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,840
body with our

14
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:58,760
breathing so that the awareness fills out your whole

15
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,760
body

16
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,320
breathing into

17
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:30,680
uh the numbed out or flat zones of the body maybe the back of

18
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:40,560
body certain portions of your body tend to uh be

19
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,199
unnoticed don't have much uh access

20
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:49,199
to

21
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
sensation

22
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,919
then breathing into the intensity is the kind

23
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,600
of hot

24
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,000
spots so that they might be soothed in some

25
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,479
way

26
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:16,440
and so the the whole constellation of Sensations that

27
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:24,240
is uh the experience of our body it's kind of lit up from

28
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:31,400
within by awareness

29
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,640
Dharma practice is about uh

30
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
learning

31
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,000
but it's uh not about a kind of

32
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:22,839
continuation of the autobiography that we've been reiterating to

33
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:31,040
ourselves it's not the next chapter

34
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
in that same

35
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,040
autobiography it's a radical

36
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,639
relinquishment and it doesn't mean you can never have your story

37
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:04,800
again doesn't mean your past is meaningless or

38
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,560
anything of the

39
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,040
sort but we

40
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,880
practice

41
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:35,120
surrendering surrendering such that it doesn't feel like uh this

42
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,240
moment is tacked on to the story we've always been

43
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
telling

44
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:21,199
we remind ourselves of our autobiography in so many ways what I

45
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:26,319
like what I dislike what I want and

46
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:34,160
need where I my life has been where I want it

47
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:40,279
to go this

48
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:46,920
meditation sandwiched painfully between past and a

49
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,839
future the headquarters of Matthew

50
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,240
orchestrating choreographing Dharma

51
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:16,639
practice we surrender all of

52
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
that

53
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:44,439
we don't try to drag all of that knowing into this

54
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
moment

55
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:12,240
instead we get more

56
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,240
more

57
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:29,880
precise these thin slices of sensory experience

58
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,199
the body the body

59
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:53,639
breathing we surrender The Familiar reference

60
00:14:53,639 --> 00:15:00,959
points and fall into to the

61
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
present

62
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:18,480
in any given moment a million things are right and a

63
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,158
million are

64
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:34,960
wrong but we're so perpetually

65
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,240
startled by the way that this ambivalent

66
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:55,360
realm part of the the value the practice of equinity is uh

67
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:04,240
we don't need to sort this out anymore just take for

68
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,720
granted that there's loveliness and

69
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:31,960
imperfection the sense of of self the kind

70
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,120
of freezing of our

71
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:42,559
autobiography it's a little bit like a maybe

72
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:48,360
a a hologram

73
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,280
cast by the

74
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,120
spotlight of clinging

75
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:34,720
equinity it's the practice of non

76
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
clinging

77
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:06,080
we can only keep track of ourselves who what we

78
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:11,360
are when we're trying to leverage this

79
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:24,640
moment trying to make this moment about

80
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:31,520
another making this moment a Down payment on something

81
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,480
else so we

82
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:59,600
surrender surrender into a

83
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,360
sense of futur

84
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:24,960
lessness this is a a different kind of way of

85
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,520
learning

86
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,349
[Music]

87
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:05,480
okay um good to sit with you uh I hope those instructions made some sense

88
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,679
or something

89
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:19,399
um and uh you know just as a word I sort of like presume that people have kind of

90
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:25,960
uh have their own meditation experience I'm not that would not be a good first

91
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:32,200
meditation instruction so I apologize if that was your first

92
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,919
um anyway I'm happy to be with you and

93
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:45,880
uh uh it's been a while since I've been here um on on YouTube and uh yeah

94
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:53,159
excited to uh explore so

95
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:58,919
um it's hard to uh it's hard to talk about

96
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:08,519
um about Dharma um because what is wisdom in one moment is

97
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:15,159
a mistake in another and I'm not saying that to be cute it's like what is wisdom in one

98
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:22,679
moment is a mistake in another and there is no no single kind

99
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:28,320
of Dharma drum that we can just march to Independent of

100
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,919
context independent of the Nuance of of

101
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:41,039
samsara this world and wisdom really creates the path

102
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:46,360
rather than follows it it's not that there's a pre-ordained path and then wisdom is just following it we're

103
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:53,919
actually creating a path and the way it strikes me the way

104
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:59,799
that delusion works is often not that we do kind of like the opposite of the

105
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:05,080
teachings it's not that the teachings say do X and we do not

106
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:10,200
X the way delusion works is we pick the wrong

107
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:17,720
teaching we pick the teaching that allows us to act out our

108
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:25,360
underlying habit energy or craving and so we

109
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:32,360
need Fierce Det determination and we pick self-compassion or we need

110
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:39,240
self-compassion and we pick Fierce determination and part of this skill in

111
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:45,639
Dharma practice is knowing um which teaching to reach

112
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:54,200
for and the Dharma is really it's found in kind of these Dynamic tensions right

113
00:32:54,200 --> 00:33:01,200
like determination self-compassion passion these things pairs of

114
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,240
values that we um we dance

115
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:13,000
between and I a couple years ago on on this

116
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,559
stream I highlighted uh a few Pairs and uh this week more pairs of of these

117
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:25,240
values we dance between and this week it's really it's a kind of dialectic of

118
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:31,960
the more assertive quality ities of mind and the more receptive

119
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:37,279
qualities and so today um confidence and

120
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:42,960
humility confidence and humility so much

121
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,880
confidence and so much humility and maybe it sounds like those are

122
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,960
in you know deep tension but they're they're

123
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,960
really complimentary heart qualities

124
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:06,760
so the more the more deeply we taste the Dharma the more devotional we become the

125
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:14,679
more confident we become uh we don't have to be a devotional person I I don't I don't know

126
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:22,000
that I would cast myself as a devotional person or a devotional type

127
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,480
um but um when your heart is nourished by the

128
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:34,560
Dharma in the way that it can nourish us you just bow

129
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:41,839
down it breathes a kind of devotional

130
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:48,480
reverence so Gil um wrote uh uh he

131
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:55,320
said um Awakening is not the end of practice Awakening is the confirmation

132
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:01,240
that the practice works Awakening solidifies our confidence in Dharma

133
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:08,320
practice we understand that when done sincerely a beginner's practice is as valuable and meaningful as that of an

134
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:16,079
experienced practitioner the greater our maturity with practice the more often and more

135
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:24,480
confidently we can begin aresh always ready to keep

136
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:32,240
practicing when I think about characterizing uh kind of some of the

137
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:39,560
the effects of of practice one piece that feels important is there's there's sort of

138
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:44,680
um there's no more doubt that my my real

139
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:50,680
life is like just out there

140
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:58,079
somewhere it's just this it's just this and there's no more more sense of

141
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:05,359
um dislocation the kind of subtle alienation that who I am my

142
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:11,280
life is sort of like just beyond my reach that I'm chasing

143
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,560
something down that um uh that in my aspiration um

144
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:25,720
there's a sense of dislocation and alienation no just this

145
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:32,000
enough and there's a sense of of um a deep kind

146
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:39,960
of selfconfidence self-confidence which I would say is is something akin

147
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:48,000
to like a sense of complete sufficiency right sufficiency not not

148
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:55,160
greatness not amazing not special complete

149
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:02,680
sufficiency we come to learn we understand more we

150
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:11,319
become more confident better and better at predicting what leads us to

151
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:18,000
happiness and so often in our life we're sort of surprised that when we get what

152
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,200
we want it's different than what we thought we were

153
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:30,119
getting we become more calibrated in this way we're better predictors of our

154
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:35,119
own happiness and that breeds a kind of

155
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:42,119
confidence we become more confident that no matter what happens in our life what

156
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:48,560
befalls us uh there's some way that Dharma can

157
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:58,040
sanctify it that that um forges a kind of

158
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:04,480
is confidence so yeah

159
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:12,240
confidence and still it is such a humbling path right oh my goodness if

160
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:18,720
you're not being humbled you're not practicing right

161
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:27,319
um we all have um you know zones where we're a little bit you know

162
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:32,760
bewildered by life and it feels like well we're doing

163
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:39,960
the best we can but we're kind of making it up as we go along we don't we don't know how to do

164
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:45,319
this you know and all the learning and all the goodness and all the whatever

165
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:53,079
freedom is ours is sort of just like we feel like children again bewildered what

166
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:59,680
to do don't know it's humbling it's humbling it's

167
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:07,000
humbling to see the gap between what we know intellectually and what what we

168
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:14,599
have actually realized what we've actually realized are

169
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:21,119
um it's only realization that changes behavior and I'm not saying only

170
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:28,200
Enlightenment changes Behavior but only only uh that which has been realized

171
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:36,319
rather than known intellectually changes our Behavior it's humbling to see how easily

172
00:39:36,319 --> 00:39:41,960
we can be uh deceived how easily we can be deceived

173
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:48,560
you know by seduced by our own mind seduced by the

174
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:53,920
very deeply camouflaged mechanisms of

175
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:01,680
clinging the Mind builds a kind of House of Cards and then where we live in that

176
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:10,599
house and then it collapses and what we thought of was truth was really a kind of

177
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:17,160
confabulation of greed and aversion a a way that we've concocted

178
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:25,960
something concocted something we're not lying we're not lying but we've um

179
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:34,400
we've concocted something out of our

180
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:40,800
clinging and so to begin to wake up to just to see how easy it is to kind of

181
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:47,119
pull a fast one on ourselves uh this is humbling this is

182
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:55,319
humbling and it might just be a a micro mood where it's like we just become convinced of

183
00:40:55,319 --> 00:41:01,520
something and then the energy in Body Mind changes we go outside we look at

184
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:10,240
the sky we take a breath we see a smile we do something and that house of cards Falls

185
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:18,560
you know it's humbling to um to

186
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:24,079
see and so humility is a kind of openness

187
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:29,760
to uh the data of of this moment but a

188
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:37,440
an unwillingness to cover over the mystery with self-serving

189
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:46,319
certainties we learn on this path right but we can never irreversibly rule out

190
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:53,119
the possibility that wisdom is delusion and that that sounds maybe

191
00:41:53,119 --> 00:42:01,160
haunting or something but it's sort of thrilling to me you know that it's like everything the

192
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:06,200
structure of science actually everything is awaiting

193
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:13,040
disconfirmation yeah and that doesn't lead us into a kind of instability or

194
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:22,880
something like that is just all tentative we have to keep

195
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:28,160
looking reading something uh

196
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:34,640
uh when uh when research you know research subjects when they when they

197
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:41,880
claim to be 98% certain about something they're wrong about 30% of the time when

198
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:47,559
when they estimate 99.9% certainty they were wrong 19% of

199
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:53,680
the time and when we subjects them we we

200
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:59,000
when subjects estimated 99 9999

201
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,839
n% certainty they were wrong 133% of the

202
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:09,920
time something funny to me about

203
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:16,440
that so the permanent the permanent possibility of being

204
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:23,960
wrong demands that we hedge we

205
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:31,240
hedge don't know we hedge epistemologically about about knowing we

206
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,680
hedge

207
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:45,000
morally to forget the the kind of permanent possibility of

208
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:51,559
uh uh of being wrong is is the first step towards

209
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:00,960
violence and

210
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:07,480
uh and so the humility um

211
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:12,839
humility uh of which I speak is is um

212
00:44:12,839 --> 00:44:22,078
actually moves Us in the direction nonviolence so much confidence so much

213
00:44:22,839 --> 00:44:31,559
humility so offer this for your um consideration this morning and uh

214
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:39,480
um uh I wish you uh wish you all a good day and and uh we'll we'll keep going

215
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:45,000
