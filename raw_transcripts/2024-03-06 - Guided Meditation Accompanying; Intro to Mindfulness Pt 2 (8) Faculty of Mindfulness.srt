00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,640
hello from the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:12,639
City and um welcome to this guided

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:23,480
meditation and we're in the middle of a five part series on the faculties

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:31,320
of of uh Faith energy mindfulness concentration and

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,879
wisdom the supports that we have within us waiting for us to their their potentials within

6
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:43,360
us waiting for us to use to engage to support us to be

7
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,160
present to overcome the way the mind obscures the present moment with its

8
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:55,920
distractions and preoccupations and

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,320
um so today it's mindfulness and mind mindfulness is such a

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,360
fantastic potential capacity we have and

11
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:15,680
it it's it's uh such a rich aspect of our capacity for

12
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:23,200
attention and we have many capacities many Senseo for attention we can pay

13
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,680
attention with our tongue as we taste nose as we smell ears as we listen

14
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:37,320
and eyes as we see and the body as we have tactile contact with objects in

15
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:45,320
the world and um and then there's other forms of uh perception that we have

16
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,439
there's mental forms of attention that we have we can observe things quietly

17
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:56,079
from The Mind's Eye we can uh know cognitively what's happening as it's

18
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:02,960
happening and all of these together contribute to what can be called

19
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,280
mindfulness and because it's and more so mindfulness is a kind of

20
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,680
multifaceted uh domain of

21
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,720
attention and so because of this over time I I Delight in having different

22
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,680
words to translate the word Sati or different ways of understanding mindfulness

23
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:34,800
today I would like to use the word accomp pment that as we practice mindfulness

24
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,640
we're accompanying our experience standing close to it standing

25
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:48,560
near being near remaining close and um in the in the ancient world

26
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:55,200
there the word the word expression for the practice of mindfulness is Sati

27
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,680
patana Sati is mindfulness and patana can mean standing by standing near

28
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,120
standing uh being approaching to be close

29
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:14,360
to and um so today I'd like to suggest that we practice accompaniment to to

30
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,680
accompany ourselves and exactly what that means is varied depending on

31
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:27,000
situations just like if you're going to accompany a friend who is grieving or is

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,400
Disturbed or troubled by something it depending on the friend depending on circumstances we may be was how close we

33
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:41,640
are uh how close we accompany them as you know you know we hold them by the arm we give them a hug we sit a little

34
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,720
bit further away we give them space um different situations we need to but we're always there we're there

35
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:54,959
accompanying intentional standing by uh being a companion being a um being there

36
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,480
with our experience and just this idea of accompanyment

37
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:07,959
requires some kind of attention and requires something from within us some kind of presence act

38
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:13,000
activated be present and maybe we're to be accompany

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,120
ourselves calmly as you would a friends maybe accompany yourself

40
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,120
kindly accompany yourself as if you're listening deeply what is this here

41
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,160
without asserting your opinions your conclusions your

42
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:38,080
preferences in the situation as if each thing that's happening to you each thing that comes in Awareness the respectful

43
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:45,160
thing to do is to accompany it as it is listening sensing

44
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:51,240
deeply without interpretation Let each thing in a sense

45
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:58,120
speak for itself and you accompany it without

46
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,199
judgment so assuming a meditation

47
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:10,440
posture a posture of care of

48
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:16,080
respect for what you're going to accompany that

49
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,280
you're going to show up and be present sometimes when you're with a

50
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,759
friend you want to be with them so they so that they see that you're attentive

51
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:35,440
you're present you're interested you're listening you're there with

52
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,080
them and sometimes that's done with a

53
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:48,520
posture and for here we're doing this for ourselves being our own

54
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,198
friend dare I say our own best

55
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:04,280
friend so then gently taking a few long slow

56
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:13,720
deep breaths and as you exhale relax and settle in to be here for these minutes

57
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,080
meditating just

58
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
here

59
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:55,800
letting your breathing return to normal and continuing as you exhale

60
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:04,440
relaxing your body so that there's a softer more

61
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:12,520
receptive way of accompanying life as it happens to you

62
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
here

63
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,080
and then settling into your

64
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:59,879
breathing and having the practice the orientation

65
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:06,840
to accompany your body breathing breathing has accompanied you

66
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:13,159
for your lifetime and now you're accompanying

67
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:17,000
breathing returning the

68
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:27,599
favor letting go of distractions

69
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:37,599
preoccupations so you can listen or sense more deeply the experience of the body

70
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:04,880
breathing in any other way that you are that's

71
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:11,519
pulls you away from breathing don't be troubled by

72
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:18,120
that it's the call of something that needs to be

73
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,800
accompanied stand close to it for a while even if it's just your thinking

74
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,120
mind but don't listen to the words

and then as we come to the end of this

115
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:44,080
sitting to again spend some moments

116
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,480
actively accompanying yourself from the inside

117
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:59,600
out an accompanyment that is

118
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:08,919
energized by confidence and faith in the value of being

119
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:18,120
present an accompaniment that's

120
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:23,000
wholehearted with a kind of courageous

121
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:29,520
effort yes this is phenomenally important

122
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:39,159
to be present here and then a kind of certain inner

123
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:47,000
activation that activates accompanying our experience

124
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,120
being there with

125
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:59,518
it and as we feel tensions in our body

126
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:09,440
to soften and relax around them so the accompaniment becomes more

127
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,759
sensitive more

128
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,840
receptive and then

129
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:33,600
to turn your attention outwards to the

130
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,880
world around you people

131
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:47,399

132
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:53,919
town people you'll encounter today known and

133
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:02,840
unknown and then imagine imagine as we come and bring this to a close that you're there

134
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:11,440
to stand with whoever whoever you meet to accompany

135
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:20,000
them and standing with as an English meaning of supporting someone

136
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:32,279
or maybe supporting that which is deepest and most valuable in each

137
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:43,120
person we're there to accompany to listen to be present

138
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:49,559
for where we have confidence in our capacity to

139
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:55,760
accompany that confidence that makes room for kindness and

140
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:04,760
friendliness we're wholehearted accompanyment of course it comes with

141
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:10,840
Good Will anything

142
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:15,518
else is a limitation in our

143

presence and wishing well for everyone you'll encounter

[Music]

151
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,159
free thank you

152
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,880
hello and welcome to this third talk on the five

153
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:41,039
faculties and um sometimes they're called the five controlling

154
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:48,080
faculties so the word control of course is complicated but in the good senses of

155
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:56,399
the term it means that uh we have some choice and and capacity to engage in

156
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:02,720
this practice ice that we're not uh living a life that's at the whims of fi

157
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:09,399
and and uh at the whims of whims that we have some ability to

158
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:15,840
change the direction of our life and change the direction of our mind and our what's happening for

159
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,000
us and so one of those is to activate

160
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,279
choose to activate have the capacity to activate our uh attention for a

161
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:33,320
awareness in a useful way awareness or attention is present

162
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:39,000
for human beings all their waking hours maybe even when we're sleeping to some in certain

163
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:45,440
ways and um and if we don't

164
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,519
choiceful uh engage in activating that

165
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:57,559
capacity using that capacity then our capacity for attention is used by things

166
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:04,919
which are deeper subconscious within us they're hijacked in a sense so if we are

167
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:13,118
not taking control or taking ownership or taking engagement with our Attention

168
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:19,878
our attention might be swept away into our greed or hostility and and U

169
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:27,720
Marshal uh you know recruited for supporting those things or for Fe fear

170
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:33,960
we get hijacked into the fear and attention kind of is food in a sense

171
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:39,118
food for these things so the more attention is hijacked by fear and anger

172
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:46,839
and ill will and greed and envy and doubts and things uh the the the more it

173
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:53,158
thrives the more it gets those things get stronger and which is to our

174
00:34:53,159 --> 00:35:01,160
detriment and so we need to have some choice some agency to engage in

175
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:09,960
mindfulness so it's not being taken over by other things and um and so uh this uh

176
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:16,079
engagement this activation of mindfulness is in the in the family of

177
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,280
things that I've been calling action the Dharma was a the Dharma is a lot about

178
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:27,359
the actions we engage in and mindfulness is one more thing that we practice M

179
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:32,560
practice we it's an activity that we engage in it's an action of

180
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,599
sorts so uh the first faculty confidence

181
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,960
is a confidence that there are things we can do that are beneficial we could

182
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:49,280
practice and in in in uh in core thing in the Dharma practice we the the

183
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:55,599
confidence in the activity of mindfulness and then there's the uh

184
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:00,880
heroic in engagement with that confidence is more I think of more

185
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:08,000
as a quality of the heart heroic effort courage is much more the

186
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,040
activation of the embodiment of who we are to be show up in a full way and then

187
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:19,079
mindfulness is more of in sense more of the mind but we're activating something

188
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:25,319
from the mind so we're have a higher capacity for attentiveness to the

189
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:33,480
present moment and so I give an example if uh if a friend of yours is

190
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:38,720
quite distressed and you're walking in the park and uh you're much more

191
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,960
interested in talking about the movie you watch last night last night and you were fascinated by it and had insights

192
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:50,280
about it and but your friend is really distressed and and actually as you talk about the movie you kind of notice that

193
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:56,200
they're kind of like they're getting quieter and their posture is sinking and they look even more distressed on the

194
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:01,560
edge of tears and at some point it occurs to you wait a minute I don't think that talking

195
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:09,760
about this movie is what's called for here right now my friend is distressed and so then you might decide

196
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,880
let me be present my friend let me turn my attention to my friend and and really

197
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:22,520
kind of accompany them or be with them check check out what's going on here and so there's a choice to activate a

198
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:29,960
certain kind of attentiveness that wasn't present when we were just kind of Carried Away by your fascination with this movie so

199
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:36,960
something's something's being activated out of choice let's listen to the friend let's be accompany my friend in a deep

200
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:42,400
way and one of the good ways to accompany people or listen is to pay

201
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,520
attention to how we listen so you might notice that you're now have tension in

202
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:56,160
your body because maybe you feel like you've blown it and you your friend is going to be angry with you talking about a movie and so you you you you take

203
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:01,599
respons ability for how you are so you can accompany the person well so maybe

204
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:08,440
you're able to relax and settle and put aside your self-c concern in that way so

205
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:13,839
that you can just be really there for your friend and um and as you're there more

206
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:20,880
and more it just seems easy to be there and it feels like now you're kind of attuned to the person and you're not

207
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:27,760
interested in anything else and you don't have to work to be present for your friend and you don't have to track yourself so carefully because you're

208
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:33,000
keep being distracted and you're just there in a nice easy way and you see

209
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,680
that your friend responds accordingly and their mood lifts a little bit they seem to appreciate the attention it

210
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:45,280
seems like you're starting to coming a little bit more in harmony so it all starts by activating a

211
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:53,119
kind of attention another example would be say that you are um really impatient but you

212
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:59,760
decide to go out for fresh air but you're super impatient restlessly impatient so you find yourself kind of

213
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:05,599
speeding around the neighborhood and almost bumping into all the people on this side walk and the kids on the

214
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:11,040
tricycles and because you hardly notice anything after a while uh you start

215
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:18,280
noticing wow you know I'm really something's not quite right here and you notice how impatient you are and how

216
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:24,680
fast you're walking and um and and so you decide to activate something that

217
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:31,599
you activate your capacity to slow down you activate the capacity not to give in

218
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:37,200
to expressing the impatience in how you walk trip you know tripping over the kids and their

219
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,640
tricycles and so you slow down to pay more attention slow down to be with yourself

220
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:48,680
more and then you say then you've learned about mindfulness you learned it's useful to pay attention to your

221
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:53,720
body and you find out there's a lot of body tension with the impatience so you

222
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:58,960
relax your shoulders you relax your eyes your belly

223
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:07,599
softens so you're choosing you're activating the capacity to relax as you walk more and slowing down

224
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:13,480
you find that it's useful for you to kind of rest in your body and just kind of be carried by the body accompany your

225
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:20,560
body and you find that kind of that kind of settle something and now you're not so much racing off into your thoughts

226
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,760
and and in fact now you're it's easier to pay attention some point attention

227
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:32,720
seems more receptive than something you're activating and oh this is good receptive

228
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:38,040
presence and so you decide to in a certain kind of way to be engaged in the

229
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:43,079
choice to be more receptive receptive to the

230
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:49,359
experience each step along the way there's something you're we're activating we're

231
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:54,880
engaging but it's an activation which is not leading to more restlessness or

232
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:00,200
busyness or agitation it's actually activation that allows something to

233
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:06,319
settle and be quieter and more receptive so this activation of and the

234
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:13,160
core thing here for mindfulness is the activation of our capacity for attention

235
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:18,880
present moment attention and exactly what that is is less important than the

236
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:24,640
activation of presence present moment attention that almost feels like we're

237
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:31,480
activating a capacity to accompany our experience here and now and I love the

238
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:38,560
expression for mindfulness accompanyment because that allows whatever attentional faculty we have

239
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:45,839
that's useful to be be activated so if it's um you know if

240
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:52,680
there's something that you're um um the uh so yesterday I went walking on

241
00:41:52,680 --> 00:42:00,440
the beach and um and and uh and I felt this is really great to feel the wind to

242
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:07,680
and uh I have a long history of the Wind part of the reason I was at the beach was to remember things in the past um to

243
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:13,640
honor someone who had passed away and um and so the the I activated a capacity to

244
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:21,880
feel the wind for all the times I'd been with this person with um when it was windy at the ocean and so I was

245
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:29,079
activating capacity to feel and be present through my skin and this in the cold as went through my clothes and it

246
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:34,839
was really a delight so this capacity to activate the sense door that's needed

247
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:42,400
for any particular time is um is a um and then it but the

248
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,480
word activation for people do mindfulness might seem like we're just getting

249
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:54,520
busy but when we give our activate a wholeheartedness something that all the

250
00:42:54,520 --> 00:43:00,720
other activations all the ways we're scattered all the ways we're fragmented and being pulled away from ourselves

251
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:07,960
those can settle there's something deeply healing even about activating a

252
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:13,200
full wholehearted attentiveness accompanying our experience being really

253
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:19,960
here in our experience that allows us to become whole and as we do that to be when we're

254
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:25,000
honest about what's going on to be carried away from that into distractions

255
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:33,280
that's where things get off a little bit that's where there's a tension or a a alienation or doesn't quite feel good

256
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:41,119
but to enter into this world here fully in an activated way allows for some deep

257
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:46,240
relaxation uh maybe not initially but there is a kind of in the beginning it's

258
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:51,680
maybe we have to work at it and then eventually we have to uh it becomes

259
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:57,880
easier so I'll end with another metaphor for cultivating developing

260
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:05,480
mindfulness that I've read that there are now stationary bicycles you can pedal that can charge create electricity

261
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:10,760
and so imagine you have such a thing and all electricity and you require

262
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:17,640
batteries to generate lights in your house to not generate but to have lights in your house but all the batteries the

263
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:24,440
battery is dead so you get on the bicycle and you're you're you're charging it you're pedaling around and

264
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:32,079
very slowly the battery has enough charge that it can turn on the lights in the house but it there's not any stored

265
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:37,760
B uh electricity in the battery so you have to keep pedaling and pedaling until

266
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:45,280
there's enough stored energy in the battery that then you can start to stop pedaling and the lights can

267
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,880
continue and so and then there's kind of you can just relax and just enjoy

268
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:57,319
seeing things that were in the dark before so the same way with mindfulness

269
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:03,319
we're kind of engaging in it activating it in a certain way uh charging the

270
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:09,640
inner battery and at some point when the battery is full enough then we don't

271
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:14,760
have to work so much at being aware the light has been turned

272
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:20,760
on uh and this so and mindfulness is when the light has been turned on the

273
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:26,119
practice of mindfulness sometimes is getting the charge going but then once

274
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:33,760
the charge is there when we're in the groove of being present then the light is turned on and it's wonderful to be

275
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:41,160
activated and then we use that light to then be you know to shine the light on

276
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:50,160
different parts of our life as we accompany it so um you might for this day those of

277
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:58,800
you know doing your mindfulness practice through the day to consider if uh it's interesting to to understand it as

278
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:05,800
accompanyment and if you accompany yourself accompany others accompany your experience of life in the present moment

279
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:14,400
as it's unfolding mindfulness will come along you cannot help but be attentive

280
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:20,359
when you're accompanying so see how that goes for this practice of mindfulness

281
00:46:20,359 --> 00:46:27,800
faculty of mindfulness thank you
