of the nostrils are playing over the top of your

41
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:17,720
lip the invitation is to include the whole body of the

42
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:27,919
breath from the beginning of the inhale all the way

43
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,639
through to the top of the inhale the

44
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:39,880
fullness and then that delicious moment of release of the

45
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:50,639

46

breath transforms to air

47
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,440
perhaps after two or three more intentional slow

48
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:18,919
breaths allowing the breath to be natural however it is

49
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:30,000
today if you like tuning into the vibrancy

50
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,360
the energy throughout the whole body the

51
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,720
transpiration of every

52
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:50,880
cell which might be felt as a gentle sense of

53
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,199
energy aliveness vibrancy

54
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:19,240

exhale making the

59
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,639
determination to have mindful awareness Presence at the

60
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,360
Forefront and allowing thoughts of there and then to fade to the

61
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,599
periphery the background

62
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:46,610
the instruction is that if a sound or

63
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:53,720
[Music] sensation something anything pulls the attention

64
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,760
away to turn with kindness completely

65
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:06,959
towards the arising of whatever that is in the moment bird

66
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:14,160
song moose [Music] munching [Music]

67
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:21,519
twinge memory as such and acknowledge

68
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:30,959
it then returning the attention back to this moment

69
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:38,200
whatever your primary anchor of attention is

70
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:19,120
laying in contact with the sensory

71
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,880
experience of

72
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:30,240
now noticing any Simple Pleasures that arise

73
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,120
with appreciation

74
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:41,120
savoring but not

75
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:52,760
clinging and noticing any challenges that arise with

76
00:10:52,760 --> 00:11:01,240
love compassion not getting too involved

77
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,360
but allowing

78
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:16,480
receiving and returning to the sensory experience of the moment

79
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,560
you'll meditate mostly in silence for the next 20

80
00:11:50,839 --> 00:12:00,160
minutes I'll add a few little nudges suggestions here and there

81
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,560
trust your

82
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
practice

83
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,160
e e

84
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:46,120
if a sensation or internal

85
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:53,330
experience begins to flood or become

86
00:13:53,330 --> 00:14:00,040
[Music] overwhelming the suggestion

87
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:05,360
is to intentionally shift

88
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:12,399
Focus to one of your senses that is not troubling

89
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:19,680
you for example from the mind the

90
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,000
heart to hearing

91
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,620
experimenting [Music]

92
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:59,519
allowing the attention to shift temporarily when necessary

93
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:07,870
the hearing seeing [Music]

94
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:15,519
smelling and then if anything overwhelming is there

95
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:23,019
is subsided returning the [Music]

96
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:31,190
attention to your primary anchor staying standing

97
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:38,079
[Music] in whatever present moment s

98
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:42,600
experience connects you most

99
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:51,199
peacefully simply happily to the

100
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
moment

101
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920

102
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839

110
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600

111
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520

118
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,440
from time to time refreshing

119
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:35,760
the mindful awareness presence of this

120
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:43,200
moment and if there was distraction rather

121
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:49,399
[Music] than self blame or feeling

122
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:58,200
badly the invitation is to appreciate the reemergence

123
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:05,919
of awareness invite it like a

e e

129
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:05,120
then the last remaining moments of our meditation

130
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:13,240
together the invitation is to turn your mind your heart back over these

131
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:21,880
moments a formal practice with an appreciative

132

152
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,880
practice e

153
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,639
so thank you dear Global online sa it's just such a delight to be with

154
00:33:13,639 --> 00:33:19,440
you I started sitting this sit the very first day it started after covid

155
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,600
Sheltering place and um have stayed in touch intermittently ever since and feel like

156
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:33,799
I know many of you from the chat and many of you I've met on Zoom or sometimes in

157
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:38,000
person so it's good to be

158
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:47,639
here so today I'm going to continue conversation the exploration I

159
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:52,720
started yesterday on the Buddha's teachings on

160
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:59,120
the senses the sense doorways bases fields

161
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:05,080
and as I mentioned yesterday this is a practice that's very accessible to you if you're totally a

162
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:11,158
beginner and it stretches all the way through to those Advanced beginners and

163
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:18,240
those who are deeply experienced and grounded in the Dharma in the Dharma

164
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:25,800
Stream So today we're going to look more deeply at how to work with the senses to support a

165
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:33,960
healthy emotional life and the Buddha's instructions on emotions and the senses as a way of

166
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:40,280
deepening Spiritual Development it's a lot to cover so this is kind of a

167
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:47,720
taster and I'll just mention that this exploration is actually a series I did a

168
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:55,720
couple of years ago this one talk is unpacked from um a much longer talk for

169
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:02,040
the Tuesday Morning Zoom it at IMC so you can look back I'll try to

170
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:07,560
remember to put the link in at the very end if you're interested in a deeper exploration of

171
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:15,520
this so first ways we can relate to our senses can support healthy emotional

172
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:22,119
life or they can make things much worse what do I mean well let's start

173
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:28,520
with how we make things worse overwhelm

174
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:34,920
sadness anxiety depression emotional flooding of all

175
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:42,800
kinds is strongly associated with getting stuck in preoccupied by stories

176
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:49,720
and thought Loops this also involves closing off the

177
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:56,319
senses all of the senses except for the Buddhist concept of the mind and heart

178
00:35:56,319 --> 00:36:03,760
doorway Fe yeld being a sense door so when all of the other senses

179
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,960
shut down stories of suffering take over

180
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:15,960
and contemporary science actually confirms this neuroimaging and

181
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:22,000
scans and it also confirms that our capacity to switch attention to the

182
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,400
other five senses and be present increases a healthy dist from

183
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,599
and wisdom discernment about unhelpful thoughts

184
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:41,960
unhelpful emotions unhelpful thought patterns this stepping into the

185
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:49,680
senses increases resiliency satisfaction and a healthy

186
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:56,680
Simplicity a lifegiving alternative and it's available both in formal meditation

187
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:02,520
and walking around in the world extremely

188
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:08,200
portable this lifegiving alternative is something that has been core to the

189
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:13,240
Buddha's teachings for Millennia and perhaps it's part of why the Buddha and

190
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:20,359
his followers were known as the happy ones having nothing but robe bowl and a

191
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:28,040
few simple requisites to support them they were likened to Birds free

192
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:36,240
and their visages were glowing according to accounts from other religious Traditions back 2600 years

193
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:41,599
ago so I'm going to offer two practices

194
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:47,480
and these practices are both for the experiences of unhelpful emotion or

195
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:55,599
overwhelm and can be used to deepen development and present in

196
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:02,720
life the first I call taking a stand at the sense

197
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:09,520
doors and this involves intentionally placing your attention on one Sense

198
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,960
store not a troubling one but for example I used to teach in

199
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:23,720
pain clinics for many years and while the normal instruction in Vasa is um to

200
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:30,680
turn your attention to discomfort or pain as it is simply without adding anything and allow

201
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:36,440
it to pass or break down or dissolve and that's a good instruction however if

202
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:43,160
pain is overwhelming or tends to Cascade through the whole system the instruction

203
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:51,359
changes then it's to shift to a different area of attention often

204
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:59,599
sound or even seeing for emotional pain there are ways

205
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:06,160
that you can also switch attention those two switches to sound or seeing

206
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:12,160
work but others do as well for example one of my root teachers

207
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,359
sayia say means teacher U Tania mister

208
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:23,800
and then his Dharma name bringer of light holder of light he for many years

209
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:29,079
even though he was a serious meditator lived kind of a wild life and then was

210
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:34,160
burdened by many obligations and prone to depression and he discovered that

211
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:40,319
using a menthol stick like this would bring him back to the present

212
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:46,560
moment cut through dissatisfaction and keep him present so

213
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:52,880
scent intentionally used can also bring us back and cut through even very

214
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:58,040
difficult experiences one of my mentor teachers

215
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:04,160
Andrea fella uses a practice and then teaches a practice of what she calls

216
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:09,200
useless gazing I actually don't think it's useless at all the practice is to

217
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:15,200
look around you can do this if you want to at home at Junctions or Corners in a

218
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:22,240
room or if you're outside at where tree limbs meet and just do it for you know 30

219
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:28,160
seconds a minute and it will often begin to settle the system

220
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:34,280
settle the system down so those are

221
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:39,920
particular kind of little practices within the main one I'm offering here

222
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:47,640
which is to take a stand in a particular sense door that's not whatever is

223
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:55,680
troubling you second practice is if there's a persistent

224
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:02,599
ongoing story in the mind unhelpful unfolding in

225
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:10,319
our hearts to intentionally rotate through flip through the different sense

226
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:16,880
doors sight sound tasting smelling bodily

227
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:24,160
Sensations kind of methodically rotating through and that attentional shifting

228
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:30,280
tends to bring us more into the present moment and this does not have to be just for

229
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:35,880
overwhelm it can be for simple distraction or getting caught up in the

230
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:41,880
mind's default mode network instead that brings us to the

231
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:49,359
senses and then the opportunity for being present allows for

232
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:57,800
occasionally then checking the attitude or quality the mood of our heart and mind itself as one of the

233
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:06,880
six total senses movement can be helpful in

234
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:12,359
this there's a research study that was done some years ago I don't remember any

235
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:18,839
citations for it but they talked about the increased satisfaction and simple

236
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:23,880
presence of people I believe they were Dutch people who went for a walk every

237
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:29,240
day and there was something about the movement in and the act of appreciating

238
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:34,599
the walk together that increased a sense of

239
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:41,920
satisfaction and connection especially if they went with another person even if that other person's on the

240
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:48,400
phone so those are some kind of simple

241
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:56,079
practices that you can explore the Buddha also taught how to cultivate wisdom regarding emotions by

242
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:03,960
noticing them at each sense door there are three primary emotions he covered

243
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:09,240
Joy or happiness sadness or distress and

244
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:16,160
Equanimity and his instruction is to notice when any one of those comes up in

245
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,559
response to input at a sense store and

246
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:27,720
notice is it hooking the mind and making things worse or is this an onward

247
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:32,920
leading emotion a burst of Joy or satisfaction without

248
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:41,440
clinging that can be onward leading to development maturity deepening on the

249
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,640
path the word the Buddha used for hooked my word is

250
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:52,040
household and he means identified with lured in obsessing

251
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:58,440
over so there's nothing at all wrong with simple

252
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:06,400
happiness unhappiness even as long as we don't get lured and stalled

253
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:12,319
diverted spun out I'll give an example that kind of

254
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:18,599
encapsulates these in these last couple of minutes recently I was with a group of

255
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:24,240
friends and we were on this beautiful Ridge and this stunning view in One

256
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:31,640
Direction of a majestic Mountain we like 15 or 20 of us and

257
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:37,079
um some of the people there were dead set on seeing that view I mean it was a

258
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:45,160
spectacular view so that's Joy at the eye door I just a sense of happiness and

259
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:54,520
satisfaction and pleasure and um in their Rush interest in having the view

260
00:44:54,520 --> 00:45:01,440
they actually kind of squeezed me out of my spot in order to see The View and so I

261
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:07,640
went and I sat somewhere else and there was a choice point there I could have

262
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:13,680
obsessed or grumpily kind of thought about oh look at what they did blah blah

263
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:20,520
blah blah blah blah blah like this means that about them and this means this about me and da d d da da or just dang

264
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:28,280
it I didn't get the view but instead I recognized oh pleasure at the sense door

265
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:34,240
of sight is driving this Behavior why don't I just let go let them have it be

266
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:42,520
generous and I went to a sort of side where I had a view of trees and a few friends and ended up having a wonderful

267
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:49,920
conversation and about an hour into this excursion I looked around and noticed that even the people that had been so

268
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:56,079
obsessed with having the spot with the view weren't looking at the view at all they were looking at each other

269
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:02,200
completely engag engaged in friendly conversation and the happiest people in

270
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:08,839
that group appeared to be those who had given up their spot for others practice

271
00:46:08,839 --> 00:46:14,880
generosity letting go so the basic difference the Buddha is

272
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:21,599
talking about here is are we addressing relating to our senses like a clenched

273
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:27,400
fist grabbing on to what makes me feel good or even worse what what makes me

274
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:33,119
feel bad or is there an open hand

275
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:40,480
open-handed experience appreciation of what arises at the senses or allowing of the difficulties

276
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,680
that arise without getting entangled hanging

277
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:52,760
on or making things worse so thank you thank you for

278
00:46:52,760 --> 00:47:02,040
listening to these teachings today I really appreciate I don't take it for granted that you all are here for your

279
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:09,440
own deepening of practice and development and community and if you want to hear more

280
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:18,160
on this topic it's a full 45 minute talk on aiod dharma.org and it is I believe

281
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:24,720
