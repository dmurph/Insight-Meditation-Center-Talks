1
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,879
so good morning good day

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,360
good week welcome and uh

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:24,320
happy to be here feels quiet here at imc and

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,480
in our town so um

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,120
the teachings this day this week will be about the body

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,640
something that i see is central to buddhist practice more gen

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:49,920
at least it is in many different schools of buddhism and if not explicit it's implicit

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:57,559
and certainly in the teachings of the buddha and um

9
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:04,000
one of the things that we'll talk about today is the karmic body

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,840
one of the things we become aware of when we first start meditation is

11
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,320
what can be called the karmic body the body of holding patterns intentions

12
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,960
that come from the activities of the mind impulses the desires the aversions and

13
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,400
the fears that we carry with us and how they're transferred into our body and

14
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,759
in gestures and muscles and all kinds of ways just and posture

15
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:42,640
and uh so when we first sit to meditate we become aware of this karmic body

16
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:49,119
and there are three sets of instructions the buddha gives

17
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:55,920
on mindfulness this year we did the discourse on the four foundations of mindfulness

18
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,040
last year we did the discourse on the mindfulness of breathing

19
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,119
and the third one is the mindfulness directed to the body each of them begin

20
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,480
with the same exercise that is to

21
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:19,440
become attuned to the breathing familiar with the experience of breathing in the body a little bit centered and connected to

22
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:27,680
the body through the breathing and then to become aware of the body more broadly

23
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,519
and then to relax the bodily formations the bodily constructions

24
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,040
the bodily reactivity that has built up that makes up this

25
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,319
karmic body sometimes it's the karma of the day

26
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,400
that can we can let go of and sometimes the karma of of a lifetime

27
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,519
the activities of a lifetime so we'll do this first exercise today many of you are familiar with it

28
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:04,239
and since it's one of the uh it's the common thread through all three of the buddha's

29
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:11,760
instructions on mindfulness it's a good place to begin

30
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:19,440
so i love the way these texts begin with

31
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,959
going to the foot of a tree to an empty open space outdoors

32
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,040
to an empty building

33
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,799
one sits down and sits upright

34
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,319
the kind of expression of deliberateness deliberately going to a place to sit

35
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,640
and then with deliberateness assuming with the body

36
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,920
a dignified a appropriate

37
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,799
posture that one way or the other

38
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:11,840
might express the dignity of being a human being not with tension

39
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:19,680
but kind of attitudinal attitudinal uprightness

40
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,080
lowering your gaze and letting your gaze be relaxed and not

41
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,599
looking at anything in particular

42
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:42,039
and if it's comfortable gently slowly let your eyelids close

43
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:59,040
and then to center ourselves in the body to take a few long slow deep breaths

44
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,560
maybe three quarters full

45
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,560
comfortably deep breaths and on the exhale

46
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:18,680
to relax to soften the whole body

47
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,560
and then to let your breathing return to normal

48
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,360
and with a normal in-breath feel the different parts of the body

49
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:49,400
i'll direct your attention to and then on the exhale relax soften

50
00:05:52,639 --> 00:06:01,880
inhale feeling the face and exhaling relax the face

51
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:17,880
relaxing the face almost as if the air around you receives your face and holds it for you

52
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,880
inhaling feeling the shoulders

53
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,759
exhalings softening the shoulders

54
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,759
releasing the shoulders

55
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,440
so

56
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,880
on the inhale inhale feeling the belly

57
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:20,639
on the exhaling exhale relaxing the belly softening

58
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:35,599
when they inhale having some kind of global awareness of your body

59
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:47,560
and on the exhale a global releasing of your body

60
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:22,319
and then on the inhale you might feel your mind your brain

61
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,160
for any tension there might be there

62
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,959
and the exhale gently relaxing the mind

63
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:09,600
and then to settle in now to

64
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:17,519
discover the body's experience of breathing

65
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:25,320
every day the experience of breathing shifts maybe slightly but it shifts changes

66
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,839
becoming familiar with inhale

67
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,120
exhales

68
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,800
so

69
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,079
um

70
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:35,120
um receiving the inhale as it

71
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,079
expands the body the lungs

72
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,839
relax and let go with the exhale

73
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
settling in to your body

74
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,399
so

75
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,720
as you exhale let go of your thoughts your thinking

76
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:11,360
so you can better feel sense take in

77
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,880
the body's experience of breathing

78
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,200
letting go of thinking is preparation

79
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,959
for a deeper connection to yourself

80
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,279
so

81
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:30,880
and then as you're breathing as we say similar to how we began on the

82
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:36,320
inhale feel

83
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,399
the whole body the global body

84
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:48,800
in whatever way is easy to the extent that's easy

85
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:59,519
as you exhale feel how that global experience of the

86
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,040
body changes with the exhale

87
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:06,480
with no hurry as if you have all the time in the world

88
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,840
feel your body as you inhale

89
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:18,720
and relax the tensions the holdings of the body

90
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,600
as you exhale

91
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:36,320
without expecting much or being ambitious as you exhale

92
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:45,000
soften the body release the body

93
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:17,600
letting the mind be still so you can feel your body better

94
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,840
so there's more room in awareness in which to

95
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,799
release the body

96
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:11,039
for these minutes we have left put aside giving any importance to your

97
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:16,320
thinking thinking is a source

98
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:24,159
one source for the karmic body the tensions we hold

99
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:33,120
put aside your thinking the best you can and prioritize breathing gently fully

100
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:41,279
into your body with your body relaxing the body

101
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,480
settling the body

102
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,559
appreciating the calm of the body

103
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,640
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

104
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:36,720
to appreciate what you can appreciate about your body

105
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,039
to appreciate the experience of being embodied

106
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,360
even if there's pain and challenges

107
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,000
i appreciate the

108
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:11,039
all the nerve receptors in the body that allow you to take in the world

109
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:17,240
around you even with your eyes closed

110
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:32,720
that when we're not preoccupied in our thoughts the sensitivity of the body

111
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:39,039
can sense others our environment

112
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:47,279
in valuable ways and may it be that as we go about our

113
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:54,320
day today that we stay connected to the body's

114
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:01,120
sensitivity discovering what the body

115
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:07,039
recognizes feels understands

116
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,000
in our environment and our meetings with other people

117
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:22,799
appreciating the deeper empathy or understanding or

118
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:27,559
appreciation of others that's possible

119
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,840
when we take them in with all our faculties

120
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:47,600
and then to aspire to a day of good will

121
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:53,080
aspire to a day of kindness friendliness

122
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,039
aspiring to offer even in the smallest possible

123
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:04,960
unseen ways unrecognized ways by unrecognized by others

124
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,399
a day of being generous for others

125
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:17,120
may all beings be happy

126
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,559
may all beings be safe

127
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:28,159
may all beings be peaceful

128
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:34,840
may all beings be free and may we

129
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,559
contribute to this

130
00:30:42,970 --> 00:31:00,619
[Music]

131
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:40,080
so on this monday

132
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:46,720
i begin the five part series on the body

133
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:54,559
mindfulness of the body is a core aspect of the buddha's teachings

134
00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:01,120
he repeats it often and with great enthusiasm talking about how

135
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:08,320
all kinds of wonderful qualities tranquility concentration peace

136
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:15,360
whatever is wholesome skillful the different stages towards liberation

137
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:22,960
liberation itself is all founded or based on or experienced

138
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:31,120
with the body with through mindfulness be more more specific through mindfulness of the body

139
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:37,279
and in my years of buddhist practice

140
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:42,640
and practicing in this country and zan and japan and in

141
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:49,279
asia what struck me was how much the body was

142
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:55,440
used in the practice certainly the meditation is a physical

143
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,480
meant to be a physically embodied practice but also in the monasteries there's a

144
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,600
lot of physical work and activities and chanting and bowing and ritual

145
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,280
that involve using the body and

146
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:18,240
the what gets awakened in the body through the kind of practice activities we're involved in

147
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:25,280
was probably as important as meditation for me and that wasn't that was given i was not

148
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,480
given instructions or told that this attention to the body the engagement of

149
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,638
the body was important um but it kind of slowly kind of seeped into me

150
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:42,800
and changed me from the inside out to give one example

151
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:49,919
in the monastery we did a lot of bowing and most often kind of standing by like even

152
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:56,480
as simple as if we pass someone in the path as we were walking around the monastery we were supposed to stop for a moment

153
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:03,440
and bow to them as we pass them and and our people served us food we always

154
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:09,839
had to bow before and after being served uh if we came into the meditation hall we'd always bow coming into the

155
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:15,760
meditation hall and just you know over and over again you know lots and lots of bowing throughout the day

156
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:22,160
and do that for months and years something changes this gesture of putting the hands together in front of

157
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:28,079
the chest and bending forward a little bit is not just a physical gesture it evokes

158
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,839
certain kind of emotions certain attitudes within and for me it was attitude of

159
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:40,240
appreciation attitude of a certain kind of attitude of letting go of self-centeredness

160
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:47,839
a certain kind of feeling of reverence and respect and as i um kind of

161
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:54,400
you know it wasn't dramatic that i would feel that but it would be teeny feelings of that sometimes unrecognized even because i

162
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:00,960
was busy doing my life doing my things but slowly drip by drip drop by drop the

163
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:07,760
those little gestures kind of establish those feelings in me in a

164
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,880
deeper way and valuable way for my life and so there was a transformation in the

165
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:19,280
body of sentiment of attitude of feelings of sensations that i became familiar with

166
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:26,000
and then multiply that to all the different things we did in practice a whole bunch of things would come up i

167
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,560
would change in the body and meditation was especially so

168
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,680
and the way that i experienced my body surprisingly

169
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,720
changed dramatically in the course of the years of meditation practice that i had

170
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:48,480
sometimes they would change within a single meditation practice session sometimes certain ways it changed over

171
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:55,119
years and years of practice so much so that i came to appreciate

172
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:00,480
that we have different bodies um and what i mean by that not that you

173
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:06,960
know we we the way we experience our body the body that we experience

174
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:13,920
shifts and changes depending on the states of mind we have how the mind is used the attitudes the

175
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:21,440
thoughts the perceptions the intentions all kinds of things come together to shape how we experience our

176
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:28,320
body and it isn't that we have it you know the material body changes um in and of itself

177
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,440
um that you know doesn't change particularly except you know

178
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:40,400
in ordinary ways we all know exercise or lack of it aging

179
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:48,320
the but the way that that body is experienced is very much conditioned by

180
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:54,400
what is going on the mind and with the kind of the very

181
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,800
significant ways in which the mind begins to shift and change in meditation

182
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,839
thereby are the way we experience the body changes as well

183
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:12,560
and and so this week i'd like to talk about um five different bodies that we can

184
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:18,960
experience don't take this to be ontological like this is like a real

185
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:25,119
um you know like different bodies physically the material body doesn't

186
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:31,119
change but we're talking about is the experienced body how it's experienced

187
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:36,480
and so i want to talk about today a little bit about the karmic body

188
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:43,280
about tomorrow about the bliss body the peace body the insight body and the

189
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,400
liberation body so each of those are kind of represents different ways of the body can be

190
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:54,240
experienced and and the karmic body is

191
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:00,480
the body that we have shaped through the activities of

192
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,160
our lifetime and especially those which are volitional those that come from the

193
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:11,520
deliberateness of the mind as opposed to you know if you have a particular

194
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:17,279
profession that um you know that uh

195
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:24,480
you know uses your body over and over and over again in certain ways it shapes the body and maybe it's um

196
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,680
it's uh we can consider it karmic but it's uh it doesn't come from the

197
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:35,920
necessarily from the attitudes of the mind that exists there or people's faces are a little bit

198
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:41,680
different because of the language as they speak and depend different languages engage

199
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:48,160
over a lifetime different muscles on teeny micro muscles in the face and so there's a subtle differences in people's

200
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:53,920
faces depending on the languages they speak so those aren't necessarily karmic

201
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:00,320
they're just you know i don't know what to call that but the karmic has to do with our

202
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:05,680
attitudes it involves the tensions that we hold the holding patterns in our body

203
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:11,040
when there is uh when there is anxiety and fear we hold our body a certain way

204
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:16,720
and if that fear is chronic that tension gets built in and becomes almost like

205
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:23,680
almost hardwired into us if we spend a lot of time being angry and the anger is chronic that affects

206
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:30,000
them also the micro muscles of the face around the eyes and the shoulders and different places

207
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,839
if there is uh um if we're oriented more for desires

208
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:42,720
that i are searching and looking the eyes the face the movements of the body

209
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:49,200
are kind of a shift and change are expressive of that desire those

210
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:55,200
desires if it's more anger that we express the body kind of takes a different

211
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:02,640
stance different posture um the confidence

212
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:08,720
generosity love are all different things which shift and change all kinds of things in

213
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:14,800
our body not just the muscles but also the chemicals of our body and um

214
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:21,280
the how the neurons fire in our body and so when we sit down to meditate

215
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:27,359
uh i mean for many people what we're encountering is our karmic body and uh we

216
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:32,400
can experience it initially for a lot of the tensions we hold in our body

217
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:38,400
the shoulders the face the belly anywhere at all the hand

218
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:45,040
and i discovered when i was early years of meditation that i carried tension in my thighs

219
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:51,040
and that tension my thighs traveled up and affected my lower back and

220
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:56,480
and so the attention was a little bit bracing myself against something going to happen

221
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:02,480
i've known people who have a tremendous feeling wanting to bolt out of meditation and so the feeling of kind of

222
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:07,760
escaping running away that might be encased in some bodies it shapes the

223
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,040
experience we have of this body of ours and so sometimes some of the pain we

224
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:18,160
experience in meditation in the early stages of meditation practice

225
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,760
is karmic pain most very common places experience that in the shoulders

226
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:29,680
shoulders that are held high like mine were when i was younger

227
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:36,319
as they begin to release they begin hurting it could be that

228
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:43,680
there's a certain kind of despair or something that we're experiencing so we're collapsing and kind of giving up

229
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:49,040
and that certainly affects the musculature and the feelings in the chest but it also

230
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:55,440
made a big big impact on the upper back and as we sit in meditation we might

231
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:02,800
feel the legacy of you know long term time sitting a certain way and muscles or muscles are tired some

232
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:09,599
have contracted and then working with that is working with a karmic body

233
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,440
and so knowing that's what it is hopefully gives us a lot of patience a

234
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:22,720
lot of compassion and a lot of understanding that that's often what we're working with when we first start meditating the karmic body

235
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:29,280
the karmic breathing how breathing has been affected by our emotions our attitudes our experiences our traumas

236
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,480
our challenges we've had in our life and um

237
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:40,640
and so too and this is what we're slowly working with and relaxing and breathing with

238
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:45,839
some of the relaxation we can contribute to and some of it we don't want to make it

239
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:51,920
too big of a project to relax all the time but some of it it just comes with

240
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:58,960
sitting quietly and meditating and letting go of thoughts and being present in a in a sincere way here and now

241
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:04,560
it gives the body a chance to unwind it gives the things to to release to soften

242
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:10,480
and slowly it's wonderful to watch meditators over you know a few years and

243
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:16,560
to see the slow evolution into what sometimes called the yogic body

244
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:23,839
you know your body of a meditator you can see in their how they sit down and there's a comfort level there's an ease

245
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:29,359
there's a embodiment there that has evolved over time

246
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,800
and and as the karmic body begins to recede

247
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:43,119
at least temporarily sometimes as we get concentrated the karmic body recedes and other kind of experience of the body

248
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:49,200
enter into the foreground but then as the concentration leaves the karmic body returns

249
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:56,240
and we back in touch with his tensions and holding patterns we have and that massage is part of the process

250
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:02,480
of healing of opening up and coming to some resolution of the karmic body

251
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,599
and um so um

252
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:13,200
so as you go about your day today you might

253
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:18,400
see if you can notice what i'm calling the karmic body

254
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:24,640
notice the holding patterns you have that both you know in the in the muscles but

255
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:30,720
also in your posture how's your posture affected by your attitude

256
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:36,880
by your desires and your aversions by your confidence or lack of confidence

257
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,240
um and where are things tight where are things holding

258
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:47,760
and maybe even some of the physical pains you have that really come from physical

259
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:56,599
conditions sometimes a small percentage of them might be from

260
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:06,800
activities we've done the activities have expressed um

261
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:12,079
these are you know are as karmic are the activities we've done expl has expressed

262
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:18,720
anger impatience uh being in a hurry um desire greed

263
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:24,000
um resistance all kinds of things then then because we were that that way

264
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:30,240
maybe something got injured and now we have to live with the after effect of this car this part of this

265
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:36,480
karmic body we have to work with uh we're not stuck in the karmic body

266
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:43,119
this is what practice is about to some degree find freedom from that karma

267
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:51,400
and and that we'll talk about for the next few days so thank you
