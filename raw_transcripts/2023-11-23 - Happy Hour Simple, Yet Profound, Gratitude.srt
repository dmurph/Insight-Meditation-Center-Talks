1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:08,360
so hello again hello and welcome to happy hour everyone so in the

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:17,119
us tonight is the eve before Thanksgiving this um the holiday of

3
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:23,720
giving thanks and uh I know that our Canadian friends have had their uh

4
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:33,320
Thanksgiving about a month ago already but you know it's always good to give thanks um so so in honor of of coming

5
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:40,480
together and giving thanks we'll we'll practice uh um gratitude the Gratitude

6
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,719
practice which is a beautiful practice an uplifting practice it's it's one of

7
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,960
the beautiful heart practices so let us engage together in this way and just one

8
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:58,719
thing that I say uh before we get started is um gratitude

9
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,920
practice uh it's best done not as a an

10
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,600
obligation that you should be grateful you know because you have this or that or

11
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:17,759
because you're not suffering grossly or there people are suffering more in the world so this this this shoting of

12
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:25,000
gratitude doesn't work it's it feels contractive um it works most beautifully

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,680
it opens the heart best when um it's just genuine that that that the heart

14
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,640
really has a deep appreciation for for something for anything and I usually

15
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,799
like to start the practice not thinking about what you have in your life that

16
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,880
you want to be grateful for that's that's a great practice too but what I like to do actually usually starting

17
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,920
this practice from right here and now so the way I like to lead it tonight is for

18
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:03,079
us to just come to our bodies and breath and just settle just settle in the silence um without any thoughts of what

19
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:08,920
to be grateful for and just be just settle just settle in the silence and

20
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:14,800
then from this place of stability see what bubbles up see what bubbles up in

21
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,599
this moment maybe appreciating the silence oh appreciation gratitude for

22
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:29,200
that maybe appreciating the softness of the cushion we're sitting on just so let it be more um arising from the moments

23
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,920
experience right here right now instead of a thinking practice and again there value to that thinking practice to and

24
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:43,840
will lead the two towards the end but it's nice to start really grounded in the here and now so so that's the method

25
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:51,959
to Madness today or gratitude Madness so let's begin let's begin practicing

26
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:58,200
together so so I like to invite you to arrive and

27
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,760

28
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,080

29
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,920

minutes on our own

35
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:10,440
and the thoughts are rising about the past and future like helium balloons letting them

36

71
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:42,240
grateful for resting in Simplicity In This

72
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
Moment

73
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:43,720
maybe as we feel our body sitting on the chair or a

74
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:50,400
cushion and there be gratitude for this chair cushion everything that has come

75
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:58,919
to make it be here right now all the workers fabric filling worksman ship

76
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,600
planning roads

77
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:17,240
Transportation all the infrastructure that has made this chair

78
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
possible

79
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:45,000
maybe if we're [Music] feeling the clothes in our skin having

80
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:52,520
gratitude for being covered with perhaps warm or cool

81
00:23:52,520 --> 00:24:01,480
clothing wherever you are can every everything that has come

82
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,919
together make this possible

83
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,480
here the food that we have eaten that's giving us energy right now

84
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,000
to be present and to

85
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
function

86
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:44,399
I believe it's Carl Sean who said that if you want to make an apple pie

87
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:53,520
first you need to create the whole universe all the causes and conditions

88
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:02,200
atoms all the Stardust and million years of billions of years of evolution to

89
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,080
make all of this

90
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:15,120
possible it's just the amazing magnificence of being a part of this

91
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:24,679
gratitude for being a part of this conscious it's a part of this mystery of

92
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
existing

93
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:42,520
usually get stuck in the minutia of Our Lives Opening Our perspective to the

94
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:48,039
Wonder and gratitude of it

95
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
all

96
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:55,480
and as we bring this meditation to a close appreciating this being who's me

97
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:01,000
who's brought me to this moment to practice practice to cultivate my

98
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:08,919
heart in community appreciating the

99
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:17,720
community appreciating it all even even the challenges even the challenges it's

100
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:24,240

great okay so second you know I've been

132
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:07,399
thinking the universe is something like 14 billion years old my life is a blank

133
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:13,639
in the lifespan of the Universe I can't make my life fun every

134
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:18,880
second or pleasurable or whatever but whatever it is it's better than the rest

135
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,440
of those 14 billion years for my

136
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:31,559
viewpoint so now it's not hard it's not so easy to remember that all the time

137
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,000

146
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:33,480
how much my practice has helped with move through the moments meet the moments and move through them I the last

147
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:38,760
two weeks have been like some of the hardest moments in my life where my mom's been in the hospital straight from

148
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:44,080
Retreat I didn't get to end Retreat without and then her it was Tia that

149
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:50,080
made her dementia worse and so now it's like I only have her for seconds and

150
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:57,200
it's it's heartbreaking but I also remember what we talked about the Beautiful Moments of it and I had a beautiful conversation of love with her

151
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:03,519
and and I even if I'm like at my lowest I wake up the next morning sometimes
