00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:09,438
hello my friends and welcome to this meditation

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,119
session yesterday for the meditation I offered the phrase no

3
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:23,320
comment that uh one way important aspect of meditation is

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:30,439
to experience ourselves to be engaged in the meditation without being caught and the

5
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:36,920
commentary we can make about what's happening or especially a commentary

6
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:43,200
about anything else in the world while we're meditating and of course it's difficult

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:50,680
to do this because uh having commentary is partly how we try to be safe in the world

8
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,760
partly how we think about and plan what we want in the world partly it's how we

9
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:04,158
create an identity or reinforce Who We Are and partly it's a way to entertain

10
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:11,400
ourselves and um but meditation doesn't operate in the arena of

11
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,479
commentary it operates in the arena of direct lived

12
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:22,520
experience and that exists

13
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:32,119
independent of commentary for the most part and um so I offer the phrase no

14
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:37,640
comment whatever is happening Let It Be allow it to be

15
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,159
there but don't be involved in it with commentary don't start thinking about

16
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:49,320
it if you really get skilled at no no comment uh you would not judge it you

17
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,520
would not evaluate it you would not um criticize

18
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,159
anything you would not Chase anything or seek anything or try to get something

19
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:07,640
going going away there's a very radical almost a paradigm shift of what happens

20
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,400
in the mind when we start developing understanding what meditation is

21
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:20,080
mindfulness meditation and so what I'd like to suggest is

22
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,120
that the commentary we make about

23
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:32,360
life is the arena of how of our

24
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:41,440
Suffering The Arena the or the field of in which we

25
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,440
grow our meditation practice the Dharma

26
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:56,640
is the direct experience especially in the body that

27
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:05,120
is a different feel than commentary and so imagine that you

28
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:13,760
are straddling two properties one is the huge parking lot of a

29
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:21,720
huge Factory with Smog and pollution and

30
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:27,440
noise but the other foot is on the property of a beautiful field a woodland

31
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:34,000
field field with beautiful grow with trees around it and grass and wild flowers growing up and here your

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,159
straddle between these two places and you would like to get some rest you

33
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:48,080
would like to find a place of peace to be for a while and so you choose to go into the

34
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,599
field the Woodland field and walk across it and find a quieter place in the

35
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:59,159
woods so in the same way with our meditation and the equivalent of The

36
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:07,959
Quiet Place Place peaceful place the fertile place is um the what the experience we

37
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:16,079
have of ourselves especially bodily after a comment after the end of

38
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,000
a comment at the end of a thought before the next

39
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,080
thought at the end of a comment before the next

40
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:33,600
comment beyond the boundaries of of Thinking Beyond the boundaries the edges

41
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:41,320
of of comments can you feel or sense the more

42
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:48,160
peaceful field of The Quiet

43
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:55,880
fertile Lush Woodland field

44
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:03,680
Meadow so the advantage of saying no comment is twofold to not be caught in

45
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,520
the commentary not stay involved but also to become

46
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,600
aware of that which is beyond

47
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,000
outside before deeper than

48
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,479
comments the place where there is no comments is a place where things are

49
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:33,160
fertile is a place where it's a natural area where something healthy and good can

50
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,840
begin to grow maybe after homeostasis as we been

51
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:44,280
reached a disturbed Woodland will take a while to come into

52
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:51,319
homeostasis but it will so no comment you might continue

53
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:57,080
saying that word as needed and then look for that space at

54
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:04,360
the end of saying no comment where there is no commentary look at the

55
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:11,400
space the end of a thought before the next one and see what is

56
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:19,918
there at the source of where breathing begins within

57
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,000
you breathing is the natural spring in The

58
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Woodlands out of which the water flows

59
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,240
feel and sense the source of breathing where breathing

60
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:45,120
begins and returns so to assume a meditation

61
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:55,758
posture and gently close your eyes or gently lower your gaze

62
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,639
and perhaps it helps to begin separating yourself from the

63
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:11,319
world of commentary thoughts is

64
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:17,520
to offer to your lips the corner of your lips a gentle

65
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:26,000
small smile maybe a smile of

66
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,520
delight in beginning your medit

67
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:45,520
meditation and then becoming aware of how the body experiences

68
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:52,639
breathing you might have thoughts and commentary and judgments about your

69
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:59,960
breathing but for now let them be in the other field

70
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:07,199
let them be alone and do their thing but for you step

71
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,800
into the body's experience of

72
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:26,840
breathing and as you exhale to relax and soften your body

73
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,360
relaxing your body is a way of caring for your

74
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:56,279
body and it's a way of preparing your

75
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:03,959
body tilling the soil of of your body so an

76
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:11,040
inner Health inner goodness inner

77
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,800
well-being can begin to show itself

78
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:41,480
and for a few breaths extend the exhale without it

79
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:49,040
being a strain just a few moments of longer

80
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:00,360
exhale until the urge to breathe in somewhere in your

81
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,600
body is the most natural and immediate issue of the

82
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,480
moment maybe deep inside your

83
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:23,440
body The Source the beginning of the inhale

84
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:46,560
experiencing yourself directly listening to your body feeling

85
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:53,600
your body is to feel something deep in your inner

86
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:01,240
life without comment

and then as we come to the end of this

115
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:11,919
sitting to appreciate for a few

116
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:21,960
moments that beyond the field of commentary beyond the factory of

117
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:28,960
thoughts and ideas judgments their lies

118
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,158
a fertile Field Valley

119
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,480
within from which flows whatever

120
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:49,039
goodness whatever wholesomeness there is within

121
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:56,039
us a quality of goodness and wholesomeness that exists within us

122
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:02,559
independent of our thoughts and ideas of should and

123
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,559
shouldn't and to be quiet still

124
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:19,880
gentle to be able to listen and feel for these inner Wellsprings of

125
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:29,640
goodness and maybe to hear to feel

126
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:36,840
the care that's there for the well-being of others care and love and

127
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:47,480
respect absence of hostility absence of greed absence of

128
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:55,919
aggression and from this place this deep inner field of

129
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:02,039
goodness to let our well wishing silently

130
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:07,120
perhaps radiate flow shine

131
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,360
outward gazing upon the world with Good

132
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,480
Will May all beings be

133
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:25,480
happy may all beings be safe may all beings be

134
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:30,840
peaceful may all beings be

135
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:38,039
free and may whatever is good within us whatever is wholesome within

136
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:45,240
us resonate with the goodness and wholesomeness that's in

137
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:53,278
others may we share the wholesome with all beings

138
00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:01,749
[Music]

139
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,159
thank

140
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,080
you e

141
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:15,840
so hello and welcome to this second uh talk on The Road Less

142
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:23,760
taken and uh applying this idea this metaphor of a

143
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:32,279
fork in the forest fork in the road and that there is a fork that leads to

144
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:37,840
what is UNH wholesome and a fork that leads to what is

145
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:45,760
wholesome and what is the path that leads to the UNH wholesome it's UNH

146
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,679
wholesome mental verbal and physical activity that we can get be involved in

147
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:59,200
what is the road to the wholesome it is the wholesome men mental

148
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:05,960
verbal and physical activities that we engage in so it's What's Happening Here and

149
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:12,279
Now that is important here taking the next step on these two different roads

150
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:18,039
and this idea that there is a division or a or a separation or a distinction

151
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:23,399
between two very different roads to take in life is kind of inherent in the

152
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:28,960
Buddhist path Buddhist practice and that

153
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:36,960
the one that leads to suffering is um very much tied to the

154
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:43,399
world of thinking not that thinking is wrong or bad in and of itself but

155
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:50,120
there's a world we construct out of our thinking that if we want something too

156
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:55,320
much or if we have aggression or hostility or if we have um

157
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:02,240
fear if we have anxiety there's a way in which that kind of prompt can prompt a

158
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:08,240
lot of thinking imaginations and thoughts and and those thoughts that we

159
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:16,919
construct then have a have a um a bounce back on the rest of us so uh

160
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:22,000
if we're anxious about something and uh

161
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,440
it's all too easy to be caught up in thoughts about anxiety the the ideas and

162
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:35,519
the story what's going to happen and those very stories maybe imagery that we create in the mind then a tie back down

163
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,840
to the body and evoke more anxiety reinforces the anxiety so the question

164
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:46,799
is what comes first the thoughts or the anxiety and we don't have to answer that question because it's like a chicken and

165
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:54,159
egg thing and but the the world of thinking is often the world of

166
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:59,880
abstraction world of imagination the world of um

167
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:06,760
distraction and uh and to a great extent that's the source for a lot of the UNH

168
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:14,440
wholesome ways in which we live our life so uh if I have some idea that um you

169
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:20,519
know having a really big fancy car was really going to perfect my sense of self

170
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:27,039
and how people see me and my sense of success in the world then uh when I when

171
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:32,600
I go by a car dealership and see a big fancy car uh then that desire for that

172
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:40,000
car arises and so the very kind of thought construct of self that I'm living under

173
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,960
is then the source for a desire for that car and that could be become an

174
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:55,080
obession uh if I um you know have the same you know desire to be you know you

175
00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:00,760
know be wealthy and therefore we car and expect and have a wonderful kind of life

176
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:06,720
with people praising me and recognizing how great I am and someone uh you know

177
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,800
crashes into my car uh my hostility and anger to that person is not just because

178
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:18,760
the inconvenient inconvenience of having a damaged car um my whole self-image is

179
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,878
tied to what this damaged car means and the assault this person has done on me

180
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:29,240
is not just me as a as a human being but it's me as my ident identity my my

181
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:34,760
constructed sense of self that I'm trying to maintain and so this reciprocal

182
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:41,878
relationship between thinking and and identity thinking and desires and aversions uh can become kind of a a

183
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:48,240
Whirlpool of activity that we get caught in um and then there's another activity

184
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:55,280
which is a deeper Wellspring of uh that arises from deep inside that the Buddha Likens to not to

185
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:01,400
something that's constructed by the human mind the the madeup world of thoughts but

186
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:10,960
it's uh related to our biological life our deep kind of um possibility natural or uh

187
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,560
movements within us where we don't construct things but we allow things to

188
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:23,000
grow like a tree grows the planting and growing of of a of a plant is a metaphor

189
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,520
for this inner growth that can happen deep inside and for that like growing a plant we create the conditions for it to

190
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:36,599
thrive but we don't make it TR Thrive so we don't have to make up a lot of thoughts we have to almost quiet the

191
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:43,800
thinking down because they're just weeds that get in the way but if uh we we we

192
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:49,960
can uh become quiet enough to feel this deeper world to come up then these beautiful things

193
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:56,560
arrive so this distinction is big in the Buddhist teaching and one of the ways that uh it

194
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:02,960
can explicitly place out is when he when he uh contrasts explicitly What's called

195
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:09,040
the five hindrances with the seven factors of Awakening the five hindrances

196
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:16,920
are um uh sensual desire and in some list it's covet

197
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:23,599
covetousness and um and then uh ill will

198
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:29,480
hostility uh rigidity or sloth toward ER

199
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:34,839
numbness and then restlessness and uh agitation

200
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:40,680
regrets and then indecisiveness so I've talked about these five hindrances

201
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:46,240
recently and um and then on the other hand there's the seven factors of

202
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:55,160
Awakening uh these beautiful qualities they're kind of like the the the the great wealth of Buddhism

203
00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:01,720
that's the Buddha is offering you def find inside yourself and so these are um

204
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:07,119
the mindfulness u a Clarity of mind that sees

205
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:14,880
clearly uh I'll talk more about that but then there's um uh making effort making

206
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:22,200
engage and being Vitality inner Vitality then we by which we engage in things

207
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:27,800
there's joy Tranquility Som and equinity

208
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:33,119
and these are states that emerge from within they're not things that emerge

209
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:40,160
from our thinking you don't think your way into the seven factors of Awakening you

210
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,319
almost if you use your thinking you think your way out of your thoughts so

211
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:53,280
that you can allow some this deeper Wellspring of the states to arise from within and um so there's this huge

212
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,520
contrast between the hindrances of one hand and the Seven factors of the other and we see with the hindrances that they

213
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:06,000
very much involve the world of constructs and thoughts and ideas uh that we have about what we want in from

214
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,240
the outer world uh or the outer world that we construct inside of ourselves

215
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:19,240
that's not really part of our deep sense of self but kind of the constructed world so uh when this when the first of

216
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:26,839
the five hindrances is is to covet the things of others then it's clearly about the outer World sensal desire is also

217
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:32,400
about how to get the senses met by the environment around us and have a good

218
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,720
feeling for you know comfort and pleasure ill will is also externalizing

219
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:45,520
something where both with desire and ill will there's an object of attention out

220
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:52,000
there that is the problem even if it's we're upset with something about ourselves or desire something within

221
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,079
ourselves we have objectifying ourselves and there's kind of this um operating

222
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:04,680
principle of the mind and thoughts and ideas of what things are that's the object of attention and um that it's

223
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:12,440
operating under and so all all five of these hindrances have a lot to do with this objectification of the world that

224
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:19,800
uh that we're kind of living with and some of that has to do or a lot of that has to do with how that relates to the

225
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:25,119
constructed idea of self we're trying to build up or defend or escape from that

226
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:30,400
uh somehow is coming into play in this objectification uh there's this self

227
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,920
that wants what how it reinforces or builds or threatens that sense of self so again we're into this world of

228
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:43,359
objectification of thoughts of ideas and people who spend a lot of time in the hindrances spend a lot of time in

229
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:50,240
thought that's one of the reasons why they're so distracting and um and uh why they're

230
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:58,800
the hindrance because they hinder uh uh Clarity uh uh intimacy being in

231
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:04,599
touchness with something deep within where something deep can grow something

232
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:11,119
deep can be born and Sprout and germinate and flow and expand within us

233
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:17,599
and the expansive states are wholesome which the Buddha says that we we should

234
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:25,240
uh cultivate and develop and uh expand and bring to abundance to

235
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:31,319
fulfill uh he doesn't not say let go of the wholesome states he does not say to

236
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:37,520
destroy them or uh he actually emphasizes their importance but these

237
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:45,800
are states that arise from this deep place within and the representative of the wholesome states that can arise are

238
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:52,040
qualities of mindfulness not not so much mindfulness as thoughtfulness which some people

239
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:58,520
interpret mindfulness but rather uh maybe think of it more as a a a kind of

240
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:06,520
a quiet silence um uh capacity for awareness for attentiveness for a deep

241
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:12,680
silent listening to what's here that's as natural as hearing when if your ears

242
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:18,079
work natural as seeing if your eyes see and

243
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:23,800
um and then there's uh the clarity part the seven factors Awakening but the

244
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:31,440
little word for investigation usually the name for the second factor of Awakening is the

245
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:37,520
differentiation of states to be able to distinguish between States and what this

246
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:45,280
refers to is the very thing we're talking about this week seeing the distinction between these two paths the

247
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:51,760
what's wholesome and what's UNH wholesome and uh and uh so to be able to

248
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:59,760
feel that almost not just see it not just know it intellectually but to really feel the UNH wholesome qualities

249
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:07,920
characteristics Sensations feelings that come with UNH wholesome activity of um

250
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:14,319
mind speech and body and to know and feel and recognize

251
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:21,359
the wholesome that capacity comes from being really quiet for awareness being really

252
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:28,119
clear and sensitive to what's happening deep inside and that sensitivity then

253
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:35,480
also then includes a sense of inner Vitality where the sense of be feeling of being alive and having certain kind

254
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:43,640
of energy even if we're sick there can be a certain kind of Vitality certain kind of of uh aliveness that we can feel

255
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:50,760
that actually feels like it's wholesome it's good and then there's joy uh not the joy

256
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:58,079
that comes from thinking things which are delightful and pleasant imagining our fantasies are coming true

257
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:05,920
but rather um the a certain Delight or appreciation of the just being alive

258
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:12,800
just this wonderfulness of a settled he present aliveness that's not caught up

259
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:20,000
in the factory of thoughts there are preoccupations we have in thinking and wanting and all that that is swirling

260
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,559
and is a labant or is a maze with no exit that spins and reinforces itself

261
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:35,000
and can feel like there's no way out there is a way out not out from

262
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:41,599
because the the maze has an exit but if we

263
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:48,559
can step out of the maze if we can quiet the mind if we can

264
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:54,359
see the end of a thought before a new thought begins and see in that very

265
00:43:54,359 --> 00:44:00,839
momentary Gap there's another life to be had where we allow this deeper world to

266
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:05,960
emerge and then that Joy leads to kind of something becoming

267
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:11,920
tranquil and calm and peaceful the fourth factor of

268
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:18,200
Awakening and um I think it's the fifth and then the sixth is samade which is a

269
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:23,359
state of uh being organized coordinated all the different parts of

270
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:28,559
us become coordinated or organized together or Cooper operative all of us

271
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:35,680
may become a Cooperative entity it's called usually unification and a state of

272
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:41,480
wholeness and then there's equinity a profound experience of Peace where we

273
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:48,240
feel happily delightfully that we're not going to react to anything we're not going to be

274
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:57,960
pushed around by anything there's a peace that's stable so so this distinction here uh uh

275
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:04,960
uh between the wholesome and the UNH wholesome these two different operating system is that one operates very much by

276
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:11,359
in the world of thinking and ideas and Fantasies and commentary and the other

277
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:18,240
at its root uh has um operates under something not with thoughts but rather

278
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:23,920
with deep inner Sensations and feelings that we can tap into that can come in to

279
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:30,960
spread out and grow within us what's wholesome within us and a lot of what we learn to do is to

280
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:38,200
let go of the hindrances so we get out of the way of this deeper wisdom that resides within

281
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:46,359
us so um that's why the topic of the meditation today no comment is quite a

282
00:45:46,359 --> 00:45:51,440
profound uh comment that can a comment that leads

283
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:58,040
Beyond comments so thank you
