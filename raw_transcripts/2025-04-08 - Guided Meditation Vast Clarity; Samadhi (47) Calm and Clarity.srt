1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,480
so good morning and welcome good day and

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:20,119
welcome and one of the

3
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:28,679
invaluable characteristics of deepening meditation so good morning welcome

4
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:36,120
good well so one of the characteristics of deepening meditation is

5
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,079
um no longer clinging to anything no longer being preoccupied by

6
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:48,079
some anything in particular including at uh experiences

7
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,480
we can have in meditation itself and for example some people are

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,440
preoccupied by getting concentrated and so that's the focus and that's what the mind is concerned

9
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:06,320
with but as the meditation goes deeper there's less and less uh clinging

10
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,280
preoccupation about anything and

11
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,320
uh and it's a little bit of a paradox or something

12
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:24,479
that the thing that deepening meditation you can't try too hard to have it happen

13
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:31,360
because then you're focusing on something so when we get to the second Janna

14
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,000
uh one of the characteristics is inner

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,680
clarity and in my understanding clarity like when

16
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:49,280
the the fog has cleared and then you can't put your finger on where the

17
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,560
clarity is or you can't take out your hand and grab it clarity is not

18
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:01,640
something that can be grasped clarity is something that you

19
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:08,800
allow and appreciate and enjoy but we don't appropriate it and it's not

20
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,879
something that you can easily push away you can close your eyes

21
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:21,400
if the sky is clear and close your eyes and not see it but the the clear

22
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:28,640
skies is um is um not something you can push away

23
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,360
or hold on to or it it doesn't lend itself to

24
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:42,879
clinging we might cling to the idea of a clear sky but the experience of clarity that

25
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:49,120
the clear sky uh provides is not not something you can hold on to

26
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:57,000
so in the second Janna an inner clarity arises and this sense that we're

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:06,720
settled in the moment here and now kind of resting or being with this

28
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:14,599
inner clarity some people might feel it more as their body starts feeling very

29
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:21,200
spacious the body seems like there's a lot of space in the body and so there's

30
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:28,239
kind of a kind of like the fog has lifted and the much of the body from the inside

31
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:34,879
out starts feeling like empty space you don't want to get too logical

32
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:42,879
about that but it's the way that it's experienced and then uh the mind starts

33
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:49,760
getting very clear awareness is clear and for the mind that it's a

34
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,120
clarity that comes when thinking has reduced to a bare

35
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,200
minimum it's like a vast open sky where

36
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,319
maybe occasionally there's a small cloud that drifts

37
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:13,480
by i was in the high Sierra some years ago in the mountains resting

38
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:20,000
after having lunch and the sky was completely blue but it was a particular

39
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,560
spot in the where the the updrafts were happening in the

40
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:32,400
mountains where we could see these little clouds form and dissolve and it

41
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,520
was such a pleasure to sit there watch them in a sense in a sense from my point

42
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,280
of view the clouds arose out of

43
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:49,040
nothing they just manifested and then they disappeared into nothing

44
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,639
and it was it was a real pleasure in the clarity of the great blue sky so in the

45
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,880
same way that that there's thoughts they seem to kind of just float in the vast

46
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,840
clarity of the mind vast clarity of the

47
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:14,960
body and so the alternative to thinking a lot is this wonderful feeling of

48
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,960
spaciousness or clarity the mind becomes more and more

49
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,400
clear a mind that's claustrophob not claustrophobic but crowded the mind

50
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,720
that's crowded with thoughts and the cascade of thought one

51
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:39,680
thought after the other so that there's no there's thoughts lined up crowding in

52
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,160
ready to fill the space there is no feeling of

53
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:53,560
space but in the second Janna there's lots of space in a very satisfying tranquil calm

54
00:05:53,560 --> 00:06:01,880
way and it's a spaciousness a clarity that can't be clung to we can maybe cling to

55
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:09,759
calm but not with clarity so assuming a meditation

56
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,638
posture and Gently closing the eyes

57
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:07,360
and taking some slow slower and deeper breaths and on the exhale relaxing your

58
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,360
body

59
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:31,319
as you as you exhale relax and let the edges of your

60
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:38,000
body dissolve

61
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,638
soften into the surrounding air

62
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,400
and letting your breathing return to

63
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,680
normal and as you exhale as you

64
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:23,759
inhale feel the sensations of your thinking

65
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:33,279
mind maybe there's pressure or agitation a lot of energy feeling of

66
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:40,360
activation maybe there's tightness constriction

67
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:49,959
whatever might be in your thinking mind as you

68
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:58,760
exhale soften without ambition

69
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:27,399
like the thinking mind is a thinking muscle that relaxes as you exhale

70
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,880
the energy the pressure to

71
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:50,399
think dissolves into the edges beyond the edges of

72
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:00,720
thought as if the edges of thinking the cloud of

73
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:11,240
thinking vanishes in the clear sky around it

74
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,800
and then to center

75
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:44,360
yourself on the grounding spot with breathing

76
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:54,519
the settling spot at the end of the exhale where the inhale begins

77
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:24,560
where the sensations that are born as you inhale and spread through your

78
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:38,440
body are moving through a vast space all around you

79
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:50,240
there's a spaciousness space that is the container

80
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,920
for all your inner experiences

81
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:23,120
and if you're pre preoccupied by anything or have some certain emotions

82
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,480
that are strong it's all okay

83
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:37,480
with a rhythm of breathing breathe

84
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,720
with the sense of preoccupation the

85
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:50,079
emotions as if everything is dissolving into the space around it

86
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,880
itself that everything is

87
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,240
received by the

88
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:07,560
clarity beyond the edges of your thoughts

89
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:20,880
if you feel the pressure to think the activation for thinking if you

90
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:28,160
feel it carefully you might feel that

91
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:35,360
that within it there's a desire to relax to

92
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:46,160
release as you exhale release your thinking release the

93
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:58,519
pressure allow for this desire to be fulfilled the

94
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:04,199
desire to not hold on to anything

95
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:23,600
allow there to be a settling

96
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:31,880
spot deep in your body where breathing begins and ends

97
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:40,360
where that settling spot is at rest is soft

98
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,498
relaxed [Music]

99
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:02,360
calm and at the same time a kind of peripheral awareness

100
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:12,438
of clarity of space all around everything

101
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,558
a clarity a

102
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,720
space that is more

103
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:37,240
evident when there is no thinking

104
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,720
even if it's just for a few moments stop

105
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:09,440
thinking so you can feel

106
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,480
clarity spaciousness

107
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,120
as you breathe in the middle of it all

108
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:40,919
Feeling whatever degree of calm however small there might be within

109
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:49,360
you breathe with the calm gently

110
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:58,320
softly let it radiate outward through your

111
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:13,039
body as if whatever calm is

112
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:22,559
within is received in in the space of

113
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:36,520
clarity nothing to hold on to nothing to be preoccupied with

114
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:45,600
[Music] allowing

115
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:59,080
come to merge into the space of clarity the clear sky of the mind

116
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,799
and as we come to the end of this

117
00:26:52,440 --> 00:27:02,480
sitting to allow your calm to spread out into the

118
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:11,919
room to let whatever peace inner peace you might feel however small it

119
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:16,960
is whatever peace you can

120
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:26,000
imagine to allow it to spread into the world as you

121
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:44,919
exhale Perhaps one of the gifts you can give the world is your calm is your

122
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:49,278
peace in a world that's

123
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:56,559
agitated calm can be

124
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:03,240
reassuring in a world at war

125
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:11,840
peace can be

126
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:22,360
settling in a world where there is hate

127
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,919
love can be healing

128
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:35,559
may we be medicine for this

129
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:42,960
world by our calm our peace our

130
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,880
love may all beings be

131
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:56,120
happy may all beings be safe

132
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,440
may all beings be

133
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:09,520
peaceful may all beings be

134
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:23,240
free and may we contribute to that possibility

[Music]

136
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,039
thank you

137
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:40,200
so hello and welcome to the second talk on the second Janna the

138
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:48,240
second absorption the second state of deep samadei immersive samadei

139
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:56,240
and uh it's a state where the word immersion uh is particularly apt that we're feel

140
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:05,640
like we're immersed in a state of maybe of the calm

141
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:13,600
clarity and unity so I'm going to read to you the the standard description of

142
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,799
this state from the ancient texts that I read

143
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
yesterday with a stilling of a applied and sustained

144
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,360
attention a practitioner enters and abides in the second Janna consisting of

145
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,720
joy and happiness born of

146
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:50,120
samadei inner with inner inner clarity and unity of mind

147
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:57,039
free of initial and applied attention the practitioner fills

148
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:03,480
pervades saturates and permeates this body with the joy and happiness born of

149
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:09,480
samadei so no part of the body is not touched

150
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:16,399
so um uh one of the great delights of this

151
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:22,559
kind of deep uh concentration is it's kind of like we

152
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:30,080
have joy and happiness for no reason uh or to say it more accurately that um

153
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:36,360
it's a joy and happiness that's born from the samadei not from external

154
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:43,120
conditions not because wonderful things happen to us in the world we get what we want we get pleasant experiences in the

155
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:51,760
world uh but rather it's not something that's not dependent on the world uh being any

156
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:57,159
particular way but it is dependent on being deeply ly

157
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:02,960
settled and deeply settled here means among other things that there's a lot of

158
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:09,840
calm uh that there's a lot of unity a lot of settleness coming together just here

159
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,880
we're not fragmented we're not divided among ourselves the feeling of being

160
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:22,840
whole and there's almost no thinking and for many people this would

161
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,440
seem impossible because of how incessant thinking can

162
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,519
be but uh thinking is an activated state

163
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,640
that is you can it's your friend it's have a very friendly relationship and

164
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:46,120
certainly don't want to banish your thinking or it's very unfortunate to have a negative relationship your

165
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:52,480
thinking um it's with time through this practice you become friends with your thoughts and your thoughts can be your

166
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,519
friend but is also a time where it becomes you can relax

167
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:07,360
deeply um for people who um like to listen to music it can be

168
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,560
quite lovely to listen to music wonderful and they can be even more

169
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:18,079
special sometimes when the music stops and there can be a deep sense of

170
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:24,480
stillness of calm of peace uh with the absence of the input and so much so that

171
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,560
they have the music start again even though it's wonderful music just seems like there's too much input now there's

172
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:36,638
too much activity going on and it was just better to be in this very simple

173
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:45,919
quiet peaceful silence so maybe you have better metaphors for this than than music um uh

174
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:51,679
walking some people I like to walk a lot and um but also it's nice to stop

175
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:58,240
walking and just sit and uh and uh and then not get up to walk again it can be

176
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:05,040
so content and happy just sitting and and being and so the same way with thinking

177
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,320
is that at some point thinking is can get so quiet that it almost seems to

178
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:18,240
disappear or it does disappear uh discursive thinking certainly stops and it's rep in a sense

179
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:25,040
it's replaced by clarity that the awareness is still present when there's

180
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:33,119
no thinking the awareness is not dependent on thinking and um and so the ability to

181
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:40,400
sense to feel to be conscious to be aware is still there but now it's it's

182
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:47,040
not filled with thoughts and um and uh and because

183
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:55,280
thoughts are kind of like the smogs thoughts are kind of like the the waves on the ocean on the sea on the lake and

184
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,960
so when the waves stop then the lake is clear you can see to the bottom of the

185
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:07,599
lake perhaps and it's so amazingly enjoyable sometimes to look into the

186
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:14,440
water of a very still lake where the water's completely clear right down to the rocks

187
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:21,400
below and um uh the um

188
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:29,440
um so this beginning to appreciate uh the quieting of the mind the stilling

189
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:37,599
of the mind and that can't do it easily and quickly if you're just coming off the busy busy life to meditate but as

190
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:45,280
things get quieter more settled in meditation there comes a time where you kind of see you have a choice where you

191
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:52,800
see that oh I can leave the thoughts alone i don't have to be involved in them they can I can just let them fade

192
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:59,960
away i can trust the clarity trust the calm trust the place where there is no

193
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:06,160
thoughts and um and this allows the calm to grow and if you're still staying with

194
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,359
something like the breathing uh then there's this wonderful delight this joy

195
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:17,680
this happiness from being really settled calm unified the idea of beingcoming

196
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:23,440
unified is in my mind is kind of like all the different psychophysical systems

197
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,640
inside of us are now working in harmony flowing together

198
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:34,839
and that harmonious flow of our inner energy inner sense of

199
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:42,320
being can come with it a tremendous sense of joy and happiness and um but one that has has a

200
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:49,839
peacefulness and calm associated with it and um so uh I want to read the metaphor

201
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:55,040
or the simile that Buddha gives for the second Janna

202
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:02,599
it is like a lake that has water welling up from the

203
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:08,040
depths like an underground spring underwater

204
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:13,960
spring which has an a lake which has no water flowing

205
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:21,359
in over the ground from the mountain side from the east south west or north

206
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:28,359
and where the rain god does not occasionally supply it with

207
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:33,480
water so this is a mountain lake beautiful

208
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:40,079
basin and the um uh there's nothing uh coming in from

209
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:46,400
the outside so meaning that um um

210
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:52,880
uh there's uh no stimulus coming so in the second genre we don't not really

211
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:59,760
involved with hearing sounds um you kind of that's you you could in a sense but

212
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:06,000
it's a loud sound maybe but you kind of that's not the orientation and you're not oriented

213
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,440
towards seeing you're not oriented towards smelling or tasting so there's not any input coming from the

214
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:19,599
outside and uh the rain god doesn't uh rain into the lake and I understand that

215
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:26,960
to mean that um the rain god perhaps if the if our thoughts are the rain

216
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,160
uh that if the rain god floods us with thoughts

217
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,200
uh then it we we can drown in these thoughts that we have but even the the

218
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:43,760
the thought maker uh the rain maker is no longer creating thoughts to stimulate

219
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:49,280
us and to agitate us or to uh kind of those are also kind of coming

220
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:56,880
from outside certain way thoughts are kind of an external input on this deep sense of being in a lake immersed in a

221
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:05,640
lake so um uh then the

222
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:13,520
cool upwelling water so cool in India being a hot very

223
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:22,079
hot climate is refreshing and wonderful and and uh delightful uh maybe a cool uh

224
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,839
lake in northern England where on a damp

225
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:34,079
foggy day uh doesn't feel very inviting for people kind of steeped in the

226
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:39,680
English language in India where they're steeped with um you know Indic languages

227
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,119
and the word cool is very welcome word very inspiring word

228
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:53,000
even so the cool upwelling Water from this underground well spring underwater

229
00:40:53,000 --> 00:41:01,440
spring would fill pervade saturate and permeate the lake with cool water so no

230
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,760
part of the entire lake would not be touched with the

231
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:12,319
water so also a practitioner fills pervades saturates and permeates this

232
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:18,560
body with a joy and happiness born of concentration born of samadei so that no

233
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:23,760
part of the body is not touched so here there's a feeling of this vast kind of

234
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:31,119
clarity of of being in a lake kind of wonderful kind of pool of samadei pool

235
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:38,960
of goodness pool of calm pool of clarity pool of unity that is completely kind of

236
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,560
feels like it has no boundaries but also feels completely kind of contained in

237
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:50,160
itself without any input come from the outside and there's an good energy

238
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:56,640
coming there's a sense of joy or delight or happiness well-being that is flowing

239
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:01,760
or or um tingling or radiating through

240
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,880
the body and and that is what the clarity

241
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:12,960
the calm is making room for almost like allow the room for it and allow that

242
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,240
calm that joy and that happiness um sometimes it's feel stronger can feel

243
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:25,240
like rapture and ecstasy uh allow it to kind of fill the whole body fill

244
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:30,319
everything so no part of your body is not touched by those good feelings by

245
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:39,920
that pleasure so the main point I'm trying to make today is that um when the time is right

246
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:45,640
to let the thinking mind become quiet let it become so quiet and

247
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:52,520
still that um you feel the the remaining clarity the remaining spaciousness and

248
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:57,920
calm that uh uh the reduction of

249
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:07,560
thinking provides and then that clarity and that calm then creates more space for

250
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:13,760
uh for um the joy and happiness the sense of

251
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:21,880
goodness the sense of well-being the sense of contentment the sense of uh

252
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:28,560
coziness the sense of sweetness the sense of beauty that can kind of well up

253
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:34,720
from deep inner are well so the welling up of joy and happiness letting it

254
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:44,280
spread through the body so this is hopefully gives you a feeling a sense for the second Janna and um and

255
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:49,480
uh and even if you don't experience this in meditation

256
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:55,040
maybe this kind of talk is maybe a little bit evocative like poetry might

257
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:01,560
be that maybe touches something uh inspiring for

258
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:09,319
you so thank you and um we'll continue tomorrow
