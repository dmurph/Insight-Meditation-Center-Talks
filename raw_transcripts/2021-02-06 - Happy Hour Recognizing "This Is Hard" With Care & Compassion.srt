1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:11,320
so hello and welcome good morning good afternoon good evening wherever you

2
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:23,199
are so um the topic for today's meditation is

3
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:29,119
self-compassion we've been working our way to through the concentric circles

4
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:37,280
the different categ worries and compassion and we've come to self-compassion and we're going to linger here um for a few sessions

5
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:45,039
because you can can't have enough self-compassion um filling one's own cup

6
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:52,199
with one's own care especially holding one's own

7
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,600
suffering with care love

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:05,239
affection instead of self recomendation or self-

9
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:12,920
judgment or trying to whip yourself into shape like here you

10
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,759
are you're being a crybaby calling yourself names ouch ouch it's adding

11
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:24,920
more insult to injury it's more adding more insult to injury and it doesn't

12
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:31,200
really work actually it doesn't really work to get us to do what we want to do

13
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,880
in the world it just makes us more depressed uh this empowers us makes us

14
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:45,360
feel bad um plenty of studies um connecting Lack of self

15
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,600
self-compassion and self flagellation with um depressive mind

16
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,079
states self-criticism self-judgment with depressive mind States and of course it

17
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,960
makes sense because if you keep hitting yourself keep demeaning yourself of

18
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,440
course ouch ouch it doesn't support you but it makes

19
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,640
you feel worse so instead of actually supporting you to to

20
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:23,560
be stronger in the world it actually diminishes you so

21
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:30,720
self-compassion is also very different from self aggrandisement um

22
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,280
from um uh self um being self-obsessed

23
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:43,680
it's none of those it's none of those it's a healthy self-care

24
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,040
self-regard for this for oneself basically the way you would treat

25
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,000
someone you care about you can think of a young one and

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,159
we did this in the meditation couple of weeks ago if you imagine a little little

27
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:06,440
child who's having a hard time uh you wouldn't kick

28
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:12,360
them and say oh come on get it together but ouch we we tend to do that when we

29
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:19,440
have a hard time we kick ourselves in the shin get it together instead of oh sweetie this is hard this is

30
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,920
hard so the first step in compassion

31
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,000
especially in self-compassion is acknowledging

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,360
that this is hard simply acknowledging that this is hard what you're going through right now this is hard just that

33
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:46,040
simple acknowledgement that we often miss and I know that I've missed that

34
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:53,480
many many times in my life having had a chronic illness the first few years the

35
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:59,560
first few months of it I would be tired exhausted and I would berid myself come

36
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:06,159
on there all these emails waiting for you get it together it's like oh and then it took me a while to realize wait

37
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:13,640
sweetie you're tired you're you're not being lazy you're this is there's something going on in this

38
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:19,400
body and learning to actually be to to be

39
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,680
more affectionate to be more understanding to realize that it was

40
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:31,400
challenging it was the starting point of knowing of learning how to work with it

41
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:38,720
so that awareness bringing awareness to seeing that this is

42
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:47,039
challenging can open our heart to care and can open our minds to wisdom to

43
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:55,440
actually open up to ways to wisely work with it instead of continuing to kick

44
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,840
ourselves and get into a vicious cycle

45
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:09,000
so so with

46
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,080
that let's start practicing

47
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,918
together let's get into our meditation

48
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:28,400
posture and Landing

49
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,680
Landing Landing in your body

50
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:50,199
Landing with whatever is showing up in this moment in this body in this heart in this

51
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,919
mind taking a temperature of what is

52
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:19,039
present and whatever is present as you become aware relaxing around

53
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:28,160
it it's an emotion thought pain in the body

54
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:03,479
and I will spend a few minutes as always at the beginning just to

55
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:07,759
rest just to arrive with the

56
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,160
breath in the body one breath at a time

57
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:42,919
relaxing softening the soft

58
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:51,240
tissue as much as possible letting go

59
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:05,879
receiving receiving each breath in this moment in the abdomen in the lower

60
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:09,720
body you know what to

61
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
do

62
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,440
for for

63
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:51,720
taking refuge in this moment Simplicity letting your heart settle and

64
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:59,680
relax putting down thoughts concerns

65
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,640
just this

66
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320

right now but something that has been challenging and perhaps

82
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:36,000
you haven't been recognizing it as difficult you've been berating yourself

83
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,560
and judging

00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:53,880
yourself for not doing better handling it better etc

209
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:48,760
to invite you to speak up or if you're new to this s your contribution is important

210
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:54,480
so so what did you discover it's all

211
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:00,200
welcome and by sharing what works or didn't questions you're supporting each

212
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:05,440
other you know this already by making yourself vulnerable and sharing of

213
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,280
yourself you're supporting others

214
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:35,480
let me start by asking ah so we have a um Reflection

215
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:43,839
from Jerry it was very helpful to think of my friends relatives and if they were in my position how difficult that they

216
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:51,160
also would feel great yeah yeah that's a helpful

217
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:58,240
perspective sometimes we think we are superhuman and we should be able to deal

218
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:05,040
with this whatever this is and and realizing and and as Jerry

219
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:13,040
brought in thinking of your friends relatives somebody else in this

220
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:19,760
situation especially someone with the same as I was offering with the same causes and conditions especially with

221
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:26,240
the same background genes and upbringing and all the challenges that you've

222
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:32,359
had so this is not unique to you this situation would be challenging for

223
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:37,640
anyone and of course with the combination of conditions that you have

224
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:43,800
so so this is hard so realizing that can be the first and most important step

225
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:49,000
yeah thank you Jerry for sharing that very important

226
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:55,078
did that realization support others or imagining

227
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:01,319
yourself Emily please so um I think something that was hard

228
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:06,440
for me just like in the actual experience of trying to practice tonight

229
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:13,319
was it being the end of the week and you know I'm a freelancer like I run my own

230
00:42:13,319 --> 00:42:20,599
life and business and just kind of feeling this feeling of dissatisfaction with what I accomplished today and this

231
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:25,920
week and it was really hard for me to let go and I noticed with the like at a

232
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:31,160
certain point like I even turned the zoom on but I was like but I'm going to work on my taxes at the same time and

233
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:38,160
then I was like that feels crazy and I kind of felt like I was

234
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:43,440
um like wanted to be done with working and kind of drained and you know didn't

235
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:49,680
really want to do more but because I didn't feel as productive as I want you know that it

236
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:55,160
was like hard to let the weekend begin and I think for me there's a

237
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:02,680
challenge around like what my behavior is versus The Compassion like it can

238
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:10,160
feel like I should have done a better job and so I if I feel compassion then I'm gonna like not take care of my life

239
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:17,400
yeah so those are just some some thoughts I yeah yeah I'm glad you brought this in

240
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:24,359
Emily because it's um what you said is so typical so typical that oh and and I

241
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:29,599
was trying to refer to it at the beginning that oh if you feel compassion then you

242
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:36,400
won't get anything done and you'll become a couch potato and you'll just be compassionate to yourself all like oh I

243
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:42,160
won't get anything done if I'm compassionate which is the wrong perspective and studies show that in

244
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:48,040
fact when we are more compassionate we take more responsibility for our actions

245
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:53,599
um and it's in fact the other way around when we self flatulate it's like Oh I'm

246
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:58,839
a failure I didn't get enough done I'm terrible then we're just beating

247
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:04,280
ourselves up and we're throwing perfectly good moments after maybe what

248
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:10,440
hasn't been accomplished and we're beating ourselves we're making ourselves small and then we get depressed and then we don't feel like doing anything it

249
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:17,359
becomes a vicious cycle so I want to say trust me and trust the

250
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:23,599
research but at the same time don't trust me try it try it just see take

251
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:30,319
that step that step step of trust if you with what you just described and and

252
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:35,920
being a freelancer this is so familiar because you're on your boss and you're pushing yourself and you have so many

253
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:41,400
hats and you're doing so many things and yet it's hard it's really hard to say oh

254
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:48,400
sweetie this is hard for all Freelancers this I can tell you this is hard this is

255
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,520
hard it's an ongoing if there was a forum of Freelancers just should be number one didn't accomplish enough

256
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:59,880
whereas if you actually went through your day you did this you did that you did like oh so oh sweetie this is hard it's hard to

257
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:05,119
be a freelancer it's hard to work on your own it's hard not to have a network

258
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:10,800
it's hard to set your own schedule it's hard to set to motivate yourself it's

259
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:16,240
it's hard sweetie it's hard isn't as I say this I see you're

260
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:21,359
nodding all I know all of the so sweetie this is

261
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:28,839
hard and I love you and I know this is hard you're doing your best and it's okay so many things are not done so I'm

262
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:36,079

264
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:51,280

267
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:11,680
Reflections um one reflection is my hand and my heart feels incredibly tender I

268
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,720
often looked for this compassion outside of myself it is such a realization that

269
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:24,240
I can give myself this compassion and love beautiful thank you for that reflection another reflection I had a

270
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:30,160
right chest and the Deep uh and the deep breathing and your words loosening the I

271
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:35,520
had the tight chest I think you meant to say I had the tight chest and the deep breathing and your words loosen the

272
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:41,760
tightness lovely compassion often does that and last

273
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:47,040
reflection um I'm surprised at realizing how hard I have been on myself since

274
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:53,559
childhood and this awareness and realization is helping me to build a self-compassion practice thank you for

275
00:46:53,559 --> 00:47:00,640
guiding this meditation with such gentleness and kindness you are so welcome that is such an important

276
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:06,119
realization that we've been hard on ourselves and it can be transformatory

277
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:12,599
just transformational for ourselves and for all those whose lives we touch so

278
