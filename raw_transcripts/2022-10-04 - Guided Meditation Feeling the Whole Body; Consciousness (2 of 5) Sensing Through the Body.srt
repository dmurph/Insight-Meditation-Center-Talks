1
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,859
hello everyone and welcome and what I'd like to do today is to also

2
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:23,760
welcome you to your body welcome you into the

3
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:33,739
felt sense of being embodied in your body has a variety of different

4
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,460
forms of perception that are activated in different circumstances

5
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:46,440
and they are ready and available

6
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,440
for you well in a sense inviting you to be here in your body be present through

7
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:59,039
your body and um and seemingly content enough if you

8
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:06,439
don't accept the invitation but for today maybe we'll uh

9
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:11,460
explore this very important form of attention

10
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,640
or aspect of attention component of how we're aware

11
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,798
is awareness through the body

12
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,540
in the teachings of the Buddha the primary one is

13
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:34,040
to sense the body so that the the through the

14
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,259
sense of touch through all the different nerve endings that are in the body that

15
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:46,500
um provide you know data to the mind about the

16
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:54,240
experience of being having a body and um and then the connection between

17
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:01,200
us and our body is you know the way we experience it is

18
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:09,179
somewhat um variable just now I said that we have a body

19
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:15,480
some people might say we are a body uh to be in their body to drop into our

20
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:22,980
body to inhabit our body to observe our body

21
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:29,760
to be disconnected from the body there's all these different ways of being in relationship to it

22
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,760
and in a sense the Buddha when he taught

23
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,700
um didn't talk about awareness of body the

24
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:48,540
sensations of the body the sensing and the body in terms of how we experience those in

25
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:54,780
relationship to ourselves and uh so we so easily use the language

26
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:03,379
of self and like having a body being a body but the Buddha just talked about

27
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:09,780
the awareness that exists with the body through the

28
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:17,040
body without necessarily a reference point to

29
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,860
the self and perhaps we can understand that to

30
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,560
mean that there's a deeper intimacy that's possible

31
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,640
than if we somehow

32
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:40,500
take a position about what relationship we we have with the body

33
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:46,379
but it's closer to the idea that we are our body but even not saying too much

34
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:54,739
it's a deeper intimacy of allowing the body to reveal itself

35
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:02,459
to who that question we don't have to answer just let it be revealed

36
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:08,540
so assuming a meditation posture

37
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,480
and

38
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:22,139
gently closing the eyes and with the eyes closed so that there

39
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:29,060
is maybe a greater ability to feel the body to

40
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:33,500
gently sway back and forth

41
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:40,860
and then slowly sway less and less finding yourself kind of in the balanced

42
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:48,259
middle or your weight evenly and maybe on both sitting bones

43
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:56,040
and maybe there's also be useful to Rock forward and back

44
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:01,380
as far as you can go back and forward and when you come forward

45
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:07,259
come back first with the shoulders so there's a little bit of an arch in

46
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:15,060
your upper back as you come back up and then find yourself again balanced

47
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:20,639
on your sitting bones the weight of your body

48
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:28,380
traveling kind of center of gravity Center of the body being directly above

49
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,340
the sitting bones

50
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:47,340
to take a few long slow deep breaths both to begin

51
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:55,199
having a heightened awareness of the body especially on the inhale

52
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:01,220
and to relax this body soften it

53
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:08,220
because in some ways a relaxed body has a higher

54
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:14,419
sensitivity to Sensations that we want to stay with

55
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:23,000
breathing in deeply relaxing exhaling

56
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:58,580
letting your breaths return to normal

57
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,919
and continue with the normal breath to relax on the exhale

58
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,479
releasing the muscles of the face

59
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:28,800
including the micro muscles there and heightened sensitivity to the face might

60
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,199
reveal teeny Holdings

61
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,580
around the eyes

62
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,060
forehead

63
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,180
the nose

64
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:01,340
the cheeks

65
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,020
the lips and the mouth

66
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:24,120
it might be nice to drop the mouth open relaxed way and then float

67
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:30,660
the teeth back together or the lips back together teeth don't

68
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,259
have to touch

69
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:41,120
softening the jaw

70
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,959
and this little tour of the face indicates shows

71
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:55,980
that we have a global capacity to sense Sensations

72
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:02,000
in the face it's phenomenal how many nerve endings there are

73
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,740
and so it is in the rest of the body

74
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:15,680
feeling your shoulders

75
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,220
relaxing the shoulders

76
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,860
feeling the stomach the belly

77
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,459
and the exhale relaxing the belly

78
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:06,380
we have nerve endings all down the legs

79
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:13,800
are there any Sensations there that indicate that you can relax your legs

80
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,060
your thighs

81
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:34,760
we have nerve endings down the arms to the whole hands

82
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:46,920
any Sensations there give a sense that we can relax or soften

83
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:54,260
the arms the hands Maybe Maybe by

84
00:10:54,260 --> 00:11:02,660
releasing ourselves to the pull of gravity feeling the weight of the arms

85
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,019
there are nerve endings throughout our body

86
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:27,660
all of which providing constantly

87
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:36,300
some sense data to the mind many of it maybe were unconscious of

88
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,519
because of where our attention goes

89
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:48,000
but it's possible to bring attention to all kinds of areas of our bodies that

90
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,820
we normally in the course of the day don't feel much but feel Sensations there

91
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:04,100
so much is available and if you sit here

92
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:13,639
with attention spread go globally around your body

93
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,320
allow your to yourself to feel

94
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:32,339
the whole body in at whatever way that reveals itself

95
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:34,820
to you

96
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,120
and then within this Global body

97
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,260
to me breathing

98
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:19,940
so that breathing sensory experience or breathing the sensations of the body as you breathe

99
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:27,500
maybe become the center or the animating

100
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:36,980
Force for being aware of your body

101
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,020
thank you

102
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,020
breathing with the whole body

103
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:50,000
feeling the breathing in the middle of the body

104
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:58,440
as you exhale let there be a further letting go in the

105
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:06,240
body releasing

106
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:20,120
a quieting of the body

107
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,820
foreign

108
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,440
perhaps at the end of the exhale

109
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:57,379
letting there'd be a quiet a calm for a moment

110
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,740
as if the end of the exhale is a calming

111
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,179
a settling

112
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:23,059
and that the inhale arises out of that to come

113
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:20,360
and becoming aware of where in your body there might be some

114
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:29,299
manifestation of calm even if much of you is agitated

115
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,480
is there any place that feels calm

116
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:56,179
as if breathing is a gentle wind a calm wind

117
00:24:56,179 --> 00:25:00,260
breathe with that calm

118
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:14,299
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

119
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,860
perhaps to appreciate

120
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:30,900
that how we can be present for others is different if we are present just

121
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,760
through our thoughts and ideas

122
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:48,299
if we are aware through our body we allow ourselves to sense and to feel

123
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:53,059
the body as we're

124
00:27:54,539 --> 00:28:01,440
in relationship to other people the body that's available to all kinds

125
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:08,760
of information including information about how we are reacting responding

126
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:14,640
tensing relaxing

127
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:27,379
and through being deeply embodied there can be a heightened sensitivity to

128
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:37,200
the joys and suffering of life and empathy in

129
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,539
to the joys and suffering of others

130
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:50,460
we can better share this life with others accompany each other

131
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:57,480
in the depth of Who We Are when we're aware

132
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:02,360
of the fullness of the body

133
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,179
may we have the patience

134
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:18,240
and the willingness to be present for others with all our

135
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:24,740
faculties and in doing so

136
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:32,220
may we be better a place to bring kindness and friendliness in all

137
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,120
our relationships

138
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:44,399
may this practice support us in our care of the world care of each

139
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:51,919
other may all beings be happy

140
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,278
may all beings be safe

141
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:05,779
may all beings be peaceful

142
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:11,240
and may all beings be free

143
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:32,060
[Music]

144
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:44,299
thank you so hello everyone and

145
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:55,320
so for this week it turns out that the overall concept tying the week together

146
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:01,380
is consciousness and in coming down to teach this morning I kind of

147
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:07,080
Marvel that somehow I managed to choose that as a topic I kind of walked

148
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:12,299
into it it was not the plan and Sunday evening

149
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:18,720
uh somehow in the course of by the time Monday morning came around I kind of found myself

150
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:27,720
almost coming up with that as the theme as we were beginning yesterday morning

151
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:33,059
and um so maybe in a more cautious moments I

152
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:39,240
wouldn't have chosen such a maybe a potentially complicated concept

153
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:45,440
and the one that has a lot of different ideas of what Consciousness is

154
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:53,279
but here we are and um so the premise that I'm operating under here

155
00:31:53,279 --> 00:32:01,080
is that Consciousness at least in the Buddhist framework uh early Buddhist framework or

156
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:08,820
how I'm teaching is not a singular thing it's not a it doesn't exist by itself

157
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:15,779
there's not a pure Consciousness that we can find somewhere deep in our psyche or in our

158
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:24,179
in our hearts or somewhere there isn't some kind of impersonal Consciousness that continues after death

159
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:29,820
there isn't some kind of transpersonal uh Consciousness that um

160
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:37,260
exists Beyond us Beyond us and that we share in or a part of or something

161
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:42,740
that all these kinds of ideas of making Consciousness into something

162
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:48,419
is uh in the Buddhist early Buddhist framework there are all kind of recipes

163
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:54,360
to contribute further to being attached to cling to things

164
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:00,120
and instead in this early tradition the word Consciousness maybe is not even

165
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:06,720
used in the texts um uh there's an argument to be made that the word that we translate is

166
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,240
consciousness shouldn't be translated that way so we're left kind of with modern ideas

167
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:18,799
the English ideas of what this word Consciousness refers to and the premise that I'm working under

168
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:27,840
is that the Consciousness is not a thing but it's uh the uh in the sense that a

169
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:33,840
sum can be more than the the gestaltism or the more what's more than just the

170
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:40,620
sum of the parts the whole is more than the sum of the parts so Consciousness is made up of many parts

171
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:48,840
that contribute to creating something that has the impression of being more is more than all the individual parts

172
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:53,940
and um in a sense the parts are all the different mental and perceptual

173
00:33:53,940 --> 00:34:03,120
processes that begin working together and forming each other and um and many of the uh they come

174
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:09,118
together and and they work together and we can get a sense the mind can create a

175
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,398
sense an image of uh of that whole and

176
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:20,760
that's partly what we can call consciousness but it doesn't exist apart from the

177
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:26,760
image we construct or the sense or the idea we construct of the whole that can

178
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:33,419
seem as some kind of a field of Consciousness or a bubble of

179
00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:39,358
Consciousness or a of some kind of continuous Consciousness Consciousness

180
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:46,320
that somehow we the self we are the Consciousness and all these things can happen once this thing has been

181
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:52,138
constructed and um but uh when people some people

182
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:57,480
get maybe for medical reasons neurological reasons something doesn't

183
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:04,740
work properly what we can call what with the sense of consciousness of awareness can get very

184
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:11,460
disorienting disoriented fragmented and you know confused but when it all works

185
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:18,119
together then it's a little bit like um the uh you know a

186
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:26,520
um an old uh I mean like a uh clock that's uh with hands and all these gears

187
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:32,720
that operate to make it all going and all those gears when they work properly

188
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:38,000
move the hands on the clock but the movement

189
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,339
doesn't exist apart from all the all the movements of the whole clock

190
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:53,579
so what we call Consciousness is more like the movement than it is any particular part of it

191
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:58,619
so the component parts which is the kind of the summary what I want to talk about

192
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:05,460
this week yesterday I talked about our capacity to recognize things and um

193
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:11,700
the this is important because without recognition then we have no recognition

194
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:17,240
of Consciousness or of anything but recognition is itself a complicated

195
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:22,800
mental processing that involves memory and things

196
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,500
but today there at the topic is another

197
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:38,160
attentional capacity faculty that we have that the Buddha put much emphasis on which is our capacity to sense there's

198
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:44,040
uh the sensations of the body to we can use the word to feel the body in English

199
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:51,180
as long as we don't think of it as the uh the second Foundation of mindfulness feeling tones it's the act of feeling or

200
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:59,579
experiencing the body from the body's point of view itself so this senses of touch all the nerve

201
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:04,820
endings throughout the body that provide data of what the body is feeling

202
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:10,400
experiencing how those nerve endings are being stimulated

203
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:17,060
there might not be there might may be or may not be acts of recognition

204
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:22,320
when we're sensing it could be sensing or without recognizing what it is

205
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:29,220
and or sometimes the recognition might be faulty uh I've had uh you know

206
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:35,040
sitting next to a bush or a little tree and the leaf uh you know brushed my neck

207
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,800
and I thought it was a person that was touching me but it was a leaf so the

208
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,260
first the recognition of what it actually was was not accurate but the

209
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:52,220
perception of touch was accurate just touch you know that that happened

210
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:57,260
and and this ability to uh

211
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:03,540
feel and sense the whole body is something that can be developed and it's

212
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:08,940
also something that can be lost there are people who for many reasons do not

213
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:14,940
feel much of their body don't feel much of the body below their neck or below their waist or you know

214
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:23,460
different parts of the body and part of what meditation mindfulness meditation can do is to reawaken the

215
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:31,760
body so that the whole body is participating in this being present for our experience

216
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:38,820
and and some people specialize in being more sensory more

217
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:44,880
somatic Italy in the world so for them they mediate the world through sensing

218
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:51,000
and feeling in the body other people mediate the world more through their their cognition and their

219
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:57,359
mind and their thinking and so recognition is a stronger Factor the cognitive faculties

220
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:02,960
and it's kind of like left and right-handed people there's different kinds of

221
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:09,839
perceptual people that's people who are somatic and sense with

222
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:15,000
their body predominantly can easily live an

223
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:21,540
imbalanced life because there's not enough knowledge recognition and wisdom about what they're sensing

224
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:28,859
people who are primarily in their recognition that cognitive parts of their mind do well in becoming dropping

225
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:35,339
into their body because there's a tremendous amount of information there that can augment and support whatever we

226
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:40,520
can think about or cognize and one of the things that we support

227
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:49,020
one of the things the Body Sensations body awareness allows for is it allows us to recognize all the

228
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:55,380
little ways in which we in big ways in which we tense up in which we are tight in the body

229
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:03,000
and for the Buddha becoming aware of that is extremely important because when we are aware of that we can

230
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,839
relax it and and carrying unnecessary tension in the body

231
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:16,020
is one of the functions of beginning of meditation practice is to learn to relax

232
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:21,839
and settle the body um so that uh the tensions of the body

233
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:28,440
don't create tensions in the mind or help you know many of the tensions of the body are there because of tensions

234
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:35,220
in the mind and then as we relax the body the Mind begins to relax as well

235
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:42,540
and this psychophysical system we have works much better as an instrument of

236
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:49,440
attention when it's a relaxed and so the movement in Buddhism towards

237
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:58,380
a heightened attention heightened awareness is dependent on a combination of alertness and relaxation and mental

238
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:06,780
alertness and a deep relaxation settling of the body deep Tranquility of the body

239
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:13,619
as the body becomes more relaxed more of uh more information can arise out of the

240
00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:20,280
body and nowadays we know that the body contains a lot more perceptual abilities

241
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:26,040
than than were known at the time of the Buddha there's a whole sense of

242
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:32,460
perception that has to do with balance there's a sense of perception that recognizes locations in our body where

243
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:38,220
different parts of the body are in space there is parts of the body Sensation

244
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:43,440
that feels gravity and weight all these are included in this

245
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,980
heightened sensitivity to the body but what it but this does a few different things

246
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:55,200
each of these perceptual ability contributes something to the overall

247
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:02,040
Gestalt of what Consciousness is and as the body relaxes it contributes

248
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:09,060
to a sense that Consciousness or awareness is soft is spacious is even

249
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:15,420
expansive as the body gets more and more relaxed and the tension is not there the hard

250
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:21,000
and fast boundaries and solidity of the body begins to dissolve and so does any

251
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,220
sense of solidity in the field of Consciousness and awareness

252
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:32,700
and so part of this mindfulness of the body what it contributes is

253
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:38,640
um is uh these other data points for constructing

254
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:46,079
the idea of consciousness and one of them is location part of the this idea that we can feel

255
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:52,079
and know different locations of the body gives a three-dimensional quality to the

256
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:59,940
scope of attention which can contribute to the idea that Consciousness can be Broad and wide that

257
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:06,780
some people have a sense that it's like a field of consciousness and it can feel very real and and kind

258
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:12,540
of existing in some wonderful way but it's the mind's way of taking in the

259
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:17,579
data about location and space that where it creates the image

260
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:23,640
a spatial kind of image that goes into the construction of our idea of consciousness

261
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:29,780
idea of the totality of all our perceptual abilities

262
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:38,819
so um so two things about uh

263
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:46,140
our ability to feel to sense our body is that one is to do it and to awaken

264
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:51,900
and make it a make it a common part of the day to drop into the body

265
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:56,940
doing that you'll learn a lot about yourself it's like the early warning

266
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:02,760
system of tension or fear Joy Delight it's a way of experiencing life more

267
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:08,700
fully including then having much more information about what's happening with

268
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:15,720
us and and our responses and reactions and then it also if this deeper feeling

269
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:23,220
of the body really making it a home for or we can then we have more ability to

270
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:32,040
relax the body to let go of unnecessary tension that we hold and that in turn supports a calming of

271
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:38,099
the of the Mind Tranquility of the body leads to Tranquility of mind

272
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:43,440
which leads to a more harmonious running of the

273
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:49,040
Clockwork of all our perceptions working together

274
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:57,660
so uh thank you and we'll continue tomorrow and on this

275
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:04,020
topic and I hope you find it interesting and um and um

276
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:07,880
and uh thank you all
