1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:08,559
great so hello hello and welcome everyone wherever you are in the world

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:18,240
however the weather is externally internally it's lovely to be with you

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,680
so as we are continuing to practice go through uh the categories

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,199
for compassion practice together we've been going through them one by one

5
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,480
we've now made it through the category of

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,960
what's called a neutral person's neutral being so

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,920
i know diana did that yesterday and i'm gonna going to continue with one more session

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,559
of cultivating compassion for someone

9
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:04,478
whom we don't know very well someone who's a stand-in for all of humanity we don't really have

10
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:12,880
a history with them we neither like them nor dislike them very strongly

11
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:21,200
due to someone there's another human being so this neutral being category

12
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:28,320
is so important is so important because yes you know there are

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,680
categories where ourselves we know ourselves pretty well we spend a lot of time with this being

14
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:41,360
that is us so cultivating compassion yes that's familiar um our beloveds our people we care about

15
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:48,079
our friends and benefactors yes compassion for them many times comes easily because we care for them if

16
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:56,000
they're hurting uh we hold their care we hold their their hurt their sorrow with care

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,119
and compassion or um yet yet this category of the neutral person

18
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:10,239
person whom we don't really know um why is it such an important category

19
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:18,319
it's many reasons but just to keep my comments brief before we actually

20
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,840
practice together one reason is that when we practice with

21
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,920
this neutral person after a while our hearts open up and we care for this

22
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:38,319
person who we don't even really know and our hearts learn that whom we care for and who is a

23
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:45,280
stranger and who's a friend who's a beloved person it's so arbitrary it feels so arbitrary

24
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:54,160
our heart as a human being has amazing unfathomable capacity

25
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,200
to care to to express its compassion for people whom

26
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,599
we don't even know and many times um

27
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:11,519
especially if you've sat or retreat or if you've practiced with the neutral person for a while you realize that they

28
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:19,760
don't remain neutral you start to develop care for them oh dear person oh dear dear human being

29
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:28,080
so it shifts it it changes you start to care for them as if they were your best friend since childhood these

30
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,760
transitions can happen very illuminating

31
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,159
to to feel that and another perspective

32
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:47,840
to consider is that being able to cultivate

33
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:55,680
and have a sense of care and compassion for a neutral person the standard for all of humanity

34
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,319
you know in a theistic context it could be thought of having a god-like

35
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:09,840
consciousness where a god-like consciousness is is one of care compassion

36
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,959
love indiscriminately regardless of your history or knowing

37
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,280
someone having care compassion for any being

38
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,880
so this god-like consciousness or divine consciousness is something that

39
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:37,040
actually we have as human beings we can experience it's accessible

40
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:45,000
and when we practice in this way sometimes there feels like there's access to this divine

41
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,199
indiscriminate care love compassion for other beings god-like divine

42
00:04:53,199 --> 00:05:00,000
being filled with beauty and grace and that is such a beautiful aspiration not just

43
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,120
aspiration but something actually we can feel into now and then the potential of our own hearts and mind

44
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:14,720
which may be beyond what we give credit to for to ourselves uh and we

45
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:22,240
even fathom that we're capable of but this practice opens us to that little by little so

46
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:29,600
don't have to take my word for it just practice and see what happens maybe not today

47
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,280
maybe in the next session or the one after that or the one after that

48
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,240
ah being open to possibilities so

49
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:52,960
so let's practice together it's the perfect time to transition into your sitting posture

50
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,759
ah if you need to shift and move

51
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:07,280
and as always we start by landing landing in our bodies

52
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:21,840
landing in our breath

53
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,600
letting go of thoughts letting go of all the words that just came before and

54
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,720
just landing ah arriving in the simplicity of this

55
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,639
moment just taking refuge for a few minutes and

56
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:49,680
breathing sitting and breathing that's all nothing fancy

57
00:06:49,680 --> 00:07:03,840
just being simple one birth at a time in this body

58
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:59,920
inviting your awareness to intimately connect be intertwined

59
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,839
with the breath in the abdomen

60
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,640
for the entire length of the in-breath

61
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:33,839
and the outbreak

62
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,600
and if their thoughts arising in this moment

63
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:52,160
are they really necessary in this moment or can you tell the thoughts

64
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:58,480
thank you for visiting not now please come back later

65
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:08,560
with gentleness kindness and yet a sense of empowered

66
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:17,839
awareness thank you not now

67
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:30,800
and intimately reconnecting with the breath in this moment taking refuge

68
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:45,839
ah safety trusting this moment

69
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,800
and now bringing to mind

70
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:03,440
someone you don't know very well they don't have to be absolutely neutral

71
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,438
but as long as you don't have much of a history with them

72
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:19,839
it could be a neighbor someone at a store where you shop

73
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,679
etc etc

74
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,559
choosing someone bringing them to your mind's eye clear visuals

75
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:42,640
trying to picture them as clearly as you can or having you felt sense of them maybe

76
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,840
it's a neighbor you walk by when you go for walks

77
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:02,720
having a felt sense of this fellow human being

78
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:15,200
but they look like what they feel like as much as possible may not be too much

79
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,840
available

80
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:29,840
connecting with them with this fellow human

81
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:43,120
who are just like you just wants to be happy this fellow human

82
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:53,039
being just like me does not want to suffer

83
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,360
it's not one to experience pain just like i don't

84
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,600
and they do have a body

85
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:14,080
so they experience pain discomfort illness sickness

86
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,720
just as i have

87
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,120
they've experienced disappointment

88
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:39,840
sadness loss grief

89
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:53,840
which has been painful for them just like i have it's been painful for me

90
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,919
this this person is an object of affection

91
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:09,600
of others they are cared for they're loved they're

92
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,679
appreciated they're a friend

93
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:21,440
a child to someone maybe a parent to someone a sibling of

94
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,919
someone a partner to someone

95
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,880
and they care for others

96
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:49,840
they have hopes and dreams they delight and laugh

97
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,200
they cherish their loved ones their happiness

98
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:05,360
they've experienced both joy love gladness

99
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:17,280
delight and sadness and sorrow pain and disappointment

100
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,400
just like you have

101
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:32,159
their inner life is just as complex and compelling

102
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:45,840
as yours is to you

103
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:59,840
they want to be seen respected loved cared for happy and not suffering

104
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:13,840
they are not so different from you

105
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,799
feeling the sense of connection to this

106
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,919
person a heart connection

107
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:41,280
maybe there are things similar about the two of you you don't know

108
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:54,000
maybe they like the same vegetable you like or the same fruit or flavor of ice cream

109
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,520
imagine both of you discovering that your imagination

110
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:09,840
and sharing relishing [Music] this favorite food together

111
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:03,279
and for the purpose of this practice it's okay to use our imagination

112
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:08,880
it's a skillful means to use our

113
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:22,820
imagination to perhaps imagine

114
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:28,880
[Music] some difficulty some sadness some

115
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,000
challenge in their life which you know which you have

116
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,840
experienced firsthand

117
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:49,440
and you know how difficult it is it could be an illness

118
00:24:50,799 --> 00:25:00,000
or grief or loss relationship challenge financial

119
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,960
work whatever it might be it's okay

120
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:14,720
knowing that they have challenges just like you and just a sense

121
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,158
have a sense of connection

122
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:30,158
what if it happened that their sorrow happened to be one way they've

123
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:37,120
had suffering experience suffering similar to yours who knows

124
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:48,320
or you can imagine some other form of challenge or sorrow

125
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:57,840
difficulty you know they have it we all do as human beings

126
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:07,120
and feeling just as you would how painful it would be for you to

127
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:25,840
experience this challenge this loss this illness the sorrow

128
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:45,600
and feeling your connection this common humanity

129
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:53,360

130

i wish you i wish you freedom

131
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:07,600
from the sorrow from this pain from this challenge

132
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:21,760
whatever it is you're experiencing

133
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,840
just as i wish to have ease

134

i wish you ease in the midst of yours

136
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,360

140
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,480
and wishing the meas

141

as if each out breath that you breathe out brings them solace and comfort

145
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:26,320
you can connect with your breath and the

146
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:40,880
phrases if you wish of compassion for this person

your heart and care compassion [Music] for this neutral person

00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:27,838
grace and beauty shining through your own heart

sense of peace and ease

157
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,078
and this cultivation of compassion

158
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,839
that you experience

159
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,760
and for the last moments of this practice period

160
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:25,200
holding yourself in compassion for whatever arose or did not arise

161
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:33,760
maybe the opposite arose or nothing arose it's okay it's okay hold yourself with care

186
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:49,680
annika monica hi um yeah haven't shared ever so let's try

187
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:57,280
it um um what came up for me actually was uh

188
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:04,319
i was going with the visualization for like a third of the meditation maybe and

189
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:10,720
then um there was just a wave of anxiety

190
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:16,430
um manifesting physically which has just been something

191
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:24,880
[Music] that's been around in my body for a few weeks now

192
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,940
um and so you know i was changing around positions and everything and um

193
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:36,079
[Music] yeah i actually ended up sort of just being barely there

194
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:43,280
with the meditation um [Music] yeah i felt like that might be worth

195
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:50,800
sharing yeah yeah absolutely i'm glad you shared that uh anika

196
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:58,240
and here's an invitation if that arises again and

197
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:05,119
it sounds like the anxiety the restlessness is something that you said has been coming up for a

198
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:11,760
while so um oh

199
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:19,599
yes i just opened chat i forgot to do that um um so it sounds like it's been something

200
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:26,079
that's been coming up and of course when your mind right now settles and there's quiet

201
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:32,079
then that pattern that's been present for a while it shows up again oh

202
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:37,520
here you are here you are dear friend anxiety restlessness i see you

203
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:43,440
i see you so it's quite normal uh if it's been going on for a

204
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,880
while for it to come up in this way so what i suggest is to then

205
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:55,520
turn the compassion to yourself because you're the one in that moment

206
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:01,920
who's suffering and having a challenge of anxiety and restlessness it's not pleasant right

207
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:08,319
so turn the compassion even though the guidance supposedly is with the with the

208
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:16,720
um uh person with the neutral person feel free to turn it turn it

209
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:22,960
to where it's needed in this moment oh i'm the one suffering right now so the practice can become

210
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,160
self-compassion great practice self-compassion fantastic

211
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:35,200
so you and everybody else absolutely has license in fact you're invited to do

212
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:41,839
that you're encouraged to do that incident no i'm not supposed to have compassion for myself i'm supposed to have it for

213
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:47,599
this other person like it's okay just turn it as long as you're practicing compassion

214
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:53,760
mental loving kindness you're at the right place you're in perfect company so i

215
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,960
appreciate you bringing this question up and i see appreciation

216
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:05,280
in chat many actually some people have sent the appreciations to you to me direct message to me but know that there

217
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:11,920
have been multiple appreciations for you raising that so does that make sense annika

218
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:18,400
yeah do you actually um put anxiety under the category of like restlessness and worry

219
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:24,160
as far as like hindrances yeah okay yeah that does make sense

220
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:29,599
thank you yeah you're welcome and again always feel free you and everyone else you can

221
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:35,760
just turn it and hold it oh this is hard sweetie this is hard this is challenging right

222
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:41,920
now it's okay it's okay may you be free may you have peace in the midst of this

223
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:50,000
restlessness worry this anxiety may you have ease with it yeah

224
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,079
great thank you

225
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:03,520
and i had uh let's see chris die like to raise your

226
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:09,839
hand but you but somehow it's not working for you i'm going to ask you to unmute yourself there you go

227
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:16,020
thank you actually i'm not sure where it's at um yeah i find that the

228
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:21,680
[Music] compassion practice can often be quite emotional for me and today was

229
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:28,480
another example of that uh if i if i really kind of connect with

230
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:34,319
the practice i kind of feel it in my chest and sometimes i can become quite tearful

231
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:40,880
as well and today i think i think it's when i i i realize

232
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:46,160
that sometimes i really don't show compassion for other people

233
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:52,720
whose lives i don't have much insight into you know and and then when i realized

234
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:59,040
that i've once that i've done that you know i yeah it really it's incredibly

235
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:06,000
eye-opening um so it's both a positive thing because i'm like oh yeah okay i recognize that

236
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:12,480
i'm doing that and hopefully i can i can use that in my day-to-day life but also you know

237
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:19,520
a little bit of shame that that happened um yeah that i that i forgot well

238
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:25,839
i didn't forget i think it's easy to say oh we don't know what people are going through everyone's got a lot on

239
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:33,280
but to like truly believe that and connect with that and treat people as such i think is a

240
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:39,920
is a whole other step so yeah it's it's a good practice but i definitely get emotional sometimes

241
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:46,880
yeah thank you for sharing that i'm gonna many things you raised i'm gonna comment

242
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:52,800
on a couple of them because i think it's very important one is as you're saying can be an emotional

243
00:46:52,800 --> 00:47:00,880
practice for you it's okay tears are fine it's perfectly fine in fact when um

244
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:07,280
i teach um uh retreats on compassion and unloving kindness specifically

245
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:15,200
and um and people come say oh i'm just crying in the hall and i'm practicing and crying and and what i

246
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:21,920
and other teachers say it's okay it's this is the place for it let it move through these are the tear

247
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:27,200
tears of healing tears of healing they need to be expressed so holding them back in fact

248
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,720
being able to cry is beautiful it's lovely this tenderness of heart so don't

249
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:38,319
shy away from it it's okay befriend befriend the tears

250
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:44,160
there's strength in the the tears and the tenderness there's a lot of strength

251
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:50,480
and there's so many people who say oh i wish i could cry i wish i could feel the tenderness so enjoy that

252
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:58,319
appreciate the tenderness of your heart krista it's not a problem and and then as you were saying oh wow

253
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:03,680
that's connecting with this um sense of other people

254
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:11,920
their challenges and really being able to connect with that again lovely beautiful and when self-judgment

255
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:18,160
comes in through shame like you should be able to do this better

256
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:23,520
it's like oh right it's it's it's it's the pattern of self-judgment

257
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:29,359
showing up in different ways in different areas like no this is a cultivation here i am i'm

258
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:35,440
cultivating it it's and it's hard for me to i and then have compassion for your dear self

259
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,800
you're overwhelmed with your own life and so here you are here you are you've

260
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:48,319
shown up to cultivate this beautiful gift to share with others so thank you so much

261
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:54,480
thank you yeah so so let's

262
00:48:54,480 --> 00:49:00,720
practice i like to invite us in small groups and and tonight i think it'll be quite

263
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:05,920
special because you can also be each other's neutral people

264
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,960
you you know you all have challenges in each other's life so holding each other

265
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:16,720
with a sense of care and and meta and compassion

266
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:22,800
these dear beings from across the world who are holding you and you're holding

267
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:30,880
them in in challenge so maybe start with 30 seconds of just wordless wordless meta 30 second

268
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:38,079
of wordless compassion for each other just holding each other's presence knowing that you all have challenges and

269
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:46,640
then if you like to share for a few words you might be shorter tonight because we had more comments so um i'll create the

270
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:52,160
rooms and i hope you stay to participate it's such an important part of our

271
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:58,559
humanity to connect in this way in these small supportive groups and practice together

272
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:05,520
so here we go rooms are open okay everyone the rooms are closed we're

273
