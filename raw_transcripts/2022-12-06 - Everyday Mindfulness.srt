1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:06,720
uh my name is Jim Podolski and I'm going to give a talk tonight

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,420
about what I call everyday mindfulness

3
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:17,760
so the word mindfulness gets used more and more these days certainly more

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,000
than um back when I first started this practice and

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,060
she's in a lot of different ways so when I use the word kind of a very

6
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:36,540
simple and probably incomplete definition would be it's

7
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:43,680
knowing what's happening as it's happening so it's a present moment awareness

8
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,379
practice I'm curious how many you of you have

9
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:55,020
taken some kind of mindfulness meditation class whether it's an hour

10
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:03,359
long or uh day long or a couple weeks okay looks

11
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,400
like most everyone has um of course I don't know about people who

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:17,340
are online so I thought I'd give a very very brief description of mindfulness meditation as

13
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:24,659
we teach it here at IMC there's basically four postures that you

14
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:33,200
can take for meditating sitting standing walking or lying down

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,460
we teach primarily sitting meditation since it's the

16
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:47,119
works the best for a group and it really just consists of

17
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,659
sitting down taking an alert an upright posture

18
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:02,700
bringing some relaxation to the body gently closing the eyes if you'd like

19
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:09,300
and then bringing the awareness to the breath just noticing the sensation of

20
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:16,560
the breath wherever in the body it's most um it's most accessible for you where it's

21
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,739
most noticeable and and so that's

22
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:27,959
really um the beginning of it is just

23
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:34,440
bringing the awareness to the breath and noticing it noticing when the awareness wanders off

24
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:42,360
and just gently bringing it back over time other uh

25
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:51,800
experiences may arise you may have bodily Sensations that arise and those

26
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:59,480
for the most part you might just leave in the background and stay with the breath if they become

27
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,860
compelling much more compelling than the breath than you can bring your your

28
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:10,319
awareness to those bodily Sensations and when they're no longer compelling

29
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:16,019
come back to the breath um the other experiences that might

30
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:21,720
arise are emotions noticing when emotions arise and again

31
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:28,920
if they're the most um a dominant experience then you'd bring

32
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:36,840
your awareness for a while to the emotion wow watch it as it arises and passes

33
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,720
and then likewise thoughts all of the activities of them all the mental activities

34
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,540
the planning for the future the remembering the past

35
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:55,760
stories fantasies beliefs opinions

36
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:05,040
um letting your awareness go to them in a in a very conscious way in a very

37
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,500
intentional way and then when they're no longer dominant

38
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:17,040
coming back to the breath so in this

39
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,079
21st century Western

40
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:29,540
Insight way we let the awareness

41
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,460
rest on one of those four categories the breath the body

42
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:41,539
the emotions or the thoughts

43
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,440
and the other characteristic is that we often decide ahead of time how long

44
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,440
we're going to meditate we usually set some kind of a timer for maybe 15 or 20

45
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,660
or 30 minutes 45 minutes maybe even an hour

46
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,880
and then just set the intention to to just sit still and be with whatever

47
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:12,440
arises until the timer goes off

48
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,720
and that's I think are very wonderful practice it's very helpful to to do it

49
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:26,280
every day you know set aside you know find some time to to sit and meditate

50
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:32,220
on retreats uh it's much more intense than that rather

51
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,380
than just doing one sitting a day you do an alternate between sitting meditation

52
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:46,039
and walking and sitting and walking and then there's some meals in there

53
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:54,900
but again mostly they're kind of fixed length and of course the Retreats fix length at the end of The Retreat you go

54
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:03,180
back to your your everyday life the effects of of either a daily sit or

55
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:11,580
a a longer retreat usually can last for some time and eventually

56
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:19,639
um are no longer as noticeable

57
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:31,160
enduring retreats there's often an instruction after the first maybe three or four or five days

58
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,979
to bring some more continuity to your practice so rather than just sit

59
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:44,220
and then stop meditating get up go back to your normal

60
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:50,220
state of of awareness and then doing walking

61
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:57,060
meditation and taking breaks between every each one of those activities the instruction is

62
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:02,160
often to um see if you can bring some continuity of

63
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,860
practice between the sits and the walks and the sits at least maybe for a couple

64
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,918
hours and see what that what that's like

65
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:21,780
um I've had the opportunity to do that a

66
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:29,160
number of times and I often wish that I could do it differently but

67
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:35,340
um my life was such a I was working I had was working to

68
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:41,460
earn a living and pay my mortgage and everything else so I couldn't go on a

69
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:48,479
retreat uh continuously so I started to think how how can I

70
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:55,740
develop this mindfulness um in everyday life

71
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,979
off the cushion off retreat

72
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:07,199
on the Retreats they they sometimes say well when you go back

73
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:14,759
into your daily life you might find a few uh cues a few things that might

74
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:20,759
um help you remember to pay attention so for example turning on and off light

75
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:27,539
switches might be a cue to you to like really notice what's what that's like or

76
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:33,659
going through doors um things ordinary things that we do

77
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:39,419
every day that we could use as cues to to just um

78
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:46,920
you know uh amp up the the awareness

79
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,060
at least for momentarily

80
00:08:53,580 --> 00:09:00,300
in the last few years certainly since the pandemic I've

81
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:08,040
I live alone and I've been doing a lot of my work remotely so I actually do

82
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:13,760
have a lot of I'm so I'm seldom really rushed or

83
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,380
constrained in time so I've started developing more and more ways of

84
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:27,540
cultivating mindfulness throughout my day so I thought I would walk you through

85
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:34,260
um a day in the life of Jim and point out some of the potential

86
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:41,459
places where I can practice mindfulness I I'm not going to say that I do it all of the time and you know like I never

87
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:47,160
miss a beat uh there there's plenty of uh gaps

88
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:55,320
but um there's also many many parts of my life where

89
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,959
that don't require a lot of interpersonal interaction or a lot of

90
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:06,899
cognitive activity to try to figure out what I'm going to do

91
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:15,120
so my day starts with my waking up and often waking up isn't just one I

92
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,700
don't just wake up and then that's it I sometimes fall back to sleep and uh

93
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:27,600
but eventually there's one time that I wake up and it's okay this is It's Time

94
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,720
and I tend to dream a lot and so the very first thing I do is notice

95
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,060
was I just dreaming you know what was going on in my mind just before I

96
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:45,360
moved from unconscious to conscious and oftentimes

97
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:52,399
um I can remember something you know like I I

98
00:10:52,500 --> 00:11:00,060
can be aware that there were thoughts and images going on even though I wasn't

99
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:06,120
um wide awake for them

100
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:15,240
some psychotherapists think that there's a lot of meaning in dreams and they encourage people to journal their dreams

101
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:22,279
and I used to do that in the 80s now for me I use it more as a

102
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:28,860
kind of a mindfulness tool that that when I wake up my first

103
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:35,000
intention is to pay attention to what what was just in my mind

104
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:41,100
and I find that by doing that it there is a little bit more energy that

105
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,440
immediately comes up a little bit more awareness

106
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:52,680
a little bit more Focus you know if I don't then my mind is often or my

107
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:59,579
awareness is kind of floating around um not quite sure where to land

108
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:04,680
so if I let it land on on dreams that

109
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,260
immediately um

110
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:16,680
bring some some Focus to awareness

111
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:22,519
the next thing that I do after or is not every morning but most mornings

112
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:28,560
I do a short period of loving kindness so even before I get out of bed

113
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:35,640
I just let whatever being or beings or people

114
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:44,040
that come to mind I say some phrases of well-wishing for

115
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:52,079
them you know may they be safe may they be happy may they be healthy

116
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:58,019
may they be tranquil and I repeat those phrases you know a

117
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:05,660
number of times for for one person and then maybe someone else will come to mind and I'll I'll do that

118
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:12,720
and I don't set a timer for that usually I do at least five minutes of loving

119
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,839
kindness but sometimes it could be 30 minutes

120
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,880
and the value of that practice for me number one is um

121
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:29,279
it helps set an intention for the day

122
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:37,980
that I've noticed over the years that this this mind is is fairly prone to aversion

123
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:44,639
you know kind of finding what's wrong with this picture so by doing loving kindness when I first

124
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:52,160
wake up there's um it kind of shifts things so that that

125
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,600
the old uh patterns of thinking

126
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,920
um yeah I get challenged a little bit you know and notice oh yeah well

127
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,579
it there's a certain happiness from wishing well for others

128
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,740
um so that not only helps wake up the mind and the

129
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:22,019
awareness but it helps wake up the heart and it brings some energy

130
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:29,180
to the body and it it sets an intention

131
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:37,620
and these are easy this is pretty easy practice um I'm not sitting in some

132
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:43,320
uh on some cushion on a hard floor I'm

133
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:50,820
still in the warm nice warm bed until I decide to get up and then when I

134
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:59,399
get up these days the house is kind of cold I leave the temperature at about 56 so

135
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:06,320
so there's all sorts of sensation of the body you know going from lying to sitting to standing

136
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,579
feeling the coolness of the air

137
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:17,040
um and then

138
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,680
from there I I go and now that

139
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:30,540
I'm woke up I wake up my computer I turn it on and you know it it takes a

140
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:35,880
while to connect to the internet and do VPN and

141
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:41,000
single sign-on and certificates and all sorts of things to get my work computer

142
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,920
ready to talk to the world and then I go in the kitchen to have

143
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,380
breakfast and

144
00:15:52,560 --> 00:16:00,240
um that's quite an enjoyable experience

145
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:06,600
so um let's see I forgot one part I was going

146
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:13,500
to say the um when I talked about mindfulness meditation

147
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:21,540
the uh categories that we that I use for experience are you know the the breath

148
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:27,480
the body um emotions and

149
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:34,980
thoughts what the Buddha taught is the foundation the four foundations for mindfulness are

150
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:40,620
also the body um but also feeling tone

151
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:48,620
is the experience you're having is it Pleasant is it unpleasant or is it neither Pleasant or unpleasant

152
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:53,639
and then the third one was mine States

153
00:16:53,639 --> 00:17:00,959
kind of the mood of the Mind is the Mind contracted or expanded

154
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:06,000
you know is it irritable or is it happy

155
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,678
you know is it um is it kind of fuzzy or is it clear

156
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,199
and you can probably think of your own labels for the states of your mind that

157
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:26,220
you find but it's it's helpful to to be able to recognize what what what's the mood in

158
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:31,440
the mind right now and then the fourth one is

159
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,780
um is mental activities thoughts

160
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:43,080
mental formations um much like the the first list that I

161
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,900
that I gave so those are the four that the Buddha gave us and

162
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:55,980
so going back into the kitchen and and back uh preparing my my breakfast I

163
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:03,179
always have oatmeal with blueberries and raspberries pomegranate arrows uh

164
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:09,900
walnuts a banana and a dollop of Greek yogurt on the top

165
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:16,620
so it doesn't you know it's kind of the same every day so it's it doesn't take a lot of thought and planning

166
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:22,380
so I can just just let that time be a time when I can

167
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:27,840
notice you know kind of notice what's it really like to hold a bowl of hot

168
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:34,980
oatmeal what's it like to um you know slice the banana

169
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:40,260
and then sitting and eating eating meditation is one of the formal

170
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:45,480
practices on Retreat you know they really encourage you to to s that when

171
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:51,059
you eat just eat just just notice all of the sensations

172
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:57,240
you know the The Taste the texture uh the smell

173
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:04,080
you know the the visual of it even the sounds like the the spoon hitting the

174
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:10,200
Corel Bowl it's quite a sense experience

175
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:16,380
um and if you just decide that

176
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:23,640
um you want to do this you can just you know kind of let

177
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:30,059
everything else um be in the background you know all of the thoughts that my computer may have

178
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:37,260
generated from looking at email you know all my plans for the day are still there but they don't they

179
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:44,340
don't have to be um what I'm attending to what I can attend to is just this this process of

180
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:50,720
eating um

181
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,940
I go back to the computer uh

182
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:03,360
look at email some more and also notice how am I sitting you know like what's what's my

183
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:10,500
posture like as I'm sitting at the computer I I find often that my my shoulders tend to move forward and I

184
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:18,059
hunch over so uh I might make a decision to sit a

185
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:24,299
little bit more upright and then the next

186
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:31,020
uh activity of the day is um going to the bathroom and getting clean

187
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:38,660
you know so I use a water pick floss brush gargle

188
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:45,020
shave with a safety razor you know a lot of a lot of sense

189
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:50,520
experience going on there and to the extent that I can just let

190
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,860
the rest of my my thoughts and my um

191
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:02,280
plans um relax a bit then I can just notice what

192
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:09,320
what's it what's it like is it is it Pleasant when I'm shaving is it pleasant when I'm

193
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,740
brushing my teeth

194
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:22,620
you know just like you know kind of letting whatever that simple activity is

195
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:27,780
be the focus of of awareness

196
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:32,880
really makes a difference and then of course

197
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:39,960
taking a shower is kind of a almost a body scan

198
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:45,419
type mindfulness practice you know starting from the head and shampooing my

199
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:52,020
hair you know all the way down to my feet the warm water

200
00:21:52,020 --> 00:22:00,500
that I use sparingly the cold air when the warm water stops

201
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:08,419
um and drying off you know taking the towel it's it's another whole body scan from

202
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:13,400
uh the top of my head to the bottom of my feet

203
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:24,419
you know it doesn't it's very easy to do all of these things automatically and with

204
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:31,320
um and kind of tuned out you know like doing them and not really knowing that

205
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:38,100
you're doing them so I uh many mornings use the sh you know

206
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:44,340
kind of do shower meditation then get dressed

207
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:50,460
you know and you know feeling the

208
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:56,760
feeling the cloth as it as it covers my my upper body and lower body and putting

209
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:03,500
on my socks and then going off for the day you know

210
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:12,840
going to work there's several categories

211
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:18,720
I mean one one of the areas that I think is very important for mindfulness and

212
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,500
it's so important that I'm not going to try to cover it tonight which is

213
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:31,500
mindfulness of speech uh or more generally mindfulness of

214
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:37,679
speech and mindfulness of listening and more generally than that is

215
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,900
mindfulness of communication like like really paying attention when

216
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:50,520
you're talking to somebody when you're listening to somebody when you're reading an email or writing

217
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:57,840
one or a text or a letter um those those in some ways are sort of

218
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,059
advanced mindfulness practice in in my view

219
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:10,500
there's been a lot of talks given about that kind of thing just yesterday afternoon the there's an Eightfold Path

220
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:17,340
class that was all on right speech um there's a teacher named Greg Gregory

221
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:22,980
Kramer who often holds workshops on Insight dialogue

222
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:30,299
which is um a way to to really help bring more

223
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:36,960
awareness to the way that we communicate with each other

224
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:44,520
so I won't say more than that about my mindfulness of communication but

225
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:50,159
that's a that's a a very important

226
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:56,220
daily practice but the simple practices the ones that

227
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:03,419
don't that um don't take quite so much um practice

228
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:08,460
um the other ones for me are

229
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:14,039
my office is at one end of the building and the both the men's room and the

230
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:20,159
break room are at the other end of the building so when I get up to either

231
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,260
go use the restroom or go to the break room to refill my water bottle

232
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:33,480
that's an opportunity to do sort of a mini walking meditation to just allow myself to say well for

233
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:40,200
this next couple of minutes that I'm walking down and back I don't have to figure anything out I

234
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:47,039
don't I don't need I'm not I don't have to compose an email or understand some

235
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:53,400
obscure concept or figure out how I'm going to

236
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:59,340
solve a some problem that I can just for that few minutes I

237
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:04,440
can just take a break and notice what's it like to be walking

238
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:13,700
the feeling in my feet in my lower legs maybe the breeze on my hands as I walk

239
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:21,440
you know just getting in touch you know getting in touch and staying in touch with the body

240
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:27,600
uh the other the other place that I practice mindfulness at least at least

241
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:34,559
some of the time is driving I'm kind of in an age now where

242
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:40,020
my reflexes are slower than they used to be so

243
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:47,640
so it's really uh it's really crucial that when I'm driving I'm just driving

244
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:54,320
I'm just paying attention to the road to the car to other drivers

245
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:03,059
I don't play music I don't listen to talks I don't have a hands-free telephone to

246
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:07,520
to talk to other people um

247
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:13,740
I just drive you know I just I just uh

248
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:20,039
let the awareness you know stay um

249
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:25,740
partly in the body and partly on the road ahead

250
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:32,220
I I don't go on any really long drives it's probably most most everything that

251
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:40,020
I do is within about an hour of where I live so being mindful driving for an hour is

252
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:45,779
um is not that challenging I mean

253
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:51,720
as much as there's some desire

254
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:58,020
for the mind to be entertained you know entertained with music or

255
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:04,020
I'm not a big fan of talk radio but you know Dharma talks or things like that

256
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:09,840
um you know for however much time I'm in the car I

257
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:17,480
can just forego that and just and just let that be a mindfulness practice

258
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:27,860
and then at the end of the day it's you know the same thing you uh brush my teeth

259
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:34,679
get into my the pajamas that I wear and then

260
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:40,140
go to bed so that's that's kind of a

261
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:49,039
a day in the life for me of of the simple ways that mindfulness is accessible

262
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,640
when I decided to give this talk I also happened to ask a number of friends

263
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:02,460
of mine people in um kalyanamita groups like

264
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:07,500
so how do you how do you cultivate everyday mindfulness what you know what

265
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:13,020
are your practices or what are your cues to uh

266
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:20,460
kick it up a notch and one friend of mine one person in the

267
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:29,000
group had talked about when they go out to the mailbox each day to get their mail you know they

268
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:35,520
you know just um do that as sort of a mini air micro

269
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:42,539
walking meditation now the person didn't tell me whether once they get the mail whether they

270
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:50,820
start to read it on the way back or whether they just stay stay with the walking I I suspect that it's the latter

271
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:56,820
or taking out the garbage thing take it to a dumpster so again it's it's

272
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:01,460
it's one of those everyday things where you can just

273
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,820
bring your awareness to the body and and also

274
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:14,760
primarily to the body but also to the feeling tone is this Pleasant or

275
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:21,539
unpleasant or neutral um you may also notice

276
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:27,659
um the mood of the Mind or the thoughts in the mind

277
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:33,059
for many years when I would drive up here on Monday nights to

278
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:39,000
to manage the traffic on 101 would often be bad

279
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:45,860
and it never it almost never failed that I noticed that when I left work to head here

280
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:51,919
I was irritable there then the mind was irritable

281
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:58,740
and by the time I left here it was completely different it was it was much

282
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:07,039
more energetic much more uh relaxed much more uh tranquil

283
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:14,580
I'd often wondered why couldn't my why couldn't my mind State have been

284
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:21,600
different when I got in the car to come here and I I don't know it could have

285
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:28,080
been I hadn't eaten it couldn't just I was kind of tired

286
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,600
but in any case that um

287
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:39,120
those are some of the things that I've come up with um

288
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,159
other people told me something that I thought I was kind of surprised that at

289
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:50,880
first and then I realized that this made perfect sense which was

290
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:58,500
their cue for kicking up mindfulness was when they were suffering

291
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:04,919
when there was Duca um it could be anything from

292
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:10,679
as mild as just feeling like something is kind of off

293
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:15,960
uh you know feeling kind of awkward

294
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:21,779
uh I'm uncomfortable dissatisfied

295
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:30,559
uh irritable all the way to fairly intense pain

296
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:36,840
and they said when they noticed that

297
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:45,240
they realized ah the response is to um shift into a higher gear

298
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:53,840
awareness wise you know to bring to bring more mindfulness to bring more attention

299
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:02,039
to what's going on for me it's not just the tension it's

300
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:10,559
a particular kind which is and the tension which has kindness and

301
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:16,080
curiosity so that it's it's

302
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:22,620
greeting the experience with a certain um openness

303
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:29,159
and also some curiosity to want to know what you know is is there something going on

304
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:35,159
here that I'm not missing that I'm missing so that that sense of

305
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:43,140
um openness of welcoming and of wanting to be curious and

306
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:50,640
investigate [Music] I think are also important parts of

307
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,940
a mindfulness that will help when things get tough you

308
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:02,820
know when things are challenging when when you're having not a nice

309
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:08,539
pleasant bowl of oatmeal but when

310
00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:16,800
you're having an experience you just don't want to have like no not this I don't want to be I don't want things to

311
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,339
be this way um

312
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:30,118
and for many many years and still to this day although not as

313
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:35,280
much my instinct

314
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:41,280
when unwelcome experience showed up was to

315
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,740
try to somehow Escape how can I get out of this you know can I

316
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:52,618
just physically get up and leave or can I just zone out

317
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:58,440
uh can I be can I ignore it can I distract myself can I distract

318
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:04,680
others is there some delusion or some fan you know is there some other

319
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:10,260
uh place in the imagination I can go so that I don't have to see what's

320
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:15,839
happening and after

321
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:22,320
all the years that I've been alive um that never works

322
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:29,280
I mean it might kind of work a little bit but a long term it never works so

323
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:35,640
developing an ability to be present in those times of

324
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:44,839
challenge in those times of uh suffering in those times of uh

325
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:49,400
experiencing The Unwanted

326
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:58,500
um paying attention is and meeting it

327
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:05,400
can often be a much better approach

328
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:11,579
than trying to make something go away I have a friend that I talked to just

329
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:17,160
recently who's subject to having migraine headaches

330
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:24,900
and they said that that when the pain is real intense the

331
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:30,599
only thing that really helps is mindfulness it is just paying

332
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:36,720
attention to the experience because what they told me was

333
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:44,820
when they really paid careful attention they found that it wasn't constant solid

334
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:52,380
pain that you know that there were moments of relative ease

335
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:57,740
that were interspersed with moments of of

336
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:04,440
intense unpleasant and they found that that there was

337
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,540
actually sort of almost a wave nature to the pain that would kind of come and go

338
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:16,460
and come and go and by seeing that it became

339
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:26,220
easier to work with that the Mind wasn't trying to push it away wasn't trying to

340
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:33,060
escape that it was actually possible to stay with that experience

341
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:40,320
and that over time it dissipated when I was told

342
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:48,119
this story last night um there was no migraine operating

343
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:50,838
so

344
00:37:53,880 --> 00:38:00,240
so cultivating mindfulness in everyday simple experience can

345
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:06,480
give us a capacity to deal to to be able to be present when those much more

346
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:13,260
challenging experiences arise so it isn't you know

347
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:20,760
cultivating mindfulness in itself isn't um the ultimate goal it's really

348
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:27,720
developing mindfulness so that we can see more clearly what's going on

349
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:38,060
and respond to our experience in a more wise and beneficial way

350
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:51,200
you know so so there's a way that um

351
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:59,579
I think practicing mindfulness can be beneficial in the moment

352
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:07,079
and it can be beneficial as the light as the challenges in life

353
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:12,540
um present themselves to us which

354
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:21,599
they always will I don't know that I've ever met anybody who hasn't hasn't uh face challenges

355
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:29,880
so uh thank you all for listening um if anyone has any questions or might

356
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:38,839
want to share their experience of mindfulness Sally could you give him the

357
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:52,200
thanks Jim you mentioned that there's times of course where you're not mindful do you find that happens by accident out

358
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:58,980
of weakness or do you find that you make a decision you know now I am going to opt for

359
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:05,000
entertainment rather than mindfulness and how do you make that decision

360
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:10,160
yeah that's a that's a great question um

361
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:16,560
I'm not sure that I ever consciously decide not to be mindful

362
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:23,160
if there's certain but it happens I'd say mindlessness happens

363
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:29,339
uh and I don't think there's anything wrong with

364
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:37,200
uh entertaining the mind I I don't have a television my television broke during the the pandemic and I just decided not

365
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:43,619
to get a new one but I have the internet and so I listen to music from my youth

366
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:50,040
you know from the 50 from the 60s and 70s and some of those songs are just I mean

367
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:55,579
they just bring up a lot of memories a lot of um

368
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:02,400
emotion and I think that those are fine to enjoy you

369
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:09,480
know I I don't think that the practice is about some real strict asceticism of

370
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:15,319
you know sitting in a cave and all your life

371
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:24,420
I'd say there's still some mindfulness operating when I when I do those things

372
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:29,460
like uh listen to old music or watch old movies

373
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:36,420
which is seeing that they can't be clung to

374
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:43,320
you know I can listen to a song that I really like and then I might listen to it again

375
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:49,460
and again and after a while it's like well song's end

376
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:55,560
you know and often they end in just a few minutes um

377
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:01,320
so being able to enjoy and not cling is is maybe the practice

378
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:07,579
to do in in those situations um

379
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:14,520
yeah I don't know have you had an experience of of

380
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:20,400
um consciously consciously

381
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:26,520
dropping awareness if I have a long drive sometimes I will drive mindfully and try to pay attention

382
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:33,060
to my hands on the wheel and sometimes I'll listen to a podcast or if

383
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:39,720
I've had a maybe a difficult experience like a hard day at work or something I feel like

384
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:45,780
I don't have capacity for mindfulness at that time yeah

385
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:53,640
yeah well I don't I don't want this any of the practices that I that I described to

386
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:58,680

387
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:05,400

388
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:12,380
