1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:07,719
hello hello voice is coming it's coming it's coming there we

2
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:12,120
go I'm happy to see you this

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,760
evening so my name is Maria stropman and I am here for Diana tonight she'll be

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:28,840
back I think next week so last week we talked about

5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:35,079
intention if you were here we talked about intention mindfulness and the

6
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:40,160
journey and we talked about it in terms of intention being a motivator an

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,520
instigator the thing that gets us started on the path and guides us tell

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,719
us tells us we're going the direction we want to be going sort of sets sets the

9
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,199
tone for what what it is that we're doing on our journey and it takes effort

10
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:03,480
then to sustain that to get it going to persist in the in the journey and

11
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,759
that it is mindfulness mindfulness that marks the journey that

12
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:19,200
keeps us on the way that brings us into the now of being here being with what is

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:26,000
happening and that all of this has to do with what we like to call the uh first

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,399
three factors of Enlightenment Faith or confidence that is the intention leads

15
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:38,159
to Faith of I'm I know I'm going the right direction and every step that we

16
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,320
take reinforces that and increases the confidence in the path and the effort

17
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,840
number two the that keeps us persisting in the path that is the second item and

18
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,840
the third one is mindfulness without mindfulness we're not going anywhere we don't know where we're going so those

19
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:04,320
are the first three this evening what we're going to talk about are the last two which are

20
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,000
con uh concentration and wisdom or

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,599
discernment now when I list it that way it all sounds a little bit like um a

22
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:25,920
catechism you know you got to do this this this this and this and we have definitions for what those

23
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,599
are and it's just one more part of our practice and if you recall one of the things that

24
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:39,760
I said is that I always feel like I'm starting in the middle of the story because everything affects

25
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,800
everything else it's not as if we do this then this happens and we do this

26
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,000
then that happens in fact everything influences everything

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,159
else so what I really want to talk about is what the effect of concentration is

28
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:04,120
on whether we have faith in the journey Journey how does concentration affect

29
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,680
mindfulness what does mindfulness have to do with concentration why when we sit down to

30
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,400
meditate do we become so obsessed with I'm not concentrated and does it make any

31
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,920
difference why do we do that what's it about what's the

32
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,280
usefulness of that and by the way what we practice

33
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,920
here is vasana which is Insight Meditation and where are those insights

34
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,360
anyway how do I get them what do I have to

35
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:45,120
do it's not as mysterious as all that it's really not as mysterious as all

36
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:52,480
that and when I point to these factors I really want you to understand

37
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,840
that you already have them all and all we want to do is cultivate

38
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:06,280
them all we want to do is learn learn how to use them skillfully all we want to do is have them as supports for the

39
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,720
practice that we do they're not goals or endpoints they're not things that we

40
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,078
have to have they're not things we pack in our

41
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:23,880
suitcases they're Maps they're AIDS they're the

42
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:31,759
GPS but they're not the journey so uh a few days ago I was in

43
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:39,400
this the Sleep Clinic at Stanford and one of the technicians was very attentive uh on the

44
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:45,400
subject of being grounded he said the only way you can get good sleep is you've got to be grounded you've got to

45
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,720
be grounded and so I was trying to figure out what he meant when he talked about being grounded because you know

46
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,400
people mean different things with these words and as he talked about the

47
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:04,720
importance of being grounded it occurred to me that it's not

48
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:11,360
unlike what we think of as the Stillness that arises when we're doing

49
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:19,120
mindfulness the continuity of mindfulness when we're just we're in the flow and we're we're we're centered

50
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:26,800
sometimes we say we're centered sometimes we say I've got my feet on the ground sometimes we say I'm right here

51
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,960
with my breath but it's that Gathering Together of the

52
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:42,360
forces it's the sort of centering pulling in settling in part that I really want

53
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:48,600
to talk about in concentration they're kind of two different forms one of them has to do with uh what we usually think

54
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,840
of when we do concentration which is one pointedness you know I'm going to I'm

55
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,840
going to concentrate on my breath and I'm going to be stuck on that breath and I'm going to be with that breath and all I'm going to think about as a breath and

56
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:06,120
the mind is going to go away which you know most people have a hard time with some people by the way are very very

57
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:13,360
good at that I'm not and for years I tried to do

58
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,759
that and what a waste that was what a waste that

59
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:24,479
was the one pointedness is a kind of absorptive kind

60
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:30,360
of concentration and it can be very important it's a very good place to

61
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,280
notice the the basic tenants of uh characteristics of existence a very good

62
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:42,120
place to directly experience impermanence because the mind slows so

63
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:48,639
down and we are free of all the the distractions that are normally part of our

64
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:55,520
experience and we can see things arising persisting and passing away and

65
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,120
impermanence begins to make sense it's something that we can actually see can

66
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:09,240
see something arising and we realize that impermanence is not only about things ending but also arising because

67
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,400
we see them arising persisting and passing

68
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,840
away and I can sit here all day and tell you that but the direct experience of it

69
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:27,840
is so much more profound and you'll never truly have faith in it until you have the direct

70
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,520
experience of oh oh I just watched that

71
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,599
oh oh it was here and now it's not and I

72
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:45,319
saw it come and now it's not and the thoughts come and they go and it's not like well I was thinking

73
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:51,560
about going to Hawaii and now I'm not I remember one time on Retreat I was

74
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:57,960
having a really difficult time because I couldn't seem to get concentrated and I talked to Gil and

75
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:04,759
said well you know what really restless but fortunately I believe in impermanence I know it's not going to

76
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:10,440
last and he said come and talk to me when you've got a little more fine structure on that

77
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,919
would you know he didn't want to hear something was going to change in an hour

78
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:22,360
he wanted to hear I can see it arising and passing away the instantaneous

79
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,479
arising and passing away with one pointed absorptive con concentration you

80
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:34,640
can see that so yes it's important but it's not the only kind of concentration

81
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:42,760
there's another kind of concentration and is the kind that we call moment to moment awareness and

82
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:50,040
that's more common when we sit in meditation and when we are have continu

83
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:57,880
continuity of mindfulness in our everyday life as well where we can see the breath comes the breath comes and

84
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:05,040
the breath comes and and the breath comes and the breath comes and we know it's leaving but we're watching it it

85
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,680
comes and we're continually following it and we're continually following it but

86
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:16,480
we're not absorbed in it what we see in that kind of state is

87
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,760
a little different we develop a steadiness of

88
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,880
Mind where the mind is not running off to Hawaii or running off to the argument

89
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:34,959
we had with somebody this afternoon noon or trying to understand what how to solve a particular

90
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:42,600
problem we're staying in the room there's a certain steadiness of effort

91
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,640
and the being mindfulness the being in a meditative state becomes easier it

92
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:55,639
doesn't it's not so much of a struggle and we're just there we're just

93
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,160
there not that the mind doesn't wander away but it more readily comes

94
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:08,200
back and we can pull it back and we say I'm here and then we start noticing

95
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:14,880
something about the quality of the thoughts or the quality of our feelings or the quality of the

96
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:21,640
itch and we can see things happening when the mind is steady when

97
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,720
the mind is running around all over the place it's very difficult it's very

98
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:34,200
difficult to see anything if you're constantly chasing crisis with your mind if you're still trying to solve the

99
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:41,440
problem that you left at work if you're still trying to figure out what to do about next week's party

100
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:48,399
or next week's crisis or anything else that absorbs your mind to rattling

101
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:54,880
around until you can step back and say ah the mind is

102
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,680
worrying and develop a little distance so that the mind can be steady

103
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,839
in the midst of that chaos that's a form of concentration as

104
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:12,320
well and it's a very important kind of concentration it's the kind of

105
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,000
concentration that allows us to notice I'm wanting I'm wanting or I really

106
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:26,320
don't want that I really don't want that or I I'm Restless or you know I'm

107
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,240
just sleepy we become aware of the hindrances

108
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:37,680
you do not become aware of the hindrances if you have no concentration at

109
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:44,839
all because the mind is off most people don't give themselves

110
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:51,839
credit for the settling that they have for the easing that they

111
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:58,839
have and when you begin to notice that's what's well that's what's really happening here it becomes easier to see

112
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:04,160
it and to watch and say okay now it seems very peaceful now oh it seems

113
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:11,600
jittery now it seems anxious now and you can begin to see what's happening

114
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:19,079
without having so many opinions about it and it be you become an observer of

115
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:21,399
your

116
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:30,320
experience you can see th things happening and experience what's going on

117
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,519
in your in front of you without grabbing onto it and being caught by it and

118
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:41,320
having to tear it apart because you have just a little

119
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,399
distance I'm sorry I'm having a little trouble here with this attachment I'm I

120
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:52,800
think I'm going to just let it go I'm feeling

121
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:59,040
confined by the microphone so

122
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,320
so the first thing we want to think about when we're thinking about concentration is what we're trying to do

123
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:13,639
is develop a steadiness of Mind a kind of resilience if you think

124
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:20,279
of it as flexibility where I'm here I am here I'm

125
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:26,480
right here and I'm following this I remember uh another time on Retreat when

126
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:33,079
I simply could not settle it was about a day and a half I was on Retreat sitting

127
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:40,199
walking sitting walking sitting walking and it was

128
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:45,519
torture so I decided something had to happen and that the problem was that I

129
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,720
was trying too hard to settle so I decided to give the Mind

130
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:57,399
something particular to do and I decided I wanted it to notice

131
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:04,480
when this muscle in my thigh twitched when I took a step and I went out and

132
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:12,320
did walking meditation and tried to notice when that twitch occurred as I was walking the

133
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:18,800
first twitch of that muscle in my thigh and so much attention to something

134
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:25,399
in particular took so much one-pointed

135
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:33,720
effort that it all went away it's sort of like if you put your hands together and you hold them so that the fingers

136
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:39,360
just barely touch not not where you clamp them

137
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:47,120
together but where they just barely touch it takes a great deal of effort to hold them where they just barely

138
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:53,759
touch and what it does is gather your attention there you are gathered right

139
00:14:53,759 --> 00:15:00,959
there in order to just barely touch you do do that long enough and all

140
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:07,360
of that scattered mind dissipates because you've pulled it

141
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,560
together it's that gathering in that you do and everything

142
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:19,240
slows it just slows it's not that the thinking stops the thinking doesn't stop

143
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:25,000
at all but we steady it's like we're no longer rocking

144
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,600
now we're just walking upright and it keep keeps us from getting too caught up in the thoughts

145
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:38,360
and the feelings and all of the other energy that we've brought into the

146
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:46,000
exercise as it turns out this happens yeah even when you're not

147
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,120
meditating so have you ever noticed there's some people that always seem to be sort of chill right they just seem

148
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:59,759
they're always cool and every everybody's going crazy and there's this person who seems to be

149
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,839
just totally unaffected by it you ever wonder what's going on with

150
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:12,279
them how can they be that way so I started watching some people

151
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:17,399
and you know it was very similar to what that sleep center person was trying to

152
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:22,639
tell me about being grounded they simply did not engage in

153
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,639
the frenzy it just stopped

154
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:37,759
just stopping is is a form of momentto moment awareness where you

155
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:43,120
just say wait I don't have to do

156
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:51,160
that and in the moment of stopping you give yourself a moment of

157
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,279
rest a moment of gathering a moment of pulling yourself

158
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:03,639
together so that you can say ah things are crazy right now but I'm not

159
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:11,199
crazy and then you go back to attending to craziness but it gets you out of that

160
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,678
mode of being totally tied up in it it's a settling of the

161
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:22,558
mind that's what we're looking for a settling of the

162
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:32,440
mind that's the place from which we have a position for insights

163
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:38,360
now since what we do is Insight Meditation everybody wants to have

164
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:44,799
insights when was the last Insight you had you know I had one this

165
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:51,360
afternoon where I realized look what you're doing look what you're doing you're

166
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,640
running around you don't have to do that why don't you go for a

167
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:03,559
walk you're worrying about you can't can't find this reference why don't you go for a

168
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:11,960
walk the energy of being caught takes energy away from everything

169
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:17,799
that's going on and if you can just see oh this is what's happening and realize

170
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:23,679
you don't have to get in caught by it that's an Insight just the

171
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:30,679
realization I don't have to or when you

172
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:38,280
see um I my husband was trying a new recipe

173
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:44,360
this afternoon and one of the things he needed was black bean paste and he went to three grocery stores and could not

174
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:52,480
find black bean paste and so uh he came home and found out that he could substitute miso he was very excited

175
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:59,720
about that and I thought about a time where I was with I was helping somebody

176
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,880
in a kitchen we were making guacamole for 40 people and we had it all made up

177
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:11,360
and it had way way too much garlic in it I mean way too much

178
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:18,000
garlic and so the cook said do something with it so I started adding things and

179
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,600
he's and uh I I I don't remember it was 20 years ago so I don't remember what we

180
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:29,080
did I know it involved almonds but we kept adding things to

181
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:35,799
this trying to cut down on that garlic taste and keep you know something to it

182
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:40,960
and as it got more and more voluminous of course the garlic kind of dissipated

183
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:47,200
because there was more volume there to begin with and then finally we realized that the real problem was calling it

184
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,720
guacamole as soon as we gave it another name it tasted

185
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:59,919
wonderful it was great all we had to do was stop calling it guacamole

186
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:06,000
very often when we're looking for insights it's because we're looking for something in particular we want to

187
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,520
explain this thing and it's not only that we want it we want it to be

188
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,280
blue well what if we give that up what if we give up looking for what we think

189
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,360
is true and just say what's going on

190
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:28,480
here and get back to get closer to what the intention was in this case it was to

191
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,120
have a sauce to go with with the Mexican meal that involved

192
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:40,640
avocados but it did not have to be guacamole and it certainly didn't have

193
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:47,039
to be named that and everybody raved about that

194
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:55,000
sauce and they wanted the recipe and we just smiled like the Buddhas we were we had

195
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,159
no idea what was in it anymore

196
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,240
and we were free of it having to be a certain way free of it having to be a

197
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:14,320
certain way so much of our suffering is about having it to be a certain

198
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,640
way if you loved me you would bring me

199
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:30,400
flowers fill in the blanks we set up tests for

200
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,320
ourselves we set up tests for those around us we set up tests for how what

201
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,679
proves that we're doing the things right so part of what we need to do in this

202
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:47,159
practice is notice when we're setting up a false

203
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:52,440
test notice oh I'm unhappy here because

204
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:58,480
I want something to happen but what do I really want to have happen

205
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:06,000
it isn't that you do this thing it's that I want you to love me oh well maybe

206
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,720
I should change what I'm looking for I can see that only if my mind isn't

207
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:18,919
build busy Building stories around what I expect I can see that because my mind

208
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:26,120
has slowed down enough that I can see what's happening I gathered it together enough

209
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:31,600
that I can see oh this is what's happening this is the value of

210
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:37,520
concentration and the importance of concentration in the form of

211
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:44,799
Stillness steadiness of mind to develop the steadiness of

212
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:51,320
mind this is how we learn to be nonreactive by coming to a place of

213
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:59,080
saying ah I can take a breath here

214
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:05,840
it doesn't have to look this way it doesn't have to be this

215
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:12,760
way we can we can come to a Still Point you know if when the pendulum

216
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:21,240
swings it goes back and forth back and forth and a certain place it changes

217
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:29,720
Direction but it doesn't really stop it just there's kind of a null point the

218
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:35,240
same thing is true in your breath when you're breathing in and breathing out at a certain point nothing's

219
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:43,120
happening catch that point where nothing's happening familiarize yourself with

220
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:50,559
nothing's happening because we're very often in a race for something to be

221
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:59,120
happening concentration is going to look like this so if it doesn't look like this I'm not concentrated

222
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,880
the mind is still working so I must be the Mind must be too busy so there's something wrong with my thinking there's

223
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,200
something wrong with my meditating there's something wrong with instead of looking there's something wrong with if

224
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:20,120
we can just say ah this is what's happening doubt is

225
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:25,640
here but I'm not doubtful doubt is

226
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:31,200
here I can come to a zero point point where I don't have to call it good or

227
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:38,080
bad me or not me I can just be here in this null's

228
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:46,720
place so tan is a a famous fasan teacher and he said the work of awareness is

229
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:54,679
just to know the work of wisdom is to differentiate between skillful and

230
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:59,799
unskillful it's when we see when things are happening and how we're contributing

231
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:05,120
to what is making them skillful or unskillful that we can discern the

232
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:10,480
difference this is what we call wisdom it's not that we suddenly know something

233
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:17,120
that we didn't know before what we know is ah it's what I'm naming this that is

234
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:24,279
at fault here it is trying to see things a certain way instead of how they are

235
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:31,360
that is at fault here the skillful thing is to see see this is what's really

236
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:38,520
happening where we learn to discern between skillful and unskillful

237
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:44,279
skillful this is what's happening with each Insight we see where

238
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:50,640
we get caught and when we're free of that being

239
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:59,080
caught when am I tied up with something and when am I free of that being tied up

240
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,000
we see wanting it to this be this way is what's making me

241
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,880
unhappy you know it used to be at every holiday I would make four or five

242
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:19,200
different Entre because everybody in my family was on a different diet and I would drive myself crazy

243
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:26,399
trying to make everything perfect for everyone and I was miserable and I

244
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:31,640
couldn't figure out why I was trying so hard why I was so miserable and it's

245
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:37,720
because I wasn't actually getting to spend any time with my family how did I know whether they were

246
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:43,320
happy or not happy I was totally blowing it because I

247
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:51,320
was saying if I do this then they'll be happy and I'll be happy but doing this was exactly

248
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:58,399
wrong making five different Entre was crazy it was only when I told everybody

249
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:03,799
bring your own entree that I started at having a good

250
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,960
time so simple so

251
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:17,080
simple and the first time someone told me you know you're being unhappy is your

252
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:25,360
own fault I just about threw her out of the room but it was true it was my own fault

253
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:32,159
it was not what I wanted it's had to look like what I

254
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:40,000
wanted that's what was causing the the suffering being able to still the Mind

255
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,639
draw it together is what allows us to see

256
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:51,840
clearly the pause oh that's

257
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:57,840
happening no blame just oh that's what's happening because then we know what to

258
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:04,240
do then we know what's skillful or if we don't know we can try

259
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:10,720
the next thing and we'll say well that worked or that didn't work I can try something

260
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:18,440
else but we're not repeatedly trying to do the same thing we can discern the

261
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,279
difference we stop trying to make the guacamole better and we read

262
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:34,159
name it and we realize what we really want is the sauce that just happens to

263
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,640
use avocados and a little

264
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:45,080
garlic so I'm going to read you a poem this is called this Shining Moment In

265
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:50,919
the now it's by David budbill this is the wrong time of year

266
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:56,919
for this poem but I like the ending so I'm going to read it anyway when I work Outdoors all day

267
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:03,760
every day as I do now in the fall getting ready for winter tearing up the garden digging potatoes Gathering the

268
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:10,360
squash cutting firewood making kindling repairing bridges over the brook clearing trails in the woods doing the

269
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:17,440
last of the Fall mowing pruning apple trees taking down the screens putting up the storm windows banking the house all

270
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,679
these things as preparations for the coming cold when I'm every day all day

271
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:28,320
all body and no mind when I'm all physically wholly and completely in this

272
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,360
world with the birds the deer the sky the wind the trees when day after day I

273
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:40,399
think of nothing but what the next chore is when I go from clearing Woods roads to sharpening a chainsaw to changing the

274
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:47,240
oil in a mower to stacking wood when I'm all body and no mind when I am only here

275
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:53,559
and now and nowhere else then and only then do I see the crippling power of

276
00:29:53,559 --> 00:30:01,240
mind the curse of thought and I pause and wonder why I so seldom find this

277
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:09,399
Shining Moment In the now when I am only here and now and

278
00:30:09,399 --> 00:30:16,279
nowhere else then and only then do I see the crippling power of mind the curse of

279
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:23,760
thought and I pause and wonder why am I so seldom why I so seldom find this

280
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,440
Shining Moment In the now

281
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:39,240
in the midst of all the work all the activities all

282
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:46,039
of the cares that you normally do can truly be found The Shining Moment

283
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:53,559
In the now you simply have to notice

284
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:02,039
it The Shining Moment In the now this is what I wish for you thank

285
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:10,000
you so we have time for questions

286
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
comments

287
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:26,559
objections yes

288
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:44,760
um I'm really relating to what you were talking about

289
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:50,000
how um how uncon

290
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:59,080
concentrated we can get and the mindfulness goes away sometimes

291
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:06,799
um and uh just last week I had an incident that I couldn't I was very

292
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:16,240
upset from something that someone said which wasn't true and and um

293
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:25,880
I I was upset I didn't want to react but by doing that it was uh kind

294
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:32,519
of was bothering me and I was trying to look at it to

295
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:41,399
meditate and observe it and embrace it and you know go through the process to

296
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:48,880
to be able to let it go and get a good sleep I lost the sleep over

297
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:57,120
it um that's one thing that I keep asking that there are moments and I

298
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:03,679
actually like last last Monday you you explained it to me that

299
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:09,720
um I I just at at some moments you you

300
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:16,000
you lose the concentration you lose the awareness of what's going on so when

301
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,840
that happens and it happens what I

302
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:29,639
notice so so when Ang arises in

303
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:36,480
me because I've watched it a lot I used to have a lot of trouble with anger I

304
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,720
can feel it in my belly before it comes to my head that I'm angry so I have an

305
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:49,279
early clue and I realize uhoh I need to pay attention to what's happening here

306
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:54,799
because I'm aware of that I'm getting angry the thing about

307
00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:00,679
anger or hurt any kind of reactivity is there are chemical things that happen

308
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:06,760
in your body right so when you're angry you have adrenaline and it's shooting

309
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:13,398
through your body and no matter what you're doing in your mind you've got to deal with the adrenaline in the body so

310
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:18,760
know that know okay there's energy here there's a

311
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:25,200
lot of energy here and when you stop for just a

312
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:32,240
moment I have just a moment to remember remember that I have an intention toward

313
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:40,200
kindness okay so is it more important to be right or kind we're in the quality of discernment

314
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:46,240
here but the energy is up I need to do something with that

315
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:51,440
energy because I I can't consider because I've stopped and I'm an

316
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:58,760
intention to be kind I haven't burst out okay but the person can see it in my

317
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:05,800
face I'm sure Telegraph everything my arms are waving I've learned about my arms waving

318
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,720
when I'm angry so I will go and wash my hands I will do something physical with

319
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:18,520
my hands that is not directed toward the other person I pay attention to the fact that there's adrenaline in my body that

320
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:25,240
I have to deal with it's a matter of where do you place

321
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:30,280
your awareness are you going to leave your awareness are you going to fight the

322
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:35,720
guacamole or you just going to Fig okay I got to deal with the fact that this is this is

323
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:41,720
happening when you stay with something like well I'm hurt by this person you

324
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:47,320
don't step out of the story when you move into the body of oh this body is

325
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:52,920
aching now you have something you can work with and you're not tied up in the

326
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:58,599
story when you're in the story explaining it justifying it

327
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:06,000
understanding it it just repeats it and restarts the emotional cycle over and over and over again somehow you have to

328
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,480
step out of the story one of my favorite stories was

329
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:17,359
when um uh I have just begun a diet and it

330
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:24,560
was a very very strict diet and I had to eat every four or five hours because I

331
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:30,040
got hypoglycemic and uh my husband was going to fix dinner and he had this elaborate

332
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:35,640
plan for dinner and I said you know I'm really I'm hungry and he kept saying it and I said I'm hungry and pretty soon I

333
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:41,119
was yelling at him and I left the room and I came back seconds later I was

334
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:47,920
yelling again I left the room I left the room three times the third time I came back he handed me a carrot which was

335
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:54,119
just the right thing I couldn't do anything about the fact I was hypoglycemic leaving the room wasn't

336
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:59,640
good enough but we somehow managed to communicate I'm hungry forget anything

337
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:07,640
fancy this woman needs to put food in her body because she's falling apart it was nobody's fault you step

338
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:15,760
away from it's somebody's fault and you deal with this is what's happening I hope that helps yeah helps a

339
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:21,119
lot because um I definitely when I um I

340
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:27,960
get you know excited or I get angry I feel it right here and what what you're

341
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:33,520
saying is that pay attention to that pay attention to that that's really do

342
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:39,520
something about that yes yes locate it go for a walk yeah tell somebody you

343
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:48,319

344
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:55,800
it thank you so anybody else

345
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:01,520
yeah you um so I'm like pretty new to like

346
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:10,000
meditation um and I feel like when I am uh meditating I struggle to find

347
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:17,119
direction and I think that uh can lead to a lack of concentration so what are

348
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:24,119
some like basic like productive things to focus on would you say um in meditation well the first thing is focus

349
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:29,480
on your breath right I mean I what kind of medic do do that kind of meditation

350
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:35,560
yeah that's what I've started with um and uh I just uh don't know if there are

351
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:41,319
other like things prodive so one thing that do you are you familiar with

352
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:47,560
meta okay so there's a form of meditation called meta in which one has

353
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:54,520
a series of phrases that are wishing oneself well others well and

354
00:38:54,520 --> 00:39:02,079
there's a series that you can step through but you you begin with yourself and so uh I might

355
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:07,920
say uh silently to myself may I be filled with loving

356
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:15,079
kindness may I be well may I be peaceful and at ease may I be happy so those are

357
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:23,480
phrases that are very familiar to me and I would mentally repeat those to myself over and over and over and over it forms

358
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:30,720
a kind of Mantra gives the Mind something to do it is in fact a con concentration practice and so when I'm

359
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:37,839
really having a difficult time I'll spend maybe the first five or 10 minutes of my sit doing that and that will tend

360
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:44,640
to to slow me down and settle and it's rhythmic the way that I've arranged my

361
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,920
phrases so it kind of lulls me into to that settling and then I go back to to

362
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:57,520
my breath and I follow my breath and I set that aside So Meta practice has a particular

363
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:03,720
purpose for softening the heart which often is the problem when we

364
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:10,520
can't concentrate we we have things on our mind we have irritations that are

365
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:15,920
bothering us and there's a kind of rigidity in place and we have to be able

366
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:23,960
to relax a little bit in order to get that concentration and sometimes that relaxation involves softening our

367
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:30,720
attitude of mind which also is a benefit of meta practice it's the primary reason

368
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:36,760
I do meta practice is to soften my heart so that's one suggestion I have

369
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,960
it's sort of oh okay and then then it's

370
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:47,480
okay I'm here and this is what I'm doing now and I'm doing this because I wish

371
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:56,119
myself well and that that's often a big big help thank you so much

372
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:05,599
anyone else okay it's been a pleasure being with you

373
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:10,800
I wish you all well good night
