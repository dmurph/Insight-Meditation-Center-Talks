1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,279
so I wanted to start with this uh story a little bit about uh comes from the

2
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:13,679
Buddha's life that the tradition holds that shortly after his Awakening

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,320
the Buddha said wow I want to you know share this well his initial spot is like

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:26,240
I don't think I want to talk about this nobody's going to get this but then he was convinced like okay if I'm going to

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,400
teach somebody I want to teach some of my former teachers but his former

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:39,480
teachers were no longer alive so he said well I'm going to go teach some of people that I practiced with earlier so

7
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:46,120
he finds them and teaches them what uh what he

8
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:52,600
had awakened to and one out of the five becomes awakened his name is

9
00:00:52,600 --> 00:01:00,480
kondan and after hearing these uh from the Buddha K has an

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,600
experience and then he says wow what wow I'm adding the wow

11
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:16,320
part it's a little uh lip there but uh K says whatever is subject to arising is

12
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,560
subject to Sensation that is like whatever comes to be will at some point

13
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:29,079
no longer to be whatever has the nature to be born has the nature to die of

14
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:35,680
course of course often we don't think about it this way but this was Kon after

15
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,759
he was awaken something that uh he said this was like his big Insight that

16
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:46,000
allowed him to become awakened so that's the first person that

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,320
becomes awakened that the Buddha teaches we don't hear very much the details of the other four because these uh were

18
00:01:53,320 --> 00:02:00,039
these five uh people practiced together and they practiced with the Buddha and then the Buddha went his own way and these

19
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:07,679
five stay together so we hear about the first one he says whatever has the nature to arise has the nature to pass

20
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:15,599
away we don't know what happens to there before they become awakened but we don't know any details number six somebody who

21
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,840
is the opposite of these um Aesthetics

22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,400
these people that the Buddha was uh practicing with a very wealthy

23
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:36,000
person this person has lots of pal is and has their life you know this opulent

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,480
lifestyle and uh for one night or maybe it's like early

25
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:47,480
morning he just feels like you know this isn't all it's cracked up to

26
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:54,720
be and he decides to go out for a walk his name is yasa and yasa happens

27
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,680
to see the Buddha the Buddha sees yasa and the and uh

28
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:08,200
and Y alsoa goes up to the Buddha and kind of the Buddha invites him to like sit down and Y saying you

29
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,680
know this Diana's interpretation it's not all like it's cracked up to be to

30
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,400
have all this wealth and this opulent lifestyle so the Buddha says well I'll

31
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:28,200
show you some real peace gives him some teachings y also has a breakthrough and

32
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,640
says whatever is subject to arising is subject to

33
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:39,040
sensation whatever has the nature to be born is the nature to die things arise

34
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:45,239
and pass away they begin and they cease so that's number

35
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,720
six number seven is y's father who comes out to find what happened to yasa he

36
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,879
wakes up in the morning yasa isn't there and his father comes out to see him the Buddha gives his father a

37
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,480
teaching and we don't know the details exactly oh yeah yes we do know a little bit of the details about that one but he

38
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:09,640
doesn't say what is rising what is whatever has the nature to rise has the nature to pass away it's number seven is

39
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:15,840
y's father number eight and number nine are two women you know often we don't

40
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,160
hear about this in the story of the Buddha but the eighth and nth person to become awakened eighth and nth student

41
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,080
of the Buddha are two women who also become awakened and they also say

42
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:35,800
whatever has the nature to arve has the nature to pass away so there's something about seeing

43
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:44,320
that things have their the nature to arise and pass away that is associated with some really deep insight into some

44
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:51,120
really deep uh shift or change in the way that somebody thinks or considers

45
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:59,759
the world or moves in the world and that's a little bit what I'd like to talk about tonight is this Rec

46
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,360
recognition that things come and go I can't help but do this with my hand

47
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,240
because it's kind of like this like they show up and then they are not showing up

48
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:18,080
anymore they arise and they pass away maybe I'll say that uh some of you

49
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,120
might know be familiar with the satian this is the kind of like the text the

50
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:31,639
premiere text that talks about mindfulness practice talks about these uh the these foundations for mindfulness

51
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:37,039
and it has a number of different practices in there to help establish uh

52
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,600
mindfulness 13 different practices one of them is often what we teach is you

53
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:49,639
should be aware of the sensations of breathing but in this uh foundational

54
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:57,440
text after each uh instruction about mindfulness is then the instruction

55
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:06,240
to abide cont cont lating the nature of arising the nature of passing away and

56
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:13,919
that the N that the phenomena have the nature to both arise and pass away so one of our key texts and

57
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:20,720
practices is pointing to this Insight seeing things arise and pass

58
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:27,639
away so what does this mean well maybe one thing that I'll say

59
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:33,000
is that um these instructions or this pointing

60
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,319
doesn't require that we actually see the moment the precise moment something

61
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:45,280
arises or the precise moment that something passes away ends we don't have

62
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:51,840
to see every single beginning and we don't have to like see and be present for every single

63
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,919
ending but it's just this deep recognition like oh yeah everything's

64
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:06,440
beginning and ending wherever I look there's a sense of beginning or or

65
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:14,000
ending and we might say well mountains of course are a they're not

66
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:21,599
ending but right every time a animal walks on the mountain and dislodges just

67
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,879
a tiny bit of soil the soil is only going in One Direction right it's always only going

68
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:33,560
down the wind does something with the soil it's only going One Direction

69
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:39,199
too it'll be a really long time but mountains also are changing right that's

70
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,479
why we have a Grand Canyon and you know all these types of things so even lot of

71
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:54,039
the things that we think are stable are actually changing also so I talked about this uh seeing

72
00:07:54,039 --> 00:08:00,360
this arising and passing away is associated with uh Awakening but I want to share some

73
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,520
other benefits of noticing the changing nature of

74
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:12,639
everything really things I keep on using this expression arise and pass away how

75
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,520
there's coming and going there's this way this recognition

76
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:26,319
that things will not always be the same can bring actually some depth and

77
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:33,039
meaning to our lives but we tend to take for granted things that we like oh yeah okay it's going to be there

78
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:40,320
tomorrow but there's this way of like just recognizing like yeah I don't actually know that things are going to

79
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,839
be the same way tomorrow this is a valid assumption for many things

80
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:53,839
but you know we don't exactly know what the future is going to hold we live in earthquake

81
00:08:53,839 --> 00:09:01,560
country maybe there'll be an earthquake we don't know all kinds of things can happen we

82
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:07,240
don't know it's just awful right maybe you guys have this feeling too like to see

83
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,480
accidents on the freeway like oh right these people whoever was in the accident

84
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:21,560
they weren't planning that this came out as surprise and know KN on wood right it's uh not us

85
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:27,320
going home tonight but there's no guarantees so there's this way this

86
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,519
recognizing that things can change They do change maybe it helps us appreciate

87
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:39,480
the moments that we have and there's a book written by Steven

88
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:45,519
Levine I don't know how to pronounce his last name I can't remember if it's LaVine or LaVine but

89
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:51,440
nevertheless um a year to live how to live this year as if it were

90
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:57,959
your last and there's been courses on this book that are taught at spit Rock and elsewhere I haven't read the book I

91
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:07,000
haven't taken the course but I know people have had and they've uh have shared with me how just this idea like

92
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,120
okay what would you do if you knew you only had one year to live well your priorities might shift

93
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,480
fact chances are your priorities will shift and they something that I really appreciate is they talk about like

94
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,800
having more courage like okay I'm going to do those things that I want to do even though I'm

95
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,800
afraid to do them often we don't do things because we think oh I'll do it

96
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:40,519
later when it's easier when I have more courage but if you realize no I just may

97
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:47,680
not even have these opportunities this recognition that things change maybe maybe that supports

98
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,880
having a sense of Courage even though there are fear and uncomfortable things

99
00:10:52,880 --> 00:11:00,959
and and also people have reported this with they realize they have one year to live that they take the time to repair

100
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:06,639
some relationships that might need some repairing making amends or doing

101
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,920
whatever needs to be done in that kind of Realm like taking care of those things

102
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:19,720
so that uh you can leave without the people I don't know

103
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:26,440
having unfinished business it's terrible right if you have unfinished unfinished business with

104
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,839
somebody and they die then you don't really have a chance to

105
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:38,959
finish it in maybe the conventional way you still have opportunity with your mind to get to a different place with it

106
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:45,320
but it's not the same exactly so this one benefit of

107
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:53,880
impermanence is this recognizing we don't have forever and maybe we'll start to get our

108
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:59,560
what is that expression that the doctors say you better get your Affairs in order

109
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:06,519
right maybe we'll get our Affairs in order not wait until we have some terrible

110
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:12,760
diagnosis but another advantage or a benefit of impermanence maybe is so

111
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:18,760
obvious that it goes uh without saying is that if things couldn't change then

112
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:24,279
there would be no growth there would be no maturation

113
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:30,440
there'd be no learning there'd be no like this sense of movement towards

114
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:37,560
greater and greater freedom I mean that's implicit in this whole idea that we can mature and change

115
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,440
so impermanence means that we'll be it's possible to let go of those things that

116
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,800
are not so helpful for us and to develop different ways of

117
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:55,639
being in the world different habits different patterns more loving kindness more

118
00:12:55,639 --> 00:13:02,040
care more presence more mindfulness careful with our speech our actions all

119
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:08,720
these things so that's a second benefit of mindfulness a third one is also

120
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:15,000
something that often we don't think about too much but if things weren't

121
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,720
changing it would be just awful it'd be like sto to find

122
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:29,160
boring I'm reminded of maybe you guys uh remember this movie uh Groundhog Day I

123
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,639
just love this movie I've watched it many many times and this character right who has

124
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:42,839
this experience happens to be Crown hog day but he has the exact same day over and over and over again and uh early in

125
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:48,839
the um movie after it's he realizes it's always going to be the same are all the

126
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:55,680
different ways he tries to kill himself dropping a toaster in the um bathtub or

127
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,680
driving off a cliff with the groundhog at the steering wheel you know all these things just this

128
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:08,360
recognition like oh there's like no sense of going forward if it's always going to be the

129
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:14,240
same so there's these ways in which you know impermanence or changing nature

130
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,600
really add some can add some depth and meaning to our

131
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:27,639
life but I also want to kind of like Circle back around to how I started this with these stories of these individuals

132
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:34,360
who are getting awakened and there's this some wisdom that comes with this

133
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:41,360
letting go and maybe I'll start with this that um or I'm sorry this wisdom that comes

134
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,880
with seeing impermanence because if we sit with our experience like if we're really present

135
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:55,320
for our experience we'll see that it's changing it's always changing there's either

136
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:03,920
flickering or it's um getting louder then softer or it's moving location or

137
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,759
you know intensity it's always changing a little

138
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:18,680
bit but what isn't changing are Notions we have in the head

139
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:25,680
abstract ideas Concepts those those like you know we

140
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,920
just uh have some steadiness but our actual experience what's actually

141
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:38,519
happening is always changing and to make this distinction

142
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:44,440
between an experience and a concept that is a label

143
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:52,440
that we assign to the experience are two different things the map is not the

144
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:58,920
territory the menu reading the menu is not the same as eating the food completely different but they're both

145
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:04,120
pointing to cheeseburger with fries for

146
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:10,800
example so part of impermanence is or noticing or practicing with impermanence

147
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:19,279
is to notice this is to notice that it's not um that the con the

148
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:26,519
concepts are staying the same and when we are relating to the concepts it feels like everything's the same oh yeah here

149
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:32,880
I am I'm bored again doing this meditation and I'm just

150
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,120
bored and if you just think okay I'm bored it's like every other time or I'm

151
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,839
Restless just like I have been every other time or I'm having a hard time staying awake just like every other time

152
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,399
if you have a relationship with those words and it feels like every other

153
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:54,480
time but if you sink into the

154
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:00,680
experience oh yeah there's a sense of like I just want to get up and run away

155
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:07,400
or I want to get up and write that note on my phone or I need to send that email I forgot or add that thing to my

156
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,918
shopping list or whatever it is or maybe sometimes a sense of boredom comes with

157
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:18,280
oh my gosh this reminds me of high school English it was so boring and I

158
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:25,360
don't know we all have different associations so the experience is always

159
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,399
different even though we might be using the same word

160
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:40,880
and there's this way that um recognizing that the not

161
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:47,880
the how we use the concepts to describe

162
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:55,080
experiences but also if we really are with the experiences we can also notice they have

163
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,120
the quality of changing

164
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:06,799
being impermanent beginning ending changing in intensity or something but

165
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:13,919
if we are with our experience there's a way in which we can also start to like get underneath maybe the experience

166
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:19,559
instead of it being something the sadness this experience of the

167
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:25,840
excitement in the chest maybe of excitement or maybe some concern the

168
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:32,120
shoulders going up and feeling some tightness we can get underneath and notice the

169
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:37,440
qualities of these experiences so there's three maybe

170
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:45,039
elements there's the concept about the experience there's the experience itself which is mostly bodily experiences and

171
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:51,799
then there's the qualities of experiences and these qualities are that they're

172
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:59,039
changing and so as we start to see this deepening

173
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:04,320
this starting to see the qualities rather than just the experiences

174
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:12,320
themselves is a type of deepening maybe like Concepts experience

175
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:18,000
qualities and it's this recognition of the qualities that can have a real

176
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,559
transformative power but how can we do this how can we make this transition

177
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:31,679
from Concepts to experiences to the qualities and part of that is to have a

178
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:39,840
sense of stability with our practice this sense of gathered this sense of

179
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:47,720
collectedness and how that might work is we start where we are of course we do it's not possible to

180
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,760
start anywhere else but just to acknowledge you know what I feel really

181
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,960
agitated and I feel like anything except stable and collected and gathered that

182
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:05,000
might just be what the experience is or maybe it's just a subtle amount of

183
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:12,480
agitation but there are many ways in which we can be like fragmented or jumping around or have a little bit of

184
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,840
restlessness and there's layers and layers and layers of this as we'll discover as the mind gets more and more

185
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,960
quiet we'll discover there's more and more subtle layers of this agitation

186
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:32,240
but we shouldn't underestimate like how power powerful it is just to name it

187
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:39,559
this is a concept but it's a way in which we are no longer turning away like

188
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:44,919
agitation is here and it feels like

189
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:53,679
this so is there a way that we can not be agitated about the

190
00:20:53,799 --> 00:21:00,880
agitation not to be restless with the restlessness not have aversion to the

191
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:07,000
aversion but in some way just to turn towards it acknowledge this is the

192
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,159
experience right now it's Restless I feel Restless there's restlessness right

193
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:20,960
now I'm using these words restless and agitation just to cover a whole range of everything that isn't just this sense of

194
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,919
collectedness or gathered and this part of like learning

195
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:33,039
how to recognize what's happening in a way that allows what's

196
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:40,200
happening to be happening very powerful not easy something that

197
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:46,600
definitely a practice but is there a way to just be with okay it's like this

198
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:53,240
right now and maybe the mind can only like it's like this and then off it goes you know into something else and then it

199
00:21:53,240 --> 00:22:00,080
comes around like oh yeah okay I'm agitated oh then off it goes and then it comes back around but is there a way to

200
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:06,400
not be agitated about agitated but instead maybe you could ask

201
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,480
yourself how can I be with this agitation in a way that's not in

202
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,840
conflict with it without pushing it away without

203
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:24,840
demanding that it be different without wishing that it were different

204
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:32,080
but instead to kind of like honor and respect our experience and there's something about the allowing

205
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,240
not being in conflict with respecting and honoring our

206
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:44,480
experience that allows some disentanglement from what's

207
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,919
Happening so there might still be restlessness there might still be

208
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:55,840
agitation might still be sloth and torp or longing or aversion doubt whatever it

209
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:04,559
might be and it might still be there but the problem of it drains

210
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:10,720
out there's still the same experience but it's not something that we're trying

211
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:16,640
to make different instead it's like oh yeah this is what restlessness feels

212
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,080
like it's uncomfortable it's not my

213
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:30,200
preference and it's like this wow is

214
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:35,480
powerful right because then we can bring that into so many areas of Our Lives we

215
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:43,039
can show up for our life and show up for other people in so many different ways so to ask this question well how

216
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:48,880
can I be aware of this agitation in a way that's not in conflict with it in

217
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:56,080
the sense that we don't have to get rid of anything we don't have to make it different but instead just to show up

218
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:03,120
for what's happening because if we are going down this path

219
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:09,600
of mindfulness and this collectedness we will all

220
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,679
discover sooner or later as we're searching for security

221
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:22,400
and safety in a place where we can finally get everything perfect so we can rest and relax of course we are we're

222
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:29,799
looking for this this place where we can just abide happy

223
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:39,240
this is to be found in this in an attitude an attitude of trust an

224
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:44,880
attitude of allowing there isn't some perfect place

225
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,480
where we're going to land and it's going to be perfect

226
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:58,200
forever it's instead of this recognition of the feeling of not feeling safety or

227
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:06,039
uh security or settledness is so much related to our trying to shove things to

228
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:12,039
be different manipulate engineer manufacturer push them to be a little bit

229
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:19,960
different maybe I'll say that again that so much of

230
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:26,159
our feeling r or feeling like we want a sense of security or a place to

231
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:33,200
land is because is things we often are not Landing we're trying to make them be

232
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:39,320
different we're trying to somehow not be with what's happening

233
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:44,520
so the real security and happiness is comes with this sense of allowing with

234
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:52,120
allowing things to be as they are even if it's not what we want and to be sure I am not talking

235
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:59,480
about just passivity for the rest of our life I'm not talking about becoming dormant I'm talking about when we when

236
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:06,000
it just the trying to make things be different gets put down then something

237
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,039
else can arise and some of this something else is this great

238
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:18,039
wisdom that leads to Awakening and as part of Awakening is that when we see

239
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:23,320
that things oh yeah things are arising and passing and I can't make them be

240
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:28,760
exactly how I want there's this deep letting go that

241
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:35,520
just naturally happens we don't make this Letting Go

242
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:43,240
happen there's just this recognition that it's meaningless to hold on cling

243
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,960
to changing phenomena and trying to change things is

244
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:55,159
one form of clinging even though it doesn't feel like it it's the way that we're getting

245
00:26:55,159 --> 00:27:01,799
tangled up with it but it's meaningless to try to control and quarrel with a

246
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:09,480
changing phenomena and there's something deep within us that realize oh yeah things

247
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:15,279
are changing I don't have to hold on I don't have to try to control

248
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:24,480
it and then there's just this letting go and this letting go is

249
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:30,000
transformative and it's part of the characteris of the first stages of Awakening is

250
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:38,039
about this letting go and it can all start just with this Insight that things

251
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:46,080
change and there's can be this way that maybe as the mindfulness or the

252
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:53,320
concentration or practice uh deepens or matures or whatever word we want to use

253
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:58,760
there may be a time in which we just noticing the beginnings of things the most

254
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:05,360
common cuz things that are new like catch our attention but then maybe with practice

255
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:11,360
we'll start to see oh yeah things are ending too maybe we don't see the exact ending

256
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:18,320
but we start to notice absences as well as presences oh yeah that pain in the knee

257
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,960
it's not the same as it was in fact actually like had forgotten about

258
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:31,080
it or there's this um way in which we might just notice that

259
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:36,840
things are flickering like really fast and so they don't have this sense

260
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:44,039
of solidity that we thought that they did often we can't see this until the mind is really quiet often this is not

261
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:49,760
until we're on a retreat setting but we start to see that yeah

262
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:56,399
things aren't like as solid as uh as they uh often

263
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:03,039
appear so this idea that things have the nature

264
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:08,919
to arise and pass away this is not meant to just necessarily just be a teaching

265
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:16,240
and something you have to adopt and believe and we can bring in science to support it but there's a way in which

266
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:24,080
that's just a uh deep recognition that happens oh yeah everything's changing

267
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,240
and there's just this natural letting that happens and with

268
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:35,360
that deep kind of letting go happens is a really deep Freedom as

269
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:42,799
well this there's no longer a sense of desperately trying to control

270
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:47,919
everything often that's where we lose Freedom right just when we're trying to control or we're feeling like we're

271
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:56,480
getting pushed around but but maybe all end there this idea of impermanence and

272
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:03,919
how it's related to to many benefits of course but importantly it's related to

273
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:10,760
some deep insights that lead to Greater freedom and maybe with that I'll open it

274
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:15,320
up and see if there's some questions or

275
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,240
comments I he'll bring you a microphone so

276
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:43,080
hi I'm glad I came today because exactly where I am nice trying

277
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:48,360
to to let go and

278
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:57,000
just it's uh changing try to change it so hard it's like I don't accept What's

279
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:05,039
happen happening or what's not happening it's I'm so happy that I you

280
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:12,240
you said it all is it's I'm going to think about it I'm going to practice it

281
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:18,399
and I meditate all the time so maybe with the Mind

282
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:24,760
mindfulness I could stop

283
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:32,960
this keep changing keep as you said I it's like what I have is enough it's

284
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:40,440
more than enough but still I I'm looking for something else to be complete to be

285
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:46,919
more secure and when I look at it I say I am secure I am

286
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:52,000
okay but still deep down or in my mind I

287
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,919
want to change it this is not good enough so

288
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:08,760
I'm glad I hear you I think makes sense it really makes sense in in the realm of

289
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:17,799
mindfulness yeah yeah in the realm of um what Buddha did or and nothing permanent

290
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:25,080
and I love it that it's just arise and passes that's so true M thank you so

291
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:31,360
much you're welcome you're welcome and there's a way that we can practice with this just in our everyday life just

292
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:36,440
noticing you know the beginnings of things just say okay I'm just going to notice the beginnings of things or I'm

293
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:42,679
going to notice the endings of things just you know going around our everyday life and just setting that intention

294
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:48,240
usually at the beginning we won't remember but then if we just keep on setting that intention eventually we'll

295
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,279
remember when know it's like oh yeah this is ending and then there's a way in

296
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:58,440
which there can be a little more freedom we can just discover yeah it's that everything things changing and it

297
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:04,639
becomes a little bit easier exactly exactly thank Youk and did you did you

298
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:11,519
raise your hand back there so can you bring that give the microphone to her and then we'll move it over here thank

299
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:17,880
you thank you so much it's a wonderful topic and it seems very simple

300
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:23,399
impermanence but um I think the hardest thing

301
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:29,240
is when I'm trying to let go my attack attachment to what is especially if

302
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:35,279
things are longstanding if things have been certain way a long for a long

303
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:43,000
time it's really hard to let go it's really hard to accept that something has

304
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,519
changed and that clinging and that fighting to fix the fighting to go back

305
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:54,080
to things were despite knowing

306
00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:02,120
that this two shall pass and Things Are permanent and I know all of those things but it's just really hard to put it into

307
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:08,679
practice so yeah maybe one thing I would say is like we like all of us understand

308
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:14,000
this thing about impermanence so it's not so much an intellectual

309
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:21,480
understanding as it's a way in which we just deeply know it and part of the way that we deeply know it is just to see it

310
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:28,679
again and again and again and again so there's something that's can be really powerful just in your everyday

311
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:34,280
experience uh I I'll just make this up like just

312
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:39,960
noticing how the sensations within your hands are changing throughout the day

313
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:45,240
sometimes you are feeling things that are cool and uh hard sometimes you're

314
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:51,679
feeling something that are neutral or they don't not too heavy sometimes you feel something that's heavier I don't

315
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:59,680
know just choose something and you just notice like oh yeah this is changing so so to get into the physical

316
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:05,160
experiences and to change them is what's uh often needed because we can think

317
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:11,880
about these things and that's often not enough there's a way in which to to know

318
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:18,599
it in a different way in an additional way does that make sense I'll try thank you I think in even in the fear

319
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:25,800
conference somebody talked about body scans and how they had underestimated body scans and then they realize they're

320
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:32,680
actually so I I appreciate that yeah thank you yeah body scans is a good thing too yeah

321
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:38,720
yeah and then do I do anything to it I'm just

322
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,960
speaking to it oh okay well this is probably going to sound kind of mundane but mundane is

323
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:50,680
good mundane is good uh I I'm terribly resistant to

324
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:55,800
change it's absolutely incredible I get an A+ in being resistant to

325
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:02,280
change but today was really strange I I decided I wanted to go to East West books you probably know East West books

326
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:08,440
in Mountain View on Castro and uh first first of all oh my God where am I supposed to park they closed off the

327
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:15,200
street I'm in a state of panic right because I couldn't remember which the cross street was uh but finally I was

328
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,880
sent in the right direction and just out of the blue this really nice man was was

329
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,960
walking down to Books Inc and we started chatting for a few minutes it was brief but it was very pleasant very nice you

330
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,119
know we were talking about how there used book sink used to be upstairs and there was a coffee house upstairs and

331
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:38,839
that was so cool because I love that place and then uh what was the order I went into East West and there were two

332
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:45,319
women who were extremely helpful I said I need something I need uh something for anxiety what do you have well they the

333
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:51,480
whole book whole book stor has changed completely those little books with affirmations used to be at the front

334
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:56,760
last time I went there which was probably years ago as but she was leading me all around the store and just

335
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:03,079
just incredibly helpful I I was amazed and then after I left

336
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:10,720
uh uh I went into went into um what is that place called a little oh geez Paris

337
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:17,440
Paris Baguette or whatever it's called um and behold a French woman I mean I didn't even know she was French I said

338
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:24,440
was that France Fran was that Fran she how did you know I don't know I'm just

339
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:29,720
it might have been the way she was dressed and then we start talking exchanging I didn't expect this to

340
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:36,119
happen you know really connected really connected and then after I left going

341
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:42,240
towards my car there was this Chinese woman I think she was Chinese Asian out front of one of the

342
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,359
places and uh we started talking and she just she said well you know don't worry

343
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:53,000
about this you know I I guess I started talking about wishing I had a boyfriend you know she says you you'll meet one

344
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,440
you're going to meet one tomorrow you know she I mean I couldn't believe

345
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:03,720
because I was open-minded that's really what it was I was open to

346
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:09,560
change I need to more to be more open to change so oh well I want to force it

347
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:15,680
just let it happen naturally right well there's is this way that says I need to

348
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:22,599
it's like kind of like embedded in said that yeah right like I should or something but why not do the same thing

349
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:29,680
just start noticing change like simple tangible change and there's a way that it just makes it

350
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,760
more like oh yeah of course everything's changing like once we kind of like turn our attention to it then it'll just

351
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:44,040
start showing up everywhere and then once we start to see oh it's already inherent in so much of my existence then

352
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:50,440
it just becomes a little bit more familiar and less uh a problem yeah I

353
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:57,560
like just noticing what's already happening yeah thank you volunteers

354
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:03,920
I guess not I think maybe Scott here will take

355
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:17,280
it just before I was here this evening um I arrived early was lying in my car

356
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:24,560
little snap take a little nap and I did suffer a loss about a year ago coming up on the

357
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:30,160
anniversary and when I was laying in the car I was kind of thinking

358
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:37,760
well it is the nature of things to die and to pass on and I take some comfort in that and

359
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:46,520
then I start wondering is that sort of a is that an Adaptive stance

360
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:52,960
um seems sort of like a sort of rationalizing you know I've suffered

361
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,400
this thing and okay that's kind of like saying well it's not so bad

362
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:06,319
I really know where I'm going with this but uh it feels like uh there might be an element of clinging and even asking

363
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:13,839
that question arising like is this is this a useful thought to have

364
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:17,640
just to look at that and say

365
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:24,359
well we all we all die all things

366
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:30,720
die but I would say that grief though was

367
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:36,440
something to really honor and respect and that of course there's grief

368
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:42,880
with loss and something for us to recognize that we all have our own

369
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,440
timelines our own ways that we express it and and to say like oh all things die

370
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:55,720
there is a way that maybe isn't honoring the grief if there's still grief there and that's part of our process is to

371
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:03,920
recognize is that this is what's happening yes we understand that things die but that doesn't mean we

372
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,760
don't feel acutely that loss

373
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:17,240
yeah thank you Scott because maybe I didn't say that explicitly I'm talking about impermanence and things and but I

374
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:25,960
do want to say right there of course there's loss of course heartbreaking loss it's just part

375
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:33,240
of it Human Condition too nobody nobody's

376
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:54,480
immune so I was going to make a comment uh like you I I really like uh Groundhog

377
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:00,640
Day I I listen to it almost every single ground did oh you

378
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,200
do watch it yeah I mean I have a copy of it at

379
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:15,119
home and one thing that came to me was what shifted for him was it when he went

380
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,839
from seeing his existence as a burden to seeing something that was valuable that

381
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:26,800
he loved and it was that love and respect and valuing

382
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,760
that really made a change to

383
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:39,240
um how he held everything yeah yeah I I agree when he stopped being so

384
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:46,240
self-concerned instead was helping others and I love this scene do you guys know this movie like where the there's

385
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:51,599
all these older ladies their their car gets a flat tire and he's already there

386
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:56,960
and he's helping to them change the tire he's jacking up the car I don't know there's something so sweet about this I

387
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:02,640
just love it so yeah thank you Jim thank you for

388
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:12,760
that okay well I guess even this class tonight is

389
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:19,319
impermanent I'm just wishing you all a lovely evening thank

390
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:26,599
