1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:09,599
so good day greetings and here we are beginning of our

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:18,560
meditation session and there are two things i want to

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:26,400
bring forth at the beginning of this meditation where the overall context is

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,160
or focus now on this practice of mindfulness of breathing

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,280
is samadhi the unification of mind the

6
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:48,000
serenity of mind the concentration of mind and um a very strong association with

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,600
the deeper concentration in buddhism in the early buddhism is the idea of

8
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,680
assurance some people some translators translated self assurance or

9
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,240
confidence and so that uh we're kind of looking for or we're

10
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:14,080
evoking or we're resting on some where we're um beginning to prioritize or

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,200
recognize in us and providing in us

12
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:26,960
is um a deep sense of internal assurance

13
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:34,400
internal confidence that comes along with somebody with this unification

14
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:41,520
but also supports it so certainly for many of us something

15
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,759
deep inside in our hearts probably it could use a lot of assurance

16
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,960
the world is in big change and a lot of challenges and

17
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,680
and to be able to discover a place of deep assurance so that

18
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:09,200
we can let go of our thoughts our concerns our everyday preoccupations really let go

19
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,680
and discover us the tremendous goodness that resides within us and have that

20
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:23,599
goodness be a resource for how we live our life so that's one thing assurance the other

21
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:30,959
is that one of the primary one of the great analogies or similes buddha uses for a particular state of

22
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:38,400
concentration is that of a of a mountain lake

23
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,720
that is not being fed by any water any rain or any rivers feeding into it

24
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,239
but the only feeding of the lake the nourishment of the lake replenishment of the lake is an

25
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:56,480
underwater spring maybe right and smack in the middle of the lake underwater spring with an underwater

26
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:04,000
fountain of water that gets sprayed up and out and fills the lake with a new water

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,000
fresh water clean water and so the idea of there being a found

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,319
a source within us a spring within us that really is a little bit peacefully

29
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:25,840
wonderfully uh flowing moving dynamic this sense of flow a vibration of it

30
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:33,200
aliveness of vitality of of a joy of assurance

31
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:40,159
that we are opening to allow for and so these two things assurance and

32
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:46,560
this inner flow of goodness of warmth of of energy of vitality

33
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,560
requires something of us requires of us to create the conditions for to allow it to

34
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,400
fill us to allow it to live in us and one of the requirements

35
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,080
is not being preoccupied by things not being off run running off to the races and

36
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,080
thinking about things and worried about things certainly it's difficult not to put down

37
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:18,400
it's difficult to put down our everyday concerns and emotions and feelings so i acknowledge that but

38
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:26,639
it's also possible to begin orienting oneself in in the kind of level of receptivity

39
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:34,320
and softness and kindness that generosity inner generosity

40
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:41,680
that begins making it possible to invite or to sense or feel or receive

41
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:49,440
a kind of assurance and a kind of vitality and aliveness that samadhi is

42
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,680
so not samadhi is not this narrow laser focus that we all get tight and contracted but

43
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:02,720
rather it's an opening and letting go into the bottom of the bowl

44
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:09,360
into really being centered here in that center maybe somewhere there you

45
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:17,280
feel more alive and vital it's flow of goodness maybe very subtle

46
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,320
so assurance and receptivity a willingness to receive and be here

47
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:32,080
a willingness to be here to allow all to invite all things to come in and be unified be

48
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:39,840
gathered collected here so taking a meditation posture

49
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:53,840
that maybe for you will somehow some simple way

50
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,880
in some simple way that will

51
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:10,479
invite goodness invite nourishment invite

52
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,520
what's that what's really good in you reassuring in you to be here

53
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:23,120
a posture of assurance and to gently close your eyes

54
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,319
and allow yourself to relax in your body

55
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:39,280
so that with some assurance your inhale begins

56
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,520
and the exhale is allowed

57
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:56,960
the inhale has characteristics of this inner

58
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:04,479
this the inner the spring and in her leg something that arises and flows

59
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,879
and moves and expands through the body

60
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,840
and to allow the beginning of the in-breath

61
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:25,680
to allow the all the sensations of breathing in

62
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,840
to be received and felt

63
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:45,759
and then to as you exhale allow yourself to relax the body

64
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:54,639
relaxing the face the shoulders the belly a kind of relaxation that becomes

65
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:02,720
an invitation for your body to self-organize

66
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:13,840
the body to become whole

67
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,400
and as you exhale allowing the mind the thinking mind to relax

68
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,840
and soften

69
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,080
adjusting the mind a little bit so the attitude the way of thinking the way you are in

70
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,719
the mind is

71
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:48,000
is kind enough for pleasant enough friendly enough soft enough

72
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:09,839
that the mind gathers together everything in the mind is welcomed to come into a hole

73
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:20,720
and as you exhale again to settle in

74
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,560
let go with the exhale deep inside of you

75
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,760
to a place maybe where there's some assurance confidence

76
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:51,839
some place of peace or tranquility

77
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,440
allowing the body whole body to be receptive

78
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,920
to the vitality of itself the physical vitality of life

79
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,760
flowing and moving through you

80
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,839
relaxing into that opening

81
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:36,480
and then at the center of it all steady yourself on your breathing

82
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:48,480
breathing in breathing out a gentle steadiness

83
00:10:48,800 --> 00:11:01,839
with a mind that's softening quieting

84
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,920
breathing with inner

85
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,839
assurance

86
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,880
breathing with whatever inner wholesomeness there is or maybe in some people's language

87
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:50,639
whatever inner goodness that's here not that you're thinking about it

88
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,399
but a felt sense

89
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,519
a vitality aliveness of goodness

90
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:11,839
of which the movements of breathing are part of

91
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:33,200
and then instead of counting the breaths today maybe at every exhale

92
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:39,519
there's some there's a similar thing you can do a single word

93
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:46,480
to place you into the experience in a receptive soft assured way

94
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,600
and maybe you don't say the word with your inner mind your inner voice

95
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:58,639
but you do it so quietly that it's you imagine you're saying it

96
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:07,839
and every time you exhale imagine saying yes

97
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:16,320
just yes to your experience to being here to breathing

98
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,920
to steadying yourself quieting yourself

99
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,959
on the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

100
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:39,680
the breathing that occurs within the vitality aliveness

101
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,480
of your lake

102
00:13:44,959 --> 00:14:03,839
yes on the exhale

103
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:55,839
yes and letting go of your thoughts

104
00:18:51,679 --> 00:19:01,440
hey yes that comes with a small subtle smile

105
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:11,840
barely perceptible turning up the corners of your lips

106
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:25,840
yes of delight

107
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,840
so

108
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,840
and as we come to the end of this

109
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,080
sitting to find within you

110
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,880
a place of assurance

111
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,840
confidence

112
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:59,520
even if it's quite small find the place where there is

113
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,720
located within you embodied expression of

114
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:12,240
confidence assurance and breathe with that

115
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:20,320
maybe as you exhale letting go into that assurance that confidence

116
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:28,840
a confidence and assurance which the buddhist tradition associates with a

117
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,840
peacefulness

118
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,919
and as you're sitting here meditating

119
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:58,159
maybe with some assurance and peacefulness confidence

120
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:03,840
and without needing to say or do anything for anyone here in the privacy of your own

121
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:12,399
meditation open your heart and mind

122
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:19,760
to the people around you in the town you live county

123
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:26,960
province you live in the people maybe you'll interact with on

124
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:33,600
through technology or people you're likely to think about

125
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:45,039
and just settle back in your assurance and gaze upon these people kindly

126
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:52,720
relax back safely in your place of assurance

127
00:29:53,120 --> 00:30:02,080
and gaze out imagine everyone engaging upon them with good will

128
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:10,799
maybe even imagining what some of their faces would look like

129
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:16,399
if they were happy smiles they would have

130
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,880
maybe a little sparkle in their eyes

131
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:37,840
and imagine how good it would be if they could be happy this way

132
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:46,080
and let there be inside of you if you'd like an attitude and thoughts of good will

133
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:54,960
and well-wishing for these people may they be happy

134
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:05,840
may they be safe

135
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:14,000
may they be peaceful

136
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,840
and may they be free

137
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:32,720
and may you carry with you through the day this private place within

138
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:40,640
whether you have enough assurance and confidence that privately you can gaze

139
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:48,240
upon others consider think about others with good will and well-wishing

140
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,760
for their happiness and whether you act on it or not is a

141
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,799
secondary thing

142
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:07,039
to allow to bring at least your inner life

143
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,880
to have love or care or goodwill for the people around you they don't

144
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,840
have to know

145
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:23,790
[Music]

146
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:36,079
[Music]

147
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,720
you
