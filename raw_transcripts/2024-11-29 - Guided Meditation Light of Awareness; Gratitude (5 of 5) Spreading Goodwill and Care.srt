00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:17,400
hello on this Friday morning hello for this day after for

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,480
people in United States day after

3
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:29,599
Thanksgiving and um perhaps

4
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,719
with whatever good will that exists here in this community

5
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:41,320
today coming together there's a way of

6
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:47,039
meditating that even if we Center ourselves on

7
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,840
breathing the attitude of mindfulness the attitude of attention the attitude

8
00:00:52,840 --> 00:01:01,600
is to be open to all things to be aware of all things in all directions

9
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:10,560
and one analogy I have for this is if you turn on a light bulb in a dark room and if you could slow

10
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,479
down um time to be really really slow you would

11
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:25,439
see that the light would move through progressively first right by the light

12
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:32,360
bulb and then it would go further out and it would it would would light up the

13
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:39,479
objects that are close to it and then it would light up the objects further away and further away

14
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:46,280
and further away and um and but it would like toot in all

15
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:52,240
directions of light bulbin kind of an equ equally freely

16
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,680
openly to to touch whatever is there and if it only goes so far because it's in a

17
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,680
room then then it has no problem with that that's the distance it

18
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:11,560
goes so in the same way I like to think of our capacity for

19
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:18,720
awareness is like a little light bulb within that rather than directing that

20
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,720
attention someplace we turn it on and let it

21
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,160
radiate let it spread like a light like a lighthouse or something

22
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:39,120
and let it just take in whatever is nearby now if awareness is centered in

23
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,280
the heart which is the ancient kind of or maybe not so ancient traditional

24
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,480
Buddhist idea rather than in the west we often might think it's in the

25
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,519
brain but if it's in the heart or in the Heart Center and emotional Center in the

26
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:02,680
Torso the chest then as that light spreads

27
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:09,799
out maybe it first comes to the movements of the body associated with

28
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,120
breathing it spreads further it goes through the body more

29
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:23,040
widely maybe in some ways it goes further and notice this thinking and

30
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,120
emotions and if it goes further it goes beyond into the room into the atmosphere

31
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,280
around you and in a sense it just keeps

32
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,879
spreading and your awareness the light of your awareness is ready to take in

33
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:47,120
anything that comes under its gaze no

34
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:55,400
problem light light from a light bulb has no problem it just lights something

35
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,400
up so to assume a meditation posture

36
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:08,159
that maybe has the same attitude of a light bulb that has

37
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:16,040
no light shade around it open present

38
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,239
available confident in a

39
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,160
posture and to gently close close the

40
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,520
eyes and to arrive at the center arrive in some centered

41
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,720
awareness you might take a few long slow deep

42
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,320
breaths not too full comfortably long

43
00:04:53,320 --> 00:05:00,680
breaths and as you inhale to feel the movements of your body the

44
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,039
stretching of the rib

45
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:14,759
cage and as you exhale a relaxing a settling

46
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:52,720
and letting your breathing return to normal and continue relaxing a bit as a

47
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:59,880
way of settling removing the cover from your

48
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,240
your light

49
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:11,720
bulb as you exhale relaxing the muscles of your face

50
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:43,039
as you inhale feeling your shoulders as you exhale relaxing the shoulders

51
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:15,680
inhale feeling the chest exhaling softening in the chest

52
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:43,520
inhaling feeling the belly exhaling softening in the belly

53
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:12,400
inhaling with a broad awareness of your

54
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:19,960
body exhaling relaxing softening the whole

55
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,960
body

56
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:42,760
breathing in breathing out gentle

57
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:48,800
soft feeling the body breathing on the

58
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:56,680
inhale softening on the exhale

59
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:25,040
on the inhale feeling the thinking mind on the exhale relaxing the thinking

60
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
mind

61
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
e

62
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,320
e e

63
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:19,880
and then centering centering

64
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:26,800
yourself in the area of breathing

65
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:42,880
feeling allowing for the inhale to

66
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:57,200
occur allowing the exhale all the way to the end of the

67
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,200
exhale

68
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:18,399
feeling the last Sensations in your torso associated with

69
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:28,360
exhaling that might be the place where the inhale begins

70
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:55,040
and perhaps you can feel that the light of awareness the little

71
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,600
light bulb is right there where the inhale Hal

72
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:11,079
begins or maybe you have another place within still quiet

73
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:18,839
place where the light of awareness can shine be

74
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,760
open equally to everything

75
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,759
where the first thing it encounters is breathing in the

76
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:49,800
body and whatever else comes into the range of the

77
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:58,839
light just let it be known with the same

78
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:10,040
undisturbed quality of light that shines upon anything equally everything

79
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:20,440
equally allowing your light to spread as far as it wants to

80
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
spread

81
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

82
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959

for for

101
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:30,240
and then as we come to the end of the sitting to

102
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,679
imagine your awareness is like a

103
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:43,640
light but a light that is filled with the warmth of Good

104
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:51,799
Will your good willll in whatever way that that is your

105
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:02,240
way there's different colors of light some are warm some

106
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:11,520
are cold some are bright with a warm light of

107
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:17,679
awareness let [Music] your let that

108
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,799
awareness Spread spread out into the

109
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,240
world spreading to your

110
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:39,399
neighborhoods your counties your Providence

111
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:47,679
provinces spread out across the land as if you can gaze upon the world

112
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,679
kindly

113
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,518
as if

114
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,039
every light Ray from your inner

115
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:16,679
light is a touch of kindness the touches the

116
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:23,080
world as if you do have the

117
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:30,480
ability to warm up the world to inspire the world with goodness and

118
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,120

safe may all beings be

123
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,799
peaceful may all beings be free

124
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:39,159
and may the warmth of our attention Our Kind

125
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:46,880
gaze convey to the world that we want them

126
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:57,960
well that we care may all beings be happy

127
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,230
[Music]

128
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,679
thank

129
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,960
you

130
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,960
e e

131
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:51,039
so hello and welcome to the fifth talk on

132
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:56,679
gratitude and I want to begin with I want to use a couple of quotes from the

133
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:04,440
sutas the ancient teachings of the Buddha and one is uh the Buddha saying

134
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:10,440
there are two kinds of people who are rare in this

135
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:17,679
world the one who helps and the one who is grateful the

136
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:25,679
ones who help and the ones who are help grateful and they need each

137
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:32,440
other because there's a circle of giving circle of

138
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:39,159
receptivity that allows the gift to continue down Through the Ages the wheel

139
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:44,320
of giving and receiving the wheel of generosity and

140
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:53,279
care and the wheel of being cared for of receiving generosity both are

141
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:58,399
important and ideally we play both parts

142
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:06,200
many years ago I learned that um that uh how unfortunate it is at

143
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:15,799
times when someone wants to offer a small favor do something to uh say no I

144
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:23,159
remember once I was going to offer someone a friend to a ride to the airport I was so happy to be able to do it and spend time with my friend and the

145
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:29,399
person was clearly was very embarrassed or or didn't want to put me out felt

146
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:36,159
somehow they were a burden and uh said no no no so I finally I kind of let go

147
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:43,440
and I thought to myself oh this is so unfortunate I had this wonderful delightful feeling I wanted to do do

148
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:51,440
something for my friend and um and it didn't go anywhere so this idea of receiving and

149
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:58,519
then being grateful offering gr gratitude and thanks is a form of gener

150
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:03,919
so so it keeps it going but these two things these are

151
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:09,839
rare in the world those who help and those who are grateful and I should say

152
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:16,839
that ideally we play both sides of that when the time is

153
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:23,240
appropriate I'm inspired by a story that uh or account in the suas of a meeting

154
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:28,320
of the Buddha with um or the meeting of a king king p

155
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:37,200
panity with the Buddha it seems like they were the same age they had known each other um for many many years I

156
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:43,679
think uh soon after the Buddha's Awakening he met uh King p

157
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:50,480
pacity and um and they were kind of friends uh leaders of in their own

158
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:56,480
rights and um and so and they knew each other they

159
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:02,119
died around the same year so they knew each other some from 45 years or so 40

160
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:08,400
years and um and so near the end of that time uh

161
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:15,040
the king comes to visit the Buddha and um he bows down to the ground

162
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:21,119
when he sees the Buddha and he exclaims I am King

163
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:29,880
panity bante I am bante is kind of like means sir bante I am King panity and I

164
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:35,680
think in India or in Ancient India especially maybe um it's very very seems

165
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,839
very odd maybe for some people in the United States that you would twice kind

166
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:46,480
of declare who you are in the presence of a wonderful great person but there's

167
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:52,200
something about uh the king kind of making it public that yes this is who I

168
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:58,319
am and I'm bowing bowing down to you fully uh this is a the in the in the

169
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:04,920
fullness all of who I am is here bowing down to you and

170
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:11,520
um and the Buddha says why is it that you show so much gratitude and loving

171
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:17,599
kindness to me to do this so that was kind of a wonderful question why but they the

172
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:23,880
Buddha describes it as gratitude and loving kindness that he's offering to the king that that the king is offering

173
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:30,640
to the Buddha and um and uh it's a uh the king

174
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:37,359
offers a whole series of reasons why he does this but I want to read the first

175
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:43,400
one it is because the

176
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:49,440
Buddha basically saying to you it's because you

177
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:56,520
Buddha uh because you um it's because you

178
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:04,240
practice for the welfare of many people for the happiness of many

179
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:13,920
people you establish many people in the noble practice that is the path of the good

180
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:20,920
Dharma in the way of the wholesome Dharma is for this

181
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:28,880
reason I honor you with this blaze of loving kindness and gratitude

182
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,920
so um so the Buddha is one of those who

183
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,680
helps people and he received the honor and the

184
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:53,520
kindness of the King by asking him why is it and so he accepted it and then he let

185
00:37:53,520 --> 00:38:00,440
it continue he heard what the king had to say and maybe he knew this was being

186
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:07,160
recorded and um and I just love the idea that uh the king would see it this is

187
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:14,599
what the Buddha is about living for the welfare and happiness of others and as we come to the United

188
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:20,319
States the day after Thanksgiving um some of us have been

189
00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:26,200
maybe with family and friends for this occasion some have

190
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:33,400
not and um but it is a kind of kind of coming together and to a small group

191
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:42,920
often and now it's time to open up the heart more widely now is the time

192
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:48,800
to expand whatever Good Will whatever thankfulness

193
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:56,319
whatever love and care there has been close in for yourself for your immediate

194
00:38:56,319 --> 00:39:03,839
family friends your neighbors to now expand it keep expanding and this is the

195
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:09,599
nature of the Dharma to keep expanding to take love

196
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,760
learn how to love learn how to care learn how to be

197
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:20,760
generous and um and uh keep it for those

198
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:28,000
who are close to us don't lose it but expand it open it up wider and wider

199
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:37,800
there's no limit to how far a light can shine no limit to the the the

200
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:45,480
360° that the light can shine all around so for us there's no limit to how far

201
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:54,319
and how all encompassing our love our care our goodwi can be out into the world no

202
00:39:54,319 --> 00:40:02,119
limit to how we to the Gratitude we have for all that supports our life all

203
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:09,760
that allows us to be uh aware mindful allows us the

204
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:16,200
amazing opportunity to be kind amazing

205
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:24,200
opportunity to be generous amazing opportunity to care for

206
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:30,960
others as we care for ourselves as we care for for our loved ones out into the

207
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:39,800
world so in this day after Thanksgiving the end of our five days on

208
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:45,560
gratitude let it serve as a foundation

209
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:52,400
for spreading our Good Will out into the whole

210
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,480
world and when we don't have that Universal Goodwill

211
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:04,440
it's okay but don't just don't go along with

212
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:11,599
it see what it is that gets in the way see what you're doing are you stressed

213
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:19,119
are you afraid are you angry what's going on for you that your heart is not

214
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:26,079
open and love yourself in spite of that it's not a

215
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:32,720
cause for shame or disregard for yourself but that's where the practice

216
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,800
is practice with it because if you do

217
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:44,160
something inside will shift and change and relax and your

218
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:50,720
capacity for Universal goodwi in all directions can grow

219
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:57,720
again you have the capacity it's part of who you are it's a gift for the world

220
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:05,440
one that the world deeply mean needs may it be that the practice that

221
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:13,839
you do of mindfulness meditation the Dharma may it be that

222
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:21,400
it that your practice includes practicing for the

223
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:28,040
welfare of many people for the happiness of many people

224
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:34,558
establishing people in the good in the

225
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:43,000
wholesome and may that good and that wholesomeness spread to every corner of the universe
