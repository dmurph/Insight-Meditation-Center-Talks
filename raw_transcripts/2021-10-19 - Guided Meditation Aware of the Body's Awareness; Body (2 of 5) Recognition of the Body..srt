1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,920
so hello everyone and welcome to our meditation together

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,920
and um one of the

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,000
remarkable aspects of being human

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,080
is the ability to be conscious the ability to be aware

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:34,640
and in that awareness being conscious has many facets the different times different facets are emphasized

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,520
and one of those is the ability to recognize what's happening

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:48,239
to be aware and to recognize but the recognition is

8
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:54,079
there's different kinds of recognition this morning

9
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:00,079
i woke up uh fairly early about an hour before i

10
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:06,240
usually do and uh felt quite quite awake and refreshed

11
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,360
and i thought wow this is an hour before i usually do my morning meditation so um

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,280
you know i could probably do some things i have a long to do list and maybe i'll do some things and have less

13
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,920
to do during the day and and then i said no i can also meditate

14
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,880
longer so i sat down to meditate and still with thoughts that i should be

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:40,799
doing things and and as soon as i sat into my meditation posture

16
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,799
and kind of settled in i realized that

17
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,200
my my my thought my thinking about what should i do here is early in the morning should

18
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:00,479
i do some some of my to-do list or should i meditate that that was all kind of um

19
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,520
uh was um a lot of thinking

20
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:12,879
and the recognition there was a deeper recognition that was happened when i sat down to meditate

21
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,000
when i sat down and got into my posture that

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,440
immediately there was this knowing in my body that i was home it would mean there's a

23
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,720
knowing of oh this is good this this is subtle this is the place to

24
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:35,360
be and that recognition was not in the same discursive thoughts that i had when i

25
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,200
was considering what to do with my time this was a deeper knowing deeper

26
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,040
cognition that felt much more embodied oh the body knows oh yes this is the

27
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,120
place to be this is right and and so then i

28
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,760
you know i settled in i felt uh affirmed in my decision to meditate

29
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,360
and um and this way of being connected to the body and

30
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,560
letting the body be an informant let the body what how does

31
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,239
the body cognize how does the body know what does the body know

32
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:23,519
and sometimes the body knows before the mind thinks about something

33
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,920
if we're uncomfortable in our body the discomfort occurs before

34
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:38,560
the cognitive intellectual labeling of that oh i'm uncomfortable

35
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,760
it might happen seemingly at the same time but there's a little gap between them

36
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,519
and a gap that is noticed when it's possible to sit quietly in meditation

37
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:56,239
and the body there's a knowing that things are uncomfortable but there's no thinking about it there's

38
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:03,680
no reaction to it there's no higher cognition in the knowing of it they just

39
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,159
it's almost like a silent knowing and this knowing that i was you know in

40
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:16,639
the right place meditating this is good to sit here there was a silent knowing in the sense that it

41
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,759
wasn't really the mind talking or thinking or imagining

42
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:29,080
just the body speaking so

43
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:38,639
to our ability to be aware of the body is such a powerful thing so helpful

44
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,680
not always easy the body's challenging a lot of pain a lot of discomfort can

45
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,120
exist but below the level of

46
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,160
thinking about it reacting to it what happens what does the body know how

47
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:01,280
does the body settle in how do we really become attuned

48
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,800
to our bodily experience so

49
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,639
assuming a posture and mindfulness begins

50
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,320
uh can begin for meditation with mindfulness of the posture

51
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,400
taking some time to maybe sway back and forth

52
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:31,120
or maybe rock back and forth a little bit and and kind of to

53
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,840
become a little more embodied but also to find a nice

54
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,000
midpoint in which to sit or lay

55
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,520
in a good balanced posture

56
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,840
and then to gently close your eyes

57
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,880
and without much else to do what are you aware of in your body now

58
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,840
if you attune yourself to your body

59
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:29,319
familiarize yourself with the body

60
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,560
maybe almost as like you're listening to the body

61
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:18,479
then as a gentle way to expand the sensations of your body

62
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,520
the range of what you sense and feel in your body

63
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,560
take a few long slow deep breaths

64
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,840
three quarters full

65
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:43,319
and gently exhale long relaxed exhale

66
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:18,479
and then being attuned to your body following kind of a pace sorry

67
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:27,400
that feels relaxed for the body return to uh normal breathing

68
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:44,480
and as you exhale in a relaxed way no hurry

69
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,680
relax any parts of your body where there's holding

70
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,640
where it's easy to relax

71
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,680
relaxing around the face

72
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,760
let the area of your lips be relaxed so the lips are not pressing against each other

73
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:27,279
some people find a little bit relaxing to have the tongue gently touching

74
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,200
the upper palate the roof of the mouth

75
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,800
relaxing the shoulders

76
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:01,800
can you relax a bit your upper back

77
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:15,320
maybe if you do so it feels like you should adjust your back a little bit

78
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,160
and on the exhale softening the belly

79
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,600
sometimes if the belly relaxes and hangs forward down

80
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,640
might also feel appropriate to adjust the posture a little bit

81
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,360
to adjust the spine

82
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,680
relax the fingers

83
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:15,800
and then center yourself on the body's experience of breathing

84
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,560
then maybe the emphasis can be to allow the body to have its own

85
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,360
experience of breathing

86
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,800
the body can have its own knowing

87
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,240
the movements the sensations of breathing

88
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:07,560
and knowing that's deeper than the skin

89
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,440
the body's knowing

90
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:33,920
that is not the same thing as thinking about the body

91
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:42,000
in fact as you exhale see if you can let go of thinking

92
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,600
or let go with your interest in thinking so your interest

93
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,839
can be in the body's experience

94
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:00,519
as it breathes in and breathes out

95
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:17,600
letting the thinking mind become quieter so you're better able to

96
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:25,000
feel and sense the body knowing itself

97
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,919
so

98
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,039
so

99
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,679
so

100
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,000
the more we can feel our body

101
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:03,279
and let the aware in the body's awareness of itself

102
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:09,120
become fuller the more the body's own process of

103
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:15,640
healing of making whole

104
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:23,120
has a chance to unfold the settling the calming of the body the

105
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:31,600
opening of the body the awakening of the body

106
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,600
allows for all kinds of wonderful

107
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,600
healing and

108
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:49,840
processes understanding processes deeper understanding of our life

109
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:57,440
and as and it gives a different character

110
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:04,000
to our capacity to care for compassion

111
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,159
for love for friendliness

112
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:17,919
when it's embodied and relaxed healed body when it's relaxed and open

113
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:26,760
when it seems to vibrate or resonate from the body

114
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:35,760
and as we come to the end of the sitting to

115
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,720
turn this body awareness out into the world

116
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,440
and the art is to say centered in the body

117
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:55,760
and simply to become aware of the world around us in

118
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:01,919
some kind of intuitive way the people in your communities

119
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:09,840
people you'll encounter people you'll learn about and communicate with today

120
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,480
and may you stay in your body

121
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,320
in your contact with others stay in your body

122
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:30,480
and let that be a place from which friendliness and care can

123
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:38,399
flow not from your thoughts so much not from

124
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:44,159
the mental shoulds and shouldn'ts but from a sweetness

125
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:50,799
within and with whatever sweetness tenderness

126
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:57,519
gentleness beauty that we have within

127
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,399
may we wish well on the world maybe maybe wish for the

128
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,399
welfare and happiness of others

129
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:18,840
may it be that we contribute to the happiness of others

130
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:25,600
may it be that we contribute to the safety of others

131
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:33,559
may it be that we contribute to peace for others

132
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:40,799
it may be that we contribute to the freedom of others

133
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:48,320
and that as we do so we do so

134
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:54,799
so it grows our own happiness and safety and

135
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:59,000
peace and freedom

136
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,679
may all beings be happy

137
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:11,130

138
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:21,069
[Music]

139
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,080
so this week we're talking about mindfulness of the body

140
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:40,399
and i think it can be one of the wonderful

141
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:47,440
results of doing mindfulness practice is to become more embodied

142
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:55,519
and uh many years ago i read ancient mahayana buddhist text

143
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:02,799
that insisted that we don't get enlightened through the mind we get enlightened through the body

144
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:08,240
and whether that's literally true or not it's kind of an inspiring idea

145
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:15,440
that certainly as we practice mindfulness slowly slowly perhaps for some of us

146
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:21,039
certainly for me the body wakes up awakening of the body

147
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:26,080
and we have more and more access to sensing and feeling the body

148
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:32,320
there are people who for all kinds of reasons you know important reasons significant things

149
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,679
happen to them difficult things that it's very difficult to be in their

150
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,720
body the body is not a safe place to be it's it

151
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:49,600
feels like you tap into fear or or tear or even sometimes to really drop in

152
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:56,480
and feel the body so to emphasize the wonderfulness of being in the body

153
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,919
is a kind of a careful thing to do because of how difficult it is some people live

154
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:07,440
kind of from their neck up or from their waist up and feel really disconnected

155
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:14,079
from parts of their body and so for today the emphasis is recognition

156
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:21,280
as an aspect of mindfulness practice in these five days of the week it's relax relaxation recognition

157
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,398
respect restoration

158
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:32,320
and release and today's recognition and um

159
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:40,720
in the re the again part of recognition is kind of to reconnect to the body to

160
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:46,000
spend time getting to know it and to learn to do it in a way

161
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,679
that is not frightening or not distressing but to do it with the kind of gentleness

162
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:57,040
and care and for some people to do it in in uh in um

163
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:02,640
you know in very short periods of time spend a little bit touching in and then pull out

164
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,839
and just as long as it's safe and i know for some people i've given them the instructions when there's been

165
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:12,960
really difficult things in the body that um to imagine awareness is like a

166
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,960
soft cotton ball that we gently uh reach down and touch the place that's

167
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:25,680
difficult and just like touch it with that softness of the cotton ball and then pull back and let it be just so

168
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,359
it's known and felt and maybe note a little bit and then pull back

169
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:37,280
and slowly over time the different ways the body reveals itself to us

170
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,400
sometimes and it can be through discomfort as the mind gets quieter as the body

171
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:48,320
settles down we go through the layers of where the body is held and where there's tension

172
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:54,960
and there's layers of tension we have that we're not aware of because the coarser tension holds it in place

173
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,640
or kind of hides it or covers it kind of and so when the coarser tension uh

174
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,960
relaxes then we're aware of deeper tension deeper tension and um and slowly there's a greater

175
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:12,640
connection to the body and and but it's not just the connection to

176
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:19,040
the body as if the body is something separate from you um there's a body has its own

177
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:27,200
awareness its own uh and often we call it sensing uh sensing and sensations

178
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:35,359
uh belong to the body and uh the place where we uh like if we touch if i touch my hand

179
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:41,280
uh the i have sensations of warmth and pressure against upon my hand

180
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,520
now and then um and that's those sensations of warmth and pressure

181
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:53,680
occur in the location where the other hand is pushing against the

182
00:36:53,680 --> 00:37:01,040
the left hand here for me so sensing that raw immediate sensing

183
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:07,839
occurs in the body in the place where the sensations occur and i like to say that sensing and

184
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:13,520
sensations are non-dual they're not really two different things and

185
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:19,599
and that and then separate from that um i know the body knows it's warm when i

186
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:26,240
touch and knows the pressure and separate from that i can have the cognitive thought

187
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,280
where i had put the english word a warmth pressure on it

188
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:37,520
and if i speak a different language i would use a different sound to represent that just sounds that

189
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:42,800
we use to represent things these words that we have and um

190
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,000
and so um and so we use different sounds to represent it

191
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,520
the if um but the body is already sensed it the

192
00:37:53,520 --> 00:38:00,240
bodies feels it and so this sensing body starts to wake up as we do

193
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:06,640
mindfulness and and the parts that are numb or been disconnected get reconnected

194
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:12,119
and so this recognition is also a remembering

195
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:19,599
putting the members of the body back together again that have been disconnected and there starts to slowly over time to

196
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,800
be a flow kind of of harmony a flow of the body the whole body kind of just

197
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,320
hums in a very nice way but the path to that is

198
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:36,160
is to appreciate this deeper recognition so mindfulness practice uses the

199
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:42,560
recognition part of mindfulness is actually extremely significant in mindfulness practice

200
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:50,320
and there are different and so to works in different ways but it's always simple

201
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:55,839
it's not a story it's not not an explanation of why it's there it's not

202
00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:01,520
a review of everything it almost like recognition doesn't have

203
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:07,599
it's almost like rec they're what we recognize doesn't have a history it's just recognizing in the moment

204
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:16,400
what's here and uh so if i recognize my the chest expanding as i breathe in

205
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:22,160
it's just the expansion just feeling and sensing the expansion feeling the movement

206
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:28,960
and then in addition we can have the mental aspect and the mental part of mindfulness practice

207
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:34,079
is sometimes to use a mental note and that mental note a label

208
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:39,359
a sound is just

209
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:48,160
is a um using a sound a word that recognizes

210
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:55,520
what it is we just uh we're experiencing so expansion of the chest movement that i feel

211
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,960
so breathing in and and but that's two different forms of

212
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,160
recognition happening it's the the immediacy of what's happening in the chest

213
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:14,560
and then it's very quiet kind of maybe in the background almost there's a mental recognition movement

214
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:20,160
expansion that's happening or uh if there's a pain in the knee

215
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:26,000
pain is happening um but that's very it's like five percent of what the mind is doing is a

216
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,839
label it's not like we're uh you know pounding that lay the mental note into

217
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:38,480
the experience it's more like a gentle brushing of it now this recognition both the mental

218
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,319
noting and the feeling of it to really be part of that and enter into this recognition mode

219
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:50,880
is an alternative to discursive thought it's an alternative to wandering off

220
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,000
flowing along with a storyline or a commentary line or

221
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,599
explanation or a prediction of what's going to happen all the ways we can kind of get involved

222
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,640
in discursive thought and the idea is that the recognition

223
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,920
begins to cut through that sometimes i think of it as the sword

224
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:19,359
that cuts through the gordian knot that you know our mental world of discursive

225
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:24,800
thoughts can be so complicated so many ideas that we live in and complicated

226
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:31,200
histories and stories and then we cut through it by just oh just breathing

227
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:37,520
that's an in-breath that's an out breath that there's a sound

228
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:43,280
listening now there's an itch now i'm back with the breathing the

229
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,560
stomach is tight relaxing the belly and

230
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:55,359
and it's just it's just coming back to that simplicity and so using the simple simple act of

231
00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:02,800
recognition to help us be engaged nicely in the present moment

232
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:08,480
without being hijacked or pulled into the world of thinking

233
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:16,240
we don't have to struggle against thoughts in a few weeks i'll talk about mindfulness of thinking but for now the idea is to kind of cut

234
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:22,720
through it to keep it really simple the meditation mindfulness of thinking and the role of

235
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:27,760
thinking it comes later but for right now the simplest we use the simplest

236
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:35,440
kind of thinking to help us stay present and that's a very simple uh one word

237
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,640
cognition of things pressure warmth expansion

238
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:46,960
if it's more than a word it probably is not simple recognition and um

239
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,400
but don't but uh and so use the mental noting very gentle soft

240
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,800
or something that's uh close to it if your mind is able to really stay close to that simple

241
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,960
recognition without a mental note you don't have to use the mental noting but mental noting is a kind of way of

242
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:11,599
staying honest really knowing that you're not wondering often thought and

243
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:17,920
and just kind of steadily steady pace breathe in out expansion

244
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,960
hearing discomfort

245
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:30,079
pleasure whatever it might be we're feeling and sensing and um

246
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:36,240
and uh and then so whether it's cognition of a mental note or the cognition of the

247
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:42,640
body's own knowing the knowing that's much more silent whichever helps you to cut through

248
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,760
uh the thinking mind and connect you to something that's living alive

249
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:53,040
because it's a miracle to be conscious this wonderful thing that i started off with but human

250
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:58,079
awareness that um it's a it's an amazing thing

251
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:04,160
and to stay close to the living moment the living experience of life where cognition

252
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:10,240
consciousness awareness mindfulness keeps us in our animated body

253
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:16,480
keeps us in our living body the lived experience and the more we can recognize and open

254
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:22,560
up and be present for this eventually we start feeling and allowing for the

255
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:29,839
healing potential healing power of this body that we have

256
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:35,040
healing not necessarily from physical illness and and

257
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:42,240
injury and things like that but it's kind of a deeper um kind of healing a spiritual healing

258
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:48,720
a healing of awareness that uh this hum that moves through the whole

259
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:56,400
body and becomes whole so i hope that made sense and

260
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:02,160
and to really get to know the body well is such a blessing

261
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:08,560
so i'd encourage you uh through the day today the next 24 hours for those of you in a different time

262
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:15,200
zone to um to get to know your body better

263
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:21,599
listen to it maybe even uh have a timer on that goes on every few minutes you know 10 minutes

264
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:29,200
or something and then check in with your body check in with your body every time you go through a door frame every time that you

265
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:34,560
change your posture from sitting to walking to whatever you do standing

266
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:39,839
whenever you pick up a new utensil cooking or eating

267
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:46,000
check what do you have find different things to just check in check in what's happening in the body what is the body

268
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,000
showing if i listen to my body now what do i learn recognize the body

269
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,200
so thank you
