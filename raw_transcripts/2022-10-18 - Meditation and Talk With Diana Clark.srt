1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,639
so tonight I'd like to like to talk a little bit about practicing mindfulness

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,580
maybe that's not too surprising at a place called the inside Meditation Center

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,820
but why do we practice like for us as individuals like why do we have this

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,880
mindfulness practice what are we expecting are the benefits or the purpose or why

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,180
would we do this is there a way that we have a sense of

6
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,960
we would measure there how our meditation goes or how our

7
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,800
meditation practice over time progresses like what are the

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,620
the values or the qualities that we're expecting to arise or shift or change as

9
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,500
a consequence of meditation and for some of us we're meditating

10
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,978
because we want to reduce stress why not nobody wants to be completely

11
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:12,260
stressed out all the time so this that we want to reduce physical

12
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:18,119
difficulties or emotional difficulties or a combination of them or

13
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:26,100
just a number of ways in which stress shows up or maybe we want to make changes in our

14
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:32,220
Behavior we have this idea that 'd be really great if I were more loving

15
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,979
and compassionate in the world to other people and to myself

16
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:44,420
to my annoying co-workers or to whomever it might be

17
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,280
or maybe for example we have this idea that we want to lessen procrastination

18
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,920
or are we maybe want to work with some some activity that feels like a

19
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,200
compulsion or an addiction maybe we do have an addiction and we're hoping that

20
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,079
mindfulness can help so

21
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:13,800
there's a way in which maybe we want to to change our behavior in some way

22
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,340
or maybe we're practicing mindfulness because we want to understand ourselves better

23
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,819
what makes ourselves tick what what's going what's our in our life

24
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:33,420
maybe get in contact with that or what are our habits of mind that

25
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,940
which ones that are supporting us and which ones are not supporting us these

26
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:45,000
patterns that uh we've inherited and patterns that we've

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,480
that have been created whether we intended to create them or not

28
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:59,400
and I'll say for me personally I came to the Dharma to practice partly because I

29
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:07,680
just didn't know what to do with my life this kind of angst like I have all these things that

30
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,319
I thought I wanted and yet my life just doesn't seem right

31
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:19,200
but I couldn't didn't really know what to do I'd been chasing after so many

32
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,620
things and for so long and I've just had this sense there's got to be something different

33
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:32,239
when I stumbled upon it the Dharma by accident during a yoga class

34
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:40,080
each of us as ours and own our own story of how we came to the Dharma and why we

35
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,120
came initially and chances are it hasn't been constant or the same the whole time

36
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,260
every your whole duration of practicing

37
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:59,060
but I would say in general like this is a gross generalization

38
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:06,000
that people do not want their meditation practice their mindfulness practice to

39
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,500
be about everything that's unpleasant that isn't Our intention when we start

40
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,840
this practice I just want to hang out with everything that's

41
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,479
uncomfortable or difficult instead like some people

42
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:30,720
have this idea I just want to meditate I want it to be some kind of like a chill out session where I can just be a little

43
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,860
bit quiet and settle down and feel good for a little bit or feel better or something like this sure why not I mean

44
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:43,560
right we all want this nobody wants to be with the difficulty all the time and

45
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,919
and to be sure for some people that's exclusively what they expect from meditation I'm using this word

46
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:56,280
meditation in general here it's a opportunity to

47
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,320
chill out but

48
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,600
I would say that mindfulness meditation in particular as opposed to like maybe

49
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:13,740
just this kind of global idea of meditation and recognizing that there's so many different practices other than

50
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:20,759
just mindfulness but I would say specifically mindfulness practice can help us with all these things right

51
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:26,580
reducing stress changing our Behavior having greater understanding in fact I

52
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:32,160
would say that those arise whether that's your intention or not but

53
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,639
one thing that's maybe I don't know if it's Unique but it's something that I would like to emphasize is that

54
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:45,419
mindfulness meditation is a way to increase the freedom in our lives

55
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:50,580
and I like this word freedom in a way because it's kind of a vague way and we

56
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:57,120
can understand it in lots of different ways and there's room for all of us to

57
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,699
interpret that in a way that makes makes sense to us but one way we might

58
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:08,460
understand freedom it is not being pushed around

59
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:15,419
by our experiences like oh I have to avoid this situation

60
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:21,419
because it might cause some uncomfortable emotions and I don't want those to arise so I have to avoid this

61
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:26,520
person I have to avoid this situation I have to avoid some of these uh

62
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,979
being alone with myself for too long or whatever it is

63
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:38,340
or maybe we have this sense that we're spending our

64
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:44,160
all of our time engineering manufacturing creating during whatever we can

65
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:51,259
to control our environment so that we can feel okay so that nothing

66
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:56,280
unpleasant and toward difficult arises

67
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:02,160
and that's not Freedom either if we're just always trying to control everything

68
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,520
control other people control ourselves wrestle ourselves into

69
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,280
being a particular way behaving in a particular way

70
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:21,240
if we only feel free or relaxed when under certain conditions when we've got

71
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:28,080
them just straight and that's not real freedom

72
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:35,819
and what the Buddha is pointing to and what this practice is pointing to is the freedom of not being pushed around by

73
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:43,680
our experiences the capacity to be with whatever arises

74
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,460
and the confidence to be with whatever Rises

75
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,479
that's where the freedom is

76
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:01,759
so I want to read a little excerpt from a poem

77
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:07,979
and I'll talk a little bit more about the poem I'll tell who the poet is and the name of the poem a little bit later

78
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:15,180
but I'd like to start by just reading this excerpt I found this poem really powerful

79
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:21,800
and just like to share little bits about it and talk about it

80
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:29,060
so this poem starts like this it's a it's a well-known poem maybe some of you know this

81
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:37,500
there's a bluebird in my heart that wants to get out

82
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,959
but I'm too tough for him I say stay in

83
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:48,680
there I'm not going to let anybody see you

84
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,279
there's a bluebird in my heart that wants to get out but I'm too tough for

85
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:01,380
him I say stay in there I'm not going to let

86
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,120
anybody see you

87
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:12,240
so in some ways I appreciate very much what the poet is pointing to here

88
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,519
that he's like he's recognizing so many different things and expressing it I

89
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:23,399
think in a in a way that I appreciate but might say that expressing a an

90
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:31,620
emotional experience and using metaphorical language as a way to express it sometimes it's not clear

91
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:37,980
what an emotional experience is and if this person's a poet he's using metaphor

92
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:43,500
in this kind of language but there's a blue bird in my heart that wants to get out

93
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:49,260
okay there's something fluttering and maybe we're not even clear what it

94
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:56,220
is and so not only does this poet pointing to his emotional experience but he's

95
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:02,760
also having some awareness of his relationship to that experience

96
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:09,740
he's saying stay in there I'm not going to let anybody see you

97
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,899
maybe this is a sense of shame or maybe a sense of you know this shouldn't be

98
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:22,920
here or something's wrong if it's here but clearly a sense of this is not something that's welcome

99
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:31,620
so the poet knows about this emotional experience and his relationship to this emotional experience and maybe he also

100
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:39,240
has this view of himself I'm too tough for him the poet says

101
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:46,260
so so this mindfulness we might say of this view of himself or maybe even a

102
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:52,260
wish that he has for himself to be tough so that this little bluebird can't get

103
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:58,260
out and mindfulness is points to all of this

104
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:03,720
though our experience including our emotional experiences our relationship

105
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:10,380
to our experiences and sometimes things that aren't so clear or obvious to see

106
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:16,320
and that is a view that we have about ourselves and a view about we have about

107
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,899
what how things should be and how they shouldn't be

108
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:30,300
and with this like learning to be with the experience or we begin with

109
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:35,399
just by recognizing what's happening and then with recognition we can increase

110
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,920
our capacity not only to be with experiences but to even acknowledge them

111
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:46,800
and be able to tease apart like for example an emotional experience and our

112
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:52,680
relationship to them sometimes they get all tangled up and we can't quite tell them apart

113
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:58,800
it can be really helpful to tease them apart what's happening

114
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,260
and our relationship to what's happening

115
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:11,339
so poet he's not expressing Freedom though

116
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:16,560
right he's having some mindfulness there but right this there's a bluebird that

117
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:23,060
wants to get out and the bluebird isn't free

118
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:29,760
and he's trying to control his experience he's not going to let anybody see this blue bird and we have a sense

119
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:36,060
that his heart is closed and or he has this fear of intimacy he doesn't want anybody to know that there's this

120
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:42,420
Bluebird in his heart but perhaps he's on his way to more

121
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:50,300
freedom because he is recognizing these different elements he is being mindful

122
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,959
and this is the way forward like if we want to have some freedom

123
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:03,240
it's really helpful to notice what is it that we are tangled

124
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:11,180
up with what is it that is inhibiting this freedom

125
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:20,519
so helps to have some understanding some awareness some intimacy with this

126
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:27,060
with whatever it is that's arising I like to read a little bit further

127
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:32,339
along in this poem I'm not I'm skipping some parts in the middle

128
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:38,880
and then I felt like I should preface this that um and then I'd like to talk a little bit about some of these other uh verses

129
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:45,000
but I I feel obliged to say you know I was thinking to myself I'm trained as a

130
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,420
research scientist and as a Dharma teacher like I have no business looking at the American literature and trying to

131
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:57,120
unpack it and look at it so I just want to recognize that there's lots of ways

132
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,180
we can interpret poems and I'm just using this in one particular lens

133
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:10,560
so I kind of want to honor the poet and I want to honor those people who study English literature which may say Diana I

134
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:19,260
don't know what you're talking about but that is a disclaimer Maybe

135
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:23,360
here's a further along in the poem

136
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:31,680
there's a blue bird in my heart that wants to get out but I'm too clever

137
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:38,880
I only let him out at night sometimes when everybody's asleep

138
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:45,480
I say I know that you're there so don't be sad

139
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:51,899
that I put him back but he's singing a little in there I

140
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:58,260
haven't quite let him die and we sleep together like that with our

141
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:08,220
secret Pact and it's nice enough to make a man weep

142
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:13,639
I don't weep do you

143
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,540
I find this poem really touching

144
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:30,320
and there's a number of ways that as I said we can interpret it but his emotions are shifting

145
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,019
in the beginning he's talking to this uh blue bird and he's saying stay in there

146
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:43,260
as this tone of harshness and then he at the end of the poem he's saying it's

147
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:49,740
enough to make a man weep so first I think this is

148
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:56,880
I could speak for myself this is often the way it is when we discover like uncomfortable experiences or like we

149
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:03,480
have some emotions for me I had a lot of fear and I wasn't even sure what I was afraid

150
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,760
of like I couldn't say I'm afraid of this or that but with some of these long

151
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:14,459
meditation Retreats I was doing there would just be this fear this not a fear and

152
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:21,480
I couldn't point to exactly what it was or but first I just was trying to like shove it down like oh I don't want to be

153
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,120
with that but then you know things were shift and

154
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,459
at the end of the poem he's saying it's nice nice enough to make a man weep he's

155
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:38,120
pointing to maybe the poignancy and the tenderness of just

156
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:44,279
being with our experiences being mindful of them as best we can

157
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:50,459
as best we can it's not he didn't he's saying that he didn't let

158
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:55,560
the this Bluebird die right he's not like getting rid of it

159
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:03,860
he's not trying to excise a part of himself but instead he's starting to engage with the experience

160
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:12,900
and I would say that relationship with his emotions is also shifting

161
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:20,339
starts with saying I'm too tough for him and saying I'm too clever for him I go

162
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:27,720
okay now I see you but now I gotta figure this out I don't have to experience this and at the end of the

163
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:35,419
poem he's saying we sleep together so in a way you know like maybe making friends

164
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:40,919
often this is kind of how our emotional life is to I would say with the practice

165
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:49,740
we learned to make friends with all these parts of ourselves that we were trying to ignore or somehow excise from

166
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:57,200
our experience or trying to shape our inner life in some way that they weren't there

167
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:02,760
and lastly I would say this is of course my interpretation his relationships with

168
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:08,340
others is shifting in the beginning there's this sense of

169
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:14,160
isolation and the be I'm not going to let anyone see you

170
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:21,380
right and maybe I for me I had the sense he's not even going to let himself see this little bluebird

171
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:29,100
and then in the middle of that poem is this maybe a sense of uh acceptance I

172
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:35,220
only let him out at night sometimes when everybody's asleep so

173
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:40,679
maybe like okay you're there but not only when the conditions are right I'm

174
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:46,440
going to be with this and then at the end

175
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:52,400
maybe the sense of connection and conversation even

176
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:58,320
he ends with it's nice enough to make a man weep but I don't weep

177
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:04,740
do you so all of a sudden there's this connection to somebody else before there's this real isolation and then

178
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:08,240
there's this openness

179
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:16,200
so this poem is called bluebird by Charles Bukowski

180
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:22,860
it's a it's a powerful poem I left out a few as stanzas there in the middle but

181
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:30,419
this um way in which you know we meet our emotional life and as we meet it

182
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:35,820
things start to shift towards more opening more acceptance more being in

183
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:40,639
dialogue with ourselves and with others

184
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:48,299
and we do this by and we find greater Freedom by bringing awareness to all

185
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:54,179
aspects of our experience It's Perfectly Natural that as I was

186
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:59,760
mentioning earlier that there's these parts that we don't really want to be aware of and we're just wishing they

187
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:06,780
would go away but with this practice is about

188
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:15,720
meeting all of it including some things that we might consider distractions sounds that the

189
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:22,320
neighbor's dog that keeps on barking or whatever it might be whatever the sounds

190
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,559
might be we just fold them in like this too we can be mindful of that we can be mindful

191
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:34,020
of a dog barking and then be mindful of the

192
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:42,660
annoyance and then be mindful maybe there's even a a sense of our self like don't our

193
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,880
neighbors know that I'm trying to meditate here and why do they have a dog they should let the dog do whatever or

194
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:54,299
something and in ways that we kind of like create this strong sense of self when our

195
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:59,460
preferences aren't getting met and maybe to just be mindful of that oh yeah

196
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:05,460
here's uh the experience of Me versus the world

197
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,559
and the uncomfortableness of that

198
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:18,860
so this idea of you know we can bring mindfulness to everything

199
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:27,480
and as we do we start to find more and more freedom there's things that we don't have to avoid so much we know that

200
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:34,020
we can practice with them and in some ways I kind of like this poem because it doesn't have a neat and

201
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:41,159
tidy and they lived happily ever after and rainbows and unicorns and hearts and all that kind of stuff

202
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:46,679
because I kind of wanted to show that this is you know this is a person

203
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:51,500
expressing some time in his life

204
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:57,000
and sometimes our life isn't filled with hearts and unicorns and rainbows and

205
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:04,440
this kind of things it has difficulties of course it does

206
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,600
and so we start Where We Are this practice isn't asking us to be

207
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,659
somebody else it's not asking us to pretend things are different

208
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:21,840
we start where we are and sometimes where we are there's a lot of difficulties

209
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:28,260
suffering sometimes not too sometimes we feel like we have a little

210
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:35,220
bit more ease in our life in particular I'd like to talk just a

211
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:40,760
little bit about mindfulness of emotions

212
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:50,100
this idea that if we're being mindful of like our inner life and emotions here I

213
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:57,179
don't know what the blue bird in the heart wants out but right we can think of all kinds of things in there

214
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:02,460
I appreciate this poet pointing to that but mindfulness of

215
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:09,480
emotions is a way in which by if we're just able to be with them recognize them have

216
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:15,860
awareness of them without insisting that they be different without trying to shove them away

217
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:22,320
we can allow these emotions to flow through us to arise

218
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:28,140
and pass away I think I think I heard this from Gil

219
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:35,820
Gil franstal e motion like this idea that they there's a movement motion

220
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:43,200
and that if we don't get all tangled up with them that they will move through

221
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:50,659
and part of mindfulness practice is discovering how we are Tangled Up and how we get tangled up and how might we

222
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:55,980
disentangle ourselves I just want to say a little bit about

223
00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:02,820
emotions and then I'll talk a little bit about how we can be mindful of them there's a lot to be said here so I'm

224
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:11,159
just going to touch the surface here maybe I'll do some more talks on this

225
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:20,100
but one way to think about it emotions is that they're a form of communication from ourselves to ourselves

226
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:27,299
some kind of way like oh I'm feeling angry well then there's maybe a

227
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:33,120
way we feel like a boundaries been crossed or we're seeing some injustice

228
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:40,620
something that feels like this this shouldn't be happening maybe we feel sad maybe there's been

229
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:47,100
some loss and It's Perfectly Natural that we have some sadness or maybe there's a loss of something that we're

230
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:53,820
not even quite clear that we're mourning something that we don't even have some quite clarity about

231
00:24:53,820 --> 00:25:00,299
but it's a communication from ourselves to ourselves but we can

232
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:08,700
only really kind of like learn what this communication is trying to tell us if we allow that emotion to exist

233
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:15,000
instead of trying to shove it down or extract ourselves

234
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,280
or if you don't try to immediately push it away in whatever way

235
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:26,640
it's the habit I think for most humans and these days right there's Industries

236
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,340
billions of dollars are getting spent to make it easy as possible for you to

237
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:37,100
distract yourself and to avoid your inner life

238
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,940
so there are forms of communication and I'll say that they are also Composites

239
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:51,000
Composites have both physical Sensations as well as mental Sensations because we

240
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,640
can kind of like divide our experience into those two ways physical and mental

241
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,679
there's different ways we could talk about emotions this is one way I'm doing it now

242
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,779
physical fear in the god in the gut anger is

243
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:13,980
hotness sadness sometimes feels like really heavy and maybe like pressure behind the

244
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:21,299
eyes so there's a bodily experience that goes with emotions and sometimes we're not so

245
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:27,000
aware of them or connected to them but they're there but generally and most

246
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:34,159
often they're like in the trunk or in the face or some something like this not always but

247
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:40,140
and then there's these thoughts these uh mental events that go with them stories

248
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:46,980
of who did what to whom and the next time that happens I'm going to make sure they did this or maybe we're rehashing a

249
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:52,919
conversation and thinking that trying to make it go differently you know something that already happened and

250
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:59,159
we're trying to make it go differently or maybe we have this sense of trying to

251
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:05,100
make things or a story about how things should be

252
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:13,919
and how we're going to make it be that way and maybe in this poem that poet says I'm not going to let anyone see you

253
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:21,600
you know right I'm going to control it that nobody can see and these things shouldn't be seen this type

254
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:27,840
of an idea and sometimes it's hard to maybe understand exactly like what's a thought

255
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,779
what's an emotion so we we don't have to get too tangled up in that I'd like to

256
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:41,419
kind of simplify and say there's a bodily aspect and a mental aspect to our emotional life

257
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:49,620
and maybe I'll start with this uh little this quote which I think

258
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:56,820
is a kind of a playful way to think about this this uh some time ago there was this article in the New York Times

259
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:01,919
about uh mindfulness being taught in schools

260
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:07,620
And the reporter asked this young kid who had was participating in a

261
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:13,320
mindfulness program and as this little kid to describe it mindfulness

262
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:19,440
and here's the kid's response mindfulness is not hitting someone in

263
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,980
the mouth and I kind of appreciate this right you

264
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:31,140
know this recognition you know what this kid is pointing to probably is like oh

265
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:36,179
yeah okay here's anger here and I don't have to act out on it you know some

266
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:45,059
awareness of this so and I'm imagining this is like a way to be with difficult emotions instead of lashing out

267
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:51,179
so how do we work with difficult emotions

268
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:58,940
there's a few few ways I'll just give some highlights here

269
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:05,580
one is can be really helpful is notice that there's a mixture of things

270
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:15,659
happening at that moment maybe there's this heat of anger

271
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:21,600
and there's this perfectly neutral sensation of your feet on the ground

272
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:29,100
and there's a perfectly neutral sensation of the furnace going or the refrigerator

273
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:35,220
humming or something like this and maybe you feel hungry

274
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:41,159
and you're noticing that the person is

275
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:47,100
wearing a particular type of shirt or something like this so just to kind of

276
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:52,740
like open up the experience sometimes we like collapse into the emotion the anger

277
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:58,020
or whatever it is it's not always easy to do but to open up the experience and

278
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:06,779
notice anything else really and often the easiest is feeling that

279
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:12,240
the pressure on the feet touching the ground and there's something in particular

280
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:18,480
about that that can kind of help us feel grounded and settled and the awareness might go to the feet

281
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:25,380
and then go back to the anger and then we can go to the feet and then go back to the anger and then go back to the feet but there's something about coming

282
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:33,179
back to the feet that interrupts the momentum of the anger getting bigger and bigger and bigger and right we have all

283
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:39,779
noticed this and there's something that you know we might think about that the amount of

284
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:45,240
harm we can cause our relationships

285
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:51,779
if we're angry for a full day as opposed to if we're just angry for a

286
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:59,100
couple of hours right we might not send that email we might not make that phone call if

287
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:05,279
we're you know the anger it's still there but just isn't for the same duration so this one thing we can do

288
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:11,100
just notice there is mixture so we could ask ourselves what else is here anger is

289
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:17,940
here sadness is here this terrible sadness what else is here and allow the

290
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,980
attention to rest on something neutral or Pleasant

291
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:29,419
if there's something pleasant maybe you're wearing some soft clothing

292
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:36,779
maybe you're sitting in a comfy chair so something like that that's one thing to do with difficult emotions or strong

293
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:41,360
emotions maybe I should use that word strong emotions

294
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:50,840
and then can we transform this emotion from this abstract concept sadness anger

295
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:57,120
love whatever emotion it might be anxiety

296
00:31:57,299 --> 00:32:04,620
transform it from this abstract concept into something that's a little bit more tangible

297
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:10,200
and this is where being aware of the bodily experience of emotions can really

298
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:16,679
help oh I'm afraid and I have this knot in my

299
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:21,919
stomach and this notch

300
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:27,240
feels like it's in this region and it's

301
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:33,720
seems like it's a little bit Dynamic it's moving around it's not it has maybe

302
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:40,080
a little bit of a throbbing quality so this way of kind of like bringing the awareness to a bodily experience

303
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:47,399
something tangible that's happening in this moment is another way we can interrupt the momentum of whatever the

304
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:52,740
emotion is we're not trying to get rid of the emotion we're not trying to shame

305
00:32:52,740 --> 00:33:00,299
ourselves or anything like this we're just trying to not dip into overwhelm where we lose all our wisdom

306
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:08,539
so to notice the bodily experience the bodily part of the emotion

307
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,820
and if we are finding that we're just really stuck in this emotion

308
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:20,220
for a for a long time and maybe that the power of it or the intensity of it is

309
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:25,620
waxing and waning but we find that we're really um

310
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:32,039
yeah that's where it has a recurring feeling to it or this

311
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:37,460
going over and over and over again maybe we can just drop in the question

312
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:43,200
that's a gentle inquiry not that we have to find the answer we don't have to

313
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,600
figure it out the power here is in asking the question the power is not and

314
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:53,640
getting the answer and the question is

315
00:33:53,640 --> 00:34:00,360
there something underneath this that is fueling this anger

316
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:05,360
or or whatever the emotion is what is underneath this

317
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:11,040
and as I said we don't have to do this archaeological interior dig to figure it

318
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:18,179
out it's more just being open to whatever is

319
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:23,638
fueling it because there is something that's feeling it otherwise the emotion would just arise you'd be mindful of it

320
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:29,339
and it would pass away right all the neurologists and physiologists and

321
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:36,300
mindfulness teacher said notice this right that things arise and pass away but if it has this way in which it's

322
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:42,118
just there for a long time then there's something that's fueling it

323
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:49,618
and just having this kind of curiosity about what are the what is underneath

324
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:57,900
this having that Curiosity bringing this kind of investigation and this openness that

325
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:04,980
itself is a way which might create that creates the conditions and when some new understanding might arise and that might

326
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:10,140
help with a new relationship to it or or a new understanding or something like

327
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:15,660
that so many of the times we practice

328
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:23,640
mindfulness and to have some reduce stress or reduce anxiety or to

329
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:28,980
change some of our habits or maybe to gain some better understanding and I'd

330
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:36,119
like to maybe offer just this language of some more freedom and part of the way to have more freedom

331
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:42,300
is to recognize where do we not have freedom where are we I I'm using this expression getting pushed around but

332
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:49,200
this way in which we're trying to navigate Our Lives spending so much energy trying to avoid this and only

333
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,420
have that and if of course we do right of course humans do this and we need to

334
00:35:54,420 --> 00:36:03,240
do this it's wise to do this but there's a way in which it can also feel exhausting and oppressive so can we

335
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:09,559
have some discernment about what's helpful to

336
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:18,000
what's helpful to avoid and what's maybe we don't need to avoid

337
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,420
what's helpful to support greater freedom and what is like

338
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:30,619
maybe some tanglements or something that's uh are not allowing for greater freedom

339
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:37,980
and part of that what maybe being with emotions is

340
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:44,160
something that can support this freedom as well as reducing stress and greater

341
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,280
awareness and changing our behaviors

342
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:56,220
so I think I'll stop there and open it up to see if there's some questions or

343
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,000
comments

344
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:20,880
maybe I'll say well Jim is walking the my friend it's not uncommon for uh maybe

345
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:27,720
people later when they hear it to say what was the name of that poem again I'll just say it's Bluebird by Charles

346
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:33,000
Bukowski um thanks for sharing um

347
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:39,780
how do you when you're getting curious about what's underneath an emotion that's arising how do you sort of draw

348
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:45,660
the distinction between unhealthy or like ruminating digging

349
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:52,460
into it versus it's helpful and curious um

350
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:58,800
because you could just feel the emotion and and that would be it and try not to put a narrative to it but

351
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,079
how do you kind of go through that process yeah I think this is a a great

352
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:09,599
question and I think part of the answer is uh and how you described it if you

353
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:16,440
find that there's a lot of ruminating and going going around and around and around and around we could sometimes it

354
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:23,700
can be as simple as to ask ourselves is this helpful I thought this thought you know 500

355
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:28,740
bazillion quadrillion times I don't this isn't so helpful so that sometimes it

356
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:35,240
could be just you know having that question um

357
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:41,160
and so maybe I'm do you want to is that how was that answer was that like oh

358
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:48,180
okay but no that's not yeah so yeah so definitely the rumination when you're cycling right so I like that question is

359
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:51,020
it helpful but

360
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:59,280
sometimes the asking the question and like the creating the narrative around it is

361
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,380
the unhelpful part of it of the emotion right you're investigating it you create

362
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:11,220
a story that's not helpful I see thank you around the emotion how do you know whether it's like oh I'm out I'm trying to understand what's

363
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:16,400
you know your mind can spin like well maybe it's this but then from that and like

364
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,660
helpful analyzing versus just the emotion is what it is and not

365
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:27,060
trying to put a narrative or understanding yeah so when you're asking the question

366
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:33,119
you're using the word analyzing and I'm I'm you know kind of like shy a little bit

367
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,400
shy that word of analyzing I'm just saying a gentle inquiry is

368
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:46,800
there something underneath that's fueling this so less about figuring it out and analyzing and I I I appreciate

369
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:52,859
what you're pointing to that sometimes we can create a narrative a whole story that um I'm having this emotion because

370
00:39:52,859 --> 00:39:59,820
I'm a person who acts or because of this or that and then we get all tangled up with that story and that's isn't so

371
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,180
helpful

372
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:12,660
maybe if we find ourselves stuck in that we can do these other things we can feel

373
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:19,859
our feet on the ground feeling into the body these types of things to kind of help interrupt the

374
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:25,099
momentum of those things thank you

375
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:30,078
I may also have a question yes for you

376
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:42,540
good evening Diana thank you um I have a question regarding the

377
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:48,480
like the mindfulness aspect like I know I'm very grateful for

378
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:55,440
this practice because I I am gaining more awareness of my emotions and what's

379
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:03,359
overwhelming me I just feel like sometimes am I am I just being passive about it

380
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:10,200
like okay I know the dog is barking and I'm gonna ignore it because it I

381
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:15,960
don't want to make a big deal out of it but in in doing so I feel frustrated or

382
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:21,480
I feel like it's still bothering me or I mean the dog barking is figurative for

383
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:27,300
yeah live but I I just sometimes feel like it's not

384
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:34,980
where like I this practice is very has been very life-changing for me I

385
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:41,700
just with all of this the presence of where I'm like where I'm

386
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:46,920
at and how I'm feeling and just sitting with all the things that I'm I think I'm

387
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:53,700
aware of or maybe I'm just they're just so much more illuminated I just don't

388
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:59,339
know if it's like how to be okay with it yeah

389
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:06,119
right yeah this is a great costume so maybe I'll say a few things

390
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:13,920
I'll just well I'm just gonna go with this dog barking uh sure we can try to create the perfect

391
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:20,599
environment and uh which we feel comfortable all the time

392
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:25,859
I kind of feel like how's that that project hasn't worked for me

393
00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:31,140
trying to make everything just be right so something like the dog barking is a

394
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:37,980
place where we can practice like okay here's annoyance and this is what annoyance feels like frustration

395
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:45,060
this is what frustration feels like anger because there will be times in your life where you cannot control it

396
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:51,180
and it will be really hard we're all going to get sick

397
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:58,619
people that we love are going to get sick and we won't be able to change it but if we are practicing for other

398
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:04,319
things in the simpler things like the dog barking sure you could pick up the phone and go to the neighbor's house or

399
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:12,599
I don't know all these types of things but it also could be a place to practice and so that because there will be plenty

400
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:19,500
of things in our lives that are really difficult that we can't change so like there's just nothing we can do

401
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:25,020
there's lots of stuff about that so that's maybe no like thank you so much

402
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,560
thank you
