1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,160
so

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,920
welcome everyone

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,840
i feel delighted sitting here and being able to be in this kind of way

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,119
with you all and seeing the greetings certainly is a

5
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:40,640
happiness producing uh beginning of our time together and um

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,719
and also delighted to be able to share a practice with you and teachings with you that have been so

7
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:55,520
meaningful for me and and bring me brought me much happiness and and satisfaction

8
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,840
so thank you

9
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:08,240
one of the one of the things that brings much

10
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:16,640
benefit and even a joy in this mindfulness practice is

11
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:24,880
beginning to value how much we have better things to do

12
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:33,360
with our life than just letting our mind wander off in its usual habits

13
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:40,799
now some of you might have very wholesome and beneficial and habits of mind and

14
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:48,479
you all you ever think about is how to do wonderfully virtuous and

15
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:55,040
activities and things and for the world and you just your uh

16
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,600
your whole very thought strain my thought streams and mind streams and

17
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,520
heart streams are simply a paradigm of

18
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,239
joy and happiness and benefit for the whole world or maybe even part of it is that

19
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:20,000
frequently but i think it's a little bit

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,360
embarrassing to say it mildly for some for many people when they begin meditating

21
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,920
to discover what their mind is up to and uh and how often the mind stream is

22
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,959
actually not that beneficial and even if it's just neutral it's not really

23
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:43,920
nourishing and enhancing our life and and to learn slowly through

24
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,120
mindfulness that maybe we in fact do have better things to do

25
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,720
than the usual habits of mind and what the directions were going

26
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,519
and now one of those things is to be present here for direct experience

27
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,720
to really be attuned to be aligned to what is actually happening in the

28
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,680
flow of present moment experience and um and to have that be clear

29
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:21,360
a clear recognition a clear up this is what's going on where the clarity of knowing the clarity

30
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,640
of mindfulness or the the the groundedness of the attention

31
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:33,519
is the alternative to just letting the mind stream flow and and do go along the regular

32
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,959
highways and byways of its habits and and um

33
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,040
and uh not in opposition to what the habits of the mind are

34
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:52,000
but rather um you know a uh just an alternative

35
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,040
resting place an alternative place to where we feel grounded this is where life our life flows from

36
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,360
doesn't flow from the habits and of the mind unwholesome tendencies of the mind but

37
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,280
it flows from a place that's deeper or fuller or an alternative

38
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:18,400
and one of those things is to clearly be aware to clearly be present to know what's

39
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:25,280
happening in the present moment as it's happening and it's not so much as a you know

40
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:32,320
a a full throttle doing like okay now i have to really get

41
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:41,120
busy but it's a kind of a knowing and clear comprehension that we learn that is um

42
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,440
alternative to the stressful ways in which the mind operates that it is kind of brings with it a kind

43
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:55,520
of clarity and a calmness and a and a spaciousness that becomes more and more

44
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,720
a place of in comparison to the usual flow of

45
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,199
mind for many of us a place of rest but as that place of rest becomes fuller

46
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,440
to say its rest is not really accurate anymore it becomes neither restful nor

47
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:20,160
stressful it's neither it feels really not so much like a doing but not so much

48
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,199
like a letting go of doing or a non-doing either

49
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,880
it's life this the wonderful flow of present moment life that we're here for and

50
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,880
experiencing in a way that uh feels valuable

51
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:44,400
that feels purposeful that feels nourishing that feels

52
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:52,800
clear and and and so just a valuable way of being

53
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,280
and a better alternative than the usual flow of everyday thoughts and ideas and

54
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,680
preoccupations that some of us might have

55
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:12,319
um and um so here we are

56
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,600
to sit and um

57
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:26,240
and um maybe begin to appreciate more than we

58
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:33,199
have each time we've sit down to appreciate this wonderful possibility of being

59
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:39,199
present and mindful so we begin with our body

60
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:46,840
and the body's posture and to be clearly comprehen

61
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,919
comprehending the posture you're in some people

62
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:58,800
meditate sitting in a cross-legged sitting posture some in a chair

63
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,800
some on a bench some people meditate standing

64
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:11,759
some people meditate walking in the ancient tradition of

65
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:19,120
walking meditation and some people practice this mindfulness lying down

66
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:25,919
each posture is called sometimes a dignified posture

67
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,759
so is there some way in whatever posture you're in that you can maybe make some slight

68
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:38,319
adjustments either physically or maybe mentally from the inside out

69
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,440
that you are sitting here with a kind of dignity

70
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,080
a kind of sense of personal

71
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:59,840
respect and value a worthiness

72
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,080
and maybe it's being a little bit

73
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,800
more upright than usual or a little bit more open chested than normal

74
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,800
and gently closing your eyes

75
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:30,800
and then with clear comprehension as if you really know what you're doing

76
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:38,080
and appreciate what you're doing and there to kind of feel do it and feel it

77
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:45,279
as if it's nourishing for you nurturing for you

78
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:52,480
to gently take actively take a few long

79
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,839
slow deep breaths

80
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:05,600
taking your time to really savor or recognize

81
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,600
this is a deep in breath

82
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:23,440
and this is an extended exhale

83
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,360
and there might be other thoughts and concerns that you have that keep pulling you away

84
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,360
but maybe there can be a recognition that some of the things you're preoccupied with

85
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:43,040
maybe is not really to the point right now or even so useful

86
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,600
and they may be a good alternative is to establish this intimate

87
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,440
connection here with yourself with your body

88
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:05,519
with your lived experience

89
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,800
and then consciously

90
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:17,519
as another activity to be mindful of let your breathing slowly return

91
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:27,200
to a normal breath a normal way of breathing

92
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,760
without too concerned with what normal really means just whatsoever seems something that's

93
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:46,320
easier and at ease with breathing and then

94
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,160
again with a sense of a little bit little bit gentle sense of

95
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:59,120
purpose and clarity of what you're doing and

96
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:05,600
and to do it maybe in a way that just feels calming or nourishing

97
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:15,839
as you exhale relax soften the muscles of your face

98
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:29,120
relax and soften

99
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,680
around the eyes the temple

100
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,839
the forehead

101
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,360
and just gently softly

102
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,519
but consciously do the same for your shoulders

103
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:11,839
as you exhale relax your shoulders

104
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:20,399
and even if you can't relax them a softening around them

105
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:28,000
and if you can't soften them maybe it's simply an appreciation

106
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:39,839
of having shoulders being with them

107
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,360
and a softening of your belly

108
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:57,760
relaxing and if they are already bellies already relaxed

109
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:05,680
or if it can't relax maybe just appreciating the opportunity

110
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:11,120
to clearly feel and sense this belly of

111
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,519
ours

112
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:27,279
and then being aware of belly in a way that is gentle and

113
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:34,079
generous or appreciative of the opportunity to be present

114
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:40,240
mindful of something that's an important part of who you are

115
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:46,959
your belly and in being mindful this way maybe

116
00:13:46,959 --> 00:14:02,720
that's a good alternative to the habits of mine you usually are in

117
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:11,519
and then in a relaxed calm way with a little gentle sense of purpose

118
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:19,440
appreciation to just settle in

119
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:28,560
to experience the rhythm of breathing in and breathing

120
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,839
out

121
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,000
breathing in and breathing out

122
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:06,240
clearly calmly knowing this is an inhale

123
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,839
this is an exhale

124
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,079
where the mindfulness the awareness the knowing

125
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:28,880
maybe you can feel it as a healthy alternative

126
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:41,839
to the thought streams you might get pulled into

127
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:55,839
that is gentle relaxed but dedicated awareness to breathing

128
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:03,839
allows a settling a calming intimacy

129
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:12,480
then maybe being involved in your thought streams

130
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:23,839
doesn't provide

131
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,720
trusting the experience of breathing

132
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,199
and when you're exhaling when it feels useful

133
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,959
quiet the thinking mind

134
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,839
so there's more room to experience breathing more

135
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:19,840
might it be that mindfulness of breathing is the better alternative

136
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,840
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

137
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:36,240
to turn your attention now outward to consider and think about

138
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,440
the people in your life whatever comes to mind

139
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,519
whoever comes to mind as you do so

140
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:56,880
people you know people you don't know people who are challenging people who are

141
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:02,080
that you care for

142
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:10,158
people who are close by people far away

143
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:18,480
and then consciously purposefully in a way that

144
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:25,440
feels nourishing or supportive for you and

145
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,840
see if you can have thoughts of goodwill for them

146
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,720
well-wishing

147
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:48,720
that may be a better alternative to some of the ways in which you might think about other people

148
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:56,000
or think about the mind involved in the mind stream of thoughts about others

149
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:05,279
perhaps you can have some gentle relaxed thoughts of how wonderful would be if others were

150
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:15,120
happy peaceful safe

151
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,559
and may it be that

152
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:28,559
this practice that we do today extends itself out into the world that we live a

153
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,640
relaxed but purposeful life

154
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:43,840
and purposeful and nourishing life where we benefit self and others

155
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:54,320
we contribute to a better world for ourselves and others may all beings

156
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:00,320
be happy may all beings

157
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:10,720
be safe and peaceful may all beings be free

158
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:18,559
and we come may we come to the time we can really share such a world together happy

159
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:25,760
safe peaceful and free

160
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,269
[Music]

161
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:42,930
[Music]

162
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,480
thank you all

163
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:56,240
so i continue today with some of the teachings from the

164
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:04,399
foundational mindfulness teachings of the buddha from the discourse and the four foundations of mindfulness

165
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:11,040
it begins with a very strong emphasis on mindfulness of the body and we know that from other teachings of

166
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,960
the buddha that it seems pretty foundational to him the practice of being connected and

167
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,280
aware of the body and in fact

168
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:30,320
there are strong statements he makes about there is no experience of awakening without

169
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,839
mindfulness of the body

170
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:49,679
so this like to read the next exercise that in this

171
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:56,800
discourse on mindfulness of the body and it goes like this and approximately

172
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:03,839
like this i paraphrase lightly um

173
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,960
instead of monastics like i'll translate render it as practitioners

174
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:19,760
a practitioner is one who acts in clear comprehension when

175
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,960
moving forward going forward and returning

176
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:31,280
who acts with clear comprehension when looking ahead and looking

177
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,320
away who acts with clear comprehension

178
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:44,640
when flexing and extending one's limbs who acts in clear comprehension

179
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:52,400
when we're in close and carrying one's outer robe and bowl

180
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:59,839
carrying one's plates and dishes and whatever one needs

181
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:06,078
who acts in clear comprehension when eating drinking

182
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,200
consuming food and tasting who acts in clear comprehension when

183
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:20,560
defecating and urinating who acts in full in clear comprehension when walking

184
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:29,920
standing sitting falling asleep waking up talking and keeping silent

185
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:39,040
so here there's many of the ordinary activities of daily life looking looking one way or the other

186
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:45,119
there is uh walking sitting there is moving our limbs and legs and

187
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:51,440
feet lifting and stretching and whatever way what they're doing with our

188
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,960
arms we clearly comprehend what we're doing like i'm lifting my hand now to make the point

189
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,720
and clearly comprehending that my hand goes up and i'm making my point

190
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:09,520
with an italian gesture that i learned growing up in italy the fingers coming together

191
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:16,800
and the and when going to the bathroom and

192
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:22,960
clearly comprehends one is present and there for it and this uh clear comprehension is a

193
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,640
very important term it means it's uh the word is some pagana

194
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:36,000
uh some people translate in different ways but i like clear comprehension that the

195
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:43,760
the root of the verb is to know or comprehend and and there's a kind of

196
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,280
emphatic prefix to really know so i like the word clear the clear

197
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,880
comprehension and rather than clear knowing because knowing

198
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,960
maybe implies little bit something more simple whereas comprehension is richer in

199
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,760
meaning and in fact the commentaries uh suggest that uh clear comprehend clear this clear

200
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,680
comprehension means to um clearly understand the purpose

201
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:20,480
of why what you're doing something so it's a purposeful life to clearly comprehend

202
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,760
the suitability of what we're doing the appropriateness the timeliness of what we're doing that we're

203
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,800
living a purposeful in life that is suitable for the circumstances

204
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:38,160
so we're living appropriately this kind of appropriate response to the situations but doing it with some sense

205
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:45,680
of purpose not casually not barreling ahead and habits of mind but having a sense of

206
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:51,680
what is valuable to do where and how to do it that it also means to be um to

207
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:58,320
understand the pasture of what we're doing the pasture means where we get our nourishment where we

208
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,839
get our nourishment from as we are present for things and that's explained

209
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:11,359
being present with mindfulness in our direct experience of body feelings mind and dharmas the four

210
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:17,040
foundations of mindfulness and there's so many different places our

211
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,240
minds can be and we know the mind stream that we live in can be

212
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:28,400
often take us away in distractions and fantasy get us swept up in irritation

213
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:35,920
complaining criticalness fear anxiety ruminations of all kinds think lost in

214
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:42,079
the past planning and anticipating the future and some of that mindstream is wonderful

215
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:48,320
and appropriate to do and part of the pleasure of life but oftentimes it can be not really so

216
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:55,520
nourishing and supportive for us and so to live a purposeful life a life that's

217
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:02,400
appropriate for the circumstance and one that we feel like this is beneficial this is nourishing

218
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:09,839
supportive for me and for others to be present and clearly aware of what we're doing as

219
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:15,920
we're doing it is beneficial for the world because when we don't have that clear comprehension

220
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:22,400
that's when the old habits some of the unhealthy motivations and purposes we have

221
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:29,760
can can uh be um um you know take over and sometimes we

222
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:36,560
say what we regret we do if we later feel sorry we did um and we feel maybe we act in ways that

223
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:42,960
are stressful through the day and we get tired and exhausted in the day by the stress of what we're doing

224
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,880
so what's i think wonderful about this instructions on clear comprehension

225
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:55,359
effect sometimes called clear comprehension of activities all the simple ordinary activities for their

226
00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:00,480
daily life that all of us are doing all the time

227
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:07,040
is to um is that it takes the mindfulness

228
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:13,280
practice of the cushion of meditation it's not only about meditating

229
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:20,079
uh there's a there's a non-separation there's a holistic quality to how

230
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:27,920
mindfulness is practiced that it's really involves our whole life all the activities that we do

231
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:34,480
and uh and then it's in all the activities of life and in meditation that there's the

232
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:42,079
growth and growing of mindfulness growing or practice and over time we learn more and more how

233
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:50,240
this practice can be nourishing and supportive moment by moment the way that being mindful being aware

234
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:55,520
just feels better than the alternative of the mind streams getting involved in

235
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:01,040
reactivity and that it feels healthy and

236
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:07,520
satisfying to be way of being here and present and in order to have that satisfaction

237
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,720
it really helps that we know how to be grounded in the body

238
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:19,920
and so the awareness can flow through the body and be aware in a way that's not colored

239
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:27,760
influenced by the stressful way of thinking the the unhelpful ways of thinking and the

240
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:33,680
unhelpful attitudes we have we learn healthy attitudes we learn supportive ways

241
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:39,520
of thinking and being in the world not in a way that's denying everything and

242
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:45,760
putting up blinders but actually it's the opposite it's the ability to be present

243
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:51,359
with an open way to it all the more we can ground ourselves in the clear comprehension

244
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:56,800
the more we really appreciate the opportunity to be aware of all the different things

245
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:03,359
that are going on including what's difficult including what's difficult about ourselves

246
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:09,040
including what's challenging in the world and we do it grounded and settled and open in a clear

247
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:14,160
way and so this is a training a practice to do this

248
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:20,640
and so for some of us as we learn begin learning this and meditation and then the great thing is to be able

249
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:25,760
to take what we're learning here and begin applying it in the

250
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:31,200
ordinariness of our daily life and having these ordinary activities of

251
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:37,920
daily life not be done unconsciously or an automatic pilot but be the training ground the supportive

252
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:44,240
ground for living a spiritual life to use language maybe that i don't use a

253
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:50,560
lot but to do it maybe in the wonderful in a way that's

254
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:57,760
evocative or captivating for you or gets your attention to live a life that's um in all the

255
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:03,839
little details of everyday life is sacred and so

256
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:10,400
to see to experience to the sacred

257
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:16,720
in going forward and returning

258
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:25,280
participating in a sacred way with looking ahead and looking away to experience the

259
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:30,880
sacred in bending and extending one's limbs

260
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:38,319
to really feel the sacrament of putting on clothes wearing them

261
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:45,200
carrying things that we carry with our hands to feel the sacredness of

262
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:52,880

tasting to discover the sacredness of all the different aspects of our life as

264
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:06,000
we live it that moves through us this way in which the lifestream for evolutionary times

265
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:12,560
come down through us and created all the different ways that we have to be we have to live in order

266
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:18,240
to sustain our life including defecating and urinating

267
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:26,880
and to feel the sacredness the specialist the nourishment of walking standing sitting falling asleep

268
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:34,000
waking up talking and keeping silent all of them

269
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,040
all these ordinary activities that all of us are involved in every day

270
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:46,480
much of the day that here is where we discover this valuable

271
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:51,599
stream of life activity that is maybe better

272
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:59,040
than some of the alternatives of the mental mindstreams streams of attitudes and and

273
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:04,880
preoccupations that is so too so easy to fall into
