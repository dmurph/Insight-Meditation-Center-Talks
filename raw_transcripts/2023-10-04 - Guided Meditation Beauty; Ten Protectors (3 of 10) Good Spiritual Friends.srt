1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:06,759
so hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:15,360
and I feel at the moment quite fortunate that we get to sit here in meditation I

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,600
get to somehow talk about meditation a little bit and this guidance I'll

4
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:28,000
offer it's as I give this uh morning guidances I'm also guiding

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,960
myself uh kind of to in doing the guidance these

6
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,480
guided meditations is kind of opportunity for me to drop in within to

7
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:46,360
my connection to meditation my inner life an in inner life that has become

8
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,920
much richer uh uh through meditation

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,359
practice so the topic I want to introduce today is um well with first

10
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:06,400
the introduction and then the topic um it's uh sometimes known that

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:13,119
ethics in Buddhism is not meant to be a set of rules that we are obligated to

12
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:22,320
adhere to they are uh trainings they are trainings that we engage in they are

13
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:30,040
trainings we engage in for our own benefit and they are gifts that we give to the World gift of safety and

14
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,159
trainings in for ourselves to tap into and support and discover something

15
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:43,240
really valuable within so that our ethical behavior is not a commandment but is

16
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:49,159
something that is inspired by the our inner state of heart our inner State of

17
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:55,520
Mind our quality of our inner being and uh and so there's a word in

18
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,960
poly that means U both beautiful some one dictionary also provides the

19
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,800
word Charming or auspicious but it also has a meaning of

20
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,120
uh virtue or uh having uh uh yes having

21
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:23,599
an uh has an ethical quality and someone who has this kalana this beauty is also

22
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:29,959
someone who has ethical um an ethical virtue or ethical

23
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:36,640
position on the inside and to connect Beauty and ethics is I think quite uh

24
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:45,599
profound um that uh it's our inner beauty that we discover that we cultivate that we

25
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,879
evoke that is the source of living an ethical

26
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:57,080
life so inner beauty what is

27
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,120
it so to begin with the assuming a

28
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,640
posture and meditation posture is a posture that

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,400
allows or begins a process of connecting

30
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:22,560
to our inner life to assume a posture that allows

31
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:31,680
there to be some degree small degree maybe of confidence

32
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,080
manifested through the

33
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:44,640
body that provides a posture that provides some

34
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:52,030
stability where our weight [Music]

35
00:03:53,480 --> 00:04:02,719
our is against the uh firmly against but whatever body firmly against

36
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:10,640
some something that supports it the floor chair

37
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:20,600
bed and a posture that maybe begins to provide us with some inner

38
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:28,600
stability a place that's stable maybe that's deeper or lower in our

39
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,639
torso than where there might be anxiety

40
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,960
or

41
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,720
agitation and lowering the

42
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
Gaze

43
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,280
gently closing the

44
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:20,080
eyes and then in a way that is in harmony

45
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:28,479
with something gentle or beautiful

46
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,280
Within take some little deeper

47
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,759
breaths smooth

48
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,840
slow not so deep that it's a

49
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:50,520
challenge but deep enough to feel your torso more

50
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:02,919
fully and a little longer exhale so the longer period of

51
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:10,680
exhaling gives it bigger chance longer chance to let go settle

52
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:20,319
in let the weight of your body settle into whatever supports

53
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
it

54
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
for

55
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,800
letting your breathing return to normal and with a normal

56
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:24,319
breath moving through your body and on the exhale seeing if there's places of

57
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,960
softening relaxing the muscles around the eyes

58
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:35,280
the face the shoulders or the

59
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
belly

60
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
for

61
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:40,518
and then as you exhale maybe you can

62
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:44,959
also relax your thinking

63
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,360
mind soften

64
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:01,200
it let there be a quieting of your thinking

65
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:06,360
and as a thinking mind

66
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:17,839
relaxes allow yourself to settle into your body

67
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
breathing

68
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
for

69
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
for

70
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
for

71
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
for

72
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:33,160
and then see if you can find a place within that you

73
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:40,279
associate with an inner goodness an

74
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:49,639
inner sense of ethical Integrity or

75
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,839
beauty maybe underneath any place of agitation

76
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
or

77
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:13,480
recrimination deep inside where do you associate where do

78
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:22,560
you feel or sense the source of goodness might

79
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,519
be and if there is such a

80
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,160
place breathe with

81
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:48,079
that as if your breathing moves through it like a gentle

82
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:56,160
wind or your breathing begins and

83
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,759
ends in that place

84
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
for

85
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
for

86
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
for

87
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
for

88
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
for

89
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
for

90
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
for

91
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
for

92
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
for

93
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
for

94
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
for

95
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
for

96
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
for

97
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
for

98
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
for

99
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
for

100
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
for

101
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
for

102
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880

for

107
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
for

108
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
for

109
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,520
for

110
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,519
e

111
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
for

112
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,399

for

114
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:56,320
and then coming to the end of this sitting to take a few moments to

115
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:04,720
see where inside do you associate with inner goodness maybe a place of

116
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:11,000
Love kindness a place

117
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,840
of where there's a desire Not to cause harm in this

118
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:25,919
world maybe a place of care for this

119
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
world

120
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:41,360
and if there is such a place maybe without feeling those things now but associated with

121
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:51,039
those to let their inner eye gaze upon the world the whole

122
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:59,720
world leaving no one out considering all all of

123
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:08,559
humanity our family may all

124
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:15,840
people have opportunities for great

125
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:23,159
happiness may all people have safety and how they live their lives and

126

people know peace wake up to a peaceful world

128
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:38,880
without conflict and

129
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:49,919
War may all people be free free of Oppression and poverty

130
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:55,960
and and free of inner turmoil

131
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:02,200
and attachments and

132
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:10,559
challenges may all beings be

133
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:20,760
happy and may we consider the small and the big ways that we can contribute to

134
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,080
that

135
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:40,919
thank

136
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,039
you

137
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,960
e

138
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:47,240
so so we come to the third talk on that 10 protectors the 10 supports or the 10

139
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:53,919
helpers depending on how we translate the word Nati the poly word and this is

140
00:33:53,919 --> 00:34:01,000
a teaching coming from the Buddha that appears in the numerical discourses it's on the in the

141
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:08,839
10th chapter it's the discourse number 17 and um what's provided is a list

142
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:14,158
without much discussion or any discussion about them

143
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,358
and um but it's a wonderful list and in other places these are discussed these

144
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:28,000
these qualities are discussed in different ways and uh and today the protect

145
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:35,800
is uh having good spiritual friends the so the first was our own

146
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:43,520
virtue the second yesterday was what was it yesterday um yeah sometimes my mind

147
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,839
doesn't work so fast sitting here and already kind of my mind going with the

148
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:57,400
next thing um but anyway today it's um loving kind it's uh kalana Mita

149
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:03,440
and uh the word kalayana can mean um beautiful that's usually the first

150
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:09,400
dictionary definition and but it also uh refers to

151
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:16,240
the kind of inner beauty from which uh virtue arises ethical Integrity arises

152
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,640
from which the disposition to be honest and truthful appears and so someone

153
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:27,520
who's a good spiritual friend Kalita is someone who is honest someone

154
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:33,200
who has a kind of a virtuous behavior and

155
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,720
life it's also meant to be it also refers to someone who is a spiritual

156
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:45,240
teacher uh the Buddha was considered to be the great Kalita someone who opens the door for a

157
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:50,359
spiritual life a life of on the path to Liberation someone who knows it and

158
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:57,160
supports to others in uh doing this and um and so the idea here is this they're

159
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:04,680
a kalana um they're also uh uh they possess a certain kind of inner beauty

160
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:12,359
and ethical beauty that uh is part of what they're pointing to as a possibility for for you for everyone

161
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:19,359
else and to have a few kalas to have a few of these good spiritual friends

162
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:26,000
these uh beautiful spiritual friend friendships is a great support for

163
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,680
ourselves it is and it's also a protection um the uh to have good

164
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,920
spiritual friends who you're a little bit accountable to uh means that when

165
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:42,800
you're about to do something that you don't quite feel good about you remember your good spiritual friends and would

166
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,760
you want to tell them about what you're doing um would you like would you like them to know about it and if the answer

167
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:56,000
is no then you probably be careful not to do it uh not that these good

168
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,520
spiritual friends are policing you and saying you know watching you and judging

169
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:09,839
you if you do something that is not quite coming from this beautiful ethical place within um but uh the teachings of

170
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:17,880
the Buddha there's he assumes that people have a natural desire uh to not do something that would

171
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:24,000
be disapproved of dis dis that there these good spiritual friends would

172
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,040
disapprove of uh that there would be a certain degree of of

173
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:36,200
um of kind of awkwardness or regret or

174
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:42,400
or um kind of self uh

175
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:49,520
self not feeling good about oneself uh if we're doing something that our good spiritual friends would disapprove

176
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:55,040
of um so some of this then is um finding

177
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:02,040
having good spiritual friends and having those that not only can be someone that we trust and someone we

178
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:08,319
think is wise but also someone maybe who could encourage um the practice and

179
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:15,240
bringing out the best qualities we have in the Buddhist teachings a good spiritual friend is someone who supports

180
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:22,119
us to develop the seven factors of Awakening these are some of the most beautiful qualities of heart that come

181
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:30,800
out of um you know deep Dharma practice uh the cultivation or the development of

182
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:37,599
of present moment awareness mindfulness uh investigation uh kind of a delightful

183
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:43,359
and wholesome effort and engagement in the practice uh Joy

184
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:48,680
Tranquility um somi and

185
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:54,400
equinity um the Buddha said that the that the um it's a beautiful teaching I

186
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,560
think of just as the sun just as the dawn is the

187
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:06,119
precursor uh to the Rising Sun so uh

188
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:14,240
externally the precursor or the what's uh the heralding forth are own

189
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:19,359
Awakening is uh a good spiritual friend so externally it's good spiritual

190
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:26,200
friends and internally is our capacity to to to have a deep profound form of

191
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:33,520
con contemplation attention to our inner life and this profound contemplation

192
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:39,079
this profound kind of uh speaks to that we can have this inner beauty and this

193
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:46,240
is one of the uh word plays around the word kalamita that usually it probably means

194
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:51,880
you know good spiritual friends we have externally but uh it also can mean uh

195
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:57,599
friendship with our own Beauty our own ethical integrity

196
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:05,160
and so that um uh our own inner beauty can be a protection for for us our own

197
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:10,200
inner beauty our own sense of ethical sens sensibility if we stay close to

198
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:17,920
that and that supports us that protects us from doing things that we later regret it protects us from uh being mean

199
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,560
to people for example or hostile it pre prevents us from uh actions that harm

200
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:28,599
other people that we you know that we some how would later regret there is a

201
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:36,040
kind of guidance that we can receive internally if we're settled on ourselves and settled and relaxed and connected to

202
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:43,079
this this soft or this quiet place inside that um offers uh a clear kind of

203
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:50,079
guidance and Living Well living out of out of a sense of goodness and compassion and

204
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:57,359
care so uh whether we find a good spiritual friend externally that we stay

205
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:05,000
in touch with enough uh that um um for me when I was uh a new student in

206
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:11,560
Buddhism um I was fortunate to have good spiritual teachers who I didn't talk to

207
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:17,480
regularly but um I saw them regularly and they reminded me and just the fact

208
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:22,560
that they were around or that I went to their talks and different things I felt

209
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:30,200
oh this is um support for me this is reminds me uh to uh to practice and really live

210
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:36,319
from the best places from inside and um so to have good spiritual

211
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:43,000
friends externally and then to offer in yourself uh discover a friendship with

212
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,119
what is beautiful within and to protect that to support that because it will it

213
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:54,880
will protect you it will guide you it will uh keep you close to what's really valuable and

214
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:01,920
important and probably that makes life a lot simpler living unethically lying for

215
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:08,680
example and and stealing and kind of doing things which are ethically

216
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:16,599
questionable uh tends to create a more complicated life um the little uh saying

217
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:22,440
is that um uh it's better to be honest because then there's less you have to

218
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:30,000
remember if we start lying then you have important to remember Iz to keep them going and um but when you're being

219
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:37,559
honest you know you don't necessarily have to be remember what you said because there you know there's no you

220
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:44,119
know there's no need to keep the the LIE going so a simpler

221
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:51,400
life so um an inner Simplicity of being an inner Joy of being and inner beauty

222
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:57,000
of being this Kalita externally and internally

223
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,640
uh is one of the great supports and when we don't have it internally then uh it

224
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,680
can be really useful to have it externally and uh to have s members

225
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:15,680
other practitioners other people who you feel are virtuous and have this inner beauty and um to spend time with them to

226
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:21,319
be around them to be reminded by them uh that it is possible

227
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:27,280
uh to be that way ourselves to be around them enough to be inspired by them so

228
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,760
that yes I this is this is who I feel like I'm when I'm most myself this is

229
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:39,720
where I want to come from so um May you consider both the

230
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:47,760
topic of your inner beauty and also who are the people in your life that uh live

231
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:53,760
uh in such a way that you're inspired inspires your beauty inside who is uh

232
00:43:53,760 --> 00:44:00,800
truthful who is ethically um virtuous who is has some quality of

233
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:07,839
goodness that uh inspires you it doesn't have to be a Buddhist but uh

234
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:14,599
um stay close to them let that let your familiarity your contact with them uh

235
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:23,319
protect what is maybe most valuable in yourself so thank you very much and

236
