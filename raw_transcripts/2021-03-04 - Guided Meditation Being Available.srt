1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:09,200
and so one of the orientations or

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,759
perspectives on practice in the teachings of the buddha

3
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,800
is an orientation oh i wasn't recording

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,680
so one of the perspectives on

5
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:34,320
practice in the teachings of the buddha is that he was oriented to

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,680
towards the consequences of our actions so there was a sense that

7
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,840
noticing little bit or caring a little bit for what the consequences of what we do is

8
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,320
important and so some orientation into the future

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:01,120
about the potential the likely results of what we do is part of a wise way of living

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:08,000
and of course we have to be very careful with that and it's balanced with the tremendous emphasis on the present moment in this

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,360
practice as well but it's not ignoring the future and

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,479
consequences and so to sit down to meditate in the morning

13
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:25,200
it might be that we do have a sense of the day will go better we'll be more centered calmer maybe

14
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,240
wiser and so there is some appreciation that the motivation even to meditate because

15
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:40,000
of the benefits it brings our lives and then there's also the consequence

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,439
in the short term it's possible to have a sense that if you sit down to

17
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,640
meditate and what you want to do is to

18
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,840
be in a super hurry to get into a deep state of concentration and

19
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,360
and because there's important things to do and in life and and so you're going to just

20
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,640
really huff and puff and strive and get all sweaty and contracted and tense so you

21
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,160
can get quickly concentrated that doesn't work and so have some sense

22
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,520
that yes i want to get settled here in my meditation but it doesn't work to strive or to push or

23
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,560
have a lot of expectations demands to be measuring how i'm doing as i go along

24
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,120
every few seconds what has a good consequence is just be very relaxed around

25
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,360
the consequences at this point and being relaxed about not trying too much to make something happen

26
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,280
is the better way to make something happen that's useful in meditation and so there's still some consequential

27
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,920
thinking but it's recognizing you know how i am in the moment is important

28
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,239
and that it makes a difference how i am that if i strive in meditation i'll have a headache and

29
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,400
that will persist through the day if i can be at ease that creates more ease and it sets up a nice thing for the

30
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,680
day if we get closer in and

31
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,280
and into the present moment the sense of the consequences of our practice

32
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:20,159
has more and more to do with the present moment we can feel the difference between uh being critical about

33
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,840
how we're paying attention to the breathing versus being relaxed around it

34
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:33,440
and you can feel the the immediate consequence sometimes called instant karma the immediate quality the that one of

35
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,040
them has is more dukkha suffering and one is more open and

36
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,640
and feels better and feels satisfying and this ability to differentiate between what is

37
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,920
satisfying and not satisfying in how we enter the moment it gets

38
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,040
closer and closer to something very intimate and close here and now and less concerned about

39
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,560
the future but to be able to discern that difference and see

40
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,599
is it are we are we involved in um um you know

41
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,640
are we too lazy in meditation and so the mind is drifting off too much and

42
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:19,280
a little bit more energy is necessary a little bit engagement are we a little bit too much

43
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,400
constantly making commentary about our meditation and always kind of questioning and doubting

44
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,240
it and is that really that's not really so useful and you could feel that that doesn't feel good

45
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:42,160
and perhaps having a provisional confidence in our meditation um a just uh

46
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,960
you know provisional until more evidence comes it's actually more useful for settling and so again there's a

47
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:56,960
sense of the immediate consequences there and for this meditation i'd like to point to something more subtle

48
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:03,039
and that is that as we practice like mindfulness of the

49
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:08,960
breathing there's a very there can be a very subtle

50
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,840
after effect of

51
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,800
be a moment of being connected to the breathing like if we follow the breath all the way

52
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,639
that knowing of the breath being connected to it it's kind of like an after image there's

53
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:33,039
a kind of or kind of like a if you go out into the water and stand in the sun and get warm

54
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:38,960
that warmth will persist if you go back into the shade for a little while there's the the after

55
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,240
effect of warmth that remains so there's an after effect of doing the

56
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,680
practice act after effect of kind of after image

57
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:57,199
after sense after feeling that persists a little bit beyond just the moment of being mindful it's

58
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:03,360
very subtle and and even if you don't feel it

59
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,400
the sense of being open to it or receptive or

60
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,600
to to feel that as well kind of in the peripheral of attention

61
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:22,080
to be a veil or to be available to be open and receptive to allow an after effect or the glow of

62
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,360
the practice or the the the after warmth

63
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:34,800
remain or the softness or the calmness or whatever it might be to let the goodness of the practice kind

64
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,280
of be available for you to persist into as if you were making space

65
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:49,120
in your body for that after effect that the results of the practice

66
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:56,080
so you're not making it happen you're not demanding it happens the subtlety is that of kind of staying

67
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,360
open available for the practice

68
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,759
to somehow work on you or radiate into you or

69
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,360
persist a nice feeling of something and whether you feel anything or not is

70
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:21,759
less important than that sense of presence and availability receptivity to something

71
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,800
be kind of of allowing yourself to be practiced by the practice

72
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:33,280
to allow yourself to be affected by the practice in a way that's not exactly

73
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,039
your doing it's the consequence of what you're doing

74
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:45,039
the after effect and if what i'm saying is too subtle or too

75
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:51,599
bizarre for you just forget what i'm saying but um so with that

76
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:59,280
taking a upright metaphorically or literally

77
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,319
upright posture

78
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:15,039
and taking a few moments and closing your eyes to feel your body

79
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,919
kind of roam let your attention roam through your body

80
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:29,520
familiarize yourself with what the experience of your body is right now

81
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:45,120
and then to see if you can adjust your

82
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:52,959
kind of your attitude your orientation that with your body and heart and mind

83
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,839
you're available

84
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,120
you are available to be receptive

85
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:12,160
to to the practice that you're available

86
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,440
to be changed

87
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:25,120
you're available for some deeper qualities of practice to be registered or to

88
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,720
waft through you

89
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:38,320
and then very gently with this receptivity availability

90
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:46,480
take some gentle but deeper breaths maybe slowly

91
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,480
as if you're receiving the inhale into that availability

92
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:05,839
and filling that receptivity on the exhale long quiet exhale

93
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:19,839
and perhaps you recognize that quieting the thinking mind

94
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:29,120
increases the receptivity the availability to really take in the experience

95
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:35,920
of practice of meditation and the more you're thinking the less

96
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:47,360
room there is to be available to sense to feel

97
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,760
and then letting your breathing return to normal

98
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:03,440
and in terms of feeling the after effect being available to linger and feel it

99
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:10,000
it might be extremely subtle but notice the after effect as you relax

100
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,600
different parts of your body as you exhale softening the muscles of

101
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,160
the face

102
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,920
and what's the feeling that comes with relaxing those muscles

103
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,279
as you exhale softening and relaxing the

104
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,839
shoulders

105
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:07,839
and in these little moments of softening relaxing the shoulders what good

106
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:24,160
feelings remain for a few moments what after effect is there

107
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,000
relaxing the belly

108
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:43,200
softening it might be possible to soften the hands

109
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:53,839
the fingers

110
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:07,519
might be possible to just gently just a little bit flap your elbows to loosen up

111
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:21,839
any tightness or holding in the arms

112
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:35,440
it might be possible to relax and soften

113
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,120
the muscles of your back so maybe those

114
00:13:46,839 --> 00:14:03,839
muscles kind of release down your back

115
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,639
and now opening more fully to your

116
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:21,040
breathing at the end of the exhale

117
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:27,440
for a moment let there be a very brief pause

118
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,839
not a pause that is a strain but just long enough so the beginning of

119
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:41,440
the inhale really wants to happen and you

120
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:51,440
allow it and rece and better so you can better receive the

121
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,839
inhale

122
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:09,839
being available for the influence the inhale has on your

123
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:16,320
body and mind receptive

124
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:24,959
not just only to the sensations of breathing but maybe to the afterglow or the

125
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:41,440
radiance or the something that spreads from your breathing as you inhale

126
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:48,240
and as you exhale allow the exhale the release to

127
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:55,839
occur ride that release ride the exhale

128
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,959
gently allowing it all the way to the end

129
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:13,199
and especially as you get to the end of the out breath being available to feel

130
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:20,079
the influence that exhaling has on you

131
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,839
more widely

132
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,480
being receptive to the inhale

133
00:16:53,519 --> 00:17:05,839
being allowing for the exhale

134
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,678
available to allow the influence of mindfulness of breathing to spread

135
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,839
through your body

136
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:38,160
as if your body is a receptacle that receives the practice

137
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,640
and whether you receive anything or not is less important than

138
00:17:46,640 --> 00:18:01,840
this openness and availability as you breathe

139
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,640
and if you become aware of other things besides your breathing

140
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:35,039
perhaps you can become aware of them body sensations feelings thoughts in this

141
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:43,840
open receptive way that's available

142
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:52,240
to feel not the influence of our feelings and body sensations but the influence of

143
00:18:52,240 --> 00:19:00,559
being mindful aware aware of body emotions

144
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,120
thoughts

145
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:17,280
where being available and receptive is almost a quality of the mindfulness

146
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,760
itself

147
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,480
and perhaps feeling the goodness

148
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:33,039
of this receptive open mindfulness

149
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,840
practice

150
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:49,840
in some subtle way small way can you adjust how you have a continuous

151
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:57,760
mindfulness continuous awareness of your breathing of your experience

152
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:05,840
so that that mindfulness has a good influence on you

153
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:16,080
that it's nourishing supportive that the after effect the influence

154
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:22,559
is beneficial or if you notice that the after effect

155
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:29,919
the influence is not beneficial can you adjust it

156
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:40,000
so that how you're aware seems to have a nice influence

157
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:47,840
here and now in the present moment in this body and mind

158
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:15,840
letting the thinking be quiet so you can better feel the subtlety of all this

159
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:59,840
sometimes the beneficial influence of the practice

160
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:08,480
can increase slightly if you very slightly make a small

161
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,240
half smile turning up the corners of your lips

162
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:22,559
and allowing for the receptivity being receptive to the influence the

163
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:28,880
good influence of pleasure joy

164
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:41,840
that supports being present

165
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:57,280
as you receive the inhale receive the global

166
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:06,319
nourishment or influence good influence that might be here from meditating

167
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:13,119
as you allow the exhale allow the nourishment or allow the

168
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:20,800
global goodness that might be here throughout the body

169
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,240
in the mind in the heart

170
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:33,200
letting your awareness take it all in on the inhale

171

the awareness allow for it on the exhale

172
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:51,760
and then as we come to the end of this sitting take a moment to feel

173
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,960
grounded in your place of meditation

174
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:03,839
if you're sitting upright to feel the sitting bones your bottom

175
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,400
firmly on what supports your weight if your feet are planted on the floor to

176
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:17,838
feel the solidity of your feet on the floor

177
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:25,680
whatever way you can really use your body weight to really feel grounded settled

178
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:34,000
established here and then together with that

179
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:44,960
to be open and receptive to be available to feel and sense and

180
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:51,279
take in the experience of the world around you

181
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:59,839
without being unduly influenced been duly affected by that

182
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:07,440
but grounded in the present moment and open and receptive

183
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:17,839
and then bringing to mind some people of your life

188
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:52,720
secure in your groundedness available to be open and receptive

189
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:57,440
to take in the experience of another person

190
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:13,280
and maybe feeling or sensing the other person knowing the other

191
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,800
person from some place inside that

192
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:26,800
is tender or gentle or kind loving

193
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,560

194
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:43,839
approaching the person or needing to say anything just this place of being grounded and
