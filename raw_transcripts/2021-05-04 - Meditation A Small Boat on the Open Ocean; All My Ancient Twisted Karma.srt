1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:08,800
well good morning welcome as some of you know my name is fu schrader and i'm a visiting teacher from

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,639
the san francisco zen center who for a few days anyway this week is sharing the dharma seat

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,800
with your teacher gail franz doll and also paul haller from last week also from the

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,400
zen center as part of a three-week intensive that we're calling the harmony

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,800
of zen and vipassana so this week of our intensive is focusing on the buddha's

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,399
teaching of right conduct so the previous two weeks we focused on

7
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,160
meditation samadhi and on wisdom prajna and

8
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,920
yesterday morning for those of us those of you who joined i talked about the precepts

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,520
which are the cornerstone of right conduct and precepts are given to us in order to

10
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,559
connect us to one another in order to bring harmony to humankind

11
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,720
through connecting practices ones that we all know like kindness and generosity

12
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,799
patience and wisdom so zen center's founding teacher shinryu

13
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:20,799
suzuki roshi taught that receiving the precepts is a way of understanding what it means to just sit

14
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:27,360
the integration of precepts and meditation is the foundation for all of the practices and activities

15
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,759
of our daily life so for this morning's meditation i'm going to remind you briefly about the

16
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,799
points of your posture that will help support just sitting and after that i'm going to

17
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:45,040
read you a small passage on silent illumination by a 12th century chinese zen master

18
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,040
named hong ju silent illumination practice is considered the hallmark

19
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:58,960
of this living branch of buddhism on which i happen to be sitting called sotozen so please first find a nice

20
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,079
comfortable position for your legs and your torso

21
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,479
and then bring your awareness slowly up from the base of your spine

22
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:16,959
toward the top of your head you know take all the time you like allowing each vertebra in your spine to

23
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,720
lengthen upward along the way the lower back is a nice deep curve

24
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,160
going into the abdomen which allows your chest to raise and open

25
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,640
there's another slight curve outward between the shoulder blades which themselves drop down as though

26
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:41,360
they're little pockets in your back you can slip them into the pockets there's another curve gentle curve at

27
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,680
the neck going in toward the throat and then let your head balance slightly

28
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,640
on the top of the spine the chin pulled slightly downward the ears

29
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:01,360
in alignment with your shoulders and the nose with the navel

30
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:10,080
excuse me keep your eyes slightly open with a soft resting gaze at about a 45

31
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:18,080
degree angle from your eyes to whatever surface is in front of you there the floor or table

32
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,720
let all the tension in your body begin to melt away from the top of the head i like to

33
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,959
imagine cracking an egg a raw egg on the top of my head and letting it run down the back

34
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,920
and the arms across the shoulders

35
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:44,560
and then softly across the belly and down to the floor carrying with it

36
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:52,159
all of that tension now gently inhale two or three full

37
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,519
breaths through your mouth and then out

38
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
again

39
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,199
now after which you can just return to normal breathing

40
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:27,520
the one traditional technique for quieting the mind is to count the breaths from one to ten

41
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,160
on the impulse to inhale one

42
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:42,000
i i like to notice that impulse in my abdomen where you low down and then fully exhale

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,199
on the impulse inhale

44
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,960
two three

45
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,039
and so on and once you reach 10 you start over with one if you forget

46
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:13,919
as we all do simply go back again to one it's like riding in your breath a little

47
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:25,840
bit like a small boat on the open ocean up and down with the waves

48
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:35,759
your arms can rest on your knees or be brought together into the cosmic mudra which is clearly visible on many statues

49
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,440
of the buddha in seated meditation the left hand is on top of the right

50
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:49,680
with the fingers overlapping your thumbs are lightly touching at the tips making a nice oval shape

51
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,960
with your hands like a little little cradle sometimes i imagine resting my mind in that cradle

52
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:04,319
as i sit when your mind is agitated it's it's

53
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:11,120
recommended that you bring it down bring your attention downwards so the hands are a nice place to hold

54
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,800
an agitated mind and if you're sleepy the instruction is to bring your

55
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:24,479
attention up to your forehead you know here third eye

56
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,319
so as we continue to settle ourselves into a comfortable upright posture i'm going to read you a teaching from the

57
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:40,000
zen and zen ancestor hong jour he was a master of the meditation that we call

58
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,639
silent illumination the model of practice that is enacted at a pivotal juncture

59
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:53,919
between meditative absorption and skillful activity of our life in the world

60
00:06:53,919 --> 00:07:03,840
here master hunger

61
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:14,720
this short essay is called drop off your skin and accept your function

62
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:22,639
in daytime the sun at night the moon each in turn does not blind the other

63
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:29,360
this is how a patch-roped monk steadily practices naturally without edges or seams

64
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,960
to gain such steadiness you must completely withdraw from the invisible pounding and weaving

65
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:42,319
of your ingrained ideas if you want to be rid of this invisible turmoil you must just sit

66
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:48,639
through it and let go of everything attain fulfillment and illuminate thoroughly

67
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:55,199
light and shadow altogether forgotten drop off your own skin and the sense

68
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:01,360
dusts will be fully purified the eye readily discerning the brightness

69
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,759
accept your function and be wholly satisfied in the entire place you are not

70
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:14,639
restricted the whole time you still mutually respond

71
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:23,120
right in light there is darkness right in darkness there is light a solitary boat carries the moon

72
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:41,839
at night it lodges amid the reed flowers gently swaying in total brilliance

73
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,919
you

74
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:37,600
oh welcome back to the world of shared language and innumerable meanings

75
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:44,080
so for those of you who are just joining i am fuschrader from the san francisco zen center and i'm a guest of gil

76
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:50,080
fronsdale who along with paul haler and myself are offering a three-week intensive

77
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:55,200
called the harmony of zen and vipassana so this morning

78
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:03,360
is the second day of our week-long study of the teachings the buddha gave on right conduct sheila and to begin i'm going to

79
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:09,679
share with you a teaching story from the pali canon about the source of what is called the bodhisattva vow

80
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:17,120
or the vow to live for the benefit of all beings so this vow underlies not only the

81
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:23,200
tradition that we endeavor to practice here at greengauge farm where i'm sitting right now

82
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:30,399
but wherever humans are conducting their lives for the benefit of others as i know so many of you are doing right

83
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:38,159
now on the front lines of this pandemic for which all of us are deeply grateful

84
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,840
so here's a story about a yogi named sumera that illustrates the origins of the

85
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:51,679
bodhisattva vowel and please keep in mind that it's just a story

86
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:57,360
countless eons ago in a city called amaravati there lived a brahmana named sumeda

87
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,399
a son of good family when sumeda was still quite young his parents died

88
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:07,840
and the minister of the state showed sumaida the wealth accumulated for seven generations

89
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:13,039
that he now had inherited from his parents the family treasury was filled to

90
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:19,519
overflowing with gold silver gems pearls and other valuables

91
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:25,600
when sumaida saw the treasure he thought after amassing all this wealth none of

92
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,720
my ancestors were able to take even one penny with them when they passed away

93
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:37,760
can it be right that i should seek to take my wealth with me to the end of my days and then he told the minister of state

94
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,000
to give all of this wealth to the poor

95
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:50,480
when he saw how a life of transmigrating within samsara the cycle of birth sickness aging and

96
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,640
dying moment after moment was suffering he wanted to find the path of deliverance

97
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:02,799
that would lead to extinction to no more rebirth so he left home and entered a forest in

98
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:10,080
the himalayas to practice as a hermit because he was a person of great integrity over time he attained

99
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:17,360
superhuman knowledge and supernatural powers one day deepangara buddha appeared in

100
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:23,440
the world and began to teach to prepare for the buddha's arrival the people of the town began to fix the road

101
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:30,480
which had flooded and to decorate it with flowers sumaida who lived near heard of the buddha's visit

102
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:37,200
and flew to the town offering to help with preparations the people were so excited because they

103
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:44,320
knew that sumeda could fix the road with his supernatural powers just in time for deepankara buddha's arrival

104
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:50,399
but sumeda wanted to do so with his own hands and so he started to carry the soil by

105
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:58,240
hand unfortunately deepangara buddha and his assembly arrived before his work was done

106
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,960
sumaida did not want the buddha to walk through the mud so he loosened his matted hair lay down on the ground and with

107
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:10,000
outstretched hands asked the buddha to walk on him

108
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,080
lying there in the mud sumeda looked up at deepangara buddha and he thought to himself

109
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,919
if i wanted i could now enter the buddha sangha and free myself from deluded states of human desire

110
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:30,240
becoming an arhat and then at death i would at once attain nirvana and cease to be reborn but this would be

111
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,440
a benefit to myself alone i want to help all beings as deepangara

112
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:42,960
buddha is doing right now and i am determined and then he made a vow i vowed to attain

113
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,559
what deepangara buddha has attained anu tara samyaksambodi the complete

114
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:53,760
perfect enlightenment of a buddha for the benefit of all beings when

115
00:33:53,760 --> 00:34:00,880
deepangara buddha saw sumeda lying in the mud he understood that the young man had vowed to become a buddha

116
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,720
so he told his assembly that in the distant future sumaida would indeed become a buddha

117
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,638
named shakyamuni hearing this prediction sumaida was overjoyed

118
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:18,800
believing that his vow would be realized and thus sumeda became a bodhisattva

119
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:24,638
meaning a buddha to be vowing to remain in the realms of suffering until all beings

120
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,839
had been saved so this is our inheritance as well you

121
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:35,919
know all of us as a gift from sumaida and our own buddha shakib who came here

122
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:42,320
to this earth looking for suffering beings it might be saved which in buddha's world means to be

123
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:50,079
awakened so this vow to live for others is the true heart of our human life whether we know it or

124
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:55,760
not say it or not believe it or not still some part of our mind turns

125
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:03,200
towards this thought of awakening the bodhichitta the thought of enlightenment and some part of our body

126
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:10,560
turns toward the image of an awakened being toward the possibility of becoming an awakened being ourselves

127
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:16,240
and so we sit like a buddha we study the buddhist teaching and we endeavor to

128
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:22,720
act like buddha over and over and over again and then

129
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:30,640
on the morning of his awakening what shakimani would have saw was his own miraculous face appearing as

130
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:36,079
the morning star as the branches of an overhanging tree the bodhi tree

131
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:43,119
as a lovely young woman carrying water in a jar on her head as bees and flowers as grass and flowing

132
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:48,800
water just as we're all seeing right now and for the first time in his many lives

133
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,560
he knew he wasn't separate from the world he knew he wasn't alone there was nothing

134
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:00,000
outside of himself so what the buddha then recommended to

135
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,040
his many disciples was an opposite world where each of us is devoted

136
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:10,160
ourselves to the welfare of someone else or maybe to everyone else

137
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,920
in his search for liberation from suffering the young prince said undermined his own self-concern

138
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,200
self-love self-conceit and ignorance a radical act that

139
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:28,800
diverted the flow of his ambition away from accumulating more cargo more wealth to preserving the

140
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,400
precious resources of this life-giving planet for everyone and everything that depends

141
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:40,160
on it so when we take this vow to live for others much like in a marriage it's done

142
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:48,000
before witnesses in our family our friends our community and for a brief moment moment or two we see into

143
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:55,280
the heart of creation itself herself himself into the great wholeness of

144
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:02,320
being our own true body and our own true life so basically the precepts are like a

145
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:09,040
trellis to hold ourselves up as we undertake this very same journey lifetime after lifetime moment after

146
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:16,240
moment need be that led to the awakening of a young prince turning toward the thought of awakening

147
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:22,640
is a natural thing for us to want something that sounds so wonderful you know like enlightenment

148
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:30,000
although wanting something for ourselves alone is perhaps the very thing that blocks our way fortunately we

149
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,680
really have no other choice but to start from where we are and most often if not always

150
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:41,520
we will find that we are starting from selfishness one of the four defiled ways of thinking

151
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:47,760
that block our view of buddhahood these four are called the klishtamanas

152
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:54,640
krishnamanas sounds defiled thinking the first is ignorance which along with

153
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:00,079
desire is the cause of human suffering the next is the belief in a self a

154
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:08,000
separate self the third is the conceit about that self and the fourth is the love for that self

155
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,520
above all else basic narcissism

156
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:19,680
and yet right there is our first opportunity for a taste of liberation by studying the self that we believe

157
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:27,599
that we are and then by telling the truth about what we see i see that i am selfish

158
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:34,480
already in that recognition and acknowledgement the precepts suddenly appear beginning with what from

159
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:41,520
my point of view is the most important precept of them all a disciple of buddha does not lie not to

160
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:47,920
oneself and not to others and that very truth will set us free

161
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:55,520
which reminds me of another amazing story also from the poly canon about the power of telling the truth

162
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:01,839
excuse me

163
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:14,240
a young boy is bitten by a poisonous snake the distraught parents stop a passing monk and ask him to use his medical

164
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:20,640
knowledge to save the child the monk replies that the situation is so grave that the only possible cure

165
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,839
would be emphatic statements of truth the father then says

166
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:32,800
i have never seen a monk that i did not think was a scoundrel may the boy live without the poison left

167
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,160
the boy's leg the mother then said i have never loved my husband

168
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:45,040
may the boy live the poison retreated to the boy's waist the monk then said i have never believed

169
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:51,040
a word of the dharma but found it utter nonsense may the boy live and with that the boy

170
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,960
rose completely cured such is the power of the truth

171
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,000
so telling the truth also called the practices of confession and repentance in the

172
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:09,520
buddhist tradition is intimately connected to the bodhisattva vowel there are two sides of one practice or

173
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,800
one coin and that's because our vow of saving all beings is endless

174
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:21,520
and therefore will never be complete you know we just can't do it our awareness of the incompleteness is

175
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:27,119
in itself a kind of repentance you know as in i am so sorry but i just cannot finish

176
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:32,960
this job even the buddha said this very thing when he could no longer stay in his

177
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:39,839
painful human body gotta go i think you've all seen the

178
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:45,119
enso the zen masters draw as a demonstration demonstration of both their unique

179
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:50,960
personalities but also of their understanding of this universal truth of incompleteness

180
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,000
the circle will never be closed this truth is the same for all who undertake

181
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,760
the bodhisattva vow and practice and at the same time that our task is unachievable

182
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:09,920
it's also important to reflect honestly on our personal shortcomings as part of entry into a life that's devoted to vow

183
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:16,720
such reflection sets up a resonance between the enormous task and ourselves as limited beings

184
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:21,760
endeavoring to undertake it you know it's harmonics shanti deva the 8th

185
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:27,440
century indian buddhist monk and scholar and an adherent of the middle way philosophy with its

186
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:33,359
primary focus on the emptiness teaching said one law serves to summarize the whole of

187
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:39,200
the great vehicle the protection of all beings is accomplished through the examination

188
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:45,040
of one's own mistakes this kind of honest self-reflection

189
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:52,160
helps to motivate us and to inspire us to continue finding our way oftentimes we back away from looking at

190
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:57,599
our mistakes and instead we lead with a string of justifications you know stories good

191
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:05,040
stories i've always appreciated the practice of the zen center when one of us misses a bell or relate or do some other

192
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:11,520
unskillful things we simply bow and apologize without bringing in a lot a lot of extra information you

193
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:16,560
know better known as excuses it's also part of the mahayana tradition

194
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:21,920
when entering into a relationship with dharma practice and in particular with the bodhisattva

195
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,200
val to acknowledge not only the impossibility of completing our mission

196
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:34,319
and our current mistakes but also our previous mistakes our previous way of life our selfish

197
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:40,480
life in which from which we are in recovery so which is exactly why we chant every

198
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:46,640
morning during service following our meditation all my ancient twisted karma from

199
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:55,200
beginningless greed hate and delusion born through body speech and mind i now fully avow

200
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:01,839
meaning i now fully accept i did it and i'm very sorry so being conscious of our errors and

201
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:08,640
being concerned about the effect our behavior has on others is essential to our life together in community both

202
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:16,960
locally and globally as we hippies used to say you know think globally act locally

203
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:23,839
in a citation to asuta thanissaro tells us throughout ancient cultures the

204
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:31,280
terminology of music was used to describe the moral qualities of people and of actions discordant intervals and

205
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:38,240
poorly tuned instruments were metaphors for doing harm harmonious intervals and well-tuned

206
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:44,160
instruments were metaphors were doing good in pali the term sama even

207
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:49,599
meaning even sama describes an instrument that is tuned on pitch

208
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:56,160
so this term samana meaning a monk or a contemplative also derives from this same word summa

209
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:02,880
evenness referring to the greatly admired characteristics of those human beings who have developed

210
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,000
in themselves the quality of being in tune with what is proper and good and most

211
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,599
importantly for everyone around them so tomorrow morning i will be talking about the verses

212
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:20,319
known as the three refuges that we recite also each morning following meditation

213
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:34,960
i take refuge in buna i take refuge in dharma i take refuge in sangha

214
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,640
the three refugees also known as the triple treasure are the first three of the sixteen

215
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:47,440
bodhisattva precepts without the buddha his teachings the dharma without the people who came to

216
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:52,960
study with him the sangha there would be no buddhism and which is kind of obvious

217
00:44:52,960 --> 00:45:00,240
less obvious perhaps is that none of us would be here this morning to talk about it there would be no us no it no way of

218
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:05,440
life so taking refuge in the triple treasure as suzuki roshi said means that you

219
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:11,760
adore the buddha the dharma and the sangha and that for you taking refuge is an act

220
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:18,160
of adoration so before declaring our adoration to the triple treasure it might be a good idea

221
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:23,760
to consider just what each of those refuges means to you and that's what i'm going to talk

222
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:33,838
about tomorrow so thank you all for your kind attention please take care stay safe
