00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:09,440
hello everyone and welcome and here we are the

2
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:17,880
the fifth of these five part series on I'm calling locations for awareness

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,720
and one of the kind of uh maybe difficult things to

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:32,940
understand about awareness is a degree to which it's a condition constructed phenomena

5
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,760
that uh the mind to some degree

6
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:46,820
and to some degree constructs its ideas of what it means to be aware

7
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,399
and so the idea that there's a location for awareness

8
00:00:53,059 --> 00:01:02,000
has some truth and it also has some sense of a choice and a construction

9
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:12,000
and what happens when awareness is not constructed when it's allowed to just be

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,600
and this comes into a play particularly with the idea that there's a here and

11
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,420
there that there's a place to be aware from and there's something that we're being

12
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,840
aware of and at times this is completely normal and natural to have that sense

13
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:38,159
and there are times when the mind gets quiet enough for still enough that where we are very aware

14
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,500
but awareness has no location it's just everywhere in a sense if or

15
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,820
nowhere we're very aware very clear there's a lot of clarity

16
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,100
and but the objects of awareness are not objects they are there's not like awareness and

17
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:02,460
then objects the there's just a things that are known

18
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:08,880
and the knowing arise together and it can be a little bit feeling like

19
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:16,500
um you know like um you know objects in space

20
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:23,280
deep and darkest space I suppose there's just something exists without any reference to anything else

21
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:31,700
so an object can exist without any reference to anything else exist in awareness and attention

22
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:37,920
so uh might be difficult unusual to understand

23
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,819
what I'm trying to say but uh we'll do a little meditation and see if uh maybe you can get some feeling

24
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:52,700
for this so to assume a meditation posture

25
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:56,360
and to

26
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,959
gently close your eyes

27
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:11,239
and to gently

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,340
become aware gently

29
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,099
gently come aware of your body

30
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,959
thin feeling the substance of your body the weight against your chair or your

31
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,379
cushion

32
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:15,659
to feel the weights of your hands and if their hands are resting upon

33
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:20,298
something feeling that resting of the weight

34
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:54,918
and then within this body to take a slow long slow deep breath

35
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:01,620
and as the Torso expands to feel it as a massage from the inside

36
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:10,139
a stretching and opening and as the inhale as the Torso contracts

37
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:17,000
again feel it the other half of the rhythm of a massage

38
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,979
a gentle

39
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,100
caring for the body

40
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,400
letting the breathing return to normal

41
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,400
and as you exhale to relax the body

42
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:27,680
soften the different parts of your body scanning through

43
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:30,120
and then gently as you exhale to relax the thinking mind

44
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:39,800
the energy agitation of thinking any sense of contraction or pressure

45
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,340
coagulation and the thinking mind

46
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:20,660
and then at the end of the exhale a really feeling for a world

47
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:27,960
the exhale whenever you're exhaling a heightened kind of sensing

48
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,360
the physical experience of exhaling

49
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:40,820
how the chest moves the diaphragm the belly

50
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:21,839
and when you come to the end of the exhale for a second or so

51
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,440
pause before you inhale

52
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:34,620
and in that pause maybe you can let go more relax more

53
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,420
for there to be more of the exhale

54
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,079
and if that happens and pause again at the very end

55
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,260
one way or the other let there be a pause at the end of the exhale

56
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:10,279
feeling the sensations in your body where that pause occurs

57
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,720
and then allow for the inhale to begin

58
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,240
allow the sensations of inhale

59
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,560
to come into awareness

60
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:05,459
if pausing at the end of the exhale causes some discomfort and breathing that

61
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:14,180
throws it off a little bit let there be almost a pause at the end

62
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,940
so that there's a little heightened ability

63
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,839
to receive the inhale

64
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,680
and allow for thee exhale

65
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:44,040
allow the body to release as you exhale

66
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,519
receiving the inhale allowing the exhale

67
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:16,079
noticing if more your awareness is in the sensations of breathing

68
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:23,519
awareness is more maybe in the head or the knowing of

69
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,880
breathing

70
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:43,440
is there a distance between awareness the knowing

71
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,459
and the breathing

72
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,300
is there a sense that there's an object that Sensations to be aware of

73
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,100
and you being aware

74
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:14,699
and if there is what are the sensations what's the

75
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:20,279
feeling what's the location of the U that's

76
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:27,060
aware what's the feeling what's the sensation

77
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:32,899
of that which is aware

78
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:43,040
that's which is receptive that which is allowing

79
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:04,399
and if there is a U or that which is receptive or allowing

80
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:15,320
on the exhale see let that relax let that soften

81
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:32,899
letting the sense of a do or of mindfulness

82
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:41,959
recede into the background let it evaporate

83
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:57,620
and there's no receiving no allowing

84
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:05,160
the sensations of breathing just are they appear

85
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,360
in awareness

86
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:25,798
no distance between awareness

87
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:29,360
and what you're aware of

88
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,220
the sensations of breathing appear

89
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:46,980
in vast space each sensation each experience of

90
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,320
breathing just is

91
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,780
an awareness of breathing just is

92
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,780
inseparable

93
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,580
knowing

94
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,960
has no location apart from the sensation

95
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:30,960
heat sensation no need to

96
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,720
for it to exist in a reference to anything else

97
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:44,059
breathing breathing itself

98
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,120
no watcher

99
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,600
just aware

100
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:16,580
no distance just awareness

101
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,899
no location

102
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:41,360
just awareness

103
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:07,220
no receiver of experience

104
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:15,559
no victim of experience

105
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:30,480
no actor of experience just knowing just awareness experience

106
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,200
by itself

107
00:20:53,520 --> 00:21:00,240
Breathing by itself is not thinking

108
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,520
breathing is free of thinking

109
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:14,360
thinking is an overlay isn't is a separate process than breathing

110
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:26,940
to be aware of breathing without thinking

111
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:33,320
that reference to thought just breathing

112
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,539
foreign

113
00:23:53,100 --> 00:24:01,039
when there is no thinking or beyond the edges of thinking

114
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:08,360
awareness experience just is

115
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:17,179
without location distance here or there

116
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,140
thought about conceived conceptualized

117
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:40,019
take awareness with that self experience without a experiencer

118
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:45,620
nothing extra nothing added

119
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,880
to the basic simplicity

120
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,900
of experience

121
00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:01,400
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

122
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:10,200
take a few moments to relax on the exhale

123
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:16,820
soften whatever is

124
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,940
energized or contracted or

125
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,039
and with any doubt any sense of

126
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:50,539
distance close or far away no sense of receiving or being active

127
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:59,960
hello there to arise some notion of care and kindness

128
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:06,600
kindness that for now has no object

129
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:14,659
nothing not thinking of anybody just kindness which has no

130
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:21,140
reference point of other people other places other times

131
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:28,760
just kindness care love

132
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,140
within an outen object

133
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:39,140
maybe love that has no

134
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:46,820
location because it's everywhere

135
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:56,179
everywhere in the field the range the range of how far away you can

136
00:29:56,179 --> 00:30:03,679
hear or sense or feel or imagine

137
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,299
that love is part and parcel of whatever way

138
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,158
whatever field of awareness there might be here

139
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:29,419
and in this objectless love for care

140
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:38,658
to fill it with universal Goodwill for others

141
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:49,039
may all beings be happy may all beings be safe

142
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:57,020
may all beings be peaceful

143
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:03,020
may all beings be free

144
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,860
and may all beings

145
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:19,559
be known peacefully within this within the range of

146
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:25,759
awareness within mindfulness

147
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:43,190
[Music]

148
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,580
thank you

149
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:09,600
so welcome to this fifth talk on locations for awareness or perspectives

150
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:16,980
on awareness and this theme for this week

151
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:22,740
is was selected because last time I was

152
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:28,559
here I talked about compassion and this week next week next week I'd

153
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:35,179
like to continue this theme of compassion but in between I wanted to

154
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:44,820
explore the medium through which compassion travels or occurs or is

155
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:50,220
is stimulated and that Medium is our capacity for

156
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:55,860
attention if we have compassion for another person who's suffering

157
00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:02,580
then um only way that we know they're suffering is we know it there's an awareness of it

158
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:08,878
there's a attention experience it in some way

159
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:15,960
and and that act that they were Act of knowing Act of being aware can often go

160
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,560
unexamined unconsidered it's almost as if there is no separation

161
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:29,179
it's just suffering and that we experience that suffering almost sometimes and sometimes the

162
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:35,280
empathy so-called empathy of other people suffering uh is experienced and

163
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:43,138
it's too hard for people they feel overwhelmed they feel like they're way too sensitive they feel that they get exhausted or

164
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:48,300
from it or they don't quite understand how to have

165
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:55,320
compassion because they don't quite they feel kind of apart from other people's suffering and don't feel like

166
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:01,440
doesn't touch them in some way so a lot of this has to do with the

167
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,680
nature of how we're being aware and we can be aware in different ways

168
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:12,900
and so to begin knowing the range and the variety of ways in which knowing

169
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:18,359
comes into existence um you know we know something because we

170
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:24,660
see it we know something because we hear it if someone tells us a story about someone who's suffering the medium

171
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:29,760
through which that's coming is through the hearing if we're with someone who's suffering we

172
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:36,180
see it then it's through the seeing and um if we're sitting you know by

173
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:42,720
ourselves and we remember that someone who's suffering then it's through the medium of our thoughts our images in the

174
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:49,500
mind our memory so these are all different means of becoming aware

175
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:55,260
and then there's a sense of uh how we're aware from where we're aware of this

176
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:00,960
and often enough the locus of awareness is our sense of self

177
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:07,380
in fact that Locus sometimes is what around what we construct a sense of self

178
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:13,500
also um and so how we're aware the location which we're aware from

179
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:19,680
is are we is something that we can change and adjust that's been the theme for this week

180
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,020
and a skilled use of awareness of mindfulness is to be sensitive to how

181
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:33,780
the different ways in which we can be aware and then be able to have some skill in choosing how to be aware

182
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:39,960
if we don't choose the difference between all the different modalities of awareness than if the modality of

183
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:46,800
awareness which we have is not serving us when we're with suffering then we're just going to keep touching

184
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,680
into that to this unhelpful way of sharing and suffering of others in a way

185
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:58,079
that it's exhausting or there's or it's uh debilitating or we just feel too much

186
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:06,540
pain to really have effective compassion so to find a way of being aware that

187
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:12,359
allows us to be balanced allows us not to be to suffer more than the person who's suffering

188
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:18,240
to suffer less to but to be empathic to feel to know what's happening

189
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:24,240
so we can move around our awareness we can sometimes sometimes it helps to feel

190
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:31,079
like we're really removed like the Mind steps back and gets the bird's eye view sometimes we can get really close we

191
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:37,859
don't physically get close but it really kind of the sense close to what's happening and maybe it's feeling closely

192
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:44,700
what's happening to ourselves because if we're not if we use this medium awareness to only be aware of

193
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:50,160
others then we're missing out on the impact and what how we're participating in it in

194
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,680
the in the experience that we're having and if we're only with ourselves then it

195
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:03,900
also can be imbalanced the whole situation so yesterday I talked about the 50 50 approach to being aware of 50

196
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:09,720
here 50 there as meditation as mindfulness becomes

197
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:18,839
richer and Fuller for people um one way that we can be aware of in of

198
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:27,300
people suffering beware of compassion be aware in general is to have the awareness not be yoked

199
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:36,540
to our sense of self to Me Myself and mine that to have that part of the mind not a

200
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:43,500
hijack or not engaged with how we're aware what we're aware of

201
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:51,000
and um and just just be aware and not even being aware receptively

202
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:58,200
because of a receptive awareness there's something someone who's receiving

203
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:04,859
not be actively aware of going out to be aware out there because then there's an actor someone who's doing the the

204
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:13,140
awareness there's this marvelous kind of middle way that we just can be aware without being

205
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:18,599
the receiver and without being the actor who goes and it can be there could be a lot of

206
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:23,760
clarity it's not being aloof or disconnected but it's a connection which

207
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:31,079
is not um doesn't have a receiver doesn't have a thought idea concept

208
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:37,320
stories about who I am and what I have to do and my responsibilities and and uh

209
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:45,540
this is the you know that this is something I have to deal with I have to respond to and this is happening to me

210
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:50,940
there's a victim here here I go again and there's a lot of extra stuff that

211
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:56,099
comes along that has a lot to do with our conceptual mind that our thinking

212
00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:02,220
mind and our our that something it's kind of activation is going on that we

213
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:08,099
don't even know we're activated it just it seems like this is how it always is

214
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:13,920
meditation as we get quieter and quieter settled more and more settled then at

215
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:20,160
some point the construct of a receiver even receiving is not needed

216
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:26,280
the construct of having the mind go towards something and become aware of it does not need it

217
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:34,680
there's just allowing whatever arises in Awareness whatever it might be without choice

218
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:40,920
just arise without a sense of a doer or receiver without a sense of it's out

219
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:45,960
there and I'm here without distance without and the same

220
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:51,359
time is no distance there is a

221
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:56,700
no concern for distance it isn't like we're glued to anything that's not that

222
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:01,920
kind of lack of distance it's it's because there's no reference point

223
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:09,180
for distance no reference point for being glued to something just arises

224
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:14,400
and um and it can be phenomenally respectful for oneself and for others

225
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:20,880
this kind of very relaxed open awareness because it allows each thing to be just

226
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:27,119
what it is for itself so the

227
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:33,359
um so sometimes it's completely wonderful and fun even and appropriate

228
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:39,240
to be to take agency over how we're aware and

229
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:46,560
to adjust how we're aware and find how to be aware that's the right way for the moment the appropriate way for us for

230
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:53,400
the situation and then sometimes what can we be available to us is just dropping away of

231
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:58,619
self dropping away of a reference point and isn't that we're becoming shut down

232
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:05,880
or Aloo for disconnected there's a lot of sensitivity to our you

233
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:11,760
know our body our mind our thoughts What's Happening Here it just it's not

234
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,160
organized around this idea of a central person who's having this experience

235
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:24,180
but we're responsible for all of this we know all of this but we're not engaged in that kind of preoccupation agitation

236
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:29,400
Around Me Myself and mine and there can be a lot of presence for

237
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:37,740
another person and um and there's just kind of a sense of Freedom a sense of Infinite Space

238
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:45,119
that things just exist there in their own simplicity in a ways at times when it's really

239
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:52,320
strong there's no future and past it's just what it is there's no here nor

240
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:58,200
there it's just what it is there's no closeness and no aloofness or

241
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:04,140
distance it's just what's there and everything is just there

242
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:10,440
and um and that's a marvelous way for compassion just to arise and compassion

243
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:16,859
is just there compassion has been triggered has been awakened but there's no burden to

244
00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:24,180
compassion there's no obligation to compassion there's no me that has to do something with this it's all just kind

245
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:29,700
of allowed to arise and be there compassion arises and if there's a

246
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:36,660
something we can do the motivation to do it arises in that same freedom

247
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:42,420
um it's a deep deep trust in allowing this deeper stuff to occur

248
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:48,180
and as long as we have this heightened sensitivity it's heightened Clarity to what's up in your body our minds and

249
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:56,099
thoughts then uh the intuition is not going to be a hijacked by our preferences our

250
00:43:56,099 --> 00:44:04,079
our unhelpful desires or our ego some people let go of just really trust

251
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:09,540
their intuition in this kind of way that I'm talking about but they're not really in touch with themselves very well

252
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:15,359
they're not really aware of what's happening in themselves and sometimes they do mistakes and they act

253
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:21,839
impulsively or they don't realize how much they're acting on ego or desires it just feels like they're just free and

254
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:27,180
allowing things to happen so um

255
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:35,460
so next week I'll talk about compassion and I'm hoping that this prepares the

256
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:40,859
ground that as you hear about compassion and how I'm going to talk about it that

257
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:47,160
uh you will have you will consider how to adjust the medium for how to be aware

258
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:53,540
the way to be aware of suffering in the world and to so that how you're aware

259
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:58,560
allows for something deeper to happen which is what I'll talk about tomorrow next week

260
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:04,380
and so in preparation for that if you have the time and the inclination for

261
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:11,660
this weekend as you become aware of your own Suffering The Suffering of others

262
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:17,280
explore a little this thing about the medium of awareness how are you aware

263
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:24,480
what's the location from which from which you're aware what's the me the way in which you know it is it more feeling

264
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:30,300
in the body it's more in the head with thoughts it's more from a distance more close in

265
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:35,579
which of all those is a useful way to be there and then maybe they they all have their

266
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:40,859
own use at different times and and then is there something about uh

267
00:45:40,859 --> 00:45:47,160
being with suffering that um is a radically simple so simple that

268
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:55,500
it's just suffering just compassion just presence just attention without all the crowd being

269
00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:00,680
crowded in by thoughts

270
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:06,599
uh obligation responsibilities fixing it

271
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:16,040
experiencing and being the experiencer how it is for me just allowed to be so so explore this and um

272
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:23,480
and then maybe uh you the more you can explore this over the weekend I'm hoping the more you'll understand

273
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:29,280
the uh the tremendous value of that compassion has for this path of

274
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:37,319
mindfulness and how it really can there's a very significant way to learn about mindfulness and how to um develop

275
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:43,200
on this path so thank you very much

276
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,960
