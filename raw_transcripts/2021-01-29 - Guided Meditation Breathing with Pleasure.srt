1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,559
so here you are

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:19,920
you're all each of you is there and you're here here spot your spot for

3
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,760
being here and i think we should never

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:33,600
overlook the hereness of this moment the hereness of where we

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,320
are and where we're going to meditate to be here

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:49,600
not as a coincidence not as something to overlook not as something that is insignificant

7
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,320
but rather here is the most important place for this

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:04,559
moment for this meditation and so to assume a posture

9
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,600
for being here

10
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,438
to be rooted to this place and to this time

11
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:27,840
and to feel the connection of your body to this location

12
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:37,200
the way your the weight of your body is received by whatever

13
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,240
body that's that in a sense stops the pull of

14
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,320
gravity that keeps you in this location

15
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:01,680
and to adjust the body a bit especially it's nice to adjust it so the

16
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:09,440
breathing can be a freer more relaxed more open without

17
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,920
getting tense and without straining but maybe it's something you can do with

18
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,800
a spine that frees up the front of the torso so

19
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,720
the breathing can be more easeful maybe sitting up a little

20
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:37,840
straighter in the spine

21
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,840
and then to

22
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:04,319
see if you can take some deeper breaths that are enjoyable for you to take

23
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,840
so maybe for you it's to do just a little bit deeper than

24
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:19,840
what you're already doing or maybe doing it slowly

25
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,799
maybe the feeling of depth or fullness of breathing is done more in the belly or more in the

26
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:33,519
top of the chest or middle of the chest

27
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:41,280
or maybe the sense of enjoyable fuller deeper breathing

28
00:03:41,519 --> 00:04:01,599
is a more subtle expansion of the back rib gauge or maybe there's something

29
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:09,120
pleasant about in a deep full breath the gentle pressure downward

30
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:17,840
as you breathe in the diaphragm pushes down and

31
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:26,479
pushes down the intestines and innards there and perhaps

32
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:43,840
that pushing down a gentle pushing down is a grounding here to this spot

33
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,120
and as you exhale is there any place in your body that would be

34
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:10,400
kind of pleasant or enjoyable to relax or soften

35
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:18,720
instead of maybe pleasant or enjoyable any place in your body as you exhale

36
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:25,840
it would be nice to relax

37
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,840
and then letting your breathing return to normal

38
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:07,840
and take a few breaths to familiarize yourself with your breathing

39
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:35,840
noticing the places in your body that move the most as you breathe

40
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:49,840
and where there's movement in the breathing but the movement is just light

41
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:18,560
and then once again to take a few deeper breaths gently

42
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,919
quietly not too much

43
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:30,800
if if it happens to be that you feel some resistance or holding

44
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,759
back at the top of the in-breath

45
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:45,199
see if you can relax around that place of holding resistance not ambitiously

46
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:52,560
but more as a expression of kindness to yourself and

47
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,840
a willingness to relax there

48
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:13,840
and at the end of the exhale is there also some holding back

49
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:21,680
and if so can you relax and release the end of the exhale

50
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,840
maybe the exhale is a little bit longer

51
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,839
and then again letting the breathing return to normal

52
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,240
and feel your breathing now perhaps by letting the thinking mind

53
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,640
become quieter it allows you to have more attention

54
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:09,839
when feeling the body breathing

55
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:32,880
and then ever so gently maybe just very slightly

56
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:39,200
within the range of what could be considered normal breathing see if there's some simple

57
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,079
ways to adjust your breathing to make it more pleasant

58
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:50,200
a little bit slower a little bit faster

59
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,480
a little fuller

60
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:08,000
a little bit more shallow and a smaller breath

61
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,720
maybe you find it a little bit more pleasant to breathe more fully into the belly

62
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,720
or more fully into the chest

63
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,040
or to really focus on the sensations of air going in and out through the

64
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,040
nostrils and notice

65
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,519
if if there is any feelings of pleasure or pleasantness in the breathing

66
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:07,760
that it's pleasant to breathe maybe not so much your effort to breathe

67
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,639
but the sensations are in the body of breathing

68
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:22,160
is there anything about them that feels pleasant enjoyable or comforting

69
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,839
it can be very slight

70
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,200
any small ways you can adjust around your breathing

71
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:51,600
maybe by being aware of a smaller little spot in your body where it's most pleasant

72
00:11:51,600 --> 00:12:00,560
or maybe it's a broad awareness of the body breathing over a larger spot or the whole

73
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:15,360
torso and then as you exhale

74
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:23,920
relax your body more and in order to settle into your breathing

75
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,839
settling in to be with your breathing

76
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:39,839
for these minutes we're together

77
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:54,320
and if your mind wanders off in thought when you begin again with your breathing

78
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:01,839
spend a few breaths re-establishing

79
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,839
an enjoyable breath the pleasant breathing

80
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:13,360
even if it's just one little piece of the cycle of breathing

81
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,880
or maybe just reestablish a breathing which is a

82
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,519
little bit feels a little bit better than what you were doing

83
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:34,800
every time the mind wanders off spend a little bit of time

84
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:49,839
reconnecting to whatever is good about breathing in and breathing out

85
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:45,839
let the thinking mind become quieter so you can be in your body more

86
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,079
feeling the embodied experience of

87
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,839
breathing

88
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:55,839
can you relax your belly as you breathe

89
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:10,800
maybe it's more present pleasant to breathe to breathe a little bit further behind

90
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:17,440
to feel the area just little bits in the back of where you feel breathing

91
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,880
not so much exactly in the center of your breathing area

92
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,600
but kind of like the little bit in the back of it

93
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:34,480
just behind it or in the backside of it so that maybe there's a little bit less sense of

94
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,720
control or there's a lighter [Music]

95
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:51,839
more delicate feeling of breathing

96
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:30,000
and while you're focusing on breathing so your central vision central awareness

97
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,480
is on breathing peripherally see if you can allow the

98
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,240
to have the body be allowing receptive

99
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:50,799
the body is open willing to experience

100
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,960
the influence of breathing

101
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,840
it's kind of like breathing

102
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,080
is a gentle wind

103
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,400
that spreads its influence across the

104
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,880
body or a light that's been turned on that

105
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,080
glows outwards

106
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:31,679
letting the body be receptive allowing for whatever

107
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,720
influence the focus on breathing might have

108
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:43,200
not looking for something particular just available

109
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:57,840
with breathing at the center

110
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:57,679
um quietly receiving the bodies breathing

111
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:12,158
and perhaps breathing within within whatever larger

112
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:21,520
context of pleasure or joy or contentment there might be

113
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:28,158
whatever larger feeling of wholeness

114
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:39,280
calmness so breathing is at the center of a wider field

115
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:46,640
of goodness wholeness settledness

116
00:20:47,120 --> 00:21:03,840
pleasure joy happiness

117
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:14,559
the thinking mind becomes quieter so attention can better

118
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:21,600
feel and sense the fullness of the

119
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,520
the way breathing spreads its influence out into the

120
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,840
goodness around it

121
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:45,840
the wholeness around it

122
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,960
and there might be ways that you do not feel calm or do not feel pleasure

123
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:32,080
that you're uncomfortable it's okay but there might also be in

124
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,280
addition to that around it underneath it in the middle of

125
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:44,159
it somewhere the opposite feelings

126
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,200
a wholeness a calmness that holds it all

127
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,840
lorry can accept it all

128
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:05,720
an ability to you stay gently aware of the breathing the rhythm of breathing so you're not

129
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:11,919
preoccupied by the discomfort it can be there but let it be just a

130
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:19,840
piece of the picture in the background you just breathing

131
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:28,480
and then sitting here quietly at the end of this meditation

132
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,278
is there anything that feels

133
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:46,398
more settled for you calmer for you having done this

134
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:54,960
meditation in some way or other do you feel

135
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:03,840
better than you were when you started the meditation

136
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,480
and if you do

137
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:21,520
if you if you would like you could offer

138
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:27,760
the goodness of your meditation how you're calmer more settled

139
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:39,120
maybe even a little happier peaceful offer that

140
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:45,919
for the welfare and happiness of others or dedicate it

141
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:53,840
let it be dedicated in some way or other that you use that

142
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:00,880
that it's the basis for benefiting the world out into the

143
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:09,440
world may it be a force may it be a avenue

144
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:19,840
support for bringing greater comfort and peace calm joy

145
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:26,080
love into the world

146
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:34,398
may we do that a little bit actively not just as a wish

147
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:40,240
but as an inspiration for being

148
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,158
concerned for the welfare of others

149
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,710
may it be [Music]

150
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:59,278
that this meditation is dedicated to the welfare and happiness of others

151
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,240
may all beings be happy

152
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,398
may all beings be safe

153
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,440
may all beings

154
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:26,240
be free may all beings be peaceful

155
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:37,840
and may our love and our care support that possibility

156
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:52,549
[Music]

157
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,360
you
