1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,280
so good evening

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,358
tonight's topic is joy

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,480
and you might first consider what you

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,120
feel

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,920
when you hear that word for some people

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,840
joy is almost the aim of the path

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,160
there's a sense of maybe seeking bliss

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,560
or something like that

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,360
for other people there might even be a

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,320
slight

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,719
negative connotation joy really

12
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,079
i don't know it feels a little bit

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,360
fluffy maybe denial

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,600
there's so much so many problems in the

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,399
world surely joy is a little bit

16
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,840
surface level lightweight something like

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,199
that

18
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,520
so whatever whatever your response is

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,840
to that idea i encourage you to

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,080
consider for tonight the possibility

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,479
that joy has some significant depth to

22
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,600
it

23
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,720
it's it's not lightweight actually and

24
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,560
neither is it solely

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,000
concerned with bliss and ease

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,200
it actually it's it has some substance

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,560
it's not an escape

28
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,320
from meeting suffering and

29
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,600
i'm gonna talk a bit about how it plays

30
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,360
an essential role

31
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,320
on the path to liberation we need joy

32
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,439
actually

33
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,960
it's important on our path

34
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,079
so joy is a very beautiful quality of

35
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,920
heart

36
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,640
it points toward in an essential way it

37
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,720
points toward abundance

38
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,840
and so we're going to talk about

39
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,720
several different kinds of joy tonight

40
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,479
i'm going to offer kind of an abundance

41
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,920
or a bouquet

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,799
of different experiences of joy that

43
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,200
come

44
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,280
on the path so just as an overview

45
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,799
there's appreciative joy or empathetic

46
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,319
joy that we can feel

47
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,000
for the success of others

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,200
there's meditative joy that comes

49
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,920
when the mind becomes stiller and more

50
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,319
free of the hindrances

51
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,520
and there can be joy in the past

52
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,959
in the practice in the dharma itself

53
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,640
there's even other kinds of joy than

54
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,160
that perhaps but

55
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,239
that's what we'll try to cover tonight

56
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,720
as a as i said kind of a bouquet

57
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,840
of different types

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,720
so let's start with this experience of

59
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,080
joy at the success or happiness

60
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,840
of others this is a kind of joy that's

61
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,840
also called mudita it's one of the four

62
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,480
brahmaviharas or heart qualities that we

63
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,000
cultivate on the path

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,840
the others you might be more familiar

65
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,040
with meta

66
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,040
loving kindness karuna compassion

67
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,159
and upekka equanimity those three

68
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,519
along with mudita appreciative joy

69
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,760
are the four brahmaviharas or divine

70
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,120
abodes

71
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,640
so these are relational qualities

72
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,680
and they acknowledge that we live in a

73
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,720
world

74
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,080
that does include happiness

75
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,519
we see people

76
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,080
getting what they like we see them

77
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,920
succeeding

78
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,519
we see them achieving goals and gaining

79
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,879
praise and one

80
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,400
quality of having a mature heart

81
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,519
is the ability to celebrate the joy of

82
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,319
others

83
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,599
in a simple happy natural way

84
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,360
the dalai lama said if i am happy

85
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,159
when good things happen to other people

86
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,280
billions more chances to be happy

87
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,239
so really this is a wonderful thing all

88
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,920
the time in the world there's

89
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,840
actually a lot of good things going on

90
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,760
there are acts of generosity

91
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,480
and kindness being done at every moment

92
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,079
somewhere in the world

93
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,040
and we can tap into that now if this is

94
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,120
sounding a little bit difficult

95
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,240
often one way that we can touch into

96
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,840
appreciative joy immediately is through

97
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,759
animals

98
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,479
like a dog dogs are excited about so

99
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,000
many things

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,880
and you can you can catch the excitement

101
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,000
of the dog

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,600
or watching a a kitten playing with a

103
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,160
leaf

104
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,400
in the wind that it's gotten attracted

105
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,280
to

106
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,880
something you know we don't want to

107
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,040
project too many things onto

108
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,840
animals but i think it's pretty easy to

109
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,600
tell when there's a sense of

110
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,720
of joy or excitement in an animal and we

111
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,470
can catch that

112
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,600
[Music]

113
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,720
we can catch that feeling i read a study

114
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,919
by the way that

115
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,320
cute cat videos have been shown to

116
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,919
reduce stress

117
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,039
so there you go um

118
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,199
one good thing as we're connecting with

119
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,240
joy in this

120
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,360
simple way is to start to feel

121
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,080
what joy feels like in our body you know

122
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,919
what is it like to have that

123
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,120
sense of uplift and just simple uplift

124
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,880
at someone else's joy

125
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,120
start to feel where that is in the body

126
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,880
how the energy moves

127
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,639
so that we can be familiar with it

128
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,120
and so we can experience it more often

129
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,199
it has a feeling in the mind too

130
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,160
a lightness of openness of warmth in a

131
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,360
certain way

132
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,600
so we can get familiar with that and

133
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,400
then we can

134
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,520
cultivate it for people also of course

135
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,479
and you know one way that we do this is

136
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,600
to say phrases

137
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,880
the common phrase for mutita

138
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,680
is uh may your happiness and good

139
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,639
fortune

140
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,919
continue your happiness and good fortune

141
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,120
continue so we wish well for the success

142
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,240
and happiness of others

143
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,880
when we do that we can also feel the joy

144
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,680
in our body

145
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,919
and maybe imagine an image of the person

146
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,479
being happy or joyful

147
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,520
and allow that feeling to mature

148
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,800
in us to cook in us if you will

149
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,560
another form of joy practice is to

150
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,199
evoke somehow that feeling of mudita

151
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,360
through an image or a phrase

152
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,319
and then um kind of drop the object that

153
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,000
we were thinking of and actually just

154
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,759
radiate that feeling from our heart

155
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,919
concentrate it into the heart center and

156
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:44,800
just

157
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,080
feel it like a light shining from inside

158
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,000
it's a wonderful way to cultivate medita

159
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,319
so it's natural of course that as we try

160
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,840
to cultivate

161
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,680
appreciative or empathetic joy we will

162
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,440
run into what gets in the way of that

163
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,280
and that's this is normal it doesn't

164
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,759
mean the practice isn't working

165
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,680
and you can imagine that the what's

166
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,520
called the far enemy or the thing that

167
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,919
really opposes our ability to feel

168
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,199
mutita

169
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,720
is envy so somebody else

170
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,440
gets some success or gains something and

171
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,639
we think

172
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,280
well why did they get that they didn't

173
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,639
deserve that

174
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,960
or we think i should have gotten that

175
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,960
how come i didn't get that instead or

176
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,919
also

177
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,680
and so there's a you know a turning

178
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,919
toward the self or somehow some

179
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,680
envy and so um

180
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,599
it's helpful just to notice that this

181
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,960
blocks our appreciative joy

182
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,160
one thing that fuels envy and that

183
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,400
the reason that we might have such

184
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,280
feelings

185
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,639
is there can be an idea that in order to

186
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,840
be happy

187
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,879
we have to get something and so

188
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,560
seeing somebody else get something we

189
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,080
would feel like

190
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,280
i didn't get something and so but if we

191
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,080
can learn to

192
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,080
feel this joy for others receiving

193
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,560
we feel a great amount of relief we can

194
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,199
realize

195
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,400
oh actually i can be happy

196
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,199
without getting something there is a

197
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,039
kind of happiness that doesn't come

198
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,919
from that and so this is actually quite

199
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,520
a wonderful discovery

200
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,680
for us like the dalai lama says it

201
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,440
greatly increases our chances of

202
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,000
happiness in the world

203
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,800
now we don't of course have to feel joy

204
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,399
at somebody else's joy

205
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,360
it may be that they're feeling joy about

206
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,560
something that's a little bit

207
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,080
unwholesome or that we

208
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,919
suspect is not going to be good for them

209
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,160
in the long run so it's not like you

210
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,880
have to have to experience joy if

211
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,600
someone else is feeling joyful

212
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,200
you know maybe if we see that it's not

213
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
leading in a good direction compassion

214
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,279
would be a better response so

215
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,320
just so you're aware of that there is

216
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,760
also what's called a near

217
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,440
enemy of mutita of appreciative joy

218
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,800
and that is um called

219
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,519
giddiness it's not a word we use very

220
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,800
often but the

221
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,560
you can get the sense of it it's like a

222
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,480
sort of over-the-top

223
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,040
uh excitement about something and

224
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,480
getting caught up in somebody else's uh

225
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,680
pleasure and joy such that we lose our

226
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,880
own balance

227
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,959
you know we fall into it and we're no

228
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,000
longer

229
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,920
aware present centered in in ourselves

230
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,279
um so our own heart

231
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,680
so you can feel you can feel when that's

232
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,399
happening

233
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,800
we've probably all experienced that

234
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,680
tumbling

235
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,399
feeling of of giddiness and so that's

236
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,320
just be aware that's not really

237
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,600
that's not really mudita um

238
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,000
so overall mudita is of course a great

239
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,839
way to reduce our self-focus

240
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,839
like all the brahmaviharas are all of

241
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,320
the heart qualities are

242
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,120
so we um undermine you know this belief

243
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,440
that we have sometimes subtly that

244
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,920
we need to be receiving and getting and

245
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,920
you know being praised and bolstered all

246
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,079
the time in order to feel happy

247
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,920
we don't actually there are many other

248
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,600
forms of of happiness available and it's

249
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,160
an expansive feeling of heart to be able

250
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,640
to tap into mudita

251
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,000
so much recommended as a cultivation

252
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,800
now in addition um there's a whole other

253
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,120
flavor of joy that comes from

254
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,480
meditation and this is something that

255
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,760
the mind starts to feel when it has less

256
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,640
of the

257
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,839
hindrances and less caught up in sense

258
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,560
pleasures

259
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,399
and sort of our usual pursuits

260
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,279
so this comes again through sitting

261
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,480
practice it's called

262
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,240
pt p-i-t-i and i'll get to

263
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,000
to it in a moment often when people

264
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,120
start sitting there's not a lot of joy

265
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,560
in the sitting and that can be because

266
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,440
we're busy dealing with body pain or

267
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,519
we've somehow taken on sitting as an

268
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,399
obligation or a chore and we're just

269
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,279
trying to

270
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,680
be with the breath or bring the mind

271
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,200
back all the time

272
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,160
it's a sort of work where's the joy

273
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,320
where's the joy in that

274
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,240
but there is an accessible way into

275
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,519
meditative joy

276
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,399
we practiced it during the meditation

277
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,760
which is that

278
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,279
even being mindful has a slight amount

279
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,800
of pleasure to it

280
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
you know it's not our usual kind of

281
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,240
sense pleasure like

282
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,279
eating chocolate or something but

283
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,760
being present as opposed to being lost

284
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,440
or caught up in something

285
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,560
is actually slightly pleasant it's a

286
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,320
very subtle kind of joy

287
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,279
being there being present and we can tap

288
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,399
into that

289
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,480
as i said in the meditation even when

290
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,000
what we're mindful of

291
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,240
is something unpleasant or a little

292
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,600
painful or

293
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,480
something the fact that we're present

294
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,320
for it we can start to appreciate

295
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,120
that that's better than being lost and

296
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,760
so that's an easy accessible way to

297
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,560
to start and so every time you get lost

298
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,880
which we do all the time in meditation

299
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,680
when the mind comes back we wake up oh

300
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,240
right

301
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,800
meditation mindful we notice at that

302
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,480
moment ah it feels better

303
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,200
there's a clarity it isn't there when we

304
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,519
were

305
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,760
lost and that clarity is slightly

306
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,920
pleasant then we tune into that

307
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,839
that the mind wants to be present a

308
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,120
little bit more often

309
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,880
so that's our first little taste of

310
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,959
meditative joy actually

311
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,160
just being present and then

312
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,720
it's also um just fine as we did in the

313
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,560
sitting to

314
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,440
as we start to feel some degree of ease

315
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:53,760
or

316
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,959
peace or softening in the body

317
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,480
um slowing down of the mind anything

318
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:00,959
that's

319
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,839
that's some direction toward well-being

320
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,079
it's totally fine to

321
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,480
notice that and appreciate it we don't

322
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,360
need to grab

323
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,839
onto it and try to make it bigger and

324
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:13,279
try to hold on to it

325
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,920
that will only cause more difficulty but

326
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,279
you can appreciate

327
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,000
those good feelings that start to come

328
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,600
in meditation and just let them be

329
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,160
nourished

330
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,200
by our attention to them let them

331
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,120
be naturally present that's also a nice

332
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,399
way to

333
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,959
slowly cultivate meditative joy

334
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,920
and then we will eventually at some

335
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,360
point

336
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,160
start to feel some genuine sense of

337
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,880
well-being

338
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,240
emerging from meditation you know we

339
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,160
know that it's coming because we're

340
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,440
sitting there

341
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,480
with some seclusion

342
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,839
of the body some seclusion of the mind

343
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,560
we start to feel an internal sense of

344
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,760
well-being

345
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,600
and it's often felt most strongly in the

346
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,920
body we may even feel

347
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,680
some kinds of pt meditative joy

348
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,120
feel almost like tingling or energy in

349
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,320
the body

350
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,720
sometimes the hair stands on end it's

351
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,040
kind of um

352
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,880
delightful these little feelings that we

353
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,560
have and then it can also settle a

354
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,279
little bit more and be more pervasive

355
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,399
but this is um this is a wonderful

356
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,240
development when it starts to come in

357
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,079
meditation and maybe you'll have it once

358
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:30,639
and then

359
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,199
not for a while it's not like it comes

360
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,880
and then stays forever

361
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,800
but just start to notice when this these

362
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,560
feelings come

363
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,720
um one way that we can know that what

364
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,240
we're having is meditative joy is that

365
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,320
full balanced pt leads to

366
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,440
tranquility now this is not our usual

367
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,240
mode with

368
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,240
joy right it's not your usual kind of

369
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,320
excitement which tends to agitate the

370
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,279
mind

371
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,480
meditative joy is pleasant in and of

372
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:00,959
itself

373
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,680
and it leads to tranquility it's almost

374
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,800
like there's a little

375
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,839
core of tranquility with this joy

376
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,480
wrapped around it and we touch the joy

377
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,480
first and as we settle into it and

378
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:12,959
deepen

379
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,920
into it we then touch the tranquility

380
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,920
that's at its heart

381
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,480
so that's um you might reflect for a

382
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,279
moment do you

383
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,399
know anything of this kind of joy even a

384
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,199
little bit a sense of settledness and

385
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,120
well-being that can come

386
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,800
through the meditation so mostly

387
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,920
meditative joy

388
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,360
comes as the mind softens and becomes

389
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,279
more continuously mindful

390
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,360
we don't have to try to cultivate it in

391
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,800
fact that's

392
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,000
sometimes counterproductive it emerges

393
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,199
from a mind that is soft and

394
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,000
more or less continually mindful so

395
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
here's a nice simile from the sutas that

396
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,839
i wanted to read

397
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,480
about this

398
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,160
just like a lake with spring water

399
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,519
welling up from within having no inflow

400
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,920
from the east west north or south and

401
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,279
with the skies

402
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,320
not supplying rain so that the cool

403
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,839
fountain of water

404
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,800
welling up from the lake would permeate

405
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,440
and

406
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,800
pervade suffuse and fill it with cool

407
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,759
waters

408
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,839
there being no part of the lake

409
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,560
unpervaded by the cool waters

410
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,560
even so the meditator permeates

411
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,279
this very body with the rapture and

412
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,000
pleasure

413
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,839
born of concentration or of composure

414
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,480
so there's a sense like okay lost in all

415
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,120
the words

416
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,399
a sense of a lake with a a well

417
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,519
within it that is bringing something up

418
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,560
it's coming from

419
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,320
meditation itself so what is the value

420
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,120
of this

421
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,519
joy there are a number of benefits of

422
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,360
course but the the main one is

423
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,199
this deep sense of well-being that

424
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,959
starts to train the mind

425
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,440
that something besides sense pleasures

426
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,400
and thinking

427
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,798
and our usual ways of trying to get

428
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,600
pleasure

429
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,959
there's something deeper than that

430
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,319
that's actually more satisfying

431
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,839
this is from the damopada tasting the

432
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,480
flavor

433
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,839
of solitude and peace one becomes

434
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,199
free of distress and evil drinking the

435
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,839
flavor

436
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,880
of dharma joy

437
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,720
so it starts out as talking about a

438
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,039
concentration the settling of mind that

439
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,559
leads to this joy

440
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,960
the solitude and peace who gives the

441
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,160
clue to that

442
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,320
but then this last line drinking the

443
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,720
flavor of dharma joy

444
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,480
that's going to lead us into the next

445
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,840
section i want to

446
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,320
talk now turn now to the kind of joy

447
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,039
that can come from the practice itself

448
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,520
of joy in the practice and the path in

449
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,640
the dharma

450
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,640
and there isn't just one word for this

451
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,919
like mudita or

452
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,840
pt it comes from a whole bunch of

453
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,679
different places so now we really get to

454
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,799
expand our

455
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,000
bouquet of different kinds of joy

456
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,840
i'll go through some ways that the

457
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,000
practice itself

458
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,919
generates joy so it's great i love this

459
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:14,799
third kind

460
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,520
of joy that we're talking about so one

461
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,240
one way

462
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,720
that it can come is through ethical

463
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,919
conduct

464
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,280
um this isn't anything complicated or

465
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,320
heavy

466
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,360
or rigid it's that when we've generally

467
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,799
behaved well

468
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,039
you know we've said and done things that

469
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,000
were

470
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,200
wholesome enough uh we've get to the end

471
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,799
of the day and we feel good

472
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,679
about how that went as sort of a sense

473
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,600
of joy it's actually called the bliss of

474
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,880
blamelessness

475
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,200
we don't need to absolutize that or make

476
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,559
it you know

477
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,400
blamelessness sounds a little bit too

478
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,480
idealistic to me

479
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,240
but essentially we can get to the end of

480
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,720
the day and feel like it went okay

481
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,919
that's actually very precious feeling

482
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,600
it nourishes us to realize that we've

483
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,080
generally said and done and even thought

484
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,960
things that were

485
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,559
good throughout the day

486
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,760
it also comes from having confidence or

487
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,760
faith if you will in the past so when we

488
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,360
have a moment where we realize that

489
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,280
we're confident that what we're doing is

490
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,799
the right thing you know

491
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,400
i have times when i realize i'm just

492
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,720
grateful that i have a path you know i'm

493
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,960
grateful that i have some way of

494
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,799
managing the things that come up during

495
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,799
the day and my mind and my body

496
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,960
that's right i have a path and when i

497
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,320
reflect on that

498
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,240
i feel a certain kind of joy just

499
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,640
emerges naturally kind of a delight

500
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,679
oh yeah good there's there's support

501
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,039
there's a way to deal with

502
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,880
life interestingly

503
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,400
joy can also come from renunciation

504
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,720
now renunciation is not usually our

505
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,559
favorite word

506
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,360
but it really just means letting go and

507
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,159
in this case

508
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,360
it might it could mean uh we don't have

509
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,080
so much conventional focus on

510
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,679
stuff and wealth and prestige and

511
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:16,559
identity

512
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,480
it's like we're not so wrapped up in

513
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,200
those usual kinds of pursuits

514
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,360
that the advertisements and marketers

515
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,039
tell us will make us happy

516
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,440
when we realize not really that's not

517
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,679
really the path to happiness

518
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,840
we can start to feel a subtle kind of

519
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,440
joy just in

520
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,039
the simplicity of living a more balanced

521
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,480
way the mind gets clearer so

522
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,000
the buddha describes a certain kind of

523
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,320
joy that arises from

524
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,720
if you will the wisdom of renunciation

525
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,559
i'll read a little bit about that

526
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,600
so seeing things as they are

527
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,039
so he says when by knowing the

528
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,159
impermanence

529
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,440
change fading away and cessation

530
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,720
of safe forms could be any of the five

531
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,080
sense objects but

532
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,360
material things and one sees

533
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,159
as it actually is with proper wisdom

534
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:12,480
that

535
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,679
forms are all impermanent and subject to

536
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,039
change

537
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,559
joy arises such joy as this

538
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,320
is called the joy based on renunciation

539
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,840
that's interesting so it's a little

540
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,320
subtle

541
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,720
but it means that you know if i if i'm

542
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,400
using this cup

543
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,080
and you know it's a nice cup

544
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,919
holds water but i know at the same time

545
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,799
that i'm looking at it that it's subject

546
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,080
to breakage

547
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,159
it will not it's not a permanent source

548
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:47,760
of happiness for me

549
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,960
uh i like it right now but this

550
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,039
wouldn't be wise to place all of my

551
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,799
happiness in this cup

552
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,799
there's certain subtle joy that comes

553
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,240
from knowing that

554
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,480
you know there's some wisdom there and

555
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,559
maybe a cup is somewhat trivial example

556
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,360
but

557
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,280
we can think about how the path and the

558
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,640
practice allow us to

559
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,840
realize not take the bait of things in

560
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,559
the world

561
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,480
quite so easily of course we still do

562
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,760
sometimes but

563
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,640
there can be a certain joy in having

564
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,919
that strength knowing

565
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,159
okay i know that all things change

566
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,280
they're going to pass

567
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,200
i shouldn't rely on this completely

568
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
so if you do feel that if you have some

569
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,840
sense of that in some areas of your life

570
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,799
take joy in that not everyone knows that

571
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,720
it's a kind of wisdom and kind of joy

572
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,360
so

573
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,520
we should get also to a question that

574
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,880
people sometimes

575
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,400
ask at this point which is why

576
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,480
or how can we be joyful in a world with

577
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,919
pain you know in the face of pain why be

578
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,360
joyful

579
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,880
so first off let me ask

580
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,960
why not seriously why not

581
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,520
so i do encounter people who think it's

582
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,600
some kind of a betrayal

583
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,720
to be happy or joyful or peaceful or

584
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,000
light

585
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,480
when there is so much suffering in the

586
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,320
world

587
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,240
or in a difficult situation you know why

588
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,400
why wouldn't you just fall into that and

589
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,400
get agitated and worried like everybody

590
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,799
else to show that you care

591
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,880
but i would again ask a little question

592
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,080
betrayal

593
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,919
of what trail of what so the buddhist

594
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,280
teachings

595
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,640
point us toward a happiness that is

596
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,440
unconditioned what does that mean that's

597
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,679
a word we don't use very often either

598
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,600
but it means a kind of happiness that is

599
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,880
not subject to

600
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
the conditions of the world so not

601
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,279
dependent on things being a certain way

602
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,200
you can be happy if they're this way or

603
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,440
that way or this other way

604
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,120
and it doesn't mean that at every moment

605
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,679
we're skipping down the aisles and

606
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,679
laughing that wouldn't be appropriate in

607
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,120
every situation

608
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,960
but there's a way in which we have a

609
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,440
certain happiness of heart

610
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,720
that can be present with anything

611
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,760
in various ways uh appropriate to that

612
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,880
situation

613
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,880
so we can look for that in our heart we

614
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,480
can look for ways that

615
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,880
we can find joy at the very least we

616
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,480
have the joy of presence

617
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,640
if we're present for suffering yeah we

618
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,000
may feel compassion

619
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,919
for the suffering concern

620
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,520
wishing to help and in that in that deep

621
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,240
presence or that wisdom of being there

622
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,039
for something

623
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,640
there is actually a little bit of joy

624
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,240
there's still that

625
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,279
that joy of presence subtle but it's

626
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,400
there

627
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,679
so jack cornfield says it this way in

628
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,880
joy we are not afraid of pleasure we do

629
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,640
not mistakenly believe

630
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,799
it is disloyal to the suffering of the

631
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,679
world

632
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,520
to honor the happiness we have been

633
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,799
given

634
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,440
so if we have some happiness in our life

635
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,880
we're not being disloyal

636
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,559
to appreciate and enjoy that

637
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,679
or this from archbishop

638
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,039
desmond tutu wonderful minister

639
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,640
from south africa it helps

640
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,080
no one if you sacrifice your joy

641
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,200
because others are suffering we

642
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,440
people who care must be filled with joy

643
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,279
so that others recognize that caring

644
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,080
helping and being generous are not a

645
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,279
burden

646
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,120
they are a joy how about that

647
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,880
we people who care we people who care

648
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,600
must be filled with joy so that others

649
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,200
recognize

650
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,440
caring is a joy it's so valuable

651
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,080
to see radiant joyful

652
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,840
helpers of the world and

653
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,159
so inspiring and necessary you know

654
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:09,039
uplifting

655
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,400
offer some hope some vision

656
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,440
even in the face of suffering

657
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,600
my friend spent some time in south

658
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,960
africa

659
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,320
and she was fortunate enough to be

660
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,000
working at an art museum

661
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
where archbishop tutu came

662
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,400
for some event that was being held there

663
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,200
and

664
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,200
somehow she managed to be standing just

665
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,520
about six feet away from him

666
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,640
and she said he lit up the room

667
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,760
he was made of pure joy so

668
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,000
there's just something so valuable

669
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,039
in this quality and so many ways that we

670
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:49,760
can

671
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,440
touch into it in our practice

672
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,000
there's the medita the appreciative joy

673
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,880
for others

674
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,120
there's the meditative joy that can come

675
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,240
from settling the mind there's the joy

676
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,200
and the path

677
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,559
practice the dharma itself that

678
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,559
can fuel us through times in our

679
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,240
practice that are difficult

680
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,640
or through meeting the world and its

681
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,400
difficulties

682
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,320
and in the end um

683
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,880
joy is one of the factors of awakening

684
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,600
there are seven factors of awakening

685
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,880
one of them is right in the middle

686
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,240
is joy and it

687
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,520
is a necessary component for awakening

688
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,000
so that we have a mind with some degree

689
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,200
of lightness

690
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,840
some happiness that is coming from the

691
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,240
heart

692
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,360
from the path itself and when the mind

693
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,679
is in a state like that

694
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,159
as well as possessing a number of other

695
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,840
wholesome factors

696
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,440
that's when it can awaken so i encourage

697
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,720
you to

698
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,000
touch into this very beautiful quality

699
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,960
that's accessible in a number of ways

700
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,240
through seeing other people

701
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,520
through the presence of mindfulness

702
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,000
through reflection through the settling

703
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,360
of the mind

704
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,720
and through wisdom through ethics almost

705
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,360
everything can be a door to joy

706
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,000
if we are looking for it and are open to

707
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,440
that

708
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,799
so to whatever degree

709
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,559
