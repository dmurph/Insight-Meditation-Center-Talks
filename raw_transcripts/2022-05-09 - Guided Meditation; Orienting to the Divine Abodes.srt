1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:06,480
okay so welcome welcome to you all uh good morning

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,080
afternoon wherever you are um

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,000
yeah so my name is matthew brent silver and um happy to be with you today

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
gil asked me to step in for this week as he's away teaching a retreat

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,439
and um so we'll we'll um we'll sit and i'll

6
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,200
offer some reflections after that um

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,480
as we we begin i i just uh looked to see what what gill had done on

8
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,680
friday he was talking about two two bodies the body

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,960
of which we're aware the body which we're not aware the thinking mind

10
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:02,160
or that is uh aware and not aware and um

11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,360
yeah so we settle into awareness we just kind of just as we begin

12
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:17,439
subtle but enormous difference just to bathe the circuits of body and mind

13
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,439
in awareness so just

14
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,400
settle in in this way

15
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,519
so we relax whatever can be relaxed

16
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,840
area around the eyes or the jaw

17
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,640
shoulders or the belly

18
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,599
relax our hands and open

19
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,239
the hands energetically

20
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,159
relax whatever can be relaxed and any tension that remains we permit

21
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,400
to remain

22
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,479
sometimes i'll give the instruction to stop try

23
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,840
to stop being aware

24
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,840
whatever aspect of awareness you can't stop

25
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,360
just rest there

26
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,400
part of practice is directing our attention

27
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,160
why is attention appropriate attention

28
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:59,400
so we direct it to the breath or the body to feeling or sound

29
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:12,759
but sometimes in in our choreography of the attention

30
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,120
we miss this dimension of awareness that

31
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:26,039
we don't hold up and we can't stop

32
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:45,000
that which doesn't require your effort to arise

33
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,440
whatever can't be stopped just rest there

34
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,260
suffering typically requires that our attention be glued to something that we be

35
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:41,959
[Music] identified with something

36
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,839
so we start to discover that whatever is the case whatever our life

37
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:11,519
is in this moment when we are aware awake

38
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:18,839
something else is always also true

39
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,519
in this space

40
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:58,040
this space makes uh all the difference

41
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,920
subtle but also dramatic

42
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,920
just to know one's life

43
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,399
as winds blowing through the space of awareness

44
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:36,799
all the familiar ground from which we

45
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:45,840
strategize and fret is just folded into awareness

46
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,400
and just keep folding our life into awareness

47
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,399
it's good to sit with you

48
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:00,480
so um this is uh

49
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:06,559
maslow 1961 and a short

50
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:14,240
reflection on peak experience so he wrote

51
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:22,080
the goal of self actualization seems to be simultaneously

52
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:27,120
an end goal in itself and a transitional goal

53
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:32,240
a rite of passage a step along the path

54
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:39,679
to the transcendence of identity this is like saying its function

55
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:48,000
is to erase itself its function is to erase itself self

56
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:56,799
actualization self-cultivation points to something greater in other words

57
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:04,600
it erases itself it erases itself and it points to something

58
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:11,440
maybe [Music] maybe we even say enlightenment

59
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:19,080
erases itself and points to something

60
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,480
what might it point to i think it points

61
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:33,840
to love when um

62
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:40,960
when the self is not a preoccupation what is left

63
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:47,440
is everything else what's left is everything else

64
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:55,679
and in that context love becomes a much more natural

65
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,880
we're we're really we're developing a practice a way of

66
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:09,279
being that feels very very natural love feels natural renunciation feels

67
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:16,080
natural samadhi feels natural the awareness feels natural

68
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:22,720
and that's important yeah this practice is meant to feel natural

69
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,760
it may be hard it may be rigorously hard at times but it's meant

70
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:35,120
to feel natural and we hear so much about choice in in

71
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:41,679
mindfulness to choose a response rather than a reaction for

72
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:47,120
example and i

73
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:53,120
honestly don't notice that i make better choices

74
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:59,120
it's more like my options are much better

75
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:06,320
it's more like i don't find myself kind of backed into karmic corners where there's

76
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:13,200
duke in every direction suffering in every direction

77
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:21,360
this is not a um a state based practice it can sound that way at times like

78
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:29,760
we're trying to engineer create state states a momentary state of something

79
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,519
but we're really developing wholesome traits

80
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,000
traits don't need or effort to be maintained

81
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,840
that's what i was pointing to in a way in the kind of that quality the

82
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:55,679
effortlessness the the dimension of awareness that you can't turn on or off

83
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:01,279
don't it doesn't need your effort to be maintained yeah

84
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:07,679
we're in the same way we're developing traits that don't need your effort to be

85
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:14,320
maintained i would say we're developing a trait of love

86
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:21,280
a trait of love so where where does the mind rest you

87
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:28,079
know what what's the what's the default position of our attention where

88
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:34,638
it's kind of like asking where do you live where do you live where does your attention live when you

89
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:42,399
don't need to [Music] do your life where does your mind go

90
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:48,398
and it tends to be a heavy mixture of self-referential thought

91
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:55,839
curating the image that others have of us curating the image we have of ourselves

92
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:01,680
i am this not that it tends to go to

93
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,800
the future which is gripping and

94
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,160
we predict and simulate futures we try to strategize

95
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:17,200
a way through samsara a way through this realm of the realm of threat and

96
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:24,560
opportunity and in that kind of that little

97
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:32,079
bubble of self-referential thought strategizing it feels very much like kind of little

98
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:39,280
little me contending with big anisha you know big uncertainty

99
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,640
this enormous intimidating world

100
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:51,359
and some of that strategizing and prediction

101
00:35:51,359 --> 00:36:00,400
and simulating is adaptive no doubt but we probably go quite a bit overboard

102
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:08,240
where else might we live where else might the mind rest

103
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,640
yeah to what baseline might the mind return

104
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,079
what might become the kind of default position of our

105
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,079
attention

106
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:33,040
buddhist suggestion is that perhaps it's the the brahma viharas

107
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:41,838
the the divine abodes uh the theme for this this week

108
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:51,040
so love and kindness kind of warmth compassion shared joy equanimity

109
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:58,079
these places for the heart to rest all expressions of

110
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:02,720
non-clinging facets of love

111
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:09,599
i think of love as um

112
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:19,520
like um like our our uh like our nervous system just longing

113
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,000
for the dharma

114
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,800
yeah when i really consider okay what what is um what does the dharma feel like what does

115
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,480
this path feel like to me just me it feels like relinquishment

116
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:44,079
and in the wake of that relinquishment kind of quiet love

117
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:51,599
and so we have these four brahmaviharas these facets of love

118
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:58,800
and if i had to propose a fifth brahma bahara gil has not authorized me to do

119
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,720
this but if i had to propose a fifth if that was my contribution to uh

120
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:10,160
american buddhist discourse the fifth brahmavihara would be

121
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:17,680
something like um puttering i think like oh yeah before that pretty

122
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:23,040
much takes care of it but i just i need one more just

123
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:31,960
puttering sometimes that's the place to rest for me

124
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:38,320
so these um these places of dwelling they're meant

125
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,440
to be varied enough so that one of them

126
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:49,920
one of them is always a good place for the heart to rest one of them

127
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:56,160
no matter what's happening in this moment one of those forces is medicine

128
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:05,359
the warmth the compassion the joy the joy the equanimity the peace one of them

129
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:10,720
yeah is is a is medicine a birth a death

130
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:16,880
um a marriage or a divorce a war or a peace

131
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,160
one of the brahma vahras has your back

132
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,440
there's no there's no control in these mind states

133
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:35,680
clinging is painful and um

134
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:41,440
trying to control it's it's painful and it's really important to get that in

135
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:48,240
our bones like clinging is is painful we can kind of take that on faith we

136
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:54,160
hear that in dharma talks but we actually have to know that for ourselves we have

137
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:00,480
to sort of run into the dead end of clinging enough times with enough vivid

138
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:07,920
awareness that we sense the pain associated with it

139
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:14,079
and that doesn't mean that doesn't mean that the best medicine is always to let

140
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:21,920
go it doesn't mean the best medicine is always to let go but clinging is so

141
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:29,920
painful we get worried you know if i don't cling

142
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,040
maybe i i won't get what i want

143
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:41,760
and maybe that's so but you get what you actually

144
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,480
need just peace

145
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:54,480
so metta um loving kindness this is this is love in

146
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:00,319
the face of goodness maybe we'd say compassion karuna love in

147
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:07,040
the face of suffering mudita sympathetic joy love in the face

148
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:12,640
of happiness and upeka

149
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:18,960
equanimity as love in the face of the ungovernable

150
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:24,720
endless nature of samsara this realm

151
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:35,520
when when you consider the state of sentience you know

152
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:44,160
just pleasure and pain the waves of pleasure and pain being human is like this

153
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,599
uh love becomes just one of the most plausible responses

154
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:58,240
to that predicament and as we'll see some some brahmavihara

155
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:04,800
practice highlights love and sometimes the practice highlights

156
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,760
everything that is not love but needs love

157
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:17,599
and just to bathe in this kind of this love that is not

158
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:23,520
born of clinging that is not seeking to control

159
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:30,480
but just that is deeply hearing really you know it um

160
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,160
sometimes it just takes a moment of abiding in that

161
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:43,359
to pierce a day or a month or a year or a life of

162
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,838
pain

163
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,119
so michelle michelle mcdonald

00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:04,079
a beautiful teacher on this uh in this realm of of met uh

165
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:10,160
um she once um described this yogi who a

166
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:16,480
long time dedicated practitioner and and

167
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:23,359
and loving kindness for herself just felt impossible just so remote you know like

168
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:30,800
just just like bizarre thought to actually express this kind of care for oneself

169
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,560
and trying over not months but years of practice right

170
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:42,079
years of practice and then during uh

171
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:50,078
one session of a silent retreat silent retreat in the silent hall

172
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:57,040
this yogi suddenly yelled out i could feel it

173
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:03,520
i could it was so sweet i could feel it for myself she yelled it out in the hole

174
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:09,560
right um

175
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:15,920
you're not allowed to yell it out in the dharma hall as sweet as it is

176
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:22,560
but um we can uh we can all yell it out on youtube yeah

177
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:28,160
i can feel it for myself

178
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:39,280
