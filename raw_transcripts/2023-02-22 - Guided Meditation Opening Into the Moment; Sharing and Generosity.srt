allow your gaze to soften

your eyes

allowing the breathing to return to normal

19
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,400
maybe a slight smile to come to the lips

20
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:31,520
that softens and relaxes the muscles around the mouth and the face

21
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,760
and softening the tongue

22
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:50,580
softening the eyes the face the tongue sends a message message to the rest of the body but it's

23
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:57,739
okay to relax the parasympathetic rest

24
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,280

[Music]

84
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:51,740
so greetings dear Sangha good morning

85
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:59,220
and today today we're going to continue on the theme of this week which is

86
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:05,340
qualities that the Buddha taught that will improve both inner and outer

87
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:11,399
Harmony over the course of this week in the last two days we've talked about

88
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:17,059
mindfulness and wisdom of benefiting self

89
00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:24,419
others self and others in the world in our practice through intention and

90
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:30,559
reflection on how we show up and yesterday we talked about the

91
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:38,220
individual and relational benefits of kindness loving kindness compassion

92
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:43,860
good will and today's topic is sharing

93
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:52,019
just like back in kindergarten when you used to share lunch or shared stickers or treats

94
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:57,779
it's also known in um through the translations as

95
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:02,880
non-stinginess generosity

96
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,919
and these are qualities kind of a suite of related qualities that naturally

97
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:14,838
emerge from mindfulness meta wisdom

98
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:22,378
sobikuboti renders the poly of this quality in the Sarnia dhamma the

99
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:29,040
principles of cordiality as to use in common what has been

100
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:34,560
received to use in common what has been received

101
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:40,618
and that's perhaps a nice reminder that some of the fundamentals we have in life

102
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:47,520
we've received without asking without making it happen

103
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:56,780
life itself we did not will it water air sunshine

104
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:01,339
nature offers all of this freely

105
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:08,119
knits the basis on which all else is received right

106
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:15,020
so to share to share without reservation is

107
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:21,420
sujatos translation this kind of sharing is a way of

108
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:28,260
building friendship creating closeness just think about in all cultures all

109
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:36,540
over the world breaking bread together or sharing a bowl of rice together is a way of building social connection

110
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:44,940
and often a way of inspiring reciprocity too right this kind of generosity and reciprocity

111
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:50,700
was woven into the culture of the Buddha and his followers it's a tradition that

112
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:56,880
lasts to this day and it's been around for millennia can imagine

113
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:04,440
back in Ancient India the monastics supported laypeople citizens with teaching presence wisdom

114
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:13,039
advice and the way people would support the monastics with food and requisites

115
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:21,480
third Psalm that kind of reciprocity and sharing persists now it's really touching to see

116
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:27,420
it in Asian countries especially but the tier here in California here in the United States

117
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:34,020
all over the world you can imagine

118
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:39,720
that in a generosity dependent group like the ancient Sangha of the Buddha's

119
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:47,099
followers generosity and sharing were really important very dependent upon others for

120
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:53,280
the meal that ends up in your bowl and maybe your friend doesn't get enough you share with them

121
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:59,700
there's a story of one young monastic I'm just going to call him puku

122
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:06,660
who had really learned this well early on so he had never met the Buddha but was

123
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:13,380
completely inspired by the teachings that he had heard that sort of rippled through India through other followers

124
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:20,579
and he had received teachings from one of these and ordained as a monk and was practicing with a lot of

125
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:27,780
sincerity and was inspired to go up to North India traveling by foot to

126
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:33,420
join the crowds to hear the Buddha teaching so the way that worked the way it still

127
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:39,240
works if monastic's do this kind of wandering practice is there

128
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:46,200
um asking or being invited to sleep in people's backyards in a garage and a

129
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:51,960
shed under an overhang as they move around

130
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:57,359
and so fuku had received permission from a friendly Merchant in some Village

131
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:04,260
somewhere to set up for the night in the woodshed and so

132
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:09,900
he and his few belongings were there and right about the time maybe sundown

133
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:16,260
another stranger came to the door and politely asked said the merchant said

134
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:23,820
that if it's okay with you I might stay here too total stranger puku

135
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:30,420
just bowed smiled and said yes welcome shared his space

136
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:35,940
and the two of them turns out we're both in this tradition of the Buddha's early

137
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:43,859
teachings and they set up in opposite corners of the shed and both of them sat up and

138
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:49,260
practiced most of the night and pooka's practice was on fire he was

139
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:54,900
sitting and this stranger was quite impressed

140
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:01,500
with the strength of his practice and the open-hearted generous non-stingy

141
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:06,680
nature of his sharing of the space but little he had

142
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:15,180
well the stranger turns out was the Buddha and come morning when they both woke

143
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:22,260
he began without introducing himself he just asked would you like to receive some teachings and puku said yes of

144
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:29,099
course and the Buddha began to expound on his teachings and at some point not

145
00:39:29,099 --> 00:39:36,359
very far in puku realized who was talking to him and he was just overcome with gratitude

146
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:42,420
Joy so in his travels to go see this famed

147
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:48,300
esteemed teacher amidst the crowds his generosity allowed for

148
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:54,800
this beautiful meeting one on one sharing of the Dharma

149
00:39:56,339 --> 00:40:04,020
so you just never know what kind of beauty might open up

150
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:09,800
through an invitation through a generosity

151
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,920
this kind of sharing can take many forms right in the Buddha's case it was the

152
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:22,020
sharing of physical space time teaching

153
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:28,020
it can also be an expression of respect to share attention or share credit with

154
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:34,320
another person it can be the generosity of receiving

155
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:41,660
feedback honestly and adjusting my behavior or my manner

156
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:48,720
this is a kind of generosity of spirit generosity of spirit towards our own

157
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,420
experience and towards the experience of others

158
00:40:54,660 --> 00:41:00,900
it's a kind open way of seeing Humanity

159
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:06,599
the good qualities and the foibles our own and others internal and external

160
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:09,859
personal and relational

161
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:18,480
you can even be an act of generosity to be vulnerable enough to share our

162
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:24,000
vulnerability enough to receive others generosity

163
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,099
modern science Bears this out it might seem counter-intuitive but allowing

164
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:35,540
other people to be generous builds trust it builds friendship and relationships that doesn't mean

165
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:41,640
grabbing and asking or demanding but to

166
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:47,220
be open be real be allowing and be open to the generosity and the beauty of

167
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:52,260
others it helps build relationships it helps

168
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:58,920
build trust and from a Dharma perspective allowing others to be generous

169
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:04,740
is generous because it allows them to build this very beneficial quality of

170
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:10,560
heart and mind and spirit generosity non-stinginess isn't just

171
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:16,859
reciprocity as beautiful as reciprocity is it's also an open hand

172
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:22,800
a letting go and that that is a powerful foundation

173
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:28,578
for the deeper forms of letting go into Liberation itself

174
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:36,000
perhaps that's why the Buddha said and this is a quote if beings knew as I

175
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:43,700
knew the results of giving and sharing they would not eat without having given

176
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:51,359
nor with the stain of miserliness overcome their minds even if it were their last bite their last mouthful

177
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:59,180
they wouldn't eat without having shared if there was someone to receive the gift

178
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:08,599
so there's attitude this inner posture of sharing and generosity

179
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:16,140
it's so helpful to mindfulness meditation all along the path

180
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:22,200
it can be helpful to recall our own acts of generosity

181
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:27,240
That's the basis for a peaceful heart peaceful mind very different than the

182
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:33,300
memory of a bit of stinginess right generosity also lends itself to openness

183
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:40,020
which as a trait and it's a learnable trait is a vital importance in spiritual

184
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:47,000
growth psychological and emotional resilience and just general happiness

185
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,619
greater openness towards whatever arises in the heart in the mind

186
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:59,040
allows what needs to be seen or heard or healed

187
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:06,440
to be metabolized to transform to move through

188
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:15,599
some this generous kind of mindfulness

189
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:21,540
in a sense it's an openness to seeing all all of what is in the heart

190
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:28,920
the mind the path and with kindness and with discernment

191
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:36,660
of what's afflictive or beneficial to ourselves to others to ourselves and others and to

192
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:44,160
