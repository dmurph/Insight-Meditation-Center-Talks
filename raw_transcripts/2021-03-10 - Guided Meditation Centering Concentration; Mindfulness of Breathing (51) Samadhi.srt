1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:08,000
so good day to everyone and here in redwood city there's a light

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,480
rain it brings me much

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:21,680
both joy and a kind of intimacy of just with life and wonderful times

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,000
and

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,880
so here we are to sit here and you're here

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:42,879
everyone has their own here and some ways for each of us to say here

7
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:49,280
is uh is something we say in common and also is unique to each of us because

8
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:58,559
of the different location that's here for us different place that we sit or meditate

9
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:06,479
and in part of meditation practice is on this anapanasati is

10
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:14,000
gathering ourselves together here and as the practice uh develops

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,720
there is an emphasis on concentration uh an english word which uh doesn't

12
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,159
really do justice to the poly words that uh are

13
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:33,520
sometimes translated as concentration or concentrating and um but the word samadhi the one

14
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,840
one one associated word is um ekagata

15
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,399
and it's a word that sometimes is translated as a one-pointedness

16
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:52,479
but uh if it's one-pointedness it's kind of like the um it use an

17
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,479
ancient analogy of of a

18
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,920
all the rafters of a small hut that maybe is more or less a round hut

19
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,160
they all come together up into the point of the singular point to the top of the roof

20
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,640
and and so everything gathers everything points everything reaches for that point

21
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,959
and that point in a sense if it's a circular building is that if we look from above it's at

22
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,599
the center of it all and everything else radiates towards or comes towards it i guess

23
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:37,120
and so everything moves towards the singular focus but focus

24
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,920
suggests in english too much that a strain duality between us and what's what we're

25
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,680
focusing on and laser focus or something and rather i think of it more if you use rather

26
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,040
than a hut you know the roof but just a circle concentric circle

27
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:02,480
and and the the the center of it is where

28
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:09,519
the mind everything is focusing everything is gathering everything is circling around and it's all included in

29
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,120
this concentric circles of our lives body emotions thoughts

30
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,560
mind everything is somehow included but everything is gathered

31
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:27,120
to this around the center so sometimes we say in english on

32
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,959
meditation practice to be centered and so we're centering ourselves here

33
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:41,280
with everything included but resting at the center and um so one of the uh

34
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,040
ancient techniques for centering ourselves and really kind of being into gathering ourselves and everything kind

35
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,879
of coming in around something developing concentration

36
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,720
is counting the breath and i suggest we do that for this sitting

37
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,040
and uh the way that i was taught which i did for i still do sometimes is to

38
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,920
count the exhale and um and then the next exhale gets the next count so one two

39
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,560
three up to 5 up to 10 and at 10 start over again be completely

40
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,960
relaxed about not forgetting losing count or getting

41
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:31,360
distracted at the first opportunity just begin again at one it doesn't matter if you only get to two or even in just

42
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,759
two gets to one before you lose count start again at one and one teacher

43
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:45,840
one person i knew who practiced in japan his and teacher taught them to count up to one and then over again

44
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:52,479
and and uh and then kind of but don't just make a count a little uh

45
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:59,520
voice in the mind that counts but rather see if the whole mind the whole being

46
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,840
can somehow one like all of you is included like if maybe if you were singing or

47
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:13,520
something and you uh all of you is included in the singing one it's kind of like really there with

48
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,720
the exhale and with the release of the exhale kind of settling and gathering together

49
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,479
and the complexity of counting up to 10 requires a little extra attention to keep count

50
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,479
that makes a little protection from wandering off too easily into thought and you're more likely to catch yourself

51
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,520
thinking perhaps you notice you're not you've lost the count because you have this very clear

52
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:43,280
kind of task but the main thing to do is just gathering together this the whole mind settles and lands

53
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,800
landing on the center and the center is the place where you most experience

54
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,000
the breathing so the belly or the chest or the nostrils or whatever

55
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:03,680
just gathering settling one so taking a posture for meditation

56
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:11,840
where you can somehow begin centering yourself

57
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,240
in your body and centering yourself

58
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,039
around where you're going to experience your breathing

59
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,880
the inhales and the exhales

60
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:37,759
the predominant place to experience breathing and then from this predominant place

61
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:44,479
the center of it all take a few long slow deep breaths

62
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,840
and this as we do this the exhale

63
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:56,160
use that to really settle in let go

64
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:06,560
release yourself into the body that's breathing into the place where breathing is felt

65
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:17,840
deep breath in and exhale relaxing the shoulders

66
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,440
softening the belly

67
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:50,159
releasing the tensions in the face

68
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,840
and then letting your breathing return to normal

69
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,280
and familiarize yourself to with that part of your body where your

70
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:18,160
feel your breathing and imagine that that's at the center of

71
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:27,440
it all center of the universe and that as you breathe from that place

72
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:36,240
awareness spreads outwards throughout your body and maybe even beyond and as you exhale

73
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,000
awareness settles back in do that

74
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:59,760
and then with a very soft quiet voice

75
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,120
but with a voice that includes

76
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,399
all your being on the exhale

77
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:23,839
use the count one

78
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:34,839
and if you want you can just do one each time as if each breath is complete in itself

79
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,240
and or you could keep it simple or simple

80
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:51,680
enough and just count to three and then start over again

81
00:09:51,680 --> 00:10:00,399
and if that works well you might count to 10 and if you get to

82
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,839
10 you could

83
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,800
start again and while they want to try to keep the

84
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,160
count the important part is the settling in

85
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,879
to the center

86
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:31,760
relaxing any centrifugal force out into outwards into thought into feelings

87
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,920
that takes you away from being centered on the breathing

88
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:45,360
not fighting anything or resisting anything just not giving it attention

89
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,200
not getting involved where attention goes where your

90
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:58,959
involvement goes is following the count

91
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:05,680
in centering yourself here in the breathing inviting all of who you

92
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,880
are to be included

93
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,839
so the count is not just a little word in the mind

94
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:24,320
but it's an expression of your whole being willingly fully here

95
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:43,839
quietly here with the breathing

96
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:31,199
as you do the count spread out the pronunciation of the

97
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:39,680
count long count one in such a way that maybe it begins

98
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,079
quieting the rest of the thinking mind

99
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:55,000
like you're gathering yourself around to say something intimate and soft and

100
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,079
warm-hearted and as you do this soft one

101
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:09,839
center your body on the breathing

102
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:23,839
land fully with your whole being on the experience of breathing

103
00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:03,440
giving yourself over to the counting and experiencing breathing

104
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:12,559
as if it's the only thing to be done for the next minutes

105
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:23,840
letting go of your thoughts except account

106
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,520
and then in the last couple of minutes of this sitting

107
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:54,559
to let go of the counting and just sit here with the breathing

108
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,640
enter into the breathing center yourself on the breathing without

109
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:08,840
the counting and see if you're a little bit more centered and

110
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,840
connected

111
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:29,919
and then at the end of the sitting to remain as centered as you can

112
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:37,278
centered inside of yourself rooted in your weight of your body and

113
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:44,000
the weight of your attention into the center of breathing

114
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:51,679
a place of balance where you're not easily pushed around or

115
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:59,760
caught up in things and being so centered

116
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:05,520
now open your awareness up to the world around you

117
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:13,360
to the communities that extend out from where you are neighbors and townspeople and

118
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:22,720
people in your county your province outwards into the world

119
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:32,080
open yourself up to consider the people you might run into today or communicate with today

120
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:41,440
and from a centered place where maybe nothing has to happen

121
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,960
at least for now sitting here no responsibilities for them no

122
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:54,480
requirements obligations just a centered experience

123
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:00,240
that includes other people awareness of them thinking of them

124
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,120
imagining them

125
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:11,760
and in this kind of way of not being obligated or

126
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:22,320
not being required to do anything or react or talk to them to open your heart

127
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:30,880
to evoke your good will your basic capacity for friendliness

128
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:38,398
care kindness and love

129
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:43,919
maybe that's related to a tenderness within

130
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:53,760
and to whatever degree that you could have this good will for others

131
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:02,159
feel how it maybe also is rooted in your centeredness in your calm

132
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,840
or your concentration

133
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:16,000
and then imagine that it radiates out from you as a warmth as a light

134
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:25,120
as a care may all beings be happy

135
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:33,840
may all beings be safe

136
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:39,120
may all beings be peaceful

137
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:47,840
may all beings be free

138
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:58,159
and may we appreciate how being centered and balanced and

139
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:05,200
non-reactive supports this possibility for the world

140
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:13,200
may our practice be for the welfare and happiness of all the people we encounter

141
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:29,840
communicate with today may the world benefit from our meditation together

142
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:36,269
[Music]

143
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,840
uh

144
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:32,158
so the 16 stages of anapanasati

145
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,919
each stage each step along the way i think it's nice to think of it as

146
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:43,120
being complete in itself to not be so concerned about making

147
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:50,880
one's way through these steps but to be fully with present for practicing with what is

148
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:57,279
and content with whatever the practice is whatever the focus is for the time

149
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:03,840
but then as it develops practice sooner or later the body starts feeling settled and

150
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:11,599
unified the whole body we're breathing with and relaxing the whole as we develop kind of

151
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:18,839
ability to be a little more content and happy to be here then we have a kind of a

152
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:25,200
a feeling of well-being that makes it easier to both notice

153
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:32,480
what's going on in our mind the mental activity and to relax it to tranquilize it and it's nice to have

154
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:38,480
a sense of well-being so we can look at some of the craziness that goes on in some of our minds

155
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:45,599
and not so we're not disturbed by it or troubled by it or reactive to you know the unusual things

156
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:51,040
that we can think and do and feel but see it as just a

157
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:58,560
you know mental activity as opposed to making it personal or material which should judge ourselves

158
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:06,079
and so to experience the mental activity and to relax it and calm it down

159
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,440
kind of in a little summary that's the first eight steps of anapanasati

160
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:17,680
and then the whole practice of these 16 stages takes a dramatic shift with step nine

161
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:24,320
experiencing the mind and it's kind of like this is a pivot into a deeper dive

162
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:30,560
into our you know maybe we could say our spiritual life and the word

163
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:36,240
mind cheetah is a you know it's usually translated as mind

164
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:42,880
or mind heart or even heart sometimes and uh it probably is to use to kind of

165
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:49,040
be a little bit of heretic buddhist heretic border on it

166
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:57,119
is that the word mind is the cheetah is so important in the teachings of the buddha and so generally respected and that

167
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:03,599
it's the closest thing we get from the buddha to something that we would maybe in english called the self

168
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:10,880
and but the self this idea of self is in put in buddhist kind of orientation

169
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:18,880
is all seen as um represents some activity of the mind some idea interpretation some um thing we're

170
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,079
holding on to and so there's a kind of a desire not to get

171
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:29,200
involved in this whole idea of self and what is the self and who am i

172
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:35,680
that that investigation is considered more complicated and more stressful than is useful for deepening a

173
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:43,760
meditation so we get to put the self idea aside but the cheetah the mind is kind of what

174
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:51,200
takes its place but the mind is not a thing the mind is a the aggregate the gestalt

175
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,640
of all the mental activities in the way that we experience that

176
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:04,400
and so it's a fluid thing it's not nothing not a thing to get attached to or to reify into like a solid thing

177
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,760
it's dynamic and fluid and it gets very clear as we go deeper and deeper in meditation

178
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,839
how fluid and changeable the mind is and how the experience of mind changes in different levels of

179
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:21,760
concentration different levels of clarity and and it's fascinating to watch this

180
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,599
how we sense and feel the mind kind of oscillates between sometimes being contracted and small and sometimes being

181
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:32,640
expansive sometimes being you know all kinds of ways

182
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:39,440
but uh when the ma when the body gets relaxed the mental activity is relaxed

183
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:47,040
generally the cheetah the mind state tends to become very welcoming very wholesome very

184
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:53,440
wholesome nourishing feeling it's like we've discovered a treasure inside as treasure of well-being of

185
00:37:53,440 --> 00:38:01,680
goodness of wholeness of intimacy that that is a kind of a state rather than a

186
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,960
thing and it's a dynamic state it's not something that's easy to hold on to or cling to

187
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,400
i mean we can have desires for it and all that but if we get close to it we realize there's nothing here to cling

188
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:18,079
to or it doesn't make sense to cling because if we cling to this this mind

189
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:24,480
we're actually getting involved in a mental activity which is a subset of the mind and any

190
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,240
kind of to too involved with these activities of mind the thoughts of the mind the interpretations of the mind

191
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:37,839
certain arrows and collapses the freedom the openness the fullness that is the sense of the mind and that's

192
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:42,880
why in step 10 uh we we're allowed we can satisfy the mind we

193
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,560
nourish the mind we gladden the mind with this sense of wholeness the sense

194
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:55,200
of being complete or centered or that can happen so there's a sense of

195
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,359
well-being a certain kind of well-being and this is the foundation this is the

196
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:06,560
uh for when uh the practice of anapanasati switches to something we can call an

197
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:11,920
english concentration practice or that concentration practice is a separate practice

198
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:17,040
but where uh the that we can develop concentration in doing mindfulness of

199
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,400
breathing in mindfulness are breathing out because we center ourselves we have this

200
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:29,040
this mind state that we're intimate with and feel and we take the whole mind state with us

201
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:35,440
as we center ourselves on the breathing or the breathing becomes the very wind

202
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:42,000
that moves through the mind state kind of the massage that moves through it and it becomes the breathing becomes

203
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,680
more and more the place in which we gather ourselves the place in which we the concentric

204
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,800
circles of our life hold counsel hold uh gather together and

205
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,160
be present for and supported for um it's not like you're sitting at the

206
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:03,839
center of a room and there's concentric circles around you

207
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:11,359
and uh all your best friends and family and supporters just come there because

208
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:16,640
just to be with you and hold you and and love you and you know show that you're you know

209
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:22,400
that you're you know you know you can you can you're good you can rest in yourself you can be

210
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:30,079
at ease and so we gather together all of ourselves and um and the word for uh

211
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:36,560
that usually translate as concentration for step um 11 of anapanasati

212
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:43,520
is is not actually samadhi it's a different word that looks like samadhi i think i didn't look and get

213
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,960
exactly right but sama sama hitti or samahati and

214
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:55,520
it more literally means a gathering together a gathering together or a settling

215
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:02,400
a settling ins here and so breathing in one settles

216
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:10,000
in breathing out one settles in breathing in one gathers oneself here

217
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:17,119
breathing out one gathers oneself here and this gathering centering settling

218
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:22,880
is difficult to do if we're preoccupied with thoughts and ideas and feelings

219
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:29,119
emotions it works best when those are uh we're relaxed enough about that we're

220
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:35,760
not tight or contracted around that or nervous about those things that those things can still happen but

221
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,119
we don't want we don't have to be involved in them they can be in the background or on the side or they

222
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:48,160
can be in the outer chairs in that circle of all our supporters there or as we get more and more gathered in

223
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:53,760
the thoughts and feelings and emotions all kind of get started getting oriented

224
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:01,599
as supporters for this process of the mind being centered in on the breathing so if we are thinking

225
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:07,920
they're very simple and innocent thoughts about staying with the breath feeling the breath if there are

226
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:14,880
emotions happening or feelings they really feel connected to the process of being settled it's

227
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,160
like almost part of settling the goodness the wholeness the wholesomeness the nourishment

228
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:27,040
seems to flow with or out of being settled on the breathing and being with the breath

229
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:33,760
so this process of settling of gathering together gathering in every all of who we are it

230
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:39,520
continues this process of becoming whole in the first tetrad

231
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:47,680
experiencing the whole body and then relaxing the bodily activity in the in the second tetrad

232
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:53,359
experiencing um the mental activity all the activity and relaxing it

233
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:59,280
contributes to that sense of the mind as a whole the gestalt of the mind

234
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:05,839
and then go further settling everything begins to come in and when it gets really sweet

235
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:11,200
the sense of being settled and deeply connected and not distracted by things

236
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:18,240
then when there's a sound or something else happens in the body a sensation it just seems to be soft and tenderly

237
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:23,280
held and included it's not a problem it's just kind of part of this wonderful

238
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:32,400
landscape of of subtleness of softness of intimacy of care of of attention

239
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:38,640
so um samadhi is a sometimes called the unification

240
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:45,599
unification of that mind making it whole so i'm very aware that

241
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:52,480
this is not easy to experience and describing it this way can set up expectation or striving for it or

242
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:58,720
comparative thinking like i'm not any ever going to be in that kind of state

243
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:04,079
so if those kinds of things happen that's why the earlier steps of anapanasati is so important

244
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:11,119
because we're always staying attentive to the stresses and the strains that happen in the body around our reactions

245
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:17,280
and then relaxing those we're always attentive and sensitive to how we get trapped and caught in our

246
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:22,880
mental activity our thoughts our judgments our our interpretations are expected you

247
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:30,079
know and uh comparative thinking and we're always ready to relax those and this is so

248
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:38,079
important these early steps of anapanasati to always keep them close by always being content just to do those

249
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:44,960
and that's the massage that we do to always go back catch ourselves

250
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:51,920
do the earlier steps again and massaging ourselves and then we come back into a nice mind

251
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:57,599
state a nice way of being and then we get caught again and there's a massage back and forth and

252
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:03,200
rather than thinking of this as a mistake or a problem and we're supposed to be always at the growing edge of the

253
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:08,720
practice it's actually this massaging and going back and forth and discovering ourselves

254
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:17,280
and works our slowly is working out the kinks slowly working out the wrinkles that need to be ironed out

255
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:25,359
so we get more and more whole and holistic and settled in this practice so don't

256
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:30,720
don't be concerned too much if these teachings we do now for

257
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:36,240
deeper and deeper teachings don't quite work for you they'll work in some way don't you can

258
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:42,319
trust that you might not be aware of it consciously and always be content

259
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:49,040
to do whatever step that you're on and will continue so um

260
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:55,040
thank you for today and we'll probably continue for a while now if at least a few days into the week

261
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:01,839
with the samadhi and concentration thank you
