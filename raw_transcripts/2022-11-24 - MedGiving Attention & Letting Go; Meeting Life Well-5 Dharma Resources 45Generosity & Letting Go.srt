1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:05,940
hey it's nice to see everyone coming on

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,340
I appreciate the way you often write hello and where you're from

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:18,300
kind of give that feeling of us all being together and I'm always delighted with how

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:25,279
widespread this Sangha is so thank you for that

5
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:30,980
let's settle in for our meditation together

6
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:38,520
finding a posture where you can be upright and also relaxed

7
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,100
and allowing yourself to settle in feeling the

8
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,260
seat where you're sitting or whatever you're lying on

9
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:56,940
really feeling that contact and connection so that you can let go

10
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:04,440
and allow it to Simply support you closing the eyes if that's comfortable

11
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:11,240
for you bringing the attention inward

12
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:24,299
sensing the body in the posture that it's in kind of an overall way to help

13
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,860
Orient the mind

14
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:40,938
and so we could say give your attention to the posture

15
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:48,078
and notice how it is that you're giving that attention

16
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,420
when you turn to the posture at the beginning of the sit are you controlling

17
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,520
it from the top down making it relax and align in certain

18
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,820
ways or are you not quite giving your full attention because you're just coming

19
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:12,560
into the usual habitual posture that you always do

20
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:24,000
so I'm just drawing attention to this word give your attention to the posture

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,239
and wondering how how would it be if the attention is really a gift

22
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,020
that we're giving

23
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:43,819
so maybe offer your attention to the posture of this body

24
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,980
and does that change how the relationship feels

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,379
maybe in light of it being a gift the body feels empowered to orient

26
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:13,019
itself to straighten up appropriately to relax

27
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:18,800
into a form that feels supportive for meditation

28
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,599
it's nice to receive a gift so letting the body receive the gift of

29
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,140
your attention

30
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:47,640
and broadening broadening that attention [Music] giving or offering attention to the all

31
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:55,319
of the bodily Sensations as they are right now just letting them be as they are

32
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,900
and letting them be known as they are

33
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:48,000
now broadening the awareness to include the emotions

34
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,139
that are present

35
00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:00,259
any thoughts that are in the mind

36
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,940
maybe various intentions or aspirations

37
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:17,960
just holding all of experience in a spacious awareness

38
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:26,479
that we are giving as a gift to our experience

39
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:44,280
and as we practice with this giving attention as a gift

40
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:52,940
we may notice how giving attention relates to letting go

41
00:06:53,160 --> 00:07:01,620
we can't fully offer our awareness unless we let each thing be as it is

42
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:07,620
be known as it is and have its life of arising and persisting

43
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,520
and passing away

44
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,940
to be fully aware we have to let things be

45
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,960
let them go

46
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:40,638
so we're just letting experience flow and we'll sit in silence for a while

47
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:43,880
foreign

48
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:21,539
with great generosity letting go of our stories

49
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:26,600
letting go of our ideas

50
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,940
our complaints our judgments are wantings

51
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:38,880
just letting go of entanglement with all of those things that

52
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,500
grab at our attention

53
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:53,360
letting them calm be as they are and go without hooking on to them

54
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:01,020
and discovering how that generous way of being

55
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:10,159
actually settles the mind slowly brings the heart into alignment

56
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:32,720
foreign

57
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:43,260
practicing this way we may get a glimpse or a hint

58
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:49,640
of how we might be that way with others also

59
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:56,279
with the right balance and under the right conditions it can sometimes be the

60
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:00,740
best just to open

61
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:08,400
let there be other viewpoints let there be

62
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:14,880
other ways of being without leaping in and entangling

63
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,600
ourselves

64
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,799
and somehow that attitude can sometimes allow things to settle

65
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:29,899
in our relationships with others

66
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,380
that spaciousness

67
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,980
to us with the gift of our full unentangle attention

68
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,240
things can shift

69
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:24,380
letting go is a contribution to peace

70
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,460
foreign

71
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:53,520
[Music]

72
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:23,640
on with this list that pertains to meeting life well it's

73
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:29,159
a list of five items from the poly Canon that are described as inner wealth

74
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:36,299
fortitude inspiring things to reflect upon and signs of spiritual growth

75
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:44,100
and today we're on the fourth one the poly word is chaga that's spelled c

76
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:50,760
long a g a chaga and it has two

77
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:58,620
important and related dimensions so chaga is sometimes translated as

78
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:06,000
generosity and that's the first dimension it's the mental attitude or movement

79
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:13,140
behind the act of Donna giving we often hear Donna translated as generosity but

80
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:20,600
it more literally means the act of giving or the gift itself chaga is this wholesome motivation

81
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:27,600
behind giving so it's about wanting to share being happy about offering

82
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:33,659
I'll read the standard language that's used in the sutus

83
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:39,600
here a noble disciple dwells at home with a heart devoid of the stain of

84
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:46,980
miserliness freely generous open-handed delighting in relinquishment devoted to

85
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:54,240
charity delighting and giving and sharing so you can hear the description is

86
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:01,520
actually about the state of the person's heart um freely generous delighting and giving

87
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:09,419
devoted to charity these are heart words so we can ask well how is an attitude of

88
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:16,740
literal giving helpful as a Dharma resource I think if we can be willing to be

89
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:22,260
generous when under stress that is an amazing spiritual quality

90
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:28,440
usually in challenging situations the heart closes and easily succumbs to

91
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:35,700
feelings of holding on wanting to protect wanting to push away but if we've cultivated generosity

92
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:42,899
deeply enough we will be more attracted to the good feeling of giving than to

93
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:50,220
those reactive emotions that might come in the moment the Buddha encouraged us to investigate

94
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:58,080
the act of giving by noticing what is going on in our mind why we're giving how we're giving

95
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:04,740
and when we talked about virtue a couple of days ago I suggested simply watching

96
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:09,779
how we act and speak with mindfulness such that we can notice when we're

97
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:16,620
acting for one wholesome motivations rather than doing some kind of a top-down control of our Behavior to try

98
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:24,419
to be ethical so we can do the same thing with giving just watch how you give and notice what

99
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:29,460
motivations what emotions what mannerisms are present

100
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:34,980
and when we do that it will gradually purify our giving to come more often

101
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:40,260
from the wholesome side so just to offer some specifics that we

102
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:46,260
might notice sometimes we can actually give a gift out of fear you know perhaps we're

103
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:52,980
afraid of displeasing someone in power if we don't give we can also give out of Desire hatred

104
00:32:52,980 --> 00:33:00,120
delusion even as an insult um we can also give of course due to more

105
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:06,000
complex relational and social reasons maybe we're giving to

106
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,159
um even the score with somebody who was given to us or were attempting to put

107
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:16,559
another person in Social debt to us or we may simply be following in the

108
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:21,779
tradition of our family or we might feel obligated to give because we have more

109
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:28,860
than someone else we might give in order to look good we can also give because it makes the

110
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:36,000
Mind tranquil and happy where we can give out of compassion or love these are very wholesome motivations

111
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,779
so actually everything I read There is are all mentioned in the Buddhist teachings they're all from the sutas so

112
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:48,000
people have been giving for these reasons for at least 2500 years and

113
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,399
they're they're not given I think to judge various motivations but rather to

114
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:58,500
suggest that it's good to know why we're giving the mind has many intentions as

115
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:05,039
we know and as we observe will naturally move toward the more wholesome ones which is what Roots this quality of

116
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:10,700
chaga deeply into the heart and helps make it into a Dharma resource

117
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:17,040
there's also a choice about when to give and it can be good to give immediately

118
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,138
when we feel the urge to do so especially if it would help to

119
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:28,440
counteract some negative mind state that we have remembering that one time I was talking

120
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:34,560
with a friend and I mentioned that I was intending to give some fruit to a

121
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:41,520
neighbor a neighbor with whom I had disagreed and this was a Dharma friend and she sat up straight and said would

122
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,919
you like to go do that right now and I was a little bit surprised but I agreed

123
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:53,460
and in a short time we had done it and I felt lighter you know there was a

124
00:34:53,460 --> 00:35:00,240
letting go it was nice that I was intending that but you know why not actually just go do it right

125
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,820
and so then that leads to the the second dimension of chaga which is Letting Go

126
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:11,880
it's the the letting go that we do along the path distinct but related to the

127
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:19,500
actual act of giving a gift it's more subtle maybe this letting go that we do as part of our practice

128
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:24,599
so the Buddhist path is about letting go more and more deeply

129
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:30,839
there is cultivation there is cultivation on the path but even if we're actively cultivating a certain

130
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:36,900
quality we're generally going to have to release or dissolve the obstacles to

131
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:42,720
doing that so the idea eventually is to let go of the craving and clinging that

132
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:49,800
are at the heart of Duca so chaga is used in a powerful verse

133
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:57,660
from the dhamapata it goes like this if by giving up a lesser happiness one

134
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:03,119
could experience greater happiness a wise person would renounce the Lesser to

135
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:10,500
behold the greater seems it makes sense in the abstract we'll talk about it in a moment but

136
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:15,660
chaga in this verse is the word that's translated as both giving up and

137
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:21,060
renounce so if by giving up a lesser happiness one could experience greater

138
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:26,280
happiness a wise person would renounce the Lesser to behold the greater both of

139
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:31,800
those are the word chaga so we see that letting go is related to

140
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,960
happiness and particularly to finding a pathway toward greater forms of

141
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,900
happiness and sometimes this is relatively clear which is the greater happiness getting

142
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:48,900
some kind of enjoyable food or creating a harmonious relationship with your partner

143
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:55,020
some kind of material gain or being honest being truthful

144
00:36:55,020 --> 00:37:01,079
so we can see that ethics and kindness and compassion are ordinary and quite

145
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:06,240
accessible examples of these greater forms of Happiness we don't need to be

146
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:11,820
thinking you know way high up but another you know another greater

147
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:18,720
happiness is the kind that comes from meditation so we gather the mind in meditation by

148
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,300
letting go of the five hindrances and other reactive line States and thoughts

149
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:30,180
that prevent us from settling down we give up the Lesser happiness of being

150
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:37,560
involved in our thoughts and emotions for the greater happiness of of meditative calm when when the conditions

151
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:44,339
allow us to do that um there's a quote from the sutus

152
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:50,820
and it says this is the Buddha talking should anyone say the five chords of

153
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:56,820
sensual pleasure are the utmost pleasure and joy that human beings experience I

154
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:02,040
would not concede that to them why is that because there is another kind of

155
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:08,640
pleasure loftier and more Sublime than that pleasure and what is that

156
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:15,300
and then I'm summarizing to say that it's the pleasure of meditative composure

157
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:21,240
so the Buddha was clear about that and then there are also various meditative

158
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:27,480
insights that emerge along the path and these are also typically realized when

159
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:35,400
the Mind releases its grip and is suddenly able to see differently in some way that can't easily be unseen you know

160
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:42,960
that's the one of the qualities of insight so as we as we practice with both literal

161
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:49,260
generosity and this act of letting go we can condition our heart to realize

162
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:54,300
that in many cases relinquishment is better than acquisition

163
00:38:54,300 --> 00:39:00,060
right in general relinquishment is better than acquisition that's actually kind of a deep spiritual thing to start

164
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:05,460
realizing and then we still have to discover in each situation what it is

165
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:12,780
that we need to let go of there is some discernment about that it is possible to let go unwisely which

166
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:18,420
we wouldn't want to do but it's also very wise sometimes to let go

167
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:24,240
so we can meet life with this attitude of letting go maybe when we're

168
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:30,180
struggling or we could have the internal question what would I have to let go of to make

169
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:36,420
this easier and sometimes we're literally we need to literally give something like offering a

170
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:42,300
gift to someone that we find difficult or sometimes we need to release

171
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:47,880
Something That We're gripping internally like an emotion for example or some

172
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:52,819
Viewpoint or opinion foreign

173
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:59,119
Thanksgiving Day in the United States and in the mythology that surrounds it

174
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:04,680
it's a celebration of a good harvest that would be sufficient to carry the

175
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:10,560
early settlers in New England through the winter and apparently there was some

176
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:17,880
cooperation with the local Native Americans so there's this image of kind of a shared Feast together which is

177
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,920
about generosity and gratitude much of what we're talking about today and this

178
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:30,180
is the story that many people in the United States grew up with and so it's a holiday that centers around family and

179
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:36,359
food but for Native Americans of course there isn't such a Rosy view of the

180
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:43,980
interaction with colonists that came from Europe that didn't play out very well and it continues to be very painful

181
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:49,740
and some Native Americans even call today a day of War of mourning okay of

182
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:55,980
mourning but I've also heard that some Native Americans are now reclaiming

183
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:01,500
Thanksgiving day as an expression of values that are deeply inherent in

184
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:09,780
Native culture you know gratitude and giving are prominent in Native American history and why let white people co-opt

185
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:14,880
that so there's an example of flexibility in

186
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:21,480
order to find a way through differing views this is something that comes out of our

187
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,579
ability to let go and be generous is to understand that there are different ways

188
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:33,000
to perceive any given situation and it's helpful to find a way that

189
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,579
isn't so much involved with duka to find some view or perspective that is not

190
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:43,980
related to suffering so regarding this day maybe in a more

191
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:51,020
you know down to earth practical sense you might find that there are some conversations at the family dining table

192
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:57,440
with relatives who hold differing views and I would like to recommend

193
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,540
experimenting with the idea of releasing adherence to your own views in favor of

194
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:10,200
being together peacefully so it's a lesser happiness to win an argument or make a pointed statement

195
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:18,060
than the greater happiness of appreciating a chance to have a meal together and spend some time together

196
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:25,260
so you'll you'll navigate it in your own way I don't want to give specifics but at least consider this idea about the

197
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:33,660
Lesser and greater happiness and maybe try to look for what you could let go of in order to Behold a greater happiness

198
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:42,420
so we can be so generous with our mind and heart and so flexible and doing that actually

199
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:48,960
makes us resilient in the world and it's a wonderful resource for meeting life

200
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,839
well so I wish you a beautiful day of if it's

201
00:42:54,839 --> 00:43:00,740
if you're in the United States a day of Celebration if you're farther out a day of

202
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:08,339
peace and letting go and generosity so chaga this resource of giving and

203
00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:12,440
letting go thank you
