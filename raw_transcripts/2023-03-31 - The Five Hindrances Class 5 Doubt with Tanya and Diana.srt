00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,340
foreign

2
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:42,010
[Music]

3
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,539
sorry about the noise so Diana's Gonna Get Us started for our

4
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,260
fifth class and the five hindrances

5
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,440
I wish there were more hindrances so we can just meet longer

6
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,600
laughs no so I'm happy to be back I don't think maybe you know that I was traveling and

7
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:20,580
then I was Ill but now I'm better and I'm happy to be here so last week you guys talked about sloth

8
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:26,820
and torbur and Tonya tells me that you didn't talk specifically about the homework but some of the homework if you

9
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:33,840
read it was about experimenting with the amount of energy that you have or adopting posture sitting up straighter

10
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,259
or doing some walking meditation is some way to maybe work with the effort level

11
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,420
as well as just this recognition that sometimes we can tease apart sloth and

12
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,520
torpers sometimes it's helpful to do that sometimes it doesn't matter but we

13
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,240
might think of sloth as kind of like this bodily feeling of

14
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,700
heaviness tiredness or you're just not enough energy and torpor is maybe like the

15
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,520
mental side this dullness fogginess kind of a

16
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,879
moving through Jello the mind kind of feeling so I just offer that as a really brief

17
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:22,020
introduction to see if you have any comments or questions about what was covered last week before we jump into

18
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,739
this week

19
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:42,379
the one thing I noticed is that um becoming aware of either

20
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,760
noticing how I was sitting was really good it just kind of brought me back to like

21
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,959
okay look this is you need to actually spent energy in being present here for

22
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,480
this right and for some reason for me the the how I'm sitting is really important

23
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,300
and I think I mentioned to you also that um one of the things that was shocking was

24
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:12,420
like not just how I was my spine was but also

25
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:18,720
the angle of my head that if I'm too far up I'm reaching for something if I'm

26
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:27,120
down I'm actually going off into sloth and torpor so forcing myself to actually be at sort of an even yeah keeping like

27
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,800
the head like distinction straight yeah looking straight ahead and it's very sensitive and I can really feel it and

28
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,080
it turned out to be really useful it has turned out to be really useful yeah

29
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,299
thank you thank you for sharing that interestingly I'm putting together a

30
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:50,819
class I'm going to be doing on Equanimity because the same thing is kind of similar with Equanimity if we

31
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:57,659
feel like we're balanced and poised then it's easier to be more equanimous so it's quite striking to this connection

32
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:04,799
with just how our posture is yeah and for me I'll say also kind of pushing

33
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,439
the chin back just this tiny little bit somehow opens up here and and I just feel a little bit more

34
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:16,400
present somehow it's quite something yeah thank you for sharing that

35
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:28,020
it's you you don't have anything that you want to share or no pressure [Laughter]

36
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:37,919
I've had um kind of sleepless nights this week and by the third day sorry Richard

37
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:44,160
I went to yoga last night and I was like almost Delirious I was so tired but I

38
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,199
did notice when I was in yoga it was like the jello mind I was like even the

39
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,780
hearing of a voice like the teacher I was like oh my God I'm so tired and it

40
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:00,180
feels like walking through like the Muddy Waters but I was present with the yoga and then went home and went to bed

41
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:05,340
so I noticed it then did it feel like a hindrance or was it just like okay this

42
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,380
is what sleep deprivation feels like or did it feel like not there's something

43
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:15,720
extra here that's making it yeah it was really hard for me to listen to or like

44
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:22,139
follow along in the class I almost felt like I wanted to do my own thing but I'm like nope there's a teacher here and he's telling me what to do and I have to

45
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:27,660
do it so it did feel a little bit more of a hindrance and then I think about at work it was even

46
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,699
harder because I had all these tests that I needed to do and I was like gosh

47
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:37,979
gosh I am so so beat from sleep deprivation hopefully you got some good

48
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:45,539
sleep since then I did thank you I'm happy to hear that it makes a difference right sleep makes such a difference

49
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:50,419
great thank you Tanya

50
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,198
I'm so glad you're feeling better and here with us tonight

51
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:04,759
so you know we're gonna start and finish with doubt

52
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:13,380
and I actually you know we've when we've taught this before we taught it first because it's so significant

53
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:19,080
and um do you even just even as I was thinking about you know it again tonight

54
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:24,960
I was like you know so many of the characters have a

55
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:33,539
combination of hindrances from The Wizard of Oz and the doubt is there for all of them

56
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:38,580
and you know I was thinking of so how do you

57
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:45,539
decide the primary and secondary you know is there a primary hindrance and the secondary hindrance and

58
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:50,819
and I was thinking about them all of them and all the characters and I'll speak more specifically and I thought

59
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:57,360
well if they had confidence if they each had confidence I don't

60
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,840
think they'd have the other significant hindrance the way they do so let's let's explore

61
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,419
this a little bit so the lion right his primary hindrance

62
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:16,620
was um worry right very cowardly and fearful

63
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:24,080
and his belief right was that he needed courage so that he wouldn't feel fear

64
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:30,360
so he had um you know he felt he needed courage he

65
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,940
didn't have the confidence right so he doubted his own ability and he he had a

66
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:41,639
belief that it wasn't okay to be fearful and we know that that's it's okay to be

67
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:48,960
fearful right we can be quite courageous and have fear and if we have confidence we know that

68
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:57,259
if we're afraid it's still okay so so you know maybe his own doubt and his

69
00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:04,919
awareness and his own capacity really created the huge feeding ground

70
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:11,819
for tremendous amount of worry Maybe and then later you know we know he has

71
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:18,900
courage because I don't know if you remember but when they go to rescue Dorothy from The Castle because the

72
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:24,720
wicked witch kidnapped dorothium had her in her castle and was going to kill her

73
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,840
and it was the lion that led the way up as they were climbing the mountain

74
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:37,700
he was the one leading the pack and he was afraid and he still did it

75
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:43,979
so the end you know the wizard gives him that fake Medal of Honor

76
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:49,980
but that's not where his courage came from it existed before right

77
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:56,220
the Scarecrow his primary entrance was restlessness

78
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:04,200
right very all over the place and his mind followed right and very very much

79
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:11,160
followed that and you know his belief was that he didn't have a brain

80
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:19,560
believing he didn't have a brain he did not think he he could think he had no confidence in his ability to think

81
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:25,800
and um you know so if he had confidence if he

82
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:33,860
had doubt in his own capacity would he have been so Restless

83
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,500
I don't know and let's just sort of also think about

84
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:48,180
the fact that who was it that was the strategizer who was it that came up with the plan to

85
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:54,360
get the guards and get the costumes and change into them so they look like the monkeys and get in the

86
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,720
it was the Scarecrow he's the one that had this idea and this

87
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:07,740
has been before the wizard gave him that fake diploma so it was the big diploma that gave him

88
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:13,200
the confidence to believe and then he shares the

89
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:20,399
equation what was it I don't know if some sort of the square root of blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah you

90
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,980
know all of a sudden he you know has this wisdom because of this fake

91
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:32,540
certificate your wisdom is all about knowing math equations that's right

92
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:38,640
and then we have the Tin Man right whose primary hindrance appears to be sloth

93
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:46,200
and torpor right moving slowly Frozen speaking slowly you know sort of and

94
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,660
um interestingly to me it's this connection to his heart right he he

95
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:59,100
believes that he he doesn't have a heart this is a belief he has right

96
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,920
so he believes he can't be in love and love be loved

97
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:13,200
and and yet he's sad Longing For Love and longing for love can we be sad about

98
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:20,279
love and long for Love Without a heart I don't know I don't think so

99
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:25,579
so his own own belief structure his own idea that he doesn't have a heart

100
00:11:25,579 --> 00:11:32,399
creates tremendous doubt and his ability to do what he most wants to do

101
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:40,500
for all of them really for all of them to do what they most want to do and so that Foundation this lack of

102
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:47,160
confidence or belief in oneself and one's capacity creates a beautiful pot for growing

103
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:53,880
hindrances [Laughter] and I'll just say about the tinman also

104
00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:01,019
just um you know he demonstrated Not only was he

105
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:07,140
longing for love and really caring about it and but you know he demonstrated a

106
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:12,660
lot of a lot of caring for Dorothy and the the you know Straw

107
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:21,360
Men when his um straw got pulled out by the monkeys and you know this is these are acts of love

108
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,519
and so did his caring come from that fake ticking heart that the wizard gave him

109
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:33,480
no it was there beforehand but yet this heart somehow gave him confidence it was

110
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:39,360
somehow somebody gave him something that he then could borrow their confidence

111
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:47,399
and bring it home and connect with his capacity for love more more freely

112
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:55,440
and then finally with Dorothy so Dorothy had this Chanda this healthy

113
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,380
desire right and and this faith I think she she was she never really questioned

114
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:06,959
her ability to get home I didn't really feel like she ever said forget it

115
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,899
you know she was willing to go into this scary forest and confront the wicked

116
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:19,380
witch and just go on this journey by herself in the beginning she was by herself you know traveling and made

117
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:25,980
these companions so she had this drive this Chanda this desire for Freedom or

118
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:31,019
home um but she thought it was somebody else

119
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:36,060
that was going to get her home she believed it was somebody else that

120
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:41,959
was going to kind of give her the way home

121
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:48,839
and really you know it was Dorothy getting herself

122
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:55,980
home there's no place like home clicking her own heels you know you could say home what is home home is awareness home

123
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,500
is being present you know

124
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:07,500
and you could say uh you know the uh the land of the Oz is

125
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:14,940
like a dream right we it's this technicolored dream and she chose to wake back up to her

126
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:21,420
true home which is okay Uncle Henry and Aunt Em on this little farm and it's

127
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:26,760
shot in black and white you know but she that's that's her home she chose to come

128
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:33,420
back and be there with our family so

129
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:39,779
she she needed a lot of you know borrowed confidence too with the Ruby

130
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:46,980
shoes and the the Glinda the the kind witch or so to so so

131
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:52,980
she seems anyway um so

132
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:59,760
there we go Diana it's kind of it's fun to listen to this

133
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:06,480
Tanya I was thinking like wow what other movies could we do this with you know when these five characters but I think

134
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,660
one of the things that's pointed out is right these are like archetypes for a reason because it's something that

135
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:17,699
happens to everybody it's just a part of life of course it is right it's part of the

136
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:25,560
human experience and in this context of Buddhist practice we can work building

137
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,019
on what Tanya said doubt one way it shows up is this doubt in our capacity

138
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:37,380
to practice and our ability or this it might be like this little niggling

139
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:43,440
feeling like doing this right I don't think I'm not doing this right

140
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,720
everybody else looks like they're just on the brink of Awakening and I feel

141
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:56,399
like I'm still just doing my shopping list or you know this kind of a feeling or like uh I'm

142
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:02,279
not I'm not sure should I do this practice or or I've heard meta practice

143
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:09,180
is really nice and I had that time when it was a lot of fun and my heart felt expense so I'm gonna do some loving kindness practice and then you do living

144
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:14,519
kindness practice for a few minutes and like oh but I I don't feel really loving

145
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:20,820
and that person that's sitting next to me is really irritating me so I'm now gonna go switch and try to do just some

146
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:27,800
concentration practice and oh it's too hard to do concentration practice so now I'm good right you get this right this

147
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:34,440
right we do this we do this so this feeling like oh maybe I can't do it it's

148
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,899
kind of like doubt in ourselves or maybe like doubt in the practices like which

149
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:45,600
practice should I do there's a sense of hesitation or a vacillation or just

150
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,779
spinning around in circles but not a sense of moving forward so maybe in the

151
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:58,320
same way with the Wizard of Oz there was in the very beginning when we first meet the characters they're kind of stuck

152
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:05,160
they're not really moving forward but then they kind of find their way and literally and figuratively right

153
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:11,579
they go down the yellow brick road and live happily ever after and I promise you're going to live

154
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:18,120
happily ever after [Laughter]

155
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:24,418
I wish I could promise that but uh I don't think I can though so

156
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:29,640
so I just want to maybe when we think of this word doubt for me I find it helpful

157
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:37,020
to think of it's when there's hesitation vacillation a wavering resistance this

158
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:44,340
is how it like shows up it's often not these clear thoughts I'm not sure if I can do this I'm not sure

159
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:50,340
about these teachers this teaching I'm not sure about the relevance of the teachings usually those thoughts aren't

160
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:56,520
so fully formed it's more just maybe a little bit of stuckness or a sense of

161
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:04,440
not going forward and then I also want to highlight that this is a natural and expected part of

162
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:10,140
practice absolutely there is not a single practitioner in which this has not happened to it's

163
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:16,860
part of the human experience is part of when you do learn anything new including meditation

164
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:24,059
but I also want to say that there's not only is it expected and part of practice but it's I would even say it's an

165
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:29,640
essential part of practice because how else would we learn about

166
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:36,480
the way that we behave when we're feeling not so motivated like what we do or what are some of these underlying

167
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:43,380
beliefs that are fueling our practice or that kind of like sabotaging our practice we wouldn't ever look at them

168
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:50,340
or examine them unless we were kind of really struck with some doubt so it has a function I would say as well in our

169
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:58,860
practice but sometimes when we hear this word doubt we may feel like it means that

170
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:04,260
you're not sure about all the answers and so again that's not what we're pointing to here we're pointing to is

171
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:11,100
this sometimes we might think of it as stuckness or hesitation or wavering

172
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:16,740
because doubt is helpful

173
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:22,320
right we need help we need to like if you receive a completely out of the blue

174
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,260
this uh email from your bank like oh we have a new policy now so please send us

175
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:33,539
all your personal information so that we can update our files right there's a

176
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:39,059
little doubt like is this right is this right right and you just know okay I'm

177
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:44,100
not going to go there so we need doubt in our life and we need

178
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:50,940
it in our practice to if somebody promises you you're going to live happily ever after right you need to

179
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:57,780
have a little bit of doubt so it's helpful to kind of distinguish what is helpful and what is not helpful

180
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:03,240
and so one way to think about it is well is it have a sense of impeding us moving

181
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:09,780
forward or is it maybe impeding or moving forward and

182
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:16,260
encouraging a certain disengagement because that's the real

183
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:21,780
I don't know the sticking point or the S or something that's really important

184
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:27,179
about doubt is it's so powerful it can have us just fall away from the practice like

185
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:32,700
I can't do this or they don't know what they're talking about or that's silly

186
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:38,700
and you know and then we could just walk away from it so of course

187
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:43,860
so that maybe maybe I'll say so the healthy doubt is a way that we're not

188
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:50,340
just buying everything Hook Line and Sinker of course there's this Dharma teaching that it's you know to come and

189
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:56,940
see a hippos ago come and see so there's a real invitation

190
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:03,360
find out for yourself as opposed to you just believe these things or just do these things and

191
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:09,320
you'll be fine instead it's what's being pointed to is

192
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:14,940
I guess I would say that it's Paramount to engage with the practice

193
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:21,240
discover for yourself allow what's being pointed to by other

194
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,780
teachers allow that to maybe

195
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:33,360
indicated direction to go but it's your own practice that's going to answer the

196
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,400
questions and um and help guide you with some of the

197
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,340
fine-tuning sometimes there's practitioners or that might think well

198
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:49,880
okay as soon as I learn everything precisely then it'll be okay memorize all 16

199
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:55,679
stepsati or all 37 wings of Awakening or you know all these types of things but

200
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:01,500
it's more about allowing some you to learn kind of the

201
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:08,159
direction to go and then to go and so what that means is that when you

202
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:13,620
go quote unquote is that naturally there will be

203
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:18,780
stumbling blocks there'll be other hindrances they'll be confusion all

204
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:24,780
these types of things but it's just to stay engaged what do I mean by engaged

205
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:31,799
one just to continue practicing if you can if you can't then it's an opportunity to do a little

206
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:37,320
bit of Investigation just to have this sense of

207
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:45,659
well what is going on is there something here that is that I'm not seeing that I

208
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:52,260
really don't want to see is there is there a I have this note I'm looking

209
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:58,919
for myself I had this nice word that I wanted to use but now I don't remember what it was but

210
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:04,880
the less I can say this instead of like

211
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:10,020
struggling with the struggle or feeling like oh this is just too complicated or

212
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:18,120
I or either just resistance I don't want to do it instead one way to engage is maybe just

213
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:28,380
to settle back open up and maybe ask the question what am I not seeing here or what is

214
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:37,260
going on that I don't want to be here and I'm trying to pretend it's not there or or is there something here that is

215
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:43,820
touching into fear or creating the conditions for fear or something like that

216
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:53,520
then we're back in the practice so I would say the opposite of doubt

217
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,780
is investigation

218
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:05,580
either investigate in your practice or if you can't get to the cushion just for whatever reason and this happens right

219
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:12,059
we have seasons in our practice where there's just so much resistance we can't go maybe see if that you can clarify are

220
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:17,220
there a particular question they talk about not self and yet there's

221
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:22,440
this rebirth thing and like I don't know that seems too weird to me I'm just not

222
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,480
gonna do it but maybe you could like if I'm just making this up right

223
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:35,400
we'll do some investigation ask somebody read about it or if that feels like something that is uh hindering you from

224
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:40,340
engaging with the practice I just offer that as an example

225
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:46,559
so sometimes it can be that we find ourselves I did this in the beginning

226
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:52,080
I'm going to do Mentos I'm going to do concentration and then I'm going to do this sometimes if you notice that's

227
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,720
happening it can be really helpful just to say oh this is doubt

228
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,820
doubt feels like this this vesselution is swirling around

229
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:08,580
so maybe I'd say that's the second so one is to investigate this is one way you can work with doubt

230
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:14,700
two is it just name it there's something quite powerful by saying oh it's just a

231
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:22,380
hindrance just like the Tin Man the lion Dorothy the wizard The Wizard might even

232
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:28,980
have doubt too right he has to overcompensate by having this microphone and this Wizard and or a curtain you

233
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:36,900
know everybody has some of this doubt right so just to name it kind of might help

234
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:42,539
normalize it and maybe take some of the authority away from it that might be a

235
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:49,320
second way to work with it a third way is to work with it is to

236
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:58,140
just notice if there are any beliefs that you will find the perfect practice

237
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:05,520
so easy gives immediate results and it's Blissful 100 of the time

238
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:11,340
or two that you find the perfect teacher that's always available when you need

239
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:19,320
them they have the perfect answer you know or you know whatever these we um

240
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:25,740
sometimes without even recognizing it we have these ideas of what we think would be helpful and then when I'm saying it

241
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:31,380
out loud it sounds silly but there might be like a little pieces of that or vestiges of that like

242
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:39,059
oh there's got to be something easier or something better so just inquire what kind of beliefs are

243
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:44,159
is fueling this this Stout this hesitation I can't practice because the

244
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:50,520
lawnmower is going yes right I can't practice because I don't have the right cushion yeah

245
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:56,880
you know there's so many ways we can say we can't practice because it's not

246
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:03,539
right or I can't practice because I only have seven minutes right I could practice for seven minutes right yeah

247
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:11,580
there's so many different things that we can do so maybe a third thing I'm looking at my

248
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:17,539
notes Here what time am I supposed to finish it there's no rush okay

249
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:24,419
I want to um maybe just say for the sense of

250
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:31,860
completeness that that we can in this tradition take

251
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:38,820
beautiful teachings that support us that make sense to us and help support a

252
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:46,020
sense of freedom and ease in our life and leave behind the other ones

253
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:51,240
just say you put them on the Shelf I don't understand that I don't think it's helpful it seems a little bit too weird

254
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,940
whatever there's no requirement that you believe absolutely

255
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:02,760
everything or take absolutely everything you don't even have to you know

256
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:10,200
become a Buddhist quote unquote whatever that means so this is really just offering what's helpful and somehow just

257
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:16,740
appreciating that kind of allows some of these doubts about some of the things to just like okay you don't have to you

258
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:23,460
don't have to believe that or do that and then maybe the last thing that I'll

259
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:28,799
say here is that I talked about how doubts often don't

260
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:34,080
show up as um clear thoughts than the way that I describe them but

261
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,720
they might kind of show up in some of the thoughts that Tanya was just saying I can't practice because the lawnmower

262
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:46,380
is going or I can't practice because I don't I left my eyes off of you at my

263
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:52,620
friend's house or whatever it is it's helpful to recognize

264
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:58,799
thoughts are just thoughts they're just thoughts

265
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:05,520
we don't have to believe them they don't have to be authoritative I'm not saying it's not true that the lawnmower is

266
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:13,519
going it's not true that the zofu is there but it's just a thought that says oh I can't practice now

267
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:20,700
and we can practice anyway so or we might have you know thoughts

268
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:26,760
that might get tangled up in philosophizing about things and well this Buddhist tradition says that that

269
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:32,399
Buddhist tradition says this they clearly don't know what they're talking about or something those are just

270
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:38,880
thoughts too so there's a way in which we can get tangled up in our thinking

271
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,880
which really can have our practice ground to a halt or something and just

272
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:52,020
to recognize oh those are just thoughts if you just wait a few moments other thoughts will arise

273
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:58,380
and you can be with those other thoughts maybe those ones are a little more supportive for practice so

274
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:04,200
you know what you're saying makes me think too it's like um it's almost it's almost the thought

275
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:11,159
that's not said yeah right because I can't practice because the lawnmowers

276
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:16,380
running why there's no why given there's an assumption

277
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:21,840
right and so it's that's why like I love what you're saying about it's it's the

278
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:27,179
doubt is very hidden it's not so Direct

279
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:32,520
I think you're you're absolutely right they're not clearly formed as I can't practice because the lawnmower it's more

280
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:40,620
irritation at the lawnmower I'll say I can't practice because they'll learn more but if you really keep playing this

281
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:49,799
sentence out and say I can't practice with the lawnmower because it's too loud and you say okay so it's too loud

282
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:55,679
and if it's too loud I can't practice well why not if I can I be aware that

283
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:01,080
it's too loud yeah oh is that practice oh yeah I guess

284
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:09,480
that is it's sort of like we just kind of end with this kind of almost a declaration

285
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:15,240
that shows up as resistance or it's kind of like pushing away or something

286
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:23,340
but maybe underneath that is this doubt I can't practice somebody else might be able to but I

287
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:30,539
can't and maybe this is something else that's kind of really highlights with doubt there's this constricted sense of

288
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:38,820
I when there's a doubt it's like I understand I can't do it and this can be subtle

289
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:45,480
to this feeling of the self is tight and

290
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:51,559
I don't know constricted not open and spacious and flexible

291
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:57,480
maybe I'll offer that so

292
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:04,080
would you what would you um I was would would maybe provide them an

293
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:09,360
opportunity to talk about this with yourselves right without uh us around it is that what you're thinking Tanya or

294
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:17,220
yeah well I was going to ask them you guys yeah you guys have been here since the beginning you're both good small group discussing discussers so are you

295
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:28,620
comfortable just talking to each other great I think I think [Laughter]

296
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:35,159
so um so I'll give you a few

297
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:40,500
um questions so and then just because there's two of you can kind of like go back and forth kind of like bouncing

298
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:46,620
around back and forth with us so one is what is uh how can you tell

299
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:53,760
and I mentioned this but maybe you have your own experience how can you tell when to skillful and hopeful and when

300
00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:00,419
it's actually a hindrance when is it getting in the way because there's sometimes we might think

301
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:07,799
oh we don't want doubt we might feel like oh I have to believe everything or something like that so that's one

302
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:14,340
like when is it really a hindrance when when is it helpful

303
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:20,279
maybe I should just give them that let them talk for a little bit and then ring the bell and give you another question let's do that

304
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:26,539
yeah that's easiest okay thank you

305
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,900
the mic up for uh this second question

306
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:54,720
what does that absence of Doubt feel like

307
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:00,119
so you know what what is how does it feel in the body as I feel in the mind

308
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:05,700
and then of course we might say that um and how would it be helpful to know this

309
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:13,619
like how can it be a support for your practice to have this familiarity with the absence of Doubt feels like

310
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:16,220
okay

311
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:54,300
this is a good sign I didn't have to ring the bell you guys are looking at me so

312
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:59,880
um here's a third question to drop in this idea of Doubt do you feel like you

313
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:05,700
have more doubt about your capacity or to practice or to do what the

314
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:11,819
teachings are or about the teachings like is this really going to make my

315
00:47:11,819 --> 00:47:18,599
life the way that I want my life to be or maybe about the teachers it could be me and Tanya or it could be like the

316
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:25,680
Buddha or just however you want to Define teachers Gail franstal whatever you know

317
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:30,960
so which do you feel like you have the most doubt that the hindering doubt

318
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:36,180
about and Maybe and then maybe just throw in what

319
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:42,359
beliefs might be underlying that or like we talked earlier about sometimes the doubt shows up as not a clearly

320
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:49,579
articulated belief but might there be a belief underneath that so

321
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:11,520
okay so maybe finishing up and while you guys were talking Tommy and I just

322
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:17,660
designed a whole nother course let's do this I'll do that

323
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:25,520
great great so I think Tonya you're gonna take well just you know

324
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:32,099
do you mind sharing any insights that are you know anything that got more clear to you as you talked about down

325
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:37,800
together anything that you would share to the people in YouTube land and listeners

326
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,599
that come come along the way

327
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:54,180
um for me feeling doubt is kind of an

328
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:59,339
indicator that I'm in the right place ah you know

329
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:04,740
uh plastic that said um

330
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:11,880
I'm not sure about investigation being the opposite of doubt or maybe not how I think about the

331
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:17,819
opposite of doubt went out arises I can't I'm I can't be

332
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:25,020
present enough for investigation I mean in in my practice for my mind right my

333
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:32,460
mind is at all times and I'm meditating trying to get me off right introducing

334
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:37,800
doubt introducing this introducing that when I feel those it's like okay there

335
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:42,900
you are let's get back but I can't

336
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:48,660
I can't get into investigation what does work for me is

337
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:55,260
um in the end it's it is in fact a sort of

338
00:53:55,260 --> 00:54:01,680
a blind faith which comes from my practice so far yeah and that's the

339
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:07,980
benefit of just continuing the practice is that eventually you just start to understand that there's benefits that

340
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:14,700
you couldn't have even described I've had a couple of insights while

341
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:20,040
meditating which blew me away and they're extraordinarily important

342
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:26,838
there's no way I would have gotten there without meditating and so at this point I have like this

343
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:34,859
this just belief that's I'll call it Faith it's belief just keep doing it

344
00:54:34,859 --> 00:54:40,079
just keep doing it and I got to thinking you know there's this there's also the

345
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:47,579
the business about the sword and just kind of cutting something and just saying I've cut it I can't quote what it

346
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:53,040
is fully right but in a way one can do that with doubt also

347
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:59,819
right you can just say no actually I'm just going to bring the sword down and I'm just going to cut that and I'm going

348
00:54:59,819 --> 00:55:05,280
to make what I think that is really is a commitment to like no I'm going to cut that and

349
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:10,800
not think about that I refuse to let it be a part of my life anymore and so move

350
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:15,559
ahead which is again I think a matter of

351
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:22,680
trust it's a matter of nice yeah fantastic this is fantastic so this

352
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:29,160
comes from practice right having had some practice like okay I've been here before I I know that if I just hang in

353
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:36,660
there or that this has benefit even if it's not comfortable or those types of things so I mean this also comes more

354
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:43,800
recently from and having coming back to practice at this point after some years if not because

355
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:49,860
my going in and out took years the realization was that

356
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:57,059
[Music] um I mean I've been in therapy for some stuff and the realization was that I can't make

357
00:55:57,059 --> 00:56:02,099
progress by what I can think through right now

358
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:07,800
and that I need to seek Avenues which come at me from different directions

359
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:13,220
which I'm not looking for meditation is one of them

360
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:20,819
there's been a couple things that have come up recently where it's like oh yeah yep that yeah that right

361
00:56:20,819 --> 00:56:26,160
but never they never would have come from just thinking it through right yeah

362
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:31,980
and I've I made that commitment recently to just like

363
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:37,140
kind of the sort coming down no just do it and I'm going after a retreat I've

364
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:42,619
never been motivated to go to a retreat but I'm going to go to a retreat

365
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:51,859
so anyways I just wanted to bring up this business of the opposite of it and

366
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:57,140
I mean I think in meditation there's no

367
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:03,359
there's no way to address that without actually just doing the practice just

368
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:11,040
meditate just do it for a long enough period of time so that you can really say to yourself I have investigated I've

369
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:16,319
just given it enough of a enough of a chance

370
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:22,800
beautiful yes that's very nice it makes me happy to hear this too that you get this ability to like no I'm just not

371
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:28,079
going to do this making this commitment having some loyalty to yourself to yeah

372
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:34,619
yeah it's beautiful very nice Richard do you want to share your little

373
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:40,319
shall I say it I'm just well I have to say it now

374
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:45,440
just to doubt doubt you doubt doubt yeah

375
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:52,520
without doubt very nice very nice yeah

376
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:59,280
it looks like Cassandra you didn't want to say much so shall we move into um doing the raft practice

377
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:04,160
yeah okay

378
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:14,520
so feeling your feet again bringing your awareness choosing where you direct your

379
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:22,020
awareness and bringing it into the body in the present moment the feet bottom hands

380
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:29,640
maybe lift the shoulders roll them back opening up the chest cavity

381
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:37,440
where's that chin finding that you know sort of Straight Ahead posture with a

382
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:43,020
little teeny tuck in the chin just feel

383
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:49,460
like maybe taking even a posture of confidence this uprightness

384
00:58:52,859 --> 00:59:00,318
and just let yourself feel the impact of setting this posture

385
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:34,920
is holding this the space for practice

386
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:40,319
this uprightness that creates a container

387
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:46,220
for things to come in and flow out and be held

388
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:49,400
to be seen

389
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:16,079
from when the time is right for you you can drop in this question when you

390
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:22,680
feel that solid space a connection with the

391
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:27,920
confidence and the brightness of being here

392
01:00:28,619 --> 01:00:33,619
drop in the question and be the Observer

393
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:42,799
what am I insecure about or try where do I lack confidence

394
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,920
or maybe where do I feel like a fraud

395
01:00:50,579 --> 01:00:57,680
and ideally this is in reference to your practice or Your Capacity to practice

396
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:05,000
and witness what arises

397
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:20,359
where is their insecurity or do I feel like a fraud

398
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:34,880
and as you allow yourself to witness what the Mind offers see if you recognize doubt anywhere

399
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:41,299
see if you can see it clearly

400
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:08,940
and of these things that arise and if there is some doubt in the practice or

401
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:13,640
in your ability to practice or in the teacher

402
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:22,440
can you choose one of these that's not overwhelming that you're able to sit with and

403
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:27,799
look in the eye without sinking into the abyss of doubt

404
01:02:30,299 --> 01:02:36,260
that you feel you could investigate with curiosity

405
01:02:43,799 --> 01:02:50,040
and if you find that recognize

406
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:55,140
the r of raft I see you I see you doubt

407
01:02:55,140 --> 01:03:03,140
yeah right there I see you I kind of look it in the eye

408
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:10,440
and see if you can hold space that's allowing the a of raft

409
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:17,579
allowing the doubt to be present and witnessed not to consume

410
01:03:17,579 --> 01:03:22,040
you not to chase away

411
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:29,099
but to recognize look it in the eye and allow it to be there

412
01:03:29,099 --> 01:03:36,420
and then to feel it the follow it into the body

413
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:41,000
and notice how it manifests

414
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:45,380
where do you feel it

415
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:51,380
be patient

416
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:58,460
what happens when you feel it

417
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:04,880
and you give it permission to be there

418
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:14,480
remembering this uprightness this capacity

419
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:18,140
to hold the space

420
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:28,400
to observe as you're aware of the experience

421
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:47,700
and as you're sitting with who may becoming aware of different

422
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:53,819
components the different pieces that come together

423
01:04:53,819 --> 01:05:00,140
to create the possibility for this doubt to exist

424
01:05:00,839 --> 01:05:06,798
and as they present themselves allowing them to have a seat at the table

425
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:18,798
the memory of an experience

426
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:23,540
is connected to the Stout

427
01:05:30,119 --> 01:05:35,180
a belief you have held or were taught

428
01:05:35,339 --> 01:05:39,319
that feeds the Stout

429
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:57,720
the image of who you think you should be or shouldn't be that may be involved

430
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:02,780
and supporting this doubt

431
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:12,078
and the sword that cuts through

432
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:19,260
the faith that has grown from your practice your experience

433
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:26,460
allowing all the pieces that unveil themselves

434
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:33,318
reveal themselves to you to have a seed at the table

435
01:06:35,819 --> 01:06:41,819
while maintaining the container that can hold it all the

436
01:06:41,819 --> 01:06:46,940
space the awareness

437
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:08,180
almost looking down at the scene

438
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:13,760
sort of taking it all in

439
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:41,420
not needing to do anything other than to get to know

440
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:50,660
all the components that come together few or many

441
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:59,539
making room for them all

442
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:20,900
and at some point as things begin to be clear or settled

443
01:08:21,179 --> 01:08:28,679
whenever that happens for you there can be a sitting back

444
01:08:28,679 --> 01:08:33,738
and away a relaxing back

445
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:41,480
the sense of trust equanimity

446
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:50,480
the capacity to be with and be at ease

447
01:08:55,980 --> 01:09:05,420
there may even be moments of Joy in the clarity that's offered

448
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:14,640
just allowing yourself to settle into this space that feels more

449
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:21,318
confident trusting equanimous

450
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:25,400
with it all

451
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:48,310
foreign [Music]

452
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:03,480
foreign thank you Tanya I've been thinking of it as rafty

453
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:08,900
because it has the two T's that kind of makes we won't go down there

454
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:15,840
recognize allow feel in the body tease apart and Trust

455
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:23,400
and maybe trust is really kind of flip out a little bit about doubt too it's like putting aside the doubt

456
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:30,840
I hadn't really thought about in that terms before but I think so that's a nice way to think about it

457
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:37,620
so just opening it up to see if you guys have any comments about that guided meditation and kind of like using this

458
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:42,440
rafty with uh doubt

459
01:11:43,739 --> 01:11:51,420
doubt about ourselves with the practice and kind of starting that way which I think I was just saying to Tonya

460
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:56,179
I think probably everybody has some of this

461
01:11:56,460 --> 01:12:03,600
if you are attending or listening to a class on the hindrances that means you're in the practice enough that you

462
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:10,560
care about working with the hindrances so everybody's like oh how can I work with these difficulties that keep

463
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,640
on showing up for something

464
01:12:15,719 --> 01:12:23,420
I was just laughing because I had doubt about doing a raft practice about doubt

465
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:28,620
I don't doubt that you doubted oh my God

466
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:36,260
how am I gonna find something to doubt this isn't going to work that's exactly what happened

467
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:43,440
I love it I love it you get bonus points for that one Cassandra to laugh well I

468
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:48,840
was it was quiet in here because I just saw it so clearly I love it and I love

469
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:56,040
it that's fantastic it doesn't get better I think our work is done here right if

470
01:12:56,040 --> 01:13:03,000
you saw that out nice that's very nice

471
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:09,360
on the rough part of it I guess it does describe to what happens except for one part when I'm meditating and feeling

472
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:15,780
doubt when the doubt arises or terrorized in several different ways but recognize for sure

473
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:21,300
allow I don't fight it actually it's just like okay you're there feel I do try to feel that in my body

474
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:28,440
and we were talking about this right we we do wind up becoming aware of it in our body I will not tease it apart

475
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:33,840
I will I will trust that it's okay it's just happening right now

476
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:39,239
it's not forever but I think if I tried to tease it apart

477
01:13:39,239 --> 01:13:44,580
it would disrupt my meditation for one beautiful because it would get kind of heady

478
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:50,280
and it's giving it too much weight it's giving it too much voice you know

479
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:56,239
so I would just raft mistake yeah yeah

480
01:13:56,699 --> 01:14:02,760
I think that's been eye-opening for me too because the teasing apart I doubt the teasing apart because I'm like I

481
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:09,260
don't know how to tease this apart I don't know where to find this and where it's coming from and then it feels stressful almost so I appreciate

482
01:14:09,260 --> 01:14:15,840
introducing a alternative tea for me yeah which is trusting and it feels like

483
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:21,000
so much better to just trust what's happening yeah so thank you for bringing that up

484
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:27,480
yeah and I'll just say that you know again I think my guess is Gus there's a

485
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:32,520
way you're already teasing it apart so quickly you don't even need to go there

486
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:38,940
you know it doesn't have to sometimes it's just it's it's like not complicated

487
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:45,540
oh you're familiar yeah yeah you know like okay I know what happens oh if I go

488
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:51,960
down there I'm gonna get lost or get caught in the mental you know so

489
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:58,080
you really are putting your it's a really it's a it's so simple

490
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:04,320
you know and sometimes uh the allowing happens instantly when you see when you

491
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:11,340
recognize you know it's like these are these are parts of the process but they don't all have to be huge in and of

492
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:16,920
themselves it depends on what we're practicing with

493
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:24,739
it really just depends and so it's good to trust what's heart we should just do tart

494
01:15:24,739 --> 01:15:30,020
fart think of all the

495
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:36,320
French I don't know we can come up with all the different versions of it yeah

496
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:44,820
just feel it in the body and then feel it leaving

497
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:53,239
just allow you might want to have other people leave the room before you do

498
01:15:54,600 --> 01:16:01,800
I think you're right about how much well maybe okay so what happens for me when I'm meditating also my sense of time

499
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:08,340
disappears and so something May actually have happened but I really

500
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:13,800
don't have any idea of how long it took I'm always shocked when the bell rings

501
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:19,199
it's like really seriously and I know that I've been I mean I've not fallen asleep I've never been awake the entire

502
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:25,620
time right so maybe you're right maybe it's just it happens but I don't

503
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:31,920
yeah or it's just so subtle it's just I mean it's not there's not a lot you know like

504
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:37,380
Cassandra a few weeks ago I think you had a lot of pieces that were coming up you know and sometimes it's like that

505
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:42,540
but sometimes it's you know it's enough to just just say

506
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:49,560
this is a thought and this is doubt and you've done it right there that's recognized yeah maybe

507
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:56,159
a little bit of allowing and that's it yeah we don't necessarily need all the

508
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:58,520
steps

509
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:07,560
well I think doubt infiltrates the way we think

510
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:12,780
maybe I would say almost thinking is doubting in some kind of ways instead of

511
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:19,320
just opening up and experiencing yeah yeah we're trying to we're thinking you know

512
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:24,360
we're trying to uh somehow put language to an experience

513
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:27,739
and it's always interpretive

514
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:41,820
maybe I'll just introduce one idea maybe like an expression that I don't think Tony or I said today and once I say it I

515
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:49,320
think you guys will recognize it but I sometimes it's helpful to just be explicit that sometimes doubt masquerades as

516
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:55,820
wisdom we might have this feeling right that oh

517
01:17:56,820 --> 01:18:02,219
right so it's just helpful to notice that like if we have this oh right now I

518
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:08,659
can't think of what I thought that would be a doubt thought masquerade wisdom maybe you have one to do

519
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:16,980
I'm not going to do that that's ridiculous I don't know but sometimes we might think that we're being really wise

520
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:23,400
or smart or yeah I know better yeah something like

521
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:29,280
that but when it's really just doubt that's fueling these kinds of thoughts

522
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:34,380
to make us feel better yeah and not to feel because doubt is

523
01:18:34,380 --> 01:18:41,280
uncomfortable too so that's part of what's fueling the thoughts right we like to feel like we can control or that

524
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:47,159
we know or something like that so it's there's inherent this uncomfortableness

525
01:18:47,159 --> 01:18:54,060
that the self really wants to get away from and we'll do almost anything to

526
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:59,460
get away from and then I'm trying to think

527
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:05,658
um is there anything else as we kind of I'm closing things up

528
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:12,659
maybe I'll just offer this to something that Tonya can uh rolled into the guided

529
01:19:12,659 --> 01:19:19,440
meditation but sometimes if if it feels like it would be helpful not if it feels burdensome and cumbersome

530
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:24,540
but if it feels like it might be helpful like before a sit to just remind

531
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:33,300
yourself of some of the things that you are a capable person that there are things that you have skills in or

532
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:38,880
whatever it might be because just reminding ourselves of that

533
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:44,760
can just switch the mindset enough that when we sit down we're coming from a

534
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:51,719
place of some stability or not all consumed with doubt or something like that

535
01:19:51,719 --> 01:19:58,320
so I just offer that sometimes it might feel a little bit awkward though do you do you have you done this Tanya

536
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:03,360
where you kind of remind yourself before you sit down like okay I am a capable

537
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:09,600
person I know how to cook some food I've been able to hold down a job or you know

538
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:15,239
whatever it is I think probably my early my first when

539
01:20:15,239 --> 01:20:22,199
I'm sitting strategy is more to arouse Faith to kind of connect with the Buddha

540
01:20:22,199 --> 01:20:29,940
um or experiences with the practice and then if I'm wobbling in the practice I might

541
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:36,199
do what you're describing which is you know you've sat through a lot more

542
01:20:36,199 --> 01:20:41,699
it won't kill you whatever I need to say to help sort of um

543
01:20:41,699 --> 01:20:48,800
I know how to cook I say this because Tanya's a fantastic cook

544
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:54,139
that's an exaggeration but I know

545
01:20:54,960 --> 01:21:01,380
and I think that's good so I have a few um a few fun Wizard of Oz things to

546
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:07,560
share yeah yeah I definitely have some I'd really like to share

547
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:14,699
and I'll start with um you know so the wicked witch right when she is in

548
01:21:14,699 --> 01:21:21,239
the castle and she's Dorothy's escaped and they're right there's this

549
01:21:21,239 --> 01:21:28,860
um Dorothy's running this way and all the Witch and all the monkeys are coming out and on this walkway

550
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:34,500
and um and so Dorothy grabs you know the the

551
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:39,780
Scarecrow she writes she lights the Scarecrow on fire the witch does

552
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:45,619
and so Dorothy grabs a bucket of water

553
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:53,640
this is such a strong metaphor to me of like you know what does water do it cleanses it puts fire out it purifies it

554
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:59,159
helps us see clearly right so Dorothy throws the water puts out the

555
01:21:59,159 --> 01:22:05,400
fire the fire of whatever it is you know and then it gets on the witch

556
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:12,560
and as the witch is melting because of the water she says this

557
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:18,070
what a thought a good little girl like you could destroy my wickedness

558
01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:22,800
[Laughter]

559
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:30,179
and to that I thought oh my God all right who would have thought something simple

560
01:22:30,179 --> 01:22:39,000
like letting all these pieces sit at a table could have it all like Fall Apart

561
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:46,219
right it's not some War it's it's just cleansing clearing

562
01:22:46,219 --> 01:22:53,040
allowing right I just love that love that

563
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:58,640
and then with the wizard you know Diana you brought up like yeah

564
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:04,320
how much of him is covering his own doubt with his

565
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:09,540
robustness you know his Illusions you know

566
01:23:09,540 --> 01:23:15,540
and um you know what is behind all the illusions that we create right there's

567
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:21,239
this part of it is or covering things that we don't want others to see

568
01:23:21,239 --> 01:23:27,239
but another part is what the Mind itself does it's a little like a magic show

569
01:23:27,239 --> 01:23:33,360
so to me some of the what the wizard represents is is how the mind works it

570
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:39,420
creates these things these these like stories and fills in the details and

571
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:44,760
predicts the future and there's many movies right so this is kind of he the

572
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:50,760
wizard kind of represents what what's going on the inner workings that can happen in the mind especially if we're

573
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:59,420
not wise with what's happening and the way that you know the Oz uses

574
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:07,320
Illusions and tricks to maintain power and status and control but you know the hindrances

575
01:24:07,320 --> 01:24:13,020
their Illusions and tricks and they the more energy we give them the more power

576
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:19,679
and control we give them Toto I already talked about but I just

577
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:25,020
love thinking about Toto as mindfulness itself unhindered right being able to

578
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:31,020
see through See Clearly pull the curtain back and Dorothy carries Toto everywhere

579
01:24:31,020 --> 01:24:38,640
she goes nice nice so we need to bring mindfulness with us everywhere we go

580
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:47,460
and I may have said this before too but the the path this yellow brick road and the path right with our path it's not of

581
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:54,239
practice it's not out there it's within and it's revealed with the

582
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:57,678
practice with mindfulness

583
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:05,159
so we want to invite you to pull back the curtains to discover what's being

584
01:25:05,159 --> 01:25:10,800
hindered the teachings say that the true mind is

585
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:19,679
quite brilliant right and we hope that I think I can say we

586
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:28,320
that you'll kind of let the lightness of the characters linking arms skipping down the path you

587
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:33,900
know and that their own ability to like you said it so nicely Diana they were

588
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:39,659
pretty Frozen with their hindrances but they worked together and through it and

589
01:25:39,659 --> 01:25:46,080
got more free and free together as they dance down the path together so

590
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:51,540
that's and maybe together is represents both you know

591
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:56,760
hindrances but people together absolutely same with others like what a difference

592
01:25:56,760 --> 01:26:00,440
it makes it makes such a difference

593
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:10,639
do you want to please bring yeah yeah please bring this forward I love this

594
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:17,639
since this is the last time and we might as well just get as much as we can into the analogy right I just said something

595
01:26:17,639 --> 01:26:22,679
about bringing uh Mara into thinking about the wicked witch maybe you can say

596
01:26:22,679 --> 01:26:29,100
more about Mara no please you say more about Mara okay

597
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:34,620
there's no such thing as the Devil Within Buddhism but there is this concept of Mara as somebody who gets in

598
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:38,780
the way and um

599
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:45,900
not pleasant and in this case that's what the witch

600
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:51,320
embodies just getting in the way

601
01:26:51,719 --> 01:26:59,300
and it's the cleansing water that just gets rid of Mara and

602
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:06,179
that story right that's really pretty is the Buddha just

603
01:27:06,179 --> 01:27:12,179
touching the ground right and saying tomorrow I see you and

604
01:27:12,179 --> 01:27:19,920
touching the ground and being fully grounded and that just kind of taking care of Mara

605
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:29,040
and the Buddha also asks the Earth to witness and and to say his He's Worthy

606
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:36,480
say what I'm sorry he's worthy right he belongs right and we need you know like that that Faith the

607
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:41,820
confidence you know is it does come from within but it also

608
01:27:41,820 --> 01:27:47,900
it is helpful to have that grounding the witness the community the Sangha

609
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:57,060
I mean in some respects maybe it is useful to know that this concept of chaos at Mara sort of

610
01:27:57,060 --> 01:28:02,940
encompassing chaos representing chaos right it's true it's real it's

611
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:08,040
I'm I'm staying away from the devil part of it that's not the point the point of

612
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:15,000
it more is yeah chaos and the the advantage of thinking about

613
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:20,639
this way is we don't have to take it personally right it doesn't mean anything that we're a failed meditator

614
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:27,540
doesn't mean anything like that it just this is what happens when people practice this is a Rises

615
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:33,900
it happened to the Buddha what happened to the Buddha what happened in a Buddha it happened to everybody in this room

616
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:39,900
I'm pretty sure so

617
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:46,139
um I'll just you know say one more thing which is um that next week uh I'll be
