1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:08,358
hello everyone and Welcome to our meditation and um

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,059
it looks like some people are saying they still have trouble connecting if those of you have trouble connecting

3
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:20,460
if you could uh a couple of things kind of refresh your

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,740
you know any kind of link you any kind of page you use at IMC for

5
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:32,180
for uh connecting to the the site

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:37,260
and if that doesn't work and you still have trouble with if you know what some

7
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,420
link is in trouble maybe you can uh mention that in the chat I think someone

8
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,700
will probably see the chat for whose knows about the trying to keep update

9
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,660
the technology parts of all this so we'll look into it some more

10
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:00,920
so um so good morning

11
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,260
and here's a analogy that I'm fond of and it can be done in different ways but

12
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:18,080
uh the the way I'd like to do it is to imagine

13
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,360
a maybe a cold place or if you are living in a very hot place

14
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,240
maybe it's fine to have a hot place but in the cold place to imagine a

15
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:37,200
a small heater placed in the middle of a room in a hot place maybe an air conditioner

16
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,560
and and that little heater is works hard and it's

17
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:50,280
when it's turned on the immediate space around the heater warms up or the media space around the air

18
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:57,780
conditioner cools down and then as it keeps working slowly the

19
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,360
the temperature changes going outwards it's warmer and warmer the whole room

20
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,459
gets warm and the whole room gets cool and if it goes on long enough maybe that

21
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:14,819
the warmth of that coolness spreads out to other rooms in the house maybe takes a while but eventually it

22
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:20,280
spreads out but it begins first close in to where it's closest to

23
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,400
so in the same way when we practice mindfulness with the classic instructions to really

24
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,400
begin here with ourselves in an embodied way with the body with breathing

25
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,239
with our own direct experience it's a little bit like there's awareness is within us

26
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:45,780
and that awareness lights up or warms up refreshes

27
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,480
and meets what is closest to it which is ourselves

28
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:58,379
and in a sense We Begin filling ourselves with warmth they're filling ourselves with refreshing coolness

29
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:04,680
we become full in a certain wonderful way we feel connected to ourselves we fill ourselves out

30
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,720
and as that becomes it gets Fuller with attention with presence when we become

31
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,239
more embodied and connected to ourselves then the awareness has a wonderful way

32
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:23,099
in which it naturally is spreads and out into the environment and first it contacts what is close by

33
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:28,980
maybe the the people and objects that we're engaged with and have some kind of

34
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:34,200
direct contact with and with time it spreads further and further

35
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,840
but there's this Radiance or this kind of flow outward and when we come to meditate every

36
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,200
morning I think of it as we get to start all over it's kind of opportunity for

37
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,080
Fresh Start it's because the mind is often preoccupied by things

38
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,799
the past and future what's happening in our lives it's maybe a little hard to appreciate how the

39
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:05,580
Opera how a morning meditation daily meditation can be an opportunity for completely fresh start to kind of like

40
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,620
you've been forgiven everything uh everything has you can put down

41
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:17,100
everything every burden every responsibility forgive yourself for every transgression

42
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:23,460
and start over again in a certain kind of way and we start over again here

43
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:29,220
turning on the heater inside turning on the air conditioner turning on the

44
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,740
the flow of the classic language is more

45
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,500
like a flow of water in an under spring in an underwater Lake

46
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:47,280
kind of turning it on and let yourself become a fool with awareness

47
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,040
let awareness take in and make contact with all the parts of Who You Are Here

48
00:04:53,040 --> 00:05:00,060
and Now so that that becomes a foundation where awareness can now with this Foundation

49
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:09,120
be ready for the world itself and then as you get ready for the world and go into the world then some of the

50
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,780
issues of your life can return and and be addressed in a much better way

51
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:21,960
but thinking of meditation as a kind of time to put everything down so you can start

52
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:30,000
over and doesn't mean the feelings emotions concerns disappear but we start over by

53
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,900
connecting to What's Happening Here and Now in our body in our breathing then they start filling ourselves with making

54
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:43,159
contact and awareness and presence with all of it and author goes

55
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:50,100
so to begin with a posture and maybe think of the posture as a

56
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,880
posture of starting over a posture of

57
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:03,300
almost like a ritual of establishing yourself

58
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,639
here and now in this place at this time

59
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,820
as if you can start over with no past and no future to be concerned with for

60
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:21,900
now and then gently closing your eyes

61
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,280
and then to

62
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:33,360
take a few long slow deep breaths to continue this ritual of letting go of

63
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:40,460
past and future [Music] letting go of concerns thoughts the best you can

64
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,099
and re-establish yourself here

65
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,259
letting go on the exhale

66
00:06:55,699 --> 00:07:01,639
establishing yourself here on the inhale

67
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,699
and then to

68
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:30,740
let your breathing return to normal

69
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:38,759
and continuing this movement towards letting go and

70
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:47,099
kind of forgiveness and starting over with a normal breath as you exhale scan

71
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:54,300
through your body and find places you can relax soften

72
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:36,380
and softening your thinking mind relax the tension pressure to think

73
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,159
maybe there's a way of gently quieting the thinking mind

74
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:54,240
not taking it Taking it as given that you have to think in the intensity

75
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,440
by which you're thinking

76
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:04,279
you can quiet and slow down your thoughts

77
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:13,500
and direct your thoughts to being here in the body with your

78
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,839
breathing direct your thoughts to be interested

79
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:24,980
in your direct embodied experience in meditation

80
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,459
and if you're following the

81
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:26,180
rising and settling of breathing the inhales and exhales

82
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,940
maybe they will place in your body where the inhale begins

83
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:39,320
the first Sensations in the Torso of beginning to breathe in

84
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:45,420
that's where the heater or the air conditioner

85
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,980
begins radiating

86
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,339
and as the inhale grows

87
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:04,920
awareness spreads through the Torso as it just expands the rib cage is Oaks

88
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:12,360
stretch the belly expands

89
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:24,440
let your awareness spread through your body through your heart through your mind

90
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:29,060
as if you have a fresh beginning

91
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,220
everything here in yourself

92
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:46,760
with a freshness a newness your curiosity

93
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:55,760
almost as if you have no past and no future just this

94
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,500
and fast and future can return later

95
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:21,320
in meditation there's nothing to solve or figure out

96
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:27,959
instead we bring awareness

97
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:33,600
to whatever is happening as if we're filling ourselves with

98
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:41,839
awareness becoming embodied

99
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:49,740
as a foundation for being with whatever is challenging whatever is

100
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,920
happening in the present moment

101
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,480
foreign foreign

102
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,240
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

103
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:10,140
to imagine that your awareness that begins with you

104
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:15,900
because that's where your all your senses are the sense of hearing

105
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:21,740
and seeing touching smelling

106
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,900
did all the sun stores are here in this body feeling your body itself from the

107
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:37,020
inside out and that this awareness

108
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:43,679
kind of in a way radiates out as it hears the world around you as it

109
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,100
sees the world around you smells

110
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,559
as it considers and thinks about the world around you

111
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:01,039
and as you breathe in and out

112
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:10,278
spreading your awareness out into the world as if it can touch the whole world

113
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:21,720
and with whatever sense of calm or well-being or presence

114
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:30,140
whatever kindness or care or compassion that you find Within

115
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:37,520
let that also spread out into the world

116
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:45,539
with the idea that it would be marvelous wonderful for all beings

117
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:50,940
to have a deep connection to themselves to the

118
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:57,900
world that is such a way that it provides them a source of happiness and well-being and

119
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:03,779
safety may it be that this practice that we do

120
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:10,620
may be the way that we live our lives in known and unknown ways and

121
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:16,260
intentional and unintentional ways may it be for the welfare and happiness

122
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:22,020
of everyone may all beings be happy

123
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:30,779
may all beings be safe may all beings be peaceful

124
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:36,740
may all beings be free

125
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:42,620
and may we support this possibility

126
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:58,059
[Music]

127
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,240
thank you

128
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:25,700
I'll be right back I think I have to push a button on a different machine

129
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,600
nope now it worked

130
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:45,659
so hello and welcome to this fourth

131
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:52,740
talk about compassionate action and it's maybe worth

132
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:58,020
repeating that this talks about compassionate action

133
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:03,299
are building on a whole series of talks from before

134
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:08,580
that focused on the role of developing awareness as a foundation for compassion

135
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:17,779
and action developing Attunement with others and ourselves as a foundation for compassion

136
00:30:17,779 --> 00:30:23,700
cultivating appreciation of others a deep respect also as a foundation for

137
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:29,039
compassionate action to cultivate the appropriate aspiration

138
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:35,700
a wish as part of compassionate action and with all that

139
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:42,779
we're ready for to act compassionately and so we don't want to be impulsive in

140
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:47,940
the compassionate action or unconsidered or or

141
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:54,419
necessarily think just because we identify something like Compassion or desire to help people or to stop

142
00:30:54,419 --> 00:31:00,960
suffering that it's wisely considered to consider wisely

143
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:07,200
is an important part of the Buddhist practice to consider that profoundly to have a

144
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:14,880
profound consideration which means to stop and feel and have access to some sense of a profound Source Within

145
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:22,740
take the time what is the depths of your being say or how does that inform you or how

146
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:28,080
does that help you understand the situation and I like this expression depth of your

147
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:36,179
being some people might say whatever is heartfelt but even the hearts might not be the the

148
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:41,460
fullest or the wisest place from which to act in the world

149
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:48,059
but to really come from some take time to come from someplace deep within

150
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:56,179
and um and this the deepest place maybe is a place where we don't have divisions

151
00:31:56,179 --> 00:32:04,080
for our care we don't have we're not partial we don't have uh distinctions between

152
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:12,179
those people deserving our care and compassion and those who don't the deepest place inside has quieted

153
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:19,140
this divisive mind that many of us can live in where it's partial it's preferential it's

154
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:24,419
it's some people are excluded from our care because we don't think they deserve

155
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:30,240
it or something but then the depth of our being it's

156
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:36,120
possible to care to be concerned with the welfare of everyone

157
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:42,779
and uh and the Buddha refers to this as being concerned for the welfare of the

158
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:48,240
whole world he talked about being concerned for the welfare of oneself

159
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,820
concern for welfare of others concern for the welfare of self and others

160
00:32:53,820 --> 00:33:00,240
and which is what we've talked about the first three days this week and then he in addition to that talked about being

161
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:06,960
concerned for the welfare of the whole world and and uh

162
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:15,299
you know certainly the whole world is a big task to consider the welfare of everyone but to let the awareness uh the

163
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:20,820
care The Compassion the compassionate concern have no divisions

164
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:26,460
have no Us Versus Them whose justifies our compassion who

165
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:33,360
doesn't that's what I understand the whole world means there's no separation so certainly we probably care for the

166
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:39,720
people close to us because we're close to us we see them we know them we don't have to go out to now and

167
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:45,720
donate to every non-profit that do a good World throughout the whole world but there's

168
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,880
no division no separation of our care and this is phenomenally important

169
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:58,380
that um we no one's Cast Away from our hearts that when we engage in this complicated

170
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:03,720
life complicated interpersonal life that we're concerned about the what's

171
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:09,000
best for everyone concerned and this was a very important approach I

172
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,898
took when I was the chair of an Ethics Committee and we had to deal with lots

173
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:21,960
of conflict and sometimes with transgressions and harms that were done between people

174
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:28,158
and um and I would talk to everyone carefully and tell them that my my

175
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,480
concern was a search for what's for the welfare and for the good of everyone

176
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:39,720
concerned it was a little bit hard for some people to appreciate when they felt that other people deserved punishment or

177
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:47,099
deserved something terrible and um and uh and certainly some kind of

178
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:54,020
serious consequences sometimes are needed but to understand what those consequences how those consequences

179
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:59,640
consequences work for the welfare of everyone for the good of everyone so it

180
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:05,580
isn't just punitive and that's the end of it it's yes there has to be consequences they have to be

181
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:12,420
accountability there has to be something has to change but here is why it's helpful for you here's why it's good for

182
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:18,839
you here's why you need to do this it gives you an opportunity to grow to change to come to terms all kinds of

183
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:24,420
things and uh generally I've found that everyone

184
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:32,520
involved in these conflicts resolutions that I was involved in came to appreciate that uh that we're looking

185
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:37,740
for the greater good for everyone and it didn't mean that we it was compromising

186
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:45,180
the good for someone who needed needed more something it was really looking for the

187
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:50,820
for the how to benefit everyone where it's not a win-lose

188
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:57,960
situation and uh and to do this it takes a lot more attention a lot more reflection and

189
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:03,119
thinking and getting a sense of the whole picture and everyone involved and

190
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,520
the quick decision that this is wrong and you're bad and we're cutting you out

191
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:13,980
or we're somehow casting you from our heart or or treating you kind of in a

192
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:21,300
punitive way or something that does not take into account the the

193
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:28,320
the humanity of everyone involved the fullness of their heart their minds their psychology and you know what the

194
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:34,140
impact of everything will be but just take time to be in conversation with

195
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:39,420
people find out what's going on for them and what really in a deep way is their need

196
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:46,200
and so they can really grow and develop and become better people that was my task as when I dealt with

197
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:52,740
these ethic challenges and I think people came to appreciate it a lot and even people who were hurt or

198
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:59,760
or felt like they were wronged in the conflict they were in I think they came

199
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,940
out as better people because they understood that um that they were being

200
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:11,520
taken care of well their situation was cared for and and um and the proper

201
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,800
resolution was made but that the the welfare of everyone involved was taken

202
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,960
into account and sometimes everyone is not necessarily the parties and only the

203
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:27,180
party is in a conflict but also involves the people around it who know about it

204
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:33,300
and are indirectly involved or connected to the parties involved so how do we

205
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:41,400
care for everyone involved so I learned a lot about this in doing this conflict you know mediations and

206
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:47,640
issues that I for many years I was doing but um but also I think it's a natural

207
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:53,400
byproduct of a liberated heart a mind that is liberated from the divisiveness

208
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:59,760
liberated from attachment to it has to be one way or attachment to oneself or attachment to

209
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,040
one's family or one's tribe or whatever it might be and um

210
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:13,460
and so when we're involved in compassionate action in the world to be considered about it is who who

211
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:18,480
benefits from this and is there anybody who is harmed by

212
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,119
this is anybody ever leaving someone out of the picture are we focusing too much

213
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:30,240
on maybe the person who is suffering the most and and forgetting there's more

214
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:36,060
people involved in the ecology and the in the community of that's related to

215
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:42,060
all this and how is it that we can take into account the whole world everyone involved

216
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:48,480
and not yourself not just the other and to some very deep personal way but for a

217
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,880
whole community and that the community could be a family it could be

218
00:38:53,880 --> 00:39:00,119
a place of work it could be a Sangha or a spiritual Community we're in it could

219
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:06,060
be a neighborhood it could be you know you know where where where that hole is

220
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:13,760
is a um you know it varies from time to time but I see it in the world of politics

221
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:20,880
that the divisions are so strong that so many times the other people are cast

222
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:28,800
from our hearts and we don't ask you know the question what would be best here for everyone how do we find a way

223
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:35,520
and the difficult thing about considering what's the welfare for everyone no matter how it is it actually

224
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:43,500
takes time the conflict resolution work that I did was not a time efficient process it

225
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:48,599
actually took a lot of conversations and I think not a few people who tried to be

226
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:53,700
involved in similar conflict resolutions tried to do shortcuts

227
00:39:53,700 --> 00:40:00,180
and I saw that whenever shortcuts were done often the conflict resolution didn't work out very well

228
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:06,180
and so it might take a long time to find what's best for everyone involved but

229
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:12,780
the other thing I learned through doing doing this and while it might take a lot of time to do so

230
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:18,540
that it actually saved a lot of time in the future when these conflict

231
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:24,619
resolution when hurt when problems between people when

232
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:30,320
when compassion is not all-encompassing in its scope

233
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:36,599
so many times the amount of repair work that had to be done later was much

234
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:43,079
greater than all the inefficient time taken to to resolve it well the first

235
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:48,660
time so it might seem inefficient and seem frustrating to stop and consider the

236
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:56,040
welfare of all and do the consideration be in the conversations to understand the situation better to do the creative

237
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:01,200
thinking to kind of consider well how to do this so it benefits everyone

238
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:07,020
and um but down but uh it it makes it much more

239
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:12,839
efficient or easier or more time saving in the future as we go along

240
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:19,920
and um and so I don't know what's coming to mind right now is a very simple example this doesn't involve you know

241
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,380
conflict resolution it could be that someone is ill and it's

242
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:30,900
nice to bring them dinner or some food and it would seem like you're just

243
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:37,500
bringing them food is a good thing but what's that big for the bigger picture the welfare of all

244
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:44,220
well maybe make enough food for their caretakers maybe there's people paid caretakers who

245
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:51,839
are caring for them who are often neglected often not seen and often ignored from you know in the close you

246
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:58,200
know relationships that um you know we we have but maybe you know make enough

247
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:03,900
for them as well maybe for their family maybe there's more people and there

248
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:10,099
might not be so much extra work to make a bigger meal that can be then shared more widely

249
00:42:10,099 --> 00:42:15,119
but it and that's a little bit more work to

250
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,579
make more might actually create a much better world that who knows what

251
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:25,800
benefits come into the future that are unseen and

252
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:32,099
so just a small example but there's many examples of this and so compassionate

253
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:38,520
action and not a rush to be compassionate to act compassionately not

254
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:44,339
narrow the focus to only the person who's suffering or challenged but how to

255
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:49,500
kind of take a deep breath and relax and open to the situation more fully take

256
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:57,240
the time and you reflect you know how is what's really

257
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:04,440
what really brings welfare for this person what do they really need how is it how do I do this for my own

258
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:10,380
sakes so I'm nourished and become a better person how do we do this so that it takes into

259
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:17,400
account the relationship between us sell then others and how do we do this

260
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:24,300
that it really takes into account a wider scope of an uh of a community the

261
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:29,900
whole world if you will um uh

262
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:37,560
and if you protest that this is too much work I'd like to emphasize again that I think

263
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:46,020
that in the bigger picture it makes life much easier and that's how in a way it has the

264
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:53,240
welfare for all concerned including oneself because of how we benefit in return

265
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:59,400
so in that process I hope that the compassionate action helps you become happier

266
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:05,700
more more contented more nourished more inspired in a wonderful

267
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:14,520
way may it lead to your happiness and freedom so thank you and uh we will continue

268
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,859
this topic of compassionate action one more day tomorrow and um

269
00:44:19,859 --> 00:44:24,140
and I look forward to it thank you
