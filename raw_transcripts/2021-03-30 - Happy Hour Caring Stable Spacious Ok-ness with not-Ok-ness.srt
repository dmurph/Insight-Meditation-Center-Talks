planting in this body

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,520
this breath in this moment

18
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:09,840
whatever is present in this moment in this body

19

can we just sit and open up open our heart to open our body to

22
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:52,720
what is here the mystery the mystery of this

23
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,560
human life as it's unfolding in this moment in this heart and this

24
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,000
mind in this body can we open to it just as

25
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:19,840
it is one breath at a time

26
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,840
do

27
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,840
this

28
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,800

moving moving the energy around

30
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:25,840

life is movement and change

32
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:07,840

and in the body with each breath

36
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:12,079

along with sensations keep shifting and changing

38

49
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:48,389
a spacious spacious [Music]

movements and the mind and the heart the emotions the body

130

okay couple of reflections one is

131
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:57,280
see dawn says a kind of quiet meditation and a quiet groove today yes equanimity

132
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:05,040
can really calm and and have a sense of stillness where we don't

133
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:10,240
want to talk afterwards so that's normal megan says very

134
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:17,440
calming felt like medicine for the soul oh sweet i wonder

135
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:23,520
one other comment initially i felt some numbness i repositioned to the floor and

136
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:29,520
felt more grounding and opening and i was able to open my heart a bit more

137
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:37,280
lovely halfway i appreciate in that recommendation in that

138
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,800
reflection how noticing okay sitting on the floor

139
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:49,359
moving the body would be more supportive and doing that in the heart being able to open more neil says

140
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:54,960
i hadn't realized how stressed i was yeah it's interesting afterwards we

141
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,839
notice when we settle and become calmer abraham i see your hand

142
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:07,440
please uh hi um so

143
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,920
i just do a kind of a breath meditation centering on joy and happiness

144
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:21,119
um and that to me feels very economist but and i haven't been attending much

145
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:27,680
is there was there a specific economy exercise that we were doing other than

146
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:32,720
meditating that i missed can you expand on that

147
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:40,000
yeah so yeah so what the invitation today so there's so many

148
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,599
different ways to to do to practice equanimity and to open

149
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:51,760
up to equanimity so the way i guided today the invitation was first

150
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:58,800
to notice all the movement all the movement of the body the breath the mind the heart so the

151
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:06,160
the movement life is movement life is movement as um so noticing all the movement and then

152
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:12,480
in contrast then noticing that oh yes there is a stillness there is a spaciousness

153
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:20,319
that can hold can be present with all the movement and not be moved so through that opening up to

154
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:25,920
oh yes equanimity oh there is this spaciousness this groundedness that can

155
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:32,880
be with all the arising and passing and and then tuning into that more and

156
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:39,760
more um so that was the in in brief the cliff notes of what i

157
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:45,359
was inviting us to explore today abraham thank you for the question thank you i

158
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:51,200
appreciate it yeah susan says i gave up and dropped my

159
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:56,319
back and let myself think i'm being trained here to be kind to myself like that and

160
00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:01,920
then nikki reinforce that right afterwards yes whatever is needed

161
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:10,319
susan whatever is needed and if happy hour is a time to cultivate kindness and go to oneself

162
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:18,560
no don't need to push it don't need to push it and jamie says for me this it was

163
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:24,480
equanimity practice focused on my kids it allowed me to see i don't have to

164
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:31,280
take on their suffering or try to fix it all i have to do is accept and love them oh

165
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,400
that's so beautiful jamie thank you for sharing that

166
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:44,400
so attached yeah and let's see on youtube

167
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,920
couple questions one is what kind of emotion is equanimity positive neutral

168
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:55,440
or negative all of them question mark none of them and thank you for the practice

169
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:02,000
and then another question how do you bring your mind back when it wants to wonder what works for you so the first question

170
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:08,000
about equanimity it's in the teachings

171
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:16,160
in abhidhamma and the higher teachings it is said that equanimity has a valence

172
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:22,880
has a neutral valence um so

173
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:30,720
so um that's what it said classically so um and yet

174
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:36,160
that the the neutral the neutral evade enough feeling tone

175
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:43,440
it's it's a can be under the category of unworldly neutral tone so there's a

176
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:50,400
grace a beauty it's not just neutral it's not just detached and aloof but there is a

177
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:58,160
it's there is a neutrality that is um

178
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:03,599
there's a wholesomeness wholesome quality to the neutrality and i'm trying to explain that as best

179
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:09,760
as i can um and

180
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:18,160
bringing the mind back is ever so gently noticing that the mind wants to wander and maybe

181
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:23,280
sean saying not now not now ever so gently bring it back so that you can

182
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:30,160
give yourself to practice and telling the thoughts if they're important enough to please come back later you'll be here waiting for them

183
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:36,640
but not right now right now you're giving your heart to this practice so you can try that there's so many

184
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:43,440
different tools but you can try this and see how that works so dear ones

185
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:51,680
ah with equanimity and inviting us to

186
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:58,160
transition with a sense of okayness see if the heart can be okay have a

187
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:03,280
sense of okayness to transition to practicing in small groups now and if

188
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:09,200
you have to go it's perfectly fine and if you can stay and maybe stretch yourself a little bit

189
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:16,079
this might be with equanimity can you stay present with all the movements the comings and goings and the heart and the

190
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:21,520
mind so with that and the invitation is

191
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:27,359

192
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:32,640
