1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:07,140
so I came down here today much more interested in hearing from you than

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:13,860
hearing from myself so what I thought would be nice to is they hear if you have any questions or

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:21,119
any concerns that are up for you and that we want to kind of look at through uh Buddhist practice lens

4
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,160
and um and then if there's no questions at all that's going to be risky for you

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,759
because because then I'm going to ask you a question

6
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:36,800
so you'll protect yourself if you ask questions

7
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,899
if you could use your mic it's nice if you do a new answer ask if you would say your name first so just so we get to

8
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,800
know each other a little more

9
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:01,100
yes I would not surprised Alex you're up in the front here no

10
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:08,420
no I was just saying oh oh oh you often have you know

11
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,939
you often have questions but we won't put you on the spot

12
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,040
so I have a practical question name Elaine mccreight

13
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,960
do you have any Insider tips

14
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:33,119
do you have any Insider tips on how one gets to attend a residence a retreat at

15
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,939
IRC how any insight about how you get to

16
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:47,298
attend the Retreats at IRC well there's um oh I can tell you the secret

17
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,860
how to manage to attend it so there we have a retreat center in Santa Cruz that

18
00:01:52,860 --> 00:02:00,659
holds about 40 retreatens and one of the heartbreaking things for me is how many

19
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:07,200
people end up on the waiting list for those Retreats and don't get in and I really feel bad about it because you

20
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,200
know it would say I don't take lightly people's intention to come on retreat and um

21
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,920
and uh and there's a lot of people maybe it's even their first interest to be on retweets who don't can't come because

22
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,400
it's such a long waiting list and then they lose interest or get discouraged and don't apply again or something

23
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,040
so but it's the nature of it so some Retreats we've had before the pandemic we had some retweets there were so many

24
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:39,540
people applied that we could have put on six Retreats and you know it was like 260 people applied or something

25
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:45,720
so um and now it's dropped now considerably since the pandemic no so now there's only about 180 or something

26
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,440
so um so uh

27
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:58,140
so uh we're trying to we try to address this in various ways one is the wish to

28
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:06,300
have a second Retreat Center so we can accommodate people more and the other is um so the secret you

29
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,400
know if they get in the secret is that it's a lottery

30
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,980
and if you don't get in in on the uh the first time you apply in the lottery then

31
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:23,040
the next time you apply the computer remembers you and you have two tickets for the lottery

32
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:30,420
the next time you apply if you didn't get in you have three tickets and the next time you don't get in you

33
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,480
have four tickets the computer doesn't give you a fight anymore tickets however

34
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,500
uh there's it pops up on the roster that

35
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,599
this person has four tickets or sometimes they have four plus so maybe that's what it says four plus

36
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,180
and so um and so then if we have four you know four plus or something then we

37
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:57,000
see what we can do to kind of work the system for you to kind of

38
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,060
bypass the lottery or something and um so that's just keep applying but you

39
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:10,019
can't work the system you can't apply to every Retreat to get a lot of tickets because if you get accepted to a retreat

40
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:15,780
that you can't do uh then you start over again at zero tickets

41
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,820
so you can't you know just try to work system uh just only apply for Retreats

42
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,280
that you can do and that's you know So eventually you'll get accepted so I'm

43
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:33,720
very apologetic that it's that difficult and you have to try so many times and but if you persist that it will and it's

44
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,240
difficult for some people some people can't persist their life changes their work changes and so to be able to be

45
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:46,680
free and plan ahead is hard so I I feel very apologetic and

46
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,020
so thank you may I add a related question so

47
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:58,620
um I have done and and really feel grateful for the um online Retreats I've

48
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:04,800
done so I'm sure it varies enormously but could you sort of what's your sense of

49
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,620
the the depth of both the residents and the

50
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:16,020
online Retreats oh I love online Retreats this is a one of the great uh

51
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:22,440
gifts of the pandemic when we couldn't do uh residential Retreats and we started we offered a lot of online

52
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,860
retweets here and before the pandemic if you had said like you're you know

53
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:35,220
you're going to be on YouTube or you're going to be you know these online Retreats you know I kind of like didn't

54
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:42,360
believe in them I'm a little bit of a Luddite or you know you know having computers look I have a like now and I I

55
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,900
used to sometimes if I brought an iPhone or phone into the Dharma Hall I'd hide it from people

56
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:54,180
and a little bit hiding it behind the Bell but you know it's it's like you know I think last time I was here I even

57
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,460
pulled it out to read a quote so things have changed and um and so one

58
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:05,940
of the things that happened in the pandemic is that uh I learned how profound these online Retreats are and I

59
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:12,120
think they're really significant I feel like what I learned from during doing many of them it's kind of the Missing

60
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:18,660
Link in our in our practice world because some people go and retreat

61
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:25,199
and they have certain significant level of experience on Retreat and but they don't learn really

62
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:31,560
how to apply that are integrate into their lives and it becomes a split between Retreat practice where they have

63
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,720
certain depths in everyday life where they go home and they're just I don't know

64
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,240
they're business as usual at home and but when people did online reads

65
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,780
most people practice from home and even sometimes with family members or housemates in the house

66
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:55,800
and and so learning how to harmonize with home life learning how when there's a Plumbing Leak there's you know that

67
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,800
you have to call the plumber during the retreat and how do you do that how do you take the trash out so it's part of

68
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:08,660
the retreat how do you um and it was it was fascinating at the the beginning of the online retreats

69
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:14,039
to have all these things that took people away from their home

70
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:20,460
you know out of the practice in a sense so for example there'd be someone a family member somewhere else was having

71
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:26,880
some crisis and they had to go to the hospital or there were family members in other countries they were having challenges and they had to address it

72
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:33,900
that they probably wouldn't have done if they were in person at the retreat center and I just delighted and felt oh The

73
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:40,560
Retreat just got bigger and I told people you're not leaving the retreat you're taking the retreat with you and

74
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,919
you're expanding what we understand Retreat practice to be for all of us that now you're you know taking care of

75
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:53,340
someone in India or taking care of someone in the hospital or your neighbor or you're taking care of the plumber who

76
00:07:53,340 --> 00:08:01,259
comes you're practicing with that and so so that's the missing link so the people who practice at home got a sense of what

77
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:06,660
it's like to engage in some serious kind of presence mindfulness care compassion

78
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:13,020
love with the life at home and harmonize their practice with life kind of in home

79
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:18,840
in a way that they didn't really figure out how to do by going on Retreat away and then coming

80
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:24,539
back so I strongly encourage home Retreats and the other thing I know I was

81
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:31,440
surprised by there were some people who did uh their very first Retreats was online

82
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,740
and I thought well how's that going to work you know their home there's no they're on the example of the other practitioners on a retreat and I don't

83
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:44,099
know well they have the discipline and it was phenomenal the discipline people had and how much people gave themselves

84
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:49,320
to it wholeheartedly and I was so inspired by people's intentionality and

85
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:54,779
dedication and how transformed they were so that's the other it may be secret

86
00:08:54,779 --> 00:09:00,080
if you don't get into IRC Retreats don't worry just do the online retreat

87
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,540
it's those are much easier to get into thank you

88
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:20,459
to bounce off of that question and and I certainly really uh concur the online

89
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:28,140
Retreats were tremendous but you were one of the few people who offers them some of the other Retreats

90
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:34,560
we don't have online and I know you have to have practice leader discussions and

91
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:41,040
things like that is it possible to give this talk to some of the other teachers that you just gave us because

92
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,320
to let them know how how important and beneficial the online Retreats are great

93
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:55,019
so our ability to offer online research right now what we do we don't we don't really offer on anymore online Retreats

94
00:09:55,019 --> 00:10:01,140
that are only online Retreats what we're offering now is hybrid Retreats and so we're offering

95
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:07,440
um uh what that means is that there's an in-person Retreat and the same time it's

96
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:14,760
being broadcast for the people who are on the online version of it and then we have the the teachers that are teaching

97
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:20,880
in person are not offer are giving the teachings for everyone online and in

98
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,100
person but the the um uh the practice discussions that

99
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:32,279
happened one-on-one with a teacher or in a group setting with a teacher uh it's a separate teacher who's not there who

100
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:39,540
offers the group back discussion individual practice period for the online people so that's what we're doing now so the

101
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,579
issue there's two issues that we have with offering more one is

102
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:51,240
in order for us to offer more of these online Retreats we have to have more service leaders everything is run by

103
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,760
volunteers and we're actually stretched to the Limit with uh and probably more

104
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:03,360
than we should in in uh in the available volunteer efforts we have fantastic

105
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:11,820
volunteers of service managers and tech people and at the retreat center for cooks and managing and so it's amazing

106
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:18,540
with what we have and the Goodwill that they carry on their volunteer work and helping everyone but we have a limited

107
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:24,180
number and so we can't we can't offer all the Retreats we want because we don't have

108
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:30,839
the resources people resources for it so that's one and then the other thing which is so maybe

109
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:36,480
um influences a little bit is that and this is kind of difficult to say and

110
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,820
awkward for me or uncomfortable for me in many ways so I so you'll see me

111
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:49,019
uncomfortable kind of and that is that people want to sign up with Retreats

112
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:55,019
that I'm doing not so much for other teachers for online that we have great teachers but then if we don't have

113
00:11:55,019 --> 00:12:01,560
enough people signing up then it just kind of doesn't quite work or or the service leaders are not as interested in

114
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:09,300
volunteering for the other teachers so that's kind of sad and bip is very human I guess that

115
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:15,180
there's that kind of issue going on and so it's so both those issues if they can be addressed then we'll try to offer

116
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:19,220
more so

117
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:30,959
the other way you can get into Retreats at IRC if you're able to another Secret is uh if you're if you uh can be

118
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,720
available the last day or very close to the beginning of the retreat like the few days before

119
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:44,100
um by that time very few people can be available at sort of notice so we'll go through the waiting list very fast so

120
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,380
you could be like 120th in the waiting list and sometimes get in if you're able

121
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:55,019
to get in you know keep your calendars clear but you know it was no guarantee so so

122
00:12:55,019 --> 00:13:01,380
it's you know it's that's awkward to keep your calendar clear but then not get in

123
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:06,779
Conrad good morning everyone my name is Conrad

124
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:14,160
I don't know if I have a question I'm going to explore something out loud with everyone but what's been on my mind and heart is loneliness

125
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,940
and I just graduated from the imc's chaplaincy program and I've been working

126
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:26,100
across the street and uh in assisted care living with a

127
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,560
group of people and there is a deep need for connection um this is what's kind of going on in my

128
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:38,399
life and I had a friend commit suicide last week and I think what's on my heart is engage

129
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,860
Buddhism and I think there's this tendency for us to want to kind of Chase

130
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:49,680
Enlightenment or awaken States and I think this is good I I kind of

131
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:56,579
want to make a pitch and see if there's anyone who's actually interested in I might say volunteer network to go and we

132
00:13:56,579 --> 00:14:01,800
can just read to the elderly um those who have dementia just sit with them

133
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,959
answer the opportunity for us to practice engaging with aging sickness and death

134
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:13,680
three of our greatest teachers in Buddhism right I think there was a question originally here but I'm kind of pitching it out

135
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:20,940
loud as I'm talking about it um because of that need that's what's on my heart so I'm just kind of curious

136
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:26,639
you don't have to raise your hand you could come afterwards and chat with me if there's something you might be get interested in engaging with

137
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:32,880
um I'll wait and show it afterwards but that's what's on my heart I want to share with the song guys so thank you

138
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:39,380
all anyway thank you Conrad very much and uh I like to say that uh

139
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:45,440
that the art of this of this yes yeah

140
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,699
that um I mean this is kind of like a dream come

141
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:57,060
true that you would just uh interested in this and interested to see what this comes out of our community that people

142
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:04,800
would do that kind of Engagement and bring their practice into the world that way and um so that's just you know fantastic

143
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:11,220
it's an important part of what I've wanted us to be about but uh the um and I've kind of been

144
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:16,740
waiting a little bit for people to come and and do this because there's a limited amount how much it can come or

145
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:21,899
should come from the leadership here at IMC and um so to have it come out of the

146
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:27,240
community it's much better and part of the art of this is uh to let it be an

147
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,760
inspiration and generosity and love that someone people want to do and not to be

148
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:39,120
obligation not to be a should but rather really feel that inner inspiration to do

149
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:46,260
this kind of Outreach into the world and that's my hope that as people practice deeper and deeper and go and Retreats

150
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:53,339
and things like that that it becomes more and more natural to start living in the world with this generous spirit this

151
00:15:53,339 --> 00:16:00,600
compassionate spirit and and that we will be agents to change the society Society we know it needs to needs

152
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:08,540
dramatic changes in so many different ways and there's way too much poverty and racism and oppression and

153
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:15,779
discrimination and and um because you know the political divisiveness and there's all these

154
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:23,220
issues that we should be addressing and um and one of the ways that you know

155
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:28,860
there's a number of things we are the number of things we are doing at IMC that comes out of IMC but they're done

156
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:34,560
kind of quietly and um and like one of them is we have a chaplaincy program training that

157
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,779
Conrad's has just finished that's why he's you know he did kept did his training and now he's

158
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:46,740
and because he did that he got invited across the street at the nursing home there to come and care for someone and

159
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:55,740
now he's coming that inspired him even more to do more of this and um so yes yeah

160
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:02,399
I love that idea and I would be happy to help but I do also have a question that kind of relates to the idea of Aging

161
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:08,760
so I recently my name is Amanda and I recently started to explore Buddhism and spirituality about eight

162
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,980
years ago when my dad died and I had a child so that was an interesting time in

163
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:20,280
my life and I've since then like really feared death and I've always tried to

164
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:26,819
figure out how to manage that and this idea of living in the life or living in the moment focusing on the now

165
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:32,340
but what's interesting for me is I have two experiences in my life that always

166
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:38,280
make me fear death more and the two things I love the most which is travel in the ocean so anytime I'm on a plane

167
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:44,820
or anytime I'm in the water I always think about dying and it's so overwhelming for me and I was just

168
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:50,940
wondering if from a Buddhist perspective you had any like approaches I could take in my mind in those moments because I'm

169
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:56,640
in the water I'm like shark shark shark shark and I know the chance is like so small and same thing on a plane I mean

170
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:03,000
there's a bump and I'm like this is it this is it and it's really bad if I'm alone so I fear getting on planes by myself

171
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,240
and in the water I always want my child to come with me because then I take on this motherly role and I'm not afraid because I'm protecting them

172
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:15,179
but just anything any suggestions you would have in terms of what I could say to myself in those moments so that this

173
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:22,380
idea of a death you know situation where it's not going to happen doesn't consume me so significantly

174
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:27,600
I love the question and I feel like I want to be careful how I answer it

175
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:34,100
so I don't know maybe I'll speak too much but let's see what comes out

176
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:41,820
um in in a number of languages including in in the Buddhist language Pali the word

177
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:47,760
for fear uh is uh very etymologically kind of linguistically

178
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:56,100
connected to the word for danger in my language that I grew up in Norwegian the the word English word fear

179
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:02,880
is related to the and the pronounce pronunciation Norwegian is

180
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,340
danger you know so and fear comes from the word danger and etymologically in Pali the

181
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:13,860
word Baya means fear but also in context means danger there are real dangers in this world

182
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:19,140
and to have some concern some fear around dangers in the world is probably

183
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:24,660
completely appropriate and the Buddhism has never said you're not supposed to be afraid like there's all these things

184
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:31,200
that Buddhism clearly wants to you to overcome greed hatred delusion make

185
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,200
that's supposed to be uprooted but there's no idea you're supposed to uproot fear

186
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,480
so there's a kind of the idea of respecting fear even have a reverence to fear

187
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:49,799
um I've lately I've been reading some people's idea of reverential fear that especially in terms of the the

188
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:59,059
natural world so a reverential fear of the ocean and um and then there's uh uh phobic

189
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:04,799
phobia of the fear which is very different and the the difference I think

190
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:11,100
is that one is out of respect uh the reverential fear is out of

191
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:18,299
respect for it and Care can I think of something important but then uh if it's an excessive kind of

192
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:26,460
horror at the dangers of the world that because we're so intimidated or so

193
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:31,919
fragile or Tender in ourselves then maybe it's time to look at

194
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,799
ourselves more and and so some fear of airplanes seems

195
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:44,760
reasonable to me some fear of being on the ocean I think is very reasonable to me I once sailed

196
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:51,900
on a sailboat across the Atlantic and the year before I knew for a year I was going to do that and um I would go I

197
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:58,020
would have a certain kind of reverential fear of doing that then I would actually go down to it was Atlantic but I went

198
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:04,380
living on the Pacific so I would go to the Pacific sometimes and have a little conversation with the ocean and

199
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:09,539
kind of prepare myself or address it or something and to be ready to go

200
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:16,500
and um and so so so one thing is to learn how

201
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:23,100
the appropriate fear how to just be a companion to let it be a companion and learn how to let it be on your left

202
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:29,159
shoulder and it come tags along and it just there to help help you be safe

203
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:35,220
um and it's the don't you know not it doesn't not a symptom of something that's necessarily wrong it might be a symptom of something

204
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,500
that's right and maybe even a deep deep kind of wisdom connection to the

205
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:47,700
natural world that there are dangers and we have to be respectful of them and find a way to live in harmony with them

206
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:54,120
but then if it's excessive fear uh that really paralyzes us then it's probably

207
00:21:54,120 --> 00:22:02,039
something really deep we need to attend to in ourselves and and uh

208
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:07,860
and so it's appropriate to really spend time with your fear if you're able to

209
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:14,580
some people go into Panic some people with trauma Their Fear triggers them and worse and worse and so then it's helpful

210
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:19,620
to have support from others to have other people accompany you and help you

211
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:24,780
with the psychological tools to really be with the fear

212
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:32,039
and uh but if you're able to be with your so there's practice here is a practice not to avoid fear but to

213
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:37,679
practice in the middle of the fear if we have the right balanced middle way

214
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:43,080
to do that and um and so if you know look for

215
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:48,200
opportunities to be afraid this way take lots of plane trips alone and

216
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,580
uh and just and and sit with your eyes closed and really take in the fear

217
00:22:53,580 --> 00:23:03,000
really be with it and if you have the tolerance the capacity to stay with it without spinning out then uh the task is

218
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,940
to help the fear feel safe and that's kind of counter-intuitive for

219
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:15,059
some people because you know the fear is just fear but if when it's when it's

220
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:20,640
kind of uh deep roots in our own fragility our own tenderness sometimes

221
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:28,559
it has to do with even sometimes our life experiences growing up or other times where we learn that somehow we uh

222
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:34,380
to have an excessive fear or reactivity to things that were dangerous and so to

223
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:41,460
learn and so to help the fear feel safe allows the fear to begin to relax but if

224
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:47,280
we're trying to fix the fear or solve the fear or psychoanalyze the fear it's not going to feel safe

225
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:53,159
so to look for an opportunity to have some of that fear maybe you know go find

226
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:59,280
a boat that's docked somewhere you know in the in the somewhere and just sit on

227
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:05,220
the boat and that's you know it's not going to go anywhere it's well moored maybe you feel safe enough but maybe

228
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:12,419
just enough of the fear comes up and then sit with a fear and and see what happens and

229
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:19,140
um and there might be layers and layers of of your emotions your beliefs your

230
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:25,500
attachments that are waiting to be discovered underneath that fear and you might find that the issue is not

231
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:31,140
the fear but the issue might be um the fear of the ocean it might be

232
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:37,320
that um you're afraid of dying but maybe you're afraid of the pain of

233
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:43,559
dying oh no it's going to be terrible drowning must be awful if it's not you're not afraid of being dead

234
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:50,039
but it's the how and so you know but even that opens a door for some people to kind of begin finding other

235
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:55,140
relationships to it or it's fear of leaving my kid behind I mean I think a

236
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:00,840
primordial fear of an of a parent is dying before the kid has grown up

237
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:06,179
and that's reasonable but um but then how do we learn to hold if you let if

238
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:14,159
you help the fear feel safe so it can be there then we can maybe learn to have the fear accompany us and not limit us

239
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:20,159
accompany us but not give a rise to anxiety fear but no anxiety fear but no

240
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,200
freezing up fear and no agitation

241
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:32,940
and um and then I think if we learn to have this wise relationship to fear then

242
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:40,020
by osmosis the people around us especially our children can feel oh this world is not such a scary place

243
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:46,440
where the parents are really scared all the time anxious all the time then at the very young age the kids learn that

244
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:53,580
this is this world is a dangerous place and they grow up anxious and the earlier they pick that up or any

245
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:58,799
of us pick this up in childhood that the deeper it's rooted in our hearts so that

246
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:04,140
you know then it takes a while for if you do use meditation practice to kind of get to the root of it it takes a

247
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:09,840
while to settle so that was a long answer you think that are you satisfied that answer is that

248
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:15,260
yeah you're satisfied okay good

249
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:26,460
my name's Caitlin uh I this will make my relationship sound a

250
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:31,740
lot worse than it is but I've noticed over time that while my husband and I

251
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:39,779
are still growing we seem to be growing maybe in different directions a little bit and I find more distance kind of

252
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:47,960
between us and I guess my question is how do we ensure that we still grow together at the same time

253
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:55,919
well I think the primary way is to be honest about it so be honest about it and find a way to

254
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,260
accept each other as you as you are and if you can't accept something to be

255
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:08,940
honest about that and find your way with that I'm a great believer in talking and being honest and exploring it that way

256
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:15,440
and but it's not but they're saying it that simply as I just did maybe

257
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,580
doesn't uh indicated that sometimes these

258
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:27,480
conversations are very difficult to have and not people might and very some people don't want to have those conversations and so what do you do when

259
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:33,659
the one of the parties doesn't capable those conversation doesn't want to do those conversations

260
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:38,820
and then you have to have this conversation in a stealth way

261
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:47,039
you know indirectly or or you have to figure out what what what does the other party need to hear or need need to relax

262
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:52,980
and to feel safe or feel heard or feel you know so that there can be some space

263
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:59,880
where a little bit of a truth-telling to go on and um

264
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,640
and sometimes if the other party doesn't want to grow and doesn't want to talk about something

265
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:12,779
um then sometimes the person who wants to grow it can be useful to go talk to a therapist there's a couple counselor and

266
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:20,340
really start looking at your what's going on for you because um I think one of the great tasks of any

267
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:27,179
relationship at least from a Buddhist point of view and is um how do you keep your heart completely

268
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:34,559
open regardless of what's happening to the other person and so that's a personal exercise and

269
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:40,620
there's a lot of challenges to that but I think Buddhist practice it's like let's say we're up let's let's be let's

270
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:46,200
be up to that challenge let me keep my heart open no matter what it doesn't mean that we don't set boundaries it

271
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:52,260
doesn't mean we don't say no it doesn't mean we don't take care of ourselves but to always have this orientation how do I

272
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:58,020
keep my heart open here and these challenges so that's the personal work that can be done

273
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:03,960
um so and then if you understand each other if you understand that if you both agree to

274
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:11,159
understand each other oh just the other thing is someone doesn't want to talk to you about their relationship what's going on then become a really good

275
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:17,100
listener offered to the other person what you wish you they would give to you

276
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:22,919
and so if and sometimes that's a stealth way just really listen and make sure

277
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:28,919
they feel it understood that they understood that they have been heard and then something sometimes can relax

278
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:35,520
in the other person that then they become interested in you so this so these are just ideas that may

279
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,980
or may not work but um I love that you're asking the question because this is a probably

280
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:47,220
important in many many relationships so is this satisfying enough now yeah yeah I'm not that satisfied with my

281
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:52,460
answer but but is it satisfying enough for now

282
00:29:54,899 --> 00:30:00,630
you already thought about all these things yeah yeah well Ben is not satisfying

283
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:04,650
[Laughter]

284
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:19,020
thanks uh my name is Steve um and uh recently earlier this summer I

285
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:25,640
attended a retreat a three-week retreat in a different tradition in uh in a

286
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,659
Shambhala Tibetan tradition and which I found very interesting and

287
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:38,460
very useful and I was wondering if you could speak just a little bit about sort of mixing practices in different

288
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:45,659
Buddhist Traditions great thank you so I've done that I mean I don't I I my

289
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:51,179
first training was in Zen Zen Zen Japanese Zen I did that for many years

290
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:57,960
before as I found that became a foundation for me to do the vipassana practice so I benefited a lot from doing

291
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:04,440
both and so that's a that's not exactly mixing but it's how they work together

292
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:10,260
and um so uh uh

293
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:16,860
often if you've been in one tradition for a while if you go study with another Buddhist tradition or even other form of

294
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:22,740
spirituality religion even that it can help you then look back at

295
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:29,220
the practice tradition you've been in and see it in new ways and uh and some of it you might see how

296
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:34,620
beneficial it was you might see how it really works well and you might see oh you know that there are there are

297
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:40,679
challenges there for me that's maybe not quite right for me but there's a deeper understanding so I think I often like to

298
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:46,500
suggest to people if they even done a good number of years in one Buddhist tradition step outside for a little bit

299
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:52,200
do something else in order to get a better a better perspective of the

300
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,600
tradition you can come back to your tradition but you maybe have a richer better perspective of it

301
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:04,080
some some uh different the questions about different Buddhist Traditions right some Buddhist Traditions

302
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:10,980
complement each other um I think oh I think every Buddhist tradition every Buddhist center every

303
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:17,279
Buddhist teacher has strengths and weaknesses I don't can't imagine that doesn't work everywhere I mean in spite

304
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:23,340
of what people think and uh and so uh you know you take the

305
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:29,880
strengths that are there and benefit from them and if you feel there's a weakness it's you know then that's where going someplace else can complement

306
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:35,760
complement it so in our vipassana tradition we have a strong tendency to

307
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:41,880
um encouragement to practice with different teachers and I like to think of the different kind of Circle of

308
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,919
teachers as being a that's the whole package and um and so you want to go and

309
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:52,559
practice with different teachers because they have different ways of um different teachings different

310
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:59,460
strengths that they're offering and it's the total package that is nice not just always with one teacher

311
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:07,980
and um and so with different Buddhist Traditions as well and so I I've known people who have practiced here at IMC or

312
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:14,279
practice with the San Francisco Zen Center that they'll go to the other one and find it really beneficial some

313
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:19,440
people have done a lot of a pasta practice then gone to the San Francisco Zen Center because it's close by and

314
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,700
they found that practicing a community there in a semi-monastic setting was really a significant complement for what

315
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:32,580
we do here and I've known Zen students who have found the coming year was a really great compliment for what they

316
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:38,519
learned at Zen Center so there's all kinds of ways that they worked worked support each other and

317
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:45,840
work work and um and the one thing that I would warn about that is against bouncing back

318
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:52,500
and forth too much and especially if you're a new practitioner for someone who's relatively new to

319
00:33:52,500 --> 00:34:00,000
practice I'd recommend that you you stay in one tradition like at least for in a

320
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
good strong way at least for a year because the the things that people are

321
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,419
working through the first year or so of Buddhist practice is kind of the same for everyone and it doesn't really

322
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:17,460
matter so much who you're practicing with and um but once you've worked through

323
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:24,300
the hindrances enough for your mind is learned to be not so distracted and so agitated and you're quieter and you have

324
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:32,220
some sort of inner connection to the Dharma now from practicing then it uh you have a different eye to

325
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:39,000
understand the different Traditions so after a year of practice you might come up surface and look around and check out

326
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,280
the different Traditions see which one feels like it really works for you is best for you

327
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,500
and you might decide who I'm staying here where I am or say oh that was great thank you but now I'm going to go do

328
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:56,580
something else so is that uh okay so will in the back

329
00:34:56,580 --> 00:35:00,080
if you wait wait for the mic

330
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:09,119
hi I'm will um I was wondering um

331
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:14,359
how do you maintain hope in the face of an ever-changing world

332
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:24,000
how do you maintain a Hope and Faith in an ever-changing world it's a great

333
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,640
question um I mean Buddhism puts tremendous emphasis on the fact that we live in an

334
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:35,880
ever-changing world and uh and um

335
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:41,640
so one of the ways to do it is don't hold on to Hope and Faith

336
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:47,640
but take a very honest look at the hopelessness and the faithlessness

337
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:53,400
what is what where does that need for Hope and Faith come from in you

338
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:59,880
know what's the sense of Despair or anxiety or hopelessness what's really

339
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:06,060
happening deep inside because addressing that might be more important than

340
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:12,260
uh provide some people get hope and what they're doing is they're just putting a

341
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:18,839
they're laying it on top of their hopelessness and not really addressing the hopelessness it's kind of like and

342
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:24,900
for a while people get inspired they hear some wonderful teaching or someone that's the solution that's the hope but

343
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:31,380
they haven't really dipped down to what was going on deeper inside so that's at least in our tradition I

344
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:39,060
think the emphasis would be let's take a deeper look what's underneath there before you look for Hope and Faith

345
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:46,020
and and one of the remarkable things that can happen there is that let's I I don't know you well

346
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:51,780
enough to know if this it speaks for you but but just so just keep that in mind it's not a statement about you

347
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:59,579
but the um hopelessness and a feeling a sense of you know

348
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:06,660
faithlessness or deep doubt or something are not the absence of something

349
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:12,060
they are activities themselves they're mental actions that are happening the

350
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:17,520
mind is doing something to provide or the heart's doing something to well up a

351
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:23,880
feeling of hopelessness the mind the heart is doing something to have feel they have I have no faith in

352
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:30,240
anything it feels like there's an absence but that sense of absence or that sense of loneliness that Conrad

353
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:36,240
brought up or that sense of of um meaninglessness or that sense of uh you

354
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:42,480
know despair that people can have those are all activities of the mind there's energy there's activity doing

355
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,420
something and because it's an activity before it says it's Dynamic and a broad mental

356
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:54,540
process it doesn't have to be there it can be settled it can be it can be

357
00:37:54,540 --> 00:38:01,260
addressed directly it could be uh you know as it feels safe as it feels

358
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:06,920
met as it feels understood and seen there's like with the fear

359
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:14,339
remarkably it can begin to settle and unravel so that as I like to say some of our

360
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:21,240
problems will not be solved they will be dissolved so something like a feeling of

361
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:28,020
hopelessness doesn't need to to discover something to have hope in

362
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:36,380
it turns out hopelessness itself can dissolve and then there's no need for hope

363
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:43,320
that's pretty radical isn't it so I'm not asking you if that was a

364
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:50,540
satisfying answer but it it it is my answer Intrigue you

365
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:59,760
I think what you said was true sorry I think what you said was true okay great so okay thank you

366
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:05,460
so I saw I think this person over here was first and then

367
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:10,800
hi um my name is favad um this has been such a beautiful question

368
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,859
asked I feel uh um I'm asking a very mundane question

369
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:21,960
um which is really um more about uh practice

370
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:28,980
um I've had attention deficit most of my life um and so I particularly struggle

371
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:35,760
as I meditate with concentration and and I tend not to be hard on myself about it

372
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:42,359
or any such thing I think I I'm good with it um but would still really

373
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:49,380
um appreciate if there is uh um if there are things that I could do to bring more concentration uh into the

374
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:55,020
meditation so sometimes even a half hour session I'll feel no more than a minute

375
00:39:55,020 --> 00:40:01,619
or two uh of having been able to focus on the breath periodically I'll gently bring the bring

376
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:07,140
my attention back but concentration feels to me uh I can't speak for anyone

377
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:13,980
else's subjective experience more of a more of a challenge for me are there ways I can work on it so I think that's

378
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:19,260
a profound question thank you nothing mundane thank you and uh there's lots

379
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:25,980
lots of lots to be could be said so I don't know what would what to say to you that would meet your circumstance

380
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:33,180
but I'll try try to to say something that um it's it's a little bit

381
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:40,200
unfortunate that the word samadhi is translated into English as concentration because it's all too easy if we go with

382
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:45,480
the word concentration to think that they need to kind of like a have a laser focus on something and it's kind of a

383
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:51,060
mental kind of Act of kind of zeroing in kind of you know like maybe you know

384
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:56,700
there are times we have to do that in life but um so so it's that reinforces

385
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:01,859
the idea that that's what we're supposed to do in meditation the word uh samadhi

386
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:07,260
can can also kind of mean unification

387
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:12,359
and I like to think of samadhi as as the process of becoming whole

388
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:18,720
so if the task is to become whole as opposed to a task is to become zero like

389
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:26,640
a laser what does it take to become whole and um and how do we become whole so

390
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:33,420
that the mind is not jumping around distracting us from that hole because then we're as soon as we're

391
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:39,060
distracted we become partial we're not whole anymore so so one of the ways to become

392
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:45,660
concentrated is um in this in this holistic way is not

393
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:50,720
to focus on anything but to rest on it

394
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:56,880
so with the breathing rest on the breathing and or or to be even more kind

395
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:05,160
of specific and helpful maybe is um uh think of the um that as you

396
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:12,420
imagine as you inhale breathing is focusing on you is arriving and once there is making

397
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:18,900
contact with you and the exhale you offer you are you're offering yourself

398
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:26,460
to the breathing and you just rest with the exhale so receive the inhale and then just rest

399
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:32,820
there with the out tail and that's where the resting can be and then over time that resting might

400
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:38,400
begin opening up a little bit sense of wholeness sense of inclusion in the

401
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:45,240
experience and so then that sense of inclusion of the present moment begins to spread out to include more and more

402
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:50,400
and you have a feeling that everything's included and then when the mind starts going off

403
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:57,599
into its thoughts when there's kind of a strong sense of wholeness or inclusion it's like oh look at that the mind is

404
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:02,760
wandering off but I'm not wandering off the mind the mind is thinking but I'm

405
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:08,220
not living in the thought I'm not identified with it it's just oh and then it sometimes that you'll see the thought

406
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:14,880
just arise and you watch it you know come and you really have a clear sense of being a watcher or being clear

407
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,700
mindful of it and it just kind of dissolves it kind of like a cloud that dissolves in the sky because you're not

408
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:26,780
participating in it you're not feeding it and um so does that Intrigue you

409
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:33,480
definitely that was a quite helpful uh I do tend to I I think think of

410
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:39,200
concentration as the inhales and the exhales and that resting concept

411
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:45,060
really intrigues me thank you great thank you so it's it's kind of time to stop but I

412
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:50,400
saw a couple of people when asked a question so what I'd like to propose is that let's take a little you know even

413
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:56,579
just a two minute break if some of you are ready to leave now please and thank you for being here and if some of you

414
00:43:56,579 --> 00:44:03,119
like to stay to continue this kind of the questions just maybe come up closer or just stay where you are and and then

415
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:08,720
we'll continue in about two three minutes or so so thank you everyone

416
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:17,700
so anybody want to ask a question yes please hi my name is pinja

417
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:23,880
um I have two questions and related so I if I heard it correctly I didn't know a

418
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:30,800
little bit louder the volume is here so oh okay if you hold it like this yeah um

419
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:37,380
so if I heard it correctly just now um there's no program for for high

420
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:42,599
schoolers yes there is there is yeah I see well I think I think there is

421
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:49,680
there's supposed to be uh we've had it for many years a team we call it teen program it's high school and I think

422
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:57,720
it's starting up again but uh you can ask Hillary she knows okay okay yeah so uh um this the second question is like I

423
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:07,260
have a teenager at home at a high schoolers so I do feel nice she has anxiety on like a GPA on staff you know

424
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:14,579
it's hard for me hearing to hear both that there and here I wonder if uh Lauren

425
00:45:15,619 --> 00:45:18,740
or something

426
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:24,920
my hearing isn't what it used to be

427
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:39,180
yeah they they I think that's so you have a you have a high school student at

428
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:45,839
home yeah she has anxiety I think about GPA about college applications that so I

429
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:51,319
feel like um we we tried uh to net her um

430
00:45:51,319 --> 00:45:57,240
and try to introduce this meditation or

431
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:02,520
this uh practice to harvest difficult difficult

432
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:09,540
for her to uh to participate so do you have any suggestion how can she benefit

433
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:16,079
from yeah how can she benefit meditation yeah you know this thing about

434
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:21,119
high school students aren't they high school students like a

435
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:28,859
different species I had two of them growing up through in

436
00:46:28,859 --> 00:46:36,900
our house you know so so um I think it's hard what you're asking I think that it's very important how the

437
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:42,060
parents care for a teenager and uh and I

438
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:47,460
think uh I mean I don't know there's so many different teenagers so many different

439
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:52,920
psychological needs they have they need to be addressed and some of them need to be in therapy even and it's really

440
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:58,619
serious but it's hard to grow up in the society this Society does a lot of people a lot

441
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:03,660
of disservice and there's particular ways in which growing up locally in the

442
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:09,119
peninsula has a lot of different very unique stresses to it about success and

443
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:14,579
and um and what success is supposed to look like and getting ahead and

444
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:21,020
things so if the parents are relaxed

445
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:27,119
about and just love the person that clearly if the kid feels that what's that what's coming from the parents that

446
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:33,300
the parents just want them to be happy and accept them as they are and there's no need to go to college there's no need

447
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:39,240
to to get ahead and be a doctor or something but just find find what what

448
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:47,640
works for you and take your time and we will support you with that whatever you do and take a gap year if you know if you

449
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:53,339
would like to do that then really kind of relax from all this and get a better sense of what you want I think the

450
00:47:53,339 --> 00:48:00,060
parents to convey that they're like that they're not tied in the parents are not tied into the popular culture about what

451
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:07,380
success means and what you have to do to be good and to just show that you will love the kid no matter what that

452
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:12,540
sometimes counts for a lot um and um

453
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:19,260
and then the other thing I I uh someone gave me advice when before my kids became teenagers he said

454
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:27,000
when when uh your kids become teenagers um uh they're hardly going to recognize

455
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:35,819
that you're home you're almost like you don't exist and but he said but that's not true

456
00:48:35,819 --> 00:48:41,700
it's even more important that you stay home it's even because they'll it's even

457
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:48,660
more important that you're present because they are noticing somehow and uh and I noticed that with my my

458
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:55,260
littlest son when he was even quite young and um and uh oh sorry I learned the saying

459
00:48:55,260 --> 00:49:01,880
recently that I thought it was really true and wish I had noted when I was a parent of young kids

460
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:08,760
adults want to be listened to young kids want to be seen

461
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:14,460
and um and so when I remember once when my kid was a little toddler

462
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:21,000
I think he could walk then but he was on the living room floor with me I was sitting next to him watching him and uh

463
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,520
he was playing with blocks and he was humming a little tune and after a while you know just sitting

464
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:32,700
there watching you know so I have things to do right so I thought well he doesn't need me

465
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:40,020
he's happy he's engaged he's humming so I got up to do something else he immediately stopped humming

466
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:46,260
and the fact that I was there watching him made a huge difference for him it was

467
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:51,300
meaningful for him but I thought he was couldn't care less that I was there he was ignoring me

468
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:58,140
so this idea that uh especially you know these kids are not paying attention they are paying attention deeply

469
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:03,960
in maybe deep more deeply than they know so so to be be present at home in a way

470
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:09,900
don't be distracted when you're home and be and even if they don't notice you're not distracted they're distracted

471
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:15,780
by their oldest technology be there and be available and uh my you

472
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:21,540
know my wife told me when my my sons were teenagers he's you know that it was

473
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:27,480
you know I didn't have much chance to talk to them I'd ask them questions at dinner and you know they're looking me

474
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:35,520
like I'm stupid and you know like if they weren't gonna you know I get one one word answers

475
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:41,700
how was school today good [Laughter] and my wife said oh you just have to be

476
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:47,940
around and just be around and available and at some point something comes out

477
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:53,400
so if for a daughter who's has a lot of anxiety I don't know when she's ready to

478
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:59,520
share but be available and she does yeah so I don't know so that I I can't

479
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:04,740
you know know your specific situation so I probably missed you but those are the

480
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:09,900
thoughts that come to mind very helpful action thank you

481
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:15,559
so so you had a hand before Kirk there

482
00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:27,059
oh thank you my name is Kurt and Gil uh this was fantastic all these

483
00:51:27,059 --> 00:51:32,640
questions and answers um and so my question relates to um

484
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:39,839
the woman that was sitting up there talking about growing away from I think that was when it came up your response

485
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:47,460
to her was uh along the lines of uh keeping your heart open

486
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:53,760
and so my question to you is can you give us some guidelines some suggestions

487
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:59,160
some ideas about how to keep our heart open because because

488
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:05,700
I need to hear some some of that great very nice thank you and um

489
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:10,980
so I'll offer you a principle that applies in many different situations like similar to what the question about

490
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:18,059
Hope and hopelessness is that Buddhism has a lot of ideals we live with a lot of ideals in our life

491
00:52:18,059 --> 00:52:24,599
and so it's an ideal to have an open heart to everyone ideals can be oppressive

492
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:29,760
you know so you know you know like I'm supposed to do this and now it must be a good Buddhist I'm supposed to keep my

493
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:37,980
heart open and you know so so but the um the principle is ideals

494
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:43,559
are good to have as a reference point as a possibility it's an inspiration

495
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:50,420
but in mindfulness practice study what keeps you away from the ideal

496
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:57,540
go the go the other direction rather than living that rather than forcing yourself to be the ideal understand what

497
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:02,819
gets in the way and the principle with an open heart is it's then it's kind of

498
00:53:02,819 --> 00:53:08,520
like the natural state of the heart is to be open we have to do something to close it down

499
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:14,400
and so if you understand how you close it that's the real work because that's

500
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:20,280
what's important to understand and and because then um when you open it you've done the work

501
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:25,920
that keeps it open uh if you use a crowbar to pry it open

502
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:32,520
uh first chance when the Crowbar goes away it's going to snap close again so it really understand what keeps it

503
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:39,599
closed so and then I you're next I think right

504
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:46,920
here and then over over there okay I'm sorry if I'm not doing it in order

505
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:54,900
go ahead hi I'm Amy and um I guess my question has to do with

506
00:53:54,900 --> 00:54:01,980
um big change in your life and also um identity and I know in Buddhism

507
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:09,420
there's non-self and non-clinging and and also fear so I've had really big

508
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:15,900
changes in my life including moving and um

509
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:21,420
um I'm about to get married and um hopefully try to get pregnant so

510
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:27,119
there are all these things and um it's stirring up a lot of fear well some of

511
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:34,260
that fear is completely appropriate if you weren't afraid if you weren't

512
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:39,540
afraid I'd be afraid and it's all happening in a very compact

513
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:47,579
time frame and I feel like um I'm fighting there's the pressure or

514
00:54:47,579 --> 00:54:53,040
stress of the thing themselves and then there's the second Arrow of me wishing I

515
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:58,680
wasn't feeling this way and feeling like I'm almost miserable and I

516
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:05,280
feel so much contraction and fear in my heart and

517
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:12,300
um I don't want to feel that and I'm it's also things that I've really wanted in

518
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:18,359
my life that when I take a step back and I'm calm I I feel good about them and

519
00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:25,319
it's it's the path I'd like to be on I see I see and as part of your what you

520
00:55:25,319 --> 00:55:30,960
call fear is part of it grief yes so you're grieving the loss of some

521
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:37,619
things including some of your dreams is that right Dreams yeah tell me your dreams some of

522
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:44,160
the things you really want in your life or no it's more that those things that I have wanted are happening and I think

523
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:51,119
the grief is the life I had just myself yeah so so there's a healthy way to

524
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:56,640
grieve and maybe that wanted a healthy way of Grieves is to spend some time

525
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:01,800
with the light that you've had like when my when my mother died a year

526
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:09,839
ago I spent time hiking in the Hills here thinking about our life together and my memories of her and and reviewing

527
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:16,319
it and if my mind drifted off got distracted by other things I'd come back to my mother and just I really stayed

528
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:22,920
focused on that and so maybe there's uh give you some quality time with your life as it's been appreciating it

529
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:29,420
remembering it crying about losing it maybe and understanding it more

530
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:35,700
maybe it also deserves a little ritual because when people get married they usually do a little ritual right I mean

531
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:41,099
some people just go down to the Courthouse which is a ritual maybe but

532
00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:48,720
uh but if you could you know to agree to what you're doing at ritual to get to get married maybe do a ritual of Letting

533
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:55,500
Go or saying goodbye or offering your respect to the life you have to really have a there's a there's a way of saying

534
00:56:55,500 --> 00:57:01,920
of there's a respectful healthy way of letting something go

535
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:07,619
or or moving on or saying goodbye to us and there's a healthy goodbye and some

536
00:57:07,619 --> 00:57:13,099
people can't say goodbye you know if you know there's I've known people who they're gone

537
00:57:13,099 --> 00:57:18,300
yeah I know they were leaving but they left before they had to say goodbye right

538
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:25,220
so say goodbye to your life and maybe you do it with some friends and talk about it and respect it and

539
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:31,680
don't have a bachelorette party I mean you can do that if you want but uh but that's not the same thing do

540
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:39,599
uh do a you know a respectful and and if you deal with your

541
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:46,800
grief that way the fear might be a lot easier and um and and uh and as I said some of

542
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:52,440
the fear might be appropriate it's actually healthy uh respectful fear well this is a big

543
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:59,940
deal there's a big responsibility this is not an easy thing to step into and um and a respectful fear appropriate

544
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:06,839
fear is one that inspires you to do your best the neurotic fear that gets in the way

545
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:12,300
is when you get Frozen or get caught and and reactive and if you can distinguish

546
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:19,319
healthy fear that inspires you in a certain way from that that doesn't then um maybe you the

547
00:58:19,319 --> 00:58:27,240
fear doesn't have to be so problematic and uh and so you you know you're you're

548
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:32,339
afraid of the of the marriage and but you can know it's healthy to have some

549
00:58:32,339 --> 00:58:39,599
degree of it so you can tell you're a partner today I have the fear of things back as opposed to feeling like oh there's a

550
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:46,200
problem here is this uh okay answer yeah it's very helpful I think sometimes

551
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:51,540
you wonder if you need to listen to the fear and just completely run

552
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:57,480
and I don't mean like the running bride away I just need fear is always a

553
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:04,680
message so I think it's always good to stop and listen to fear but uh don't run

554
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:09,980
unless it's a mountain lion well but you're not supposed to run from Mountain lines

555
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:18,180
this is then tall look at it and yeah and so um so um

556
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:23,460
the uh I think I I think of these these these kind of difficulty emotions fear

557
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:29,040
angry anger loneliness I like to see them all as Messengers and so we want to

558
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:34,200
listen and find out what's going on some deeper level and there's wisdom in fear as well

559
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,880
so and there's also

560
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:45,359
you know attachment and so part of the listening to something like fear or anger what's

561
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:52,319
the message sometimes it's the message about the world out there and what's going on but sometimes the message is is

562
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:58,020
that boy am I attached to something and I needed to find out what I'm attached to

563
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:04,500
so I don't know what your message is but okay if you run and don't get the message that's unfortunate

564
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,220
thank you

565
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:21,960
hi I'm mariksa and my question is more a practical one I'm recent like a meditation like like

566
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:29,339
this year and sometimes I find it difficult to like the gentlemen there to just be with

567
01:00:29,339 --> 01:00:35,339
a breathing and I tend to have a monkey mind like a lot of thoughts

568
01:00:35,339 --> 01:00:42,480
so what I've been trying to do is uh concentrate in one word like it means

569
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:47,760
nothing like one the number one yes so I don't know if there's a good technique

570
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:53,099
or I'm just like cheating like doing push-ups on my knees instead of doing it

571
01:00:53,099 --> 01:01:00,480
all my toes uh but um I don't know if I if that's okay just

572
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:07,380
is it well is it I said helping you with it with the monkey mind it does like you know instead of content

573
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:15,500
internet instead of latching into the thought and going into the monkey mind just I started like doing one one

574
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:22,520
repeating it yeah yeah I think that's why I think that's a a great thing and then once you're settled

575
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:29,700
enough then maybe you can settle into the breathing because the the one is quieted the if it

576
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:37,500
quiets the monkey mind I think that's great I'll use the word here oh you're gonna have a okay so oh yeah okay I'll

577
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:45,799
finish this question and then we'll go outside the um the

578
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:52,319
um I use the word here when I'm here oh no h-e-r-e okay

579
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:57,420
um and so I'll use the word here for the same purpose man my mind is too busy and I can't

580
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:04,200
be present I just say here and then I rest here what's here and then that's that's works really great for about half

581
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:10,619
a second and and I'm happy for that half a second and then I'll say here again and then I

582
01:02:10,619 --> 01:02:15,660
get three quarters of a second you know here and then eventually it settles down and

583
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:21,480
and I'm here so so that sounds good to me thank you yeah so do we have to we

584
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:27,980
talked about the family program so we have to make room for it so thank you all very much
