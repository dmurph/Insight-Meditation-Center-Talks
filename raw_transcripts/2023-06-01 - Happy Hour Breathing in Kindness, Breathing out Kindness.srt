1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
all right so hello and welcome to happy hour

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,620
so for today's theme of practice

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:19,500
um I'd like to invite us to consider a uh starting starting with meta with

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:27,300
kindness loving kindness for ourselves for this body and then spreading it outward spreading

5
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,340
it outward but we start from ourselves and if you've been coming to happier for

6
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:39,840
a while you know that we uh we always start um we tend to start by filling our own

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,140
cup um and then we share then we spread we

8
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:54,420
shift we take on the perspective of kindness care not just for this being for that is me but for all beings

9
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,460
everywhere so that's going to be the progression and um

10
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:06,060
and whatever arises as long as you are kind as long as you

11
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:12,119
make space for whatever Rises you're doing this practice right whatever Rises

12
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,520
as long as you're kind if it's pain in the body

13
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,220
ah if you're kind to it if you make space for it

14
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,259
if you receive it with Good Will instead of aversion pushing it away

15
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:34,860
just be kind be kind be kind that's all his practice is about cultivating

16
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:41,100
kindness towards whatever Rises so with that as

17
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,159
the Prelude let's begin let's settle

18
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:54,740
in our bodies in this moment arriving

19
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,159
as well as we are able to

20
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,539

23
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:45,920
of sitting of our feet our legs on the Earth

24
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,500

26
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,099

29
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:28,340

30
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:38,480

your rooms are closed and we have a few minutes for Reflections so uh I'm also

167
00:31:54,179 --> 00:32:01,980
going to change the chart settings so you can type them to me directly in which case they'll be private uh I'll

168
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:08,039
only read the reflection not your name or you can type them to everyone if you want in which case I'll read your

169
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:14,640
reflection and your name as well and you can also raise your hand just like Claire hi Claire

170
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:20,760
hmm I know I spoke recently so I'll be brief but we were talking about the

171
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:29,399
physical aspects of the meditation tonight and I was just trying to tell the rest of my team that I actually sort

172
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:37,320
of started meditating as a cyclist when you're on the bike you can't think

173
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:43,740
you just have to deal with your body and your environment and and focus on that

174
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:49,260
there's no thinking going on and it's a form of meditation

175
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:55,860
yeah it's a different way of being very present in the moment yeah it's very interesting climbing too also rock

176
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:01,620
climbing as well it's very easy to be so present in the discursive yeah so many

177
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:08,340
different types of meditations like sports right there's so many different types thanks that's why I like to do it

178
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:14,460
because it gets me out of here yeah yeah I think he might yeah thank you

Sangha but also sitting in the morning too you know being with people whose faces I don't say for the

187
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,919
most well I guess I don't see them um that has another feeling too but it's

188
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:19,919
there's an intimacy that I've never felt sitting with people in person and

189
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:25,980

you the way you respond the the the

things have shifted and wow to actually pause and acknowledge that is profound

198
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:25,740
is the fact that it has happened and you notice that it has happened and also the sense of appreciation and and gratitude

yes you're singing perfectly right thank you as I said I'm pretty new to this but

226
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:26,460
I've always been meditating in some form or the other I just realized today as I was

227
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:32,040
meditating what a luxury it is and you know it's one of the best things

228
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:37,579
I can do for myself it's just sitting there being loving to myself

229
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:42,900
valuing my energy that if I send it out into this world it's going to matter

230
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:48,119
uh it's just such a luxury thank you thank you for I'm just so

231
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:53,339
grateful that this is here and I found it so thank you thank you for everyone

232
00:38:53,339 --> 00:39:00,060
who's here and especially and thank you thank you so much

233
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:06,000
beautiful yeah what a you know it's both a luxury and it's a

234
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:14,240
necessity it's a necessity that we spend our time this way we we incline

235
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:22,380
our minds towards kindness towards ourselves towards the world it's

236
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:29,820
um it's both a necessity and luxury and it's a radical act in in these times

237
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:37,200
because it's so easy to give into to give into hatred and disillusionment and

238
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:43,200
and not enoughness I'm not enough I'm not good enough I'm not good others are

239
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:49,079
not whoa ouch ouch ouch so it's actually a necessity it's

240
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:56,460
getting in touch it's it's inclining our hearts towards goodness to reconnect our hearts

241
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:02,880
with its own goodness to see our own goodness it grows it grows when we see

242
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:08,760
our own goodness it it shines it grows both for our own benefit and also for

243
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,579
the benefit of the world we do this so that we can serve it's this is not you

244
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:22,560
know when I use the word luxury it's not this luxurious thing that we do for self you know uh self preoccupy we're just

245
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:29,700
gonna know there's a reason for it and the reason for it is so that we become Kinder gentler not just to ourselves but

246
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:35,040
to everybody else so that we serve so it's

247
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:41,359
it is it is out of service it out it's out of love it's out of the the

248
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:47,700
bodhisattva wow it's the body cheetah intention to serve all beings including

249
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:56,900
this being who is myself with love and care so so meditation is a necessity

250
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:02,099
thank you all thank you for your Reflections for your practice it's such

251

253
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:20,220
