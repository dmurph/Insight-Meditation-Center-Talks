1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,940
well as I um

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,599
do when I come here I in the meditation I think about what are these are these different things come up

3
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,280
into my mind what I should talk about

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,460
and then I let him go

5
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,059
I try not to grab onto any of them

6
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,899
but one thing that strikes me is that um

7
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,559
we're all sitting together here

8
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:59,940
and it just feels to me like uh that we're that it's a stream of awareness

9
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:06,420
that we're sharing that maybe this sounds far-fetched to you but this is how I experience it that there's a

10
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,540
stream of awareness in here that we're that we're sharing

11
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,860
or maybe it's just my stream of awareness or not just my stream of awareness it is

12
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,000
my stream of awareness

13
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,060
what could be greater what could be

14
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,799
more vast more imminent

15
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:53,040
more pervasive if I want to think of something to talk

16
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,280
about that's true what could be more true

17
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:09,500
than this I don't know if I should say my stream of awareness this stream of awareness

18
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,140
and I say it's in the room but

19
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:31,760
it is in the room it's bigger it's well I can see the room

20
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:40,459
I can feel the space of the room I can see all of you

21
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:53,359
or except looking at different senses I can taste a little bit of something in my mouth so the awareness

22
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:03,800
has all of these qualities of the five senses

23
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,540
your five senses your hearing

24
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,900
you can hear right you can hear something maybe I hear something I don't think I have tinnitus but I

25
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,480
always hear of something in my inner ear that's

26
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:31,159
a great teacher calls it The Sound of Silence

27
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:44,159
I can definitely see you can see right you can hear if you're kind of examine your tongue

28
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,019
you can probably taste a little something there

29
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:56,819
and certainly we feel we feel our bodies

30
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:00,080
we feel hot or cold

31
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:12,060
and we are there's some feeling in our body some feeling

32
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:18,239
like you could say it's an emotion perhaps but some feeling that we have we have a

33
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:25,580
feeling we always have a feeling if we look look at it

34
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,199
and we have thoughts

35
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:48,360
and that's it that's all we got we have the five sense perceptions

36
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,300
thoughts and feelings

37
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,380
is there any is there anything more that you have than that

38
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:10,758
it's kind of amazing isn't it it's all we got

39
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,560
and it keeps going in this stream of

40
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:24,900
feelings thoughts Sensations tastes see

41
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,120
ing hearing and it goes on and on and on is

42
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,600
this stream

43
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:45,740
and sometimes we get really busy try to create a better stream

44
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:55,039
what we want we want the best stream we want a good stream

45
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:01,699
that's I think I re that should be respected we want a good stream we want to be happy

46
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:09,180
we want to have well-being so that's something else that I think is

47
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:15,120
in US there's this stream of awareness

48
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,340
and I talked about a feeling before well

49
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:25,919
there's something in us that wants to be happy that one's well-being that's probably

50
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:32,120
why we're here

51
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:39,680
it's probably why you meditate you want to have well-being

52
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:50,160
trouble is we want more well-being than is what is so amply provided

53
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,819
so amply abundantly provided by this stream

54
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,479
we want more

55
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,220
but I really respect that we want well-being

56
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:23,160
that we want to be happy that we want ease

57
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,560
we want all kinds of things that we should have it's

58
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,819
kind of our Birthright

59
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,960
and that's love that wanting that

60
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:50,780
I want you to have well-being nice to see you

61
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,460
and I want you to have well-being and I want all of you to have well-being it's just natural

62
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,620
if we aren't obscured by

63
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,599
by the uh odious

64
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:26,240
quality of comparative thinking competitive thinking

65
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:38,099
where I was originally trained there was a saying

66
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:42,320
that stuck in me all it's just

67
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:50,360
all these years comparisons are odious

68
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:01,880
compared to comparisons destroy our well-being

69
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,079
measuring ourselves against others

70
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,899
making a thing

71
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,240
out of me or me making a me and a you

72
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,680
and comparing measuring

73
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,800
everything's going so well the stream of awareness is going so well and I want to be you know happy and I want you to be

74
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,260
happy and I want well I want there to be well-being and ease and and then

75
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:56,459
oh then all of a sudden I compare myself to someone else ugh

76
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:59,540
what a buzz kill

77
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,940
the Buddha said a couple of things about this but one

78
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:17,000
that I remember word for word

79
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:23,640
is he who sees through

80
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:30,920
the deception of

81
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:38,399
more than less than or equal to

82
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,660
will not suffer

83
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,920
so the Buddha is saying

84
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,399
in a way this is the secret to life

85
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:04,920
if you can give up or not indulge in

86
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:12,360
comparative thinking you won't suffer

87
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,459
and we all know that's what Buddhism is all about right

88
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:24,480
how not to suffer but we do it anyhow

89
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:31,940
and I'm not saying I'm not going to do it and I'm not saying you shouldn't do it and I'm not saying

90
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:38,899
you shouldn't suffer or that I shouldn't suffer

91
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:57,440
or maybe we can be at ease with our suffering we can allow the suffering

92
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,820
to be there in the Stream of awareness

93
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:17,060
just relaxing and let the suffering be

94
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,800
you know if we want to get rid of suffering I don't want this suffering

95
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:35,940
I want to yeah that's a lot of me

96
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,140
that's a lot of control

97
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,560
and it brings more suffering

98
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,720
so there's comparative thinking

99
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:06,740
Maybe or something else comes along that makes you suffer makes me suffer like a

100
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,880
habitual pattern arises

101
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,079
an affliction

102
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:29,240
there's one school of thought it's called The Yoga Chara School

103
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:37,560
that says there aren't just those seven things the five sense perceptions

104
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,480
and and um

105
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:49,459
thinking and feeling

106
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,160
but there's an eighth one afflictions

107
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,620
inflictive an afflictive mind that we have an afflictive mind that we turn our

108
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:08,399
thoughts and our feelings and our Sensations into a me a self

109
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:14,720
and I don't know if this is interesting to you

110
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,579
maybe it's kind of academic I don't know it is to me it's interesting

111
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:29,240
there's an afflictive Consciousness a me Consciousness that suffers

112
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,320
so to bring it back to Earth

113
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:43,100
we probably mostly from comparative thinking we have anger

114
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,420
hatred

115
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:56,899
jealousy it all has to do with other people

116
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:04,820
self-doubt I'm not as good as

117
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,800
fear anxiety

118
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:24,660
so you have your own afflictive thoughts

119
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,339
and feelings I hope you know them

120
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:40,820
I heard a fellow a great teacher today saying

121
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:51,680
so it takes the these afflictions they come in many shapes and forms in a different circumstances

122
00:15:52,620 --> 00:16:00,440
but he says they're really just they're just in each of us just one or two maybe one

123
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,579
so when you think about your suffering over the years

124
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:16,940
and years and years and years and it's kind of the same suffering

125
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:30,899
I was talking to a friend of mine today about that I I think that's a very interesting

126
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:37,800
thought there's only one or two seems like there's such a variety

127
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:43,860
come up in this situation and we think about our our life of suffering and you know how it was suffering in high school

128
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:48,980
and suffering when you know we were you know

129
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,639
College suffering and

130
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:03,259
midlife suffering suffering these days

131
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:10,199
and it kind of has the same flavor my you know your flavor is going to be different from your flavor but

132
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:15,660
but it's based on maybe some something that happened in the family

133
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,298
some habitual pattern that originated in your family

134
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:32,659
so

135
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:42,720
just let it be let let that Consciousness be

136
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,799
just let it be

137
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:58,140
and letting it be is like this love

138
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:04,140
that wants us this essential love that we have that once well-being

139
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:11,899
that wants us to be happy that wants us to Beauty so be at ease with suffering just let it be

140
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:19,679
fight with our suffering don't have to get entangled with our

141
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,100
suffering

142
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:35,160
letting it be my darling

143
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,840
suffer all you want go ahead

144
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:46,159
treating your suffering holding it

145
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,640
with warmth

146
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:59,360
it's not your fault we all have this

147
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,940
eighth consciousness

148
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:20,700
actually the yoga Chara School I'm getting my numbers confused

149
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:27,179
five sense objects thinking is six and then the afflictive Consciousness is

150
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:32,460
7. so yeah and then the yoga charter school

151
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:37,620
has another another Consciousness that they describe and the Buddha

152
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:43,400
also described this in a Sutra all of these things

153
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,980
and it's called the Elia vignana

154
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:59,419
it's beneath our Consciousness it's a storehouse consciousness it stores all of our Karma

155
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:12,679
it's like it's um I think of it like a some ground some some vast vast ground

156
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:18,360
and it said when we do something I could do something quote unquote good

157
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,820
it goes into our Elia vignana and it becomes a seed

158
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:30,320
we do something bad it becomes a seed so the alive vinyana

159
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:36,260
I like this I think it's it makes sense to me

160
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:43,220
it's a ground that holds all of these seeds of our Karma

161
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:50,240
and then something happens

162
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:57,799
and a seed sprouts you never know what's going to happen

163
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,760
look at all the things that happened to you today

164
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:09,120
you never know what kind of karma is going to arise tomorrow you might want to

165
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:15,000
love someone hug someone you might want to be irid you might get irritated or

166
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,100
afraid of someone or you know all kinds of things happen you might start feeling lonely

167
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:29,000
insecure it's coming from our Elia vinyana and then the

168
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,000
afflictive Consciousness makes a me

169
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:43,760
out of that I am insecure

170
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:51,080
I'm full of Rage I want

171
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:59,820
and all of those suffer and it's all part of this flow of

172
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,679
awareness it just keeps flowing

173
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:15,919
and we can embrace it all with

174
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:20,658
with love

175
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:31,760
by love I mean by allowing it just allowing it to flow

176
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,900
I'm not going to try to stop you

177
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,760
I don't know what's going to happen next but it's okay with me

178
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:53,779
there are thousands of thoughts that keep coming through my mind

179
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,360
Let It Be who cares so what

180
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:20,059
there's a saying the greatest transformation

181
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:28,760
the greatest transformation is non-transformation

182
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:36,380
just letting it be is the greatest transformation

183
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:53,280
we work so hard sometimes to create a better me or get rid of a

184
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,320
worse me a bad me

185
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:08,600
or we work so hard in so many things that have to do with comparisons with others

186
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:16,559
makes me sad to think about it making making trying to get people to

187
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:22,580
like us and say with good things about us think well of us and

188
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:31,080
I know a guy he's a scientist and he he just really really wants to be so

189
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,299
he's a great guy but he really wants to be successful

190
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:41,640
any he wakes up at night thinking about

191
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:48,539
this this this stuff this these projects that are going through his mind and he's really nervous about he wants them to be

192
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:51,139
successful

193
00:24:54,120 --> 00:25:01,159
I hope he accepts that and lets it be because that's the way it is for him

194
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,200
without trying to

195
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,679
become anything special

196
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:36,919
do anything special

197
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:51,200
because really what could be more special

198
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,140
than this

199
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,840
this past

200
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:19,760
awareness is as big as this room right we can sense this whole room

201
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:27,860
and we can sense so many things

202
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,580
I was meditating this morning

203
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:01,940
trying to remember what was going on um

204
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:10,580
it wasn't exactly this but it was something like what's the meaning of life

205
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:21,059
what's the meaning of this it wasn't exactly that it was more of a feeling looking for something some kind

206
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:25,158
of something I was looking for

207
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:32,000
some discontent was there

208
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:46,820
what's the meaning of life what's the meaning of your life what is the meaning of your life

209
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:52,340
is it your work your relationships your

210
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:06,020
it's really got to come down to just this just this

211
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,779
there's a Buddha right here

212
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:21,240
just this he's sitting right in the middle of it and he has so much there's so much

213
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:27,140
meaning in that Buddha

214
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,880
serenely sitting in the middle of

215
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,380
just this

216
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,260
just relaxed

217
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,799
is this enough for you

218
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,679
I have a

219
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:37,860
an ink drawing on my altar made by our Suzuki Roshi's son her witso

220
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,760
Rochelle

221
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:49,220
and it is a very simple

222
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:58,100
it's a carrot a couple of carrots in front of a rabbit

223
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:08,460
the carrots are orange and the rabbit is but it's very simple just an ink drawing of this carrot with of this rabbit with

224
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:17,840
just it's not complex the eyes are dots but they're very awake dots

225
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:25,940
so it's just this simple rabbit with these carrots in front of him

226
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:32,059
and the calligraphy says I have enough

227
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:41,840
I have enough

228
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:49,340
with whatever is happening right now

229
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:59,539
with the vast space of awareness

230
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:07,740
and the feelings in your body and the thoughts in your mind

231
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:12,840
and your eyesight your sounds you hear and all these things

232
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,919
and your afflictions

233
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:30,059
and your welcoming of it all Your Love

234
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:35,520
welcoming it all owing it all to take place and to flow

235
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,480
freely flow

236
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:47,539
whatever is happening allowing it to happen is love

237
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:54,740
without getting in the way of it can you do any better than that

238
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:09,960
I had a dream the night before last that I walked into

239
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:16,140
a pet shop and I saw these

240
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:21,779
little puppies doggies in cages on a Shelf

241
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:27,840
looking out Yorkies they look like small dog like Yorkies or

242
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:34,860
chihuahuas and I felt very bad for these doggies

243
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:39,080
as I always do when I go into Pet Shops

244
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:47,039
and then the the sales girl

245
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:53,658
said the owner the roshi isn't here right now

246
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:02,279
and when she said the owner the roshi

247
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:07,440
something completely changed in me and

248
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,760
it made this place this Pet Shop seemed like

249
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:19,860
kind place a realized place like the

250
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:26,760
the realization the Blessed realization

251
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:33,320
of a great master was perfuming this Pet Shop

252
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:44,059
and then I looked at the dogs again and the dogs were not troubled whatsoever

253
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:51,500
they were just sitting there completely at ease

254
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:04,580
so wondering if you have any uh comments or

255
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:10,338
protests or questions about anything that I've said

256
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,839
anything coming up for you that you'd like to talk about

257
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:30,020
David I like what you said about that Reservoir deep inside that holds

258
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:35,220
accumulated past karmas I think that's a lion

259
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:41,820
um it seems to me to be how things are at one level

260
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:48,960
can you take off your mask so I can hear you yeah at one level you see how your mind works and

261
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:55,618
where your attachments and aversions are and

262
00:34:55,619 --> 00:35:02,280
you work on letting go of them and in a way you do but there's some

263
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:09,240
stuff suffering deeper down that you haven't really fully worked it out of yourself

264
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:15,480
does that make sense yeah oh now that sounds like suffering is

265
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:21,839
that what you're talking about uh disease no I mean they lead to

266
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:28,280
suffering but what I'm talking about is patterns patterns yeah that um

267
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:34,740
accumulated I think it's really interesting that it's just one or two things does that make sense to you I

268
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:40,920
hadn't thought of it that way before yeah I think it's amazing if you think about it think about that

269
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:46,140
I didn't recognize you behind your mask but it's so nice to see you yeah

270
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:51,240
um think about it it's just one or two

271
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:56,339
things for instance um

272
00:35:56,339 --> 00:36:02,400
I don't know what it is for you I was talking to a woman today about this and she said oh that's right that's

273
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:08,900
what happened to me when I was a little girl and I felt that way since I was a little girl the same

274
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:14,040
very similar dis ease has come up in so

275
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:19,680
many different forms hers was like being uh left out of the popular group in sixth

276
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,260
grade but then she identified well it's always feeling a little bit left out of this

277
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:31,859
and that and this and that all through her life and that was her thing but uh

278
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:40,338
you might recognize that but it doesn't matter that that's just I just very interesting but um

279
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:55,460
but if we just don't fight with them and allow them to be

280
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:00,800
as they arise from this

281
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:06,359
structure of the LIE of vinyana becoming this and that if we just allow them to

282
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:11,700
float up come into fruition grow into whatever

283
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:19,160
they want to grow into mature blossom into a full-fledged affliction

284
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:27,119
they free themselves they always free themselves they're gone right I don't even know what was bothering me

285
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:33,000
if anything was bothering me an hour or two ago but I know things always you know they're always changing they're

286
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:39,119
always liberating themselves can you think can you remember a thought

287
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:45,599
you had a minute ago so everything is always freeing

288
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:52,500
itself so we don't have to worry so hard so much about I gotta free this I gotta work on this I gotta you know

289
00:37:52,500 --> 00:38:01,040
we drive just relax and let it be and welcome with love accepting allowing

290
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:09,500
there are other ways to work with afflictions this is a very gentle way

291
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:16,140
the way of the path of accepting the path of equanimity

292
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,640
is the path of accepting

293
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:24,440
there are other ways

294
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:31,859
one way is to get rid of them

295
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:38,579
if I think a loving thought if I think a meta thought I can't think a hateful thought

296
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:43,980
can't you can't think two thoughts at the same time for example is another way

297
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:51,500
a way of getting rid of that's a Hinata way

298
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:03,200
this is another way of accepting allowing

299
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:10,680
which I really like because it's so big and generous and warm and compassionate

300
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:18,060
and calling on what's deeply intrinsic to Who We Are

301
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:23,540
we don't have to manufacture anything

302
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:32,099
compassion is here in that acceptance

303
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:38,960
Love is Here we're naturally compassionate I don't want you to suffer

304
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:46,700
I just don't I don't want myself to suffer

305
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:53,180
unless there's some comparative thinking

306
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:59,760
some odious comparative thinking I want you all to be happy and I want myself to be happy and there's this generosity

307
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,020
this openness that was intrinsic

308
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:11,420
and there's this awareness that's intrinsic

309
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:24,540
so all we have to do is relax and simply

310
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:31,200
be ourselves be our perfect selves you're perfect all Just As You Are

311
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:37,500
I'm perfect this is it's so nice it takes all the pressure off

312
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:42,859
the greatest transformation

313
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:47,660
is non-transformation

314
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,480
the Buddha tried so hard

315
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:03,119
with ascetic exercises is stomach was

316
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:10,320
you said a sunflower seed couldn't fit between his spine and his stomach he was just it

317
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:16,079
just almost died by the river and he did all these yogic exercises we need all

318
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:23,720
these concentration exercises going through all these genres and finally he just thought of himself as a child

319
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,259
and he's relaxed

320
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:42,559
and then he said this is profound

321
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,180
this is peaceful

322
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:52,759
just to be

323
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:04,079
and he said this is Luminous this is Luminous

324
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:10,760
the light is on your light is on

325
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:17,720
your light is always on well when you go to sleep it's not on but it's

326
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:24,060
it's always on we don't have to use a flashlight to find our light it's

327
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:29,780
on couldn't be more obvious

328
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:35,180
that's our refuge

329
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:41,660
we don't have to manufacture a refuge

330
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,680
we are we have awareness

331
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:58,338
luminosity we have love we have compassion
