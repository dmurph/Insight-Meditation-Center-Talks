1
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:07,620
so in the world of in here in the United States of spiritual care the field of

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:13,380
spiritual care pastoral care or chaplaincy care

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,660
there was a theologian named Henry nowin

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:25,380
who uh was kind of foundational for establishing kind of a general

5
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,480
field of or the ethos understanding of spiritual

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,360
care in hospitals and Chapman sea and things like that and he had a very there's a very famous

7
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,460
quote they're teaching from him which I don't remember exactly how it is but

8
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,700
um it goes something like this that to offer spiritual care

9
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,579
uh is to create an empty space

10
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,820
in which to welcome the stranger this works particularly well like in

11
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:07,080
chaplaincy where you're meeting people you don't know chaplain is meeting some people they don't know but um but they create the empty space

12
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,479
in which to welcome the stranger and um

13
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:19,680
and so what is this empty space that's that we create and I think it's easier to point out

14
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:26,820
what we the opposite that we create we fill the space with our opinions with our assertiveness where even sometimes

15
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,520
there's no space where people if we talk too much to take care of them if we're taking the initiative and

16
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:40,200
working on them and we fill the space with our judgments we fill the space with our conceit like

17
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,560
I'm special I'm going to be the spiritual caregiver or I'm this and that or sometimes it's negative definitions

18
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,439
of ourselves we have and so kind of the kind of people can feel that we're so you know the emotions

19
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:58,439
and the and the ideas that were kind of living under that there's no space

20
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:06,000
for the other and in offering spiritual care that's the purpose it's to kind of kind of

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,660
clear the air so people can breathe so people can be themselves so people can feel like it's

22
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:21,420
okay to be themselves and they're not being judged or put into a box or and so to recognize that this

23
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:27,599
person is welcomed here as they are completely as they are and that's so important for this kind of spiritual

24
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,760
care because that's the foundation that kind of acceptance is the foundation to

25
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,940
let someone Blossom let someone find themselves let someone grow and develop and

26
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:46,019
kind of become even more who they actually are in some way so we could but we also can do this to

27
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:51,480
ourselves we can create an empty space in which to welcome ourselves

28
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,519
a kind space in which they welcome ourselves and what do we do that gets in the way

29
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:02,459
of that one of the ways is that we live we Define ourselves in a lot of ways and

30
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:07,500
that the way that which we kind of fill the space with definitions of ourselves

31
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:14,640
is one of the things that meditation can help clear out and there are other ways that humans can

32
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:21,060
find ways to clear out the space for themselves clear out all the definitions that we're operating under

33
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:27,540
I mean sometimes you know here here locally someone might go down to the to

34
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:34,680
a to the coast and walk along the shore or the sand it's just big open expanse sometimes and that can be a place where

35
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:41,940
so much Falls away and is forgotten away from society and there's a kind of space there just be and not be defined

36
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:49,500
sometimes somehow the magnitude the magnificence of the Great Pacific Ocean and the sky and the size of it and

37
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:56,099
again just kind of give a very different perspective of who we are where the where whereas from an urban environment

38
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:01,980
it's so easy to be to Define by you know our job our relationships our

39
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:07,440
traffic patterns are you know all kinds of things but sometimes in the night sky

40
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:14,040
and looking at a clear you know dark sky where the all the stars are shining and kind of a very different

41
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:22,639
kind of feeling for who we are that maybe creates a kind of empty space where we're not defined

42
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,080
and um and so meditation can be one of those places where and it's actually an

43
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:35,220
important uh function or or opportunity of meditation is to discover how to be

44
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:42,860
present how to breathe to be attentive with a kind of empty space for ourselves

45
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:48,000
without definition this is represented a little bit I think

46
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,259
or very powerfully by how the Buddha referred to himself we call him the Buddha we'll keep saying

47
00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:00,660
Buddha Buddha Buddha it wasn't called Buddha as often in the

48
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:06,120
ancient to his time when he was alive as much as we're calling him that these days

49
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:12,900
as we kind of settled on this is his name but it's really a Epitaph it's it's not really a given name

50
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:20,940
means the awakened one and he there were people who called him that he seldom called himself that many

51
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:26,720
people called him by his given name gotama and um

52
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,820
but uh how he referred to himself when he was he used this very enigmatic

53
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:39,000
phrase that was maybe not original to him it might have been already a title for

54
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,780
Spiritual teachers in his time and the word in poly is tatagata

55
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:52,020
and tatagata is made up of this word Tata which

56
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,240
is a very simple uh word that means like this

57
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:04,500
or thus or so and the Gata part is lots of people have

58
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,539
written about what this word Gata is but we find it that I've used repeatedly as

59
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:18,960
a suffix that just means something like the one the the thing so the thing that is the

60
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:25,039
one that is so the one who is like this and imagine if someone you go to someone

61
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:32,520
and you say like what are you and who are you and they say oh

62
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,560
I'm like this you get what you see kind of I'm like this maybe maybe they don't even say

63
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:45,419
anything to you they just open their arms and just like here right yeah you know they don't Define themselves

64
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:48,560
it could be a little bit irritating

65
00:06:51,120 --> 00:07:00,840
but um uh there's also something very profound about that where uh where the kind of the way this

66
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,940
the self way of seeing and holding oneself is in this empty space where

67
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:11,819
everything's allowed to be there is welcomed but there's a idea let's not

68
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:17,419
Define it in any one particular way any one particular way of definition

69
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:22,680
Narrows the field doesn't allow for the fullness of what a

70
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:30,300
person is it doesn't allow for the fullness of what a person can grow into in the next minute in the next moment

71
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:38,280
and so to not be defined the Buddha did Define himself at times

72
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:45,120
and he recognized that it's appropriate to Define it's a little bit ringing is it ringing a little bit maybe it's a

73
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,720
little bit too loud let's see is that the better now you're always welcome to say something if the

74
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,979
sound is not good so um the

75
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:03,419
um so the Buddha did you know say there's a time and place to Define

76
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:09,419
people and and he wanted to Define people by

77
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:14,819
what they do so if you're farmering farming then

78
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:21,180
you're a farmer he said if you're a selling Goods you're a merchant if

79
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:26,340
you're a ruler if you're ruling people then you're a ruler if you're a thief he

80
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:31,500
says if you steal if you steal then you're a thief

81
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:38,520
but uh it's a very clearly this is provisional these are just conventions

82
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:44,459
these are just ways of referring to People by what they're doing that just helps us

83
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:51,060
organize our life in efficient way I mean imagine if you go to a hospital say you have a big illness maybe big

84
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:57,000
surgery is needed brain surgery you know and you really wanted to be care about it but that particular day

85
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,260
you go to the hospital they decided you know defining everyone in the hospital by what they do it's just that's old hat

86
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,540
and it limits everyone too much we're today in the hospital everybody who works where works there is not going to

87
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:14,580
have any definition no one's me recognized as a surgeon or as a janitor

88
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:20,459
or as an administrative person we're just there working and so then you know we need someone to

89
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:24,920
come and do surgery everyone shows up

90
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:32,820
you know the whole Hospital thing works so much more efficiently if people kind of are

91
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:40,440
known by their function and what they've been trained to do but when they leave the hospital and

92
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,600
they take off their maybe their uniform and like you know then

93
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,120
they don't have to be defined that way anymore some people want to continue to be

94
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:58,140
defined that way outside of their work they're holding on to it their status their power their their

95
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:03,240
all kinds of things come with certain roles and so people will hold on what is

96
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:09,060
it you better Define me this way let me tell you who I am outside of the context of what they're

97
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:16,019
doing and uh like for me um you know I spent a lot of time

98
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:22,680
teaching but there was a time where it was a beginning teacher I would go home to my

99
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,720
wife and she said to me Gil you're using that voice again

100
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,760
[Laughter]

101
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:38,339
so you know I you know that's the place I can't be a teacher right at home so there's places where you better drop it

102
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:45,060
you know put it aside and um and so um

103
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:51,360
and so this ability to be defined while we're doing something

104
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,120
and drop it when we're not doing it the ability to be defined functionally

105
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:04,680
in the right place by what we're doing in certain situations but to also have the ability to create

106
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:11,959
for ourselves in an empty space where of course you're allowed to be who you are

107
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:20,279
but maybe there is no R maybe there is no thing that you are in terms of fixed

108
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:25,920
static thing in Buddhism the idea is that uh it's uh

109
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:32,160
um who we are is what we're becoming it's always dynamic

110
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,980
it's always changing we're constant in a constant state of becoming and renewing

111
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:44,820
and developing and growing and transforming and changing Buddhism has this very Dynamic view of

112
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:50,220
what a human being is and so because of that the idea of a

113
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:57,600
fixed definition limits the open space in which we can

114
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,640
grow into the next moment the next moment the next moment

115
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:08,820
so we come to meditation and part of what's possible in meditation is to let

116
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:15,540
go of all the definitions let go of all the judgments let go of it

117
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:20,940
all sometimes it's for some people it might be easier to do for the external

118
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:26,519
definitions in meditation maybe that you know the profession we have for example

119
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:32,579
or the place we have in a family it was kind of eye-opening for me when I

120
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:37,860
was in my 20s and I was talking to a zen teacher about my relationship to my father

121
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:44,279
and the zen teacher said to me you know your father

122
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:50,579
there was a time when your father was not a father it was just a person and chances are

123
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:57,019
once you grow you know once you've kind of really left home I was I had already left home but I guess I hadn't

124
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:05,060
um uh you know you know he has a life outside of being a father you know and and I said really

125
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:10,200
it's like oh I just thought that's who he was he's the father and suddenly he

126
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:16,680
became much more multi-dimensional and I and I kind of created space for my father to be something Beyond just a

127
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:22,500
father so it might be some meditation is a place where the external definitions how

128
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:29,459
we are in society maybe can drop away some maybe a little bit easier sometimes than

129
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:36,839
how we do it for ourselves on the inside how we've internalized these things and uh not a few people will Define

130
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:42,300
themselves by their shortcomings will Define themselves by their by

131
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:48,000
negative judgments I'm to this some to that you know for me when I was young in my

132
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,980
20s I was def I kind of I had a wonderful amazing capacity to

133
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:01,260
feel guilty and uh I was just guilty if I breathed

134
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:06,800
somehow just like no matter what that was you know before I did something I was guilty

135
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:14,600
before I even knew I was going to do something I was guilty and um because

136
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:23,100
and I and it was only when I started doing my meditation practice my zen practice I saw how pervasive it was the

137
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,200
first time I saw it was I was walking across the meditation hall floor

138
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:36,120
and I felt guilty in the way I was walking and I said what what's going on here

139
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:41,160
and so we might think we're somehow inadequate or we're not worthy we've

140
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:49,079
sometimes done I feel that way because we've internalized judgments from society and we did our society societies do

141
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:54,720
terrible things to each other judging each other by their race and their gender and their sexual

142
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:01,019
orientation and there's class status and all kinds of things that we do size and

143
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:07,920
age and and then sometimes people internalize it and so they go around feeling that

144
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:14,399
somehow you know they're not unlimited they're not filled with huge unlimited

145
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:20,339
potential to become something in a inner way but rather they're held limited by

146
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:27,540
these judgments these ideas these Concepts that were caught in and so the amazing thing that's possible

147
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:34,019
in meditation is to not just calm down meditations often associated with

148
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:41,880
becoming calm but the calmness is just the kind of the tip of the iceberg of what can happen as

149
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:47,519
the mind gets still there and quieter and one of the things that can happen is that

150
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:53,639
um the activity of the Mind to judge the activity of the mind to

151
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:59,399
Define takes a break takes a vacation

152
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:06,300
and we come to a time when we feel ourselves we experience ourselves without any definition

153
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:13,139
so that like the Buddha at those moments if someone said who are you what are you

154
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:19,199
it would be a sincere answer to just go like to lift your arms out

155
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:26,100
you know wide and spread them wide and just like to hear it you know just in the gesture imply just this

156
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:32,220
or maybe you say who you know someone says who are you what are you I'm this

157
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,800
no definition beyond that and they have to just kind of somehow deal with that

158
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:43,560
or take that in or but that seems sincere anything else seems like it

159
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:50,399
maybe limits it or narrows it or and um and uh

160
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,699
so to come to a place where this sincere answer is this this is who I am

161
00:16:56,699 --> 00:17:05,059
sincere place is we've created an empty space in which to welcome ourselves

162
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:12,720
empty space to allow whatever we're kind of meant to be or whatever

163
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,600
the conditions come together to move through us and wants to grow and develop and express itself

164
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:24,418
that we we kind of begin creating space when seeing that and discovering it

165
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:30,120
one of the advantages of doing this at the empty space this non-definition

166
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:37,799
is we can see much more clearly when we begin defining ourselves

167
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:44,779
we can see more clearly when we begin acting and you know becoming something

168
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:51,080
and if in fact what you're becoming is the hateful one

169
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:57,059
you'll be the one who hates the hater you can see that

170
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:03,480
clearly and in that clarity where you haven't been judging yourself

171
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,179
you haven't been criticizing yourself or feeling guilty you continue to not criticize yourself

172
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:14,280
you continue not feeling guilty but you recognize for example the hate

173
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:20,039
that arises and you recognize this is not good this is not useful

174
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:25,260
this limits me this really limits me in fact the Buddha said that very clearly

175
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:30,299
he said create hate and delusion are limiters

176
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:35,580
they'd limit people they kind of you know and um

177
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:43,020
and so we can feel the cost of having hate in a way that we can't if we're living an active stressed racing

178
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:48,419
around life and we don't even you know just feels like like

179
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:54,419
hate can just feel like just I don't know it's an automatic pilot

180
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:59,520
and people don't realize that they were hating until after they're arrested for

181
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:05,580
road rage because they were so beside themselves and what they've caught up in

182
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:11,340
this ability to come into some modicum of an empty space where we can Welcome

183
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:17,580
All Of Who We Are can help us be much more responsible for

184
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:24,179
what we are and what arises within us without judgment without criticism and we can learn to recognize when

185
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:29,940
what's coming through us is healthy and not a problem and when it has uh

186
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:37,940
motivated by unhealthy things like uh greed and lust or conceit or hate

187
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:45,120
this is a hugely powerful insight to have and to see that and then to work with

188
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:52,500
that and practice with it then maybe return to the empty space because the empty space that welcomes a

189
00:19:52,500 --> 00:20:00,000
stranger is a kind space is a place of kindness a place that

190
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:07,919
allows for the heart's care to be there it's a Caring Place remember the Henry now and as quote was

191
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,440
a quote for people who are caregivers spiritual

192
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:20,280
caregivers that's a space they're creating for their care so to have that care

193
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:26,700
for ourselves have us care for others to just by have a discovering how not to

194
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:33,600
how to breathe be alive be attentive without definition

195
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:40,520
maybe in a way that can be a bit like okay

196
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:47,100
very very clean glass have you ever gone up to a glass door

197
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:53,340
and tried to walk through it without realizing it was a glass I've done that

198
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:59,940
it's just so clear so clean and clear I don't see it but you know if the glasses they're fine like we have here for the

199
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:07,140
birds the decal on the door that defines us a door for the birds so they know but you know or the dirt the window is

200
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:14,100
dirty or or or you know tinted or whatever it defines but what's really clear

201
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:19,559
then you know it kind of has no definition so the mind can become like a clear

202
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:25,220
window or even better an open window

203
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:33,080
so um so to sit meditate

204
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:40,559
and to see what our mind is doing without judgment

205
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:47,039
to see what our mind is doing dedicated to create an open welcoming

206
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:52,140
space for all of it can allow

207
00:21:52,140 --> 00:22:00,059
the warm open space can allow that tension to unwind it can allow the the

208
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:06,240
stress that's behind so much of our everyday Behavior to settle and quiet

209
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:13,620
and the stress behind defining ourselves the stress behind being caught in self-definitions and self-judgments has

210
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:20,280
a chance to relax and relax and relax and so you can follow the path

211
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:25,919
of that relaxation follow the path to less and less

212
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:31,500
being defined by anything until you find that the absence of

213
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:38,280
definition provides a freedom and a capacity

214
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:44,539
to welcome everyone in a friendly space

215
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:50,720
so those are my thoughts today so do you have any thoughts

216
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:59,000
did anybody have any comments or questions if you could use the mic the Camille's going to give you to you

217
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:05,520
hi thank you um yeah yeah thank you um just what you're

218
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,740
talking about is what I'm really working with right now and I'm really realizing how much I hate

219
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:16,860
and I think a lot of it comes from obviously projection of self-hatred but

220
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:22,380
also I'm just using like um like trusting my own

221
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:27,780
um inner guidance as far as where my hate goes like

222
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:35,880
sometimes I mean I I knew someone who was a Buddhist teacher who hit her dog things like that and I had so much hate

223
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:41,820
I I just anyone who hurts an animal I just it just fills me with a rage

224
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:46,919
and um so I don't even really know where I'm going with this but I guess I have a lot

225
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:53,820
of confusion sometimes about like what to accept what to reject and my own inner guidance but knowing

226
00:23:53,820 --> 00:24:00,240
that I also just don't have it all figured out so I feel like things are really tight at the same time but also

227
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:07,440
really spacious and I don't know I just it feels really groundless right now and it's it's scary yeah well I certainly

228
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:14,460
appreciate the clarity in which you can talk about this hate that you have at rage I mean that's quite phenomenal to

229
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:22,280
have that kind of clarity and to be able to have the the willingness to say it publicly like this

230
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:29,460
I take this to be really healthy what you just did so I think I think you're on a I think

231
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:35,400
you're in a good path and the fact that you're kind of feeling groundless at

232
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:41,039
this particular juncture probably there's no way around that do you think it is a groundless time to kind of come

233
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:47,100
to terms with it to deal with the see it so clearly and the fact that you can hold both both some kind of more

234
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:52,200
spacious wave and to struggle with this hate and rage I

235
00:24:52,200 --> 00:25:01,020
think you're in probably in good hands with yourself and I think the probably just go continue because the the hate that

236
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:07,020
you're feeling the rage you're feeling it probably needs uh that that friendly

237
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:13,679
welcoming space it's probably something actually it's probably a symptom of something deeper

238
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:21,000
yeah yeah and so don't feed the hate but make room for it befriend it so it

239
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:28,980
has space and time and because it might begin to settle enough that you can feel what the what's

240
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:35,100
actually underneath it and uh and I don't want to limit you what it might be yeah but just to give

241
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:41,100
you a hint thank you [Laughter] that I think a high percentage of people

242
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:47,100
who have hate and rage somewhere underneath it there's a deep sense of hurt

243
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:52,799
and So eventually it's the hurt that really needs your attention and care and

244
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:59,039
to be sidetracked too much by believing the hate or acting on the hate is actually disservice to what really needs

245
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:03,860
the needs the attention thank you

246
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:15,000
hello can you hear me yes thank you um

247
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,179
thank you for what you shared today your teaching resonated for me

248
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:28,500
not only in what I'm working on right now but in relation to a kind of tangential idea which might be relatable

249
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:34,500
for others which is one of the things I discover when I'm meditating in that

250
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,900
when I'm in the open space when all has fallen away and I'm in the Stillness is

251
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:48,600
that that is where there's space Not only to let go of defining but to let go of self-judgment to work with my thought

252
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:56,100
life to be able to notice that I am believing my thoughts and to then choose

253
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:03,539
to not only allow starting with the allowance and then for me there's prayer involved as well

254
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:10,320
so in connecting to to source and opening and in that I'm creating

255
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:17,039
space and I'm deeply grateful that you put some words to what happens there

256
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:23,460
very nice thank you and very nice and they're just to add something to what you said is that as you're doing what

257
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:30,299
you're doing making that space seeing your thoughts and what you believe it's probably a process of continuing

258
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:37,020
ability to open more space New Dimensions of more space and then you see more and more deeply what some of

259
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:42,860
the thought patterns are and which ones are healthy and which are not foreign

260
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:50,940
yes thank you Gail for today's talk so

261
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:56,940
continuing on some of the points that have been raised I just wanted to ask if you mentioned we need to create an open

262
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:03,120
space where we don't have judgments but often we come with judgments and you

263
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,159
know it's tight and restricted so is the path of going from the Titan restricted

264
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:13,919
space to open non-judging is it basically acknowledging what's coming

265
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:20,820
and giving space for what's coming and is that the path by which it happens or does it happen through developing you

266
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:27,539
know a meditation practice it's a great great question and so

267
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:33,840
hopefully my my response will address it one of the really important

268
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:40,380
abilities we have as human beings that maybe is underappreciated

269
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:48,360
is the capacity to have the veto over what we do to say I'm not going to say that I'm not

270
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:54,120
going to do that we don't necessarily have a control over what the mind

271
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:59,700
kicks up the thoughts their motivations what we feel like we want to say what we

272
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:06,539
want to do that is maybe outside of our control to always and that's why it's good not to

273
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:11,760
be able to judge ourselves for what comes because it's not necessarily in our control what comes

274
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:18,899
but we do have and that's what we want to have as a minimum in Buddhist practice we want to have the ability to

275
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:24,600
have the veto power and so okay I'm not going to say that

276
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:30,840
and I'm not going to act on that and so learning to be restrained to be at peace

277
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:37,380
to be at ease in not doing is a phenomenal capacity

278
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:44,460
it doesn't sound very exciting to be restrained right I mean we come to IMC and learn how to be restrained

279
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:49,799
I mean no one's going to come it just feels like you know that's too

280
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:56,940
restrained that's too limited that's too something but it's actually the opposite that as we learn not to act on

281
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:02,700
the unhealthy motivations unhealthy harmful things that we mind is capable of doing

282
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:09,000
or not or if we're unsure whether it's healthy or harmful to maybe hold back

283
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,299
we actually then get closer to that place of being undefined being unlimited at being free we're actually exercising

284
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:21,360
our freedom in doing the veto power does that address your concern yes thank

285
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:28,620
you so what you're saying is keep doing the vetoing until you go from a constricted space into an open space in

286
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:34,640
the mind and eventually develops all the time like not just during meditation yeah especially if you're in social work

287
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,840
you know there are times of course where you want to kind of give free reign to

288
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:47,159
what's going on in the mind and sometimes meditation is that place when I used to go to the gym I worked in

289
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:53,279
exercise machines that was a time I gave free reign to my mind and I would sometimes close my eyes doing some of

290
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:59,640
the exercises and just let let complete freedom to let mine do whatever it wanted to do or if I go for a walk up in

291
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:05,520
the hills here um and uh there have been times when I've been really angry and I go for a

292
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:12,360
while I'm not going to do anything to anyone I'm not going to say anything or do anything but I'm going to go walk fast up in the hills

293
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:19,020
and let that just kind of course through me so I'm not restrict not I'm not suppressing anything

294
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:26,100
I'm not repressing anything it's very important to see it clearly but what the veto power is over is

295
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:32,299
causing harm with it thank you again

296
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,899
thank you good morning and thank you for thanks very much for the talk Gail

297
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:47,580
um so I've become become aware that sometimes kind of building on what you were you were just saying um that I can either have a response to

298
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:52,799
someone that seems unkind or even an immature reaction

299
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:57,840
so it just strikes me that it's almost like I have a bunch of three-year-olds and seven-year-olds

300
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:04,440
within me yes and I've kind of got to say no no kids we're not going to do that right yeah yeah but sometimes it

301
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:10,260
comes out and you do it but sometimes we believe much of the times sometimes you need to call on the inner adult yes

302
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:15,299
exactly exactly or or the inner grandparents if you have good references

303
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:20,520
for that and so we have we have all these capacities we can't necessarily control

304
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:28,740
of whether this inner kids are doing you know having a party but uh but you know you do have the veto

305
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:34,140
power about what's what what spills out and hopefully by nurturing them over

306
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:39,360
time you can help them maybe grow up a little bit yes I think very much so very

307
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:45,860
very much so yes is there a mic over there

308
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:53,220
where's the other mic oh you have it there okay hi good morning

309
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:59,399
um um I think going back to you know having that veto power is a way to have

310
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:05,820
inner love for yourself but then also external love for those that you're talking to having that

311
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:12,659
respect and so I'm glad you brought that up because I think that's very important it's something that I think a lot of

312
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:18,240
people miss these days because they just care about I have an opinion I have an opinion I

313
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:24,419
have an opinion but it's not more of you know well maybe what I'm saying is going to be hurtful to that particular person

314
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:31,200
yeah and I'm glad you brought up the space about not making not only making space for a

315
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:37,919
stranger but making space for yourself because I think a lot of us just forget that uh who we were

316
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:43,980
and kind of comparing that to who we've become and I think that's something that

317
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:49,500
gets lost in some sort of translation as we're growing older and older and older

318
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:56,100
um we forget that you know hey um I'm so busy with my external life that I forget that I need to you know

319
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:02,460
take a step back and go who was it before and what am I missing and I think that's

320
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:07,799
something that a lot of people can you know take advantage of

321
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:13,260
um by the way off topic you have a great aura I'm just

322
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:18,540
I'm seeing that I'm seeing that in you um but uh yeah I think that's I mean it's

323
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:24,480
important for people to be kind to each other yeah overall great great yeah thank you that was really well said

324
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,878
thank you very much and and so as it just reinforces again it

325
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:34,580
says it a different way you know important meditation can be

326
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:41,220
thank you for the talk um I was thinking when you were talking about how the Buddha defined people by

327
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:46,378
their jobs Merchant teacher doctor and so forth and then you spoke personally

328
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:51,720
about your teaching voice when you got home and were with your wife so I was

329
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:57,180
thinking about fixed views and that's one thing that makes us uh suffer fixed

330
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:03,080
view of oneself if I'm this I need to behave and respond in a particular way

331
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:08,280
so you hinted at it but I wonder if you could speak to how having this fixed

332
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:14,760
view of self doctor teacher lawyer brilliant physician can really be

333
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:20,640
something that we cling to and cause some difficulty in our lives more suffering

334
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:26,579
yeah well if we went one is a little bit well when I come back to what you said I

335
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:33,420
think if we took if there's too crowded with too many definitions and activities there's no space for love there's no

336
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:39,000
space for kindness there's no space for inquiry there's no space for deeper

337
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:45,599
self-discovery and and then but if we cling to like these roles these jobs and stuff it can

338
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:51,480
be a headache for the people around you you know because they're happy you're expecting them to participate in the

339
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:58,740
idea you know you better treat me that you know I'm like you know you know you better treat me with the

340
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:05,700
right respect because you know guess who I am you know and I'm this way and yeah and I noticed for myself I was a

341
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:13,140
teacher for a number of years and defining myself or thinking I was teacher uh was a heavy load to carry so

342
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:18,240
it's much more liberating and freeing psychologically to to say oh I'm just

343
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:25,619
who I am or I am the I I am what you see basically rather than having to put on the role of a

344
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:32,579
teacher all the time so that that was a a weight that I um somehow got

345
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:39,660
rid of at some point but it can be a pretty heavy burden for people there are people who would prefer that

346
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:46,200
when they meet strangers or something that the strangers don't ask them what do you do the first you know right away because

347
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:51,839
somehow that immediately defines them too much you know they don't want to be defined so quickly by what they do

348
00:36:51,839 --> 00:37:00,240
and other people love it and then in between It's just sometimes a very very nice way to connect so how

349
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:07,680
do you know where in that Spectrum it is it depends on the context the person but so I think we should stop and um but

350
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:14,820
we'll if you want to come out in the parking lot now I think it's warm enough uh bring a folding chair with you and we

351
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:19,920
can sit in the circle take off masks and outside and um and continue the

352
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:27,300
discussion maybe we often do this on Sundays so everyone's welcome to stay and thank you for being here today and

353
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:31,040
thank you for your great comments and questions
