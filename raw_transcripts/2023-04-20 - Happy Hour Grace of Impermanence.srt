00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,839
great so hello everyone hello and welcome to happy hour

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:14,040
and um delighted to feel your presence whatever your time zone it's the present

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,140
moment yay we're sharing this present moment

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,420
this illusion of time in together how

5
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:30,900
how great is that so so for the theme

6
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,940
um of this evening I want to talk about

7
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:43,260
um or invite us to practice with kindness kindness towards ourselves compassion

8
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,780
towards ourselves with impermanence befriending impermanence

9
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,860
sometimes impermanence is on our side when

10
00:00:54,860 --> 00:01:03,000
say the short term there's something that's troubles us maybe something that you

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,659
know you had a meeting that didn't go well or something it just you know you've got a parking ticket again the

12
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:15,060
short term the short terms like ah there's an out but if you take the

13
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,939
long-term view the longer term Horizon with impermanence to changing all the

14
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:27,000
time the nature of of Our Lives changing all the time in

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,700
the big picture this thing that perhaps happened today or last week or the past

16
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,520
month isn't the big pictures it shifts and changes it's not we can have a

17
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:46,259
larger perspective so even though of course holding this with compassion but but it is impermanent

18
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:54,240
um so there's some Reflections having to do with that so bringing impermanence long long term View and

19
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,780
kindness compassion and Equanimity so well we'll practice together and see

20
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:07,860
what arises sounds like a lot a tall order but you know we'll just take our time together and explore

21
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,739
explore our hearts and and see what what is um supportive so

22
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:20,340
so okay with that let's uh let's begin together let's begin

23
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,520
let's settle into our seat if you need to shift and move

24
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,319
into a comfortable position

25
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:44,659
and arriving in this body In This Moment In Time

26
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:12,019
letting the breath be received in the abdomen take the breath be breathed

27
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,720
breath the entirety of being breath the pause

28
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,840
the entirety of the Opera and the pause

29
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:31,620
taking some time to befriend the in-breath pauses and the out breath in your own time

30
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:37,099
letting them extend a little bit slowing down

31
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:32,180
of your thoughts are arising still thinking about what happened before

32
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,540
planning for the next thing it's okay it's all right

33
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:45,479
oh sweet dear heart let's put down let's put it all down and

34
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:51,600
just be here and give our heart fully to this just to

35
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,840
this right here this breath

36
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:05,040
this breath let it be felt received in its fullness like a

37
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,259
cherry blossom in the spring

38
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:15,740
fresh

39
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,860
full

40
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,080
impermanently grow glorious

41
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,978
this breath

42
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:02,759
and now as we continue to be embodied to feel the breath in the

43
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:07,860
body in the abdomen receiving the breath in breath the out

44
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:16,099
breath it's impermanent glorious breath

45
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,740
like a cherry blossom in the spring

46
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:29,280
let's turn let us open our hearts to appreciating

47
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:34,700
appreciating ourselves

48
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:43,500
we're doing our best doing our best

49
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:51,560
showing up and every moment is in this life as best as we're able to

50
00:08:51,779 --> 00:09:00,740
we appreciate that we are doing our best given all the causes and conditions

51
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,820
many most of them most of them out of our control

52
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:17,839
so a little Within our sphere of influence

53
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,200
doing our best Within that's fear

54
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:33,260
doing our best within the causes and conditions

55
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:46,860
then again be not trying to pick fights with ourselves or

56
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,300
judging ourselves self-judgment

57
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:01,560
staying that if things could have been different or could be different they would have been given everything that

58
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,420
came before so many

59
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,399
factors and forces

60
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,760
and resting with this not thinking about it but resting with it

61
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,440
letting ourselves breathe with it

62
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:48,120
now if you like if there is something that perhaps there is a little bit of an

63
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:57,600
ouch from something recent today yesterday this past week

64
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,660
not the biggest ouch not the biggest thing but something that's more manageable to practice with right

65
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,839
now

66
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:17,959
and acknowledging the ouch with kindness towards yourself

67
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:29,540
maybe it didn't turn out as well as hoped but you did your best

68
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:34,880
can you have kindness appreciation you tried

69
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:45,440
and letting go of thinking about it and just feeling into

70
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:54,019
kindness Goodwill for yourself for this ouch with this ouch

71
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:31,940
and appreciating your own goodness your own wholeheartedness

72
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:38,660
your values your efforts

73
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:49,320
and within this sphere of kindness acknowledging that

74
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,519
yeah didn't go

75
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:00,540
this was challenging it goes well as hoped or possible and it's okay

76
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:05,660
it's okay Elisha's like this it's okay

77
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:30,060
and we have stability equanimity equipoise

78
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:39,680
and whole things just as they are just as they've been with kindness

79
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,880
and if we could imagine impermanentness

80
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:26,720
as a friend as as an angel as of impermanence

81
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:34,380
ate a visit and said oh dear one things change

82
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:43,199
I'm the angel of impermanence things shift always it's just the way things are

83
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:50,779
you can put this down you can let go and forgive yourself

84
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:58,519
you can forgive the causes and conditions

85
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:11,839
perhaps learn there's something to be learned

86
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:19,678
without self-judgment there's need to make amends do that

87
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:26,660
maybe not maybe it's just acknowledging

88
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,799
care learning and letting go

89
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:52,220
releasing releasing releasing

90
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:04,340

knowledgeing with kindness compassion letting go

93
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:42,740
but the support of the angel of impermanence that permeates our lives our human lives

94
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:10,140
may be kind accepting loving towards this person who

95

expanding the circle

110
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:34,880
people we have interacted with directly and indirectly impacted

111
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,980
many circles have shame

112

116
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,899
existence and offering our goodness

117
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:21,740
the goodness of our practice the Merit

118
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:29,220
the wholesomeness of our practice to all beings everywhere May our practice be a cause and

119
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:35,700
condition or our own waking up freedom from sorrow suffering cultivation of

120
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:42,240
kindness compassion wisdom may we be free and may all beings

121

everywhere too be free

122
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:13,460
thanks everyone thank you so much for your practice

123
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:20,460
ah so we explore it we practiced with first

124
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:26,159
coming embodied with our body and breath being within higher brain but outbreak

125
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:33,020
connecting settling and then we open to

126
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:38,000
appreciating ourselves sense of appreciation

127
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:44,820
kindness Goodwill for ourselves for um having done our best and maybe

128
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:52,320
with something that that there might be a little bit of ouch with so when we when goodness when

129
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,659
kindness meets the outfit becomes compassion so practicing compassion for

130
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:02,820
maybe a tiny ouch that has happened recently and acknowledging that we've done our

131
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:09,360
best um letting there be forgiveness letting there be an appreciation of goodness and

132
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:16,740
then extending your kindness forgiveness not just to ourselves but to someone else maybe renter interacted with them

133
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:24,840
entangled with them and then spreading out to everyone and oh yes and there was the uh there

134
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:30,480
was an invitation to imagine impermanence as an angel angel of impermanence

135
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:37,380
Letting Go inviting us to let go well that was a new element tonight we explored we experimented with

136
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:45,240
letting go it's all impermanent we learn the lessons we make amends if needed and

137
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:51,480
then we don't we don't hold on we don't hang on we let go we open our hands our

138
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:58,200
fist so with that I'd like to invite us to to

145
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:40,559
someone asked last time if you notice somebody else's is offering advice or asking questions it's okay to say hey

146
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:46,799

impermanence if you lean into that what does it feel does it support you to to

152
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:22,980
lean into letting go to letting to letting be not attaching to see

recently pull back a little bit so you can also type in chat if there are any

164
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:39,480
Reflections aha moments questions comments what was this like for you love

165
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,200
to hear from you

166
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:52,320
Ali please hi Nikki thank you uh for the practice

167
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,540
I've always I mean I came to the practice because of the wisdom aspect of it you know those two wings of the bird

168
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:02,579
no I'm still heavy on that so that's why I came you know to the loving kindness

169
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:10,800
happy hour because I know that is the ultimate wisdom just to have that one and uh so having said that as a

170
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,960
background when you were talking about the throwing the impermanence and I said it's like a glad you know I said that

171
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:22,740
right something I can just you know chew on and just like just turn it around in the wine and stuff but I was able to see

172
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:28,320
that as it's like let that go you know I mean that's not why uh even I mean but I

173
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:34,020
was glad they threw that in there uh put that in there uh but how

174
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:39,599
still am and this will be okay this is okay too I mean loving the wisdom part I mean that's like

175
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:45,720
uh but uh yeah that's that's where I am and

176
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:52,740
that's what came up for me it was interesting that I saw all right she's talking about that uh that's it thank you yeah yeah yeah

177
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:59,400
thank you Ellie I appreciate what you brought in and and actually before you mute yourself years uh

178
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:05,460
um well you can unmute if you want um so so so what I heard you say was was given

179
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:10,980
that you're uh and many people you know lean into the wisdom aspect a lot more

180
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:16,740
but as you said yeah wisdom and compassion are the two wings of the birds if you have mostly wisdom and you

181
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:22,560
don't have compassion the bird is Not Gonna Fly it's going to go go around and around in circles so uh so the

182
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,960
compassion aspect the the practice of the heart are so important and wisdom

183
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:34,260
arises actually I have seen wisdom arise just doing the hard practices wisdom

184
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:39,420
arises and and ultimately at some point uh if you're just doing wisdom

185
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:45,060
compassion might arise at the very end when you see emptiness but anyway but the whole path could be pretty bumpy

186
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:52,140
without without kindness and we're just doing wisdom but uh and and I also heard you say when I brought in impermanence

187
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:58,079
like oh yes and yet and yet you know maybe the way I heard it was the sense

188
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:03,300
of wanting to think about it impermanence but it's actually not a

189
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:10,859
something to think about and you know that it's really something to relate to in our hearts it is part of the it's

190
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:16,440
it's a um you know to to relate to the wisdom of

191
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:25,140
impermanence in a hard-based way because usually we grieve impermanence that's the the the the twist I wanted to bring

192
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:32,940
in tonight we usually grieve impermanence like oh it's impermanent and I want it to stay it's not like but

193
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:39,000
I was kind of playing a little you know Aikido like shifting like oh here's the

194
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,579
angel of impermanence is telling us to let go it's okay to forgive it's okay to

195
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:50,820
be kind it's okay to let it put it down so that's how I was reframing it

196
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:56,520
um so just putting a little more explanation around that yeah

197
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:03,240
yeah thank you Ellie and anything else or does it feel complete give me an okay if he feels complete yeah it feels

198
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:10,578
complete great thank you yep yep and I saw Erica please

199
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:18,420
hi Nikki how are you I'm well thank you good so I have a question because I

200
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:27,780
personally have said this in in groups before impermanence is one of my North Stars I really appreciate knowing that

201
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:34,260
everything changes and I guess so the funky stuff it's gonna get better and the good stuff you don't grasp because

202
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:41,099
it's just gonna do the back and forth but when you start talking about the angel of impermanence and sort of put

203
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:47,040
this body to it I'm a little confused so can you can you talk about what that is

204
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:54,359
to you and what an angel of impermanence means yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah thank you thanks for that and I

205
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:59,579
appreciate also what you brought in about the way you've been practicing with it which is oh yeah it's it's

206
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:05,160
impermanence you know when when things are challenging It's Gonna Change it's like the saying about the weather in

207
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:11,640
London if you don't like the weather wait five minutes because it's Gonna Change um and if it's something good enjoy it

208
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:18,480
shaded but don't hang on to it because things are impermanent of course love it I really enjoy it it's not like oh don't

209
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,700
push it away so and then you're well curious or confused like what's this

210
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:31,560
embodiment that you're bringing as as an angel so so it's it's to bring um the idea the invitation is is to

211
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:37,680
bring some Grace to it because I love their attitude you have to uh impermanence Erica which already has a

212
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:43,980
sense of Grace but one I want to invite us to feel some Grace about empowerment it's not just about how I'm like oh yeah

213
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:49,140
impermanence one of the three marks of existence yeah these Buddhists talk about everything being impermanent yeah

214
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:54,780
whatever like no it's actually it's the grace of impermanence oh wow this is the

215
00:40:54,780 --> 00:41:01,200
way things are and it's there's a Grace to us that's what I'm inviting when I bring the word Angels kind of bringing

216
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,420
some Grace or to shift our relationship to impermanence that's what I'm trying

217
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:12,660
to do does that make sense yeah thank you I love the word Grace so that's that's lovely yeah great thank you

218
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:18,780
thanks for that question it helps me give a little more Nuance to to what I

219
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:24,599
was trying to invite us to to explore yeah thank you any other Reflections now

220
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:31,800
if you have spoken recently you are invited to speak since we've had a round Marianne

221
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:39,420
I just want to say to you uh you're so skillful of a facilitator and bringing

222
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:45,540
people to the front that I just have to help by by doing that it's I'm so admire

223
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:50,579
how you do it um and thank you

224
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:57,020
um for me the an angel is also a symbol of protection

225
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:02,760
and so that makes impermanence easier to

226
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:08,280
uh come to accept or confront or yeah

227
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:15,480
except maybe yeah those are one it was a wonderful pairing for me a beautiful

228

thank you Marion thank you so much for your kind kind words and and yay I love

229
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:29,700
this this pairing that you just shared in this Angel has a sense of protection as a sense of safety a sense goodness

230
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:35,160
it's and to bring that together and exploring it in that that dimensionality

231
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:40,800
that that door that can open in that way with with impermanence oh

232
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:46,079
that's deep that's very interesting yeah I'm gonna sit more with that thank

00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:31,579
change happening that there's a caring presence
