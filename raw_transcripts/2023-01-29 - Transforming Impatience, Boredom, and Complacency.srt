1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,960
so it's uh particularly wonderful for me to be back here

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,139
it's been a number of years since I've been at IMC teaching

3
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:20,820
um and it was very sweet you know because I um one of my good friends

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:31,140
um Peter Medina some of you might know him died last year and over 20 years ago he he was a monk

5
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,440
in Asia and he um gave IMC his clock his travel

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,140
clock you know and and so it's still here it's survived all the modernization

7
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,600
and improvements and it's still here so it's kind of sweet to see that

8
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,000
um uh so

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,239
um I'll start with um a metaphor that really helped me in

10
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:09,299
my early practice which was the metaphor of the snow globe you know when you shake a snow globe you

11
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:16,439
know all the snow just you know is all over you can barely see anything inside it but if you just let it settle it just

12
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:24,119
kind of very gently eventually it settles down and that image was very helpful for me

13
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:31,259
in my early meditation you know I'd sit down and my mind would be so chaotic there's so much happening but just

14
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:37,979
thinking the snow globe was like okay okay I just have to sit here and in time it will settle

15
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:43,079
and uh for what for quite a while that was like a really helpful

16
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:50,579
piece of my practice that patience of just okay it will settle but at a certain point

17
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:57,240
um I realized that I was thinking of those first 15 20 minutes that it took me to

18
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:03,659
settle as not really being part of my meditation and so I just kind of sat down and it was just like okay I'll

19
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:10,560
think about whatever I want an occasional breath and I start really taking it for granted and and just

20
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:18,000
assuming that that was just kind of you know this part of my mind wasn't even worth paying attention to it was so so

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,620
irrelevant and as he started learning more the subtleties of practice I began to really

22
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:34,319
understand that my thinking this thinking messy mind is what's here right now and that

23
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:41,280
that first 15-20 minutes of lots of messiness and chaotic thinking and busy

24
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:49,800
and Restless was really worthwhile to pay attention to that it was a very rich part of my

25
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,379
practice and I found that no matter how restless and agitated my mind was in

26
00:02:55,379 --> 00:03:00,780
that time that by becoming mindfully aware of it I could there would be a

27
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:09,599
little bit of space around it there was the agitation and there was that little bit of sweet space and you know and I

28
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:15,780
recognized that that agitation it was unpleasant you know and so I was trying

29
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:21,000
to avoid it I didn't want to feel that agitation as you know really not liking

30
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,060
the the how my mind felt at those times so I just started folding all of that

31
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:34,319
into my practice so that my practice is just as Rich whether my mind is busy or

32
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,099
my mind is still it's still just as close and intimate as

33
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:44,360
regardless of the state of the Mind

34
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:52,620
you know the practice teaches us to um to show up for any mind State whether we

35
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,159
like it or judge it as not interesting

36
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,219
foreign

37
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:12,360
I wanted to talk about three kind of related mental states that arise

38
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:19,139
commonly in meditation and um and because they're kind of they're

39
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:24,900
related because we tend to not find them all that compelling to pay attention to

40
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:32,580
and they're impatience boredom and complacency

41
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:39,120
and all of those are kind of these kind of subtle States like we tend to like to you know if you've got a strong emotion

42
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:46,020
in meditation that's really juicy that's really interesting um oh a fantasy oh yeah I've been you

43
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:52,259
know it's very strong very compelling but these states of um or even physical

44
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:59,520
pain we can get very interested in you know trying to fix it try and trying to you know there's a lot to grab on to a

45
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:06,960
lot to to engage with but boredom and patience complacency they're all mental

46
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:15,380
states that we tend to not like we don't like them but we don't hate them enough to pay attention to them

47
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:20,699
so um so they tend to kind of go under the rate radar

48
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:26,580
you know for instance did any of you um you know maybe not today maybe on

49
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:33,720
rare occasion are kind of waiting for the Bell to ring you know I've been very few people who

50
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:40,080
haven't had that experience at least once um when I was

51
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:47,220
um for for a long time in practice you know I used to keep a clock in front of me you know and

52
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,259
and I'd also have a uh a timer that would go off so I didn't

53
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:58,680
really need the clock the timer did its job but I would just open my sun Peak

54
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:06,300
you know and um you know if there was 15 minutes I'd like ah 50 more minutes you know and and

55
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:12,300
you know the idea the idea that there was 15 more minutes was unpleasant more

56
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:18,300
unpleasant than the moment itself the idea of 50 more minutes and you know

57
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:26,400
so I'd get really involved in my impatient thoughts I'd get very engaged like okay so 50 more minutes that's 150

58
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,800
breaths you know I I negotiate my way through it you know

59
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,560
totally involved you know much more interested interesting at the moment um

60
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,660
but then if it was like five minutes you know my whole heart would lift it's like

61
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:48,539
oh only five more minutes great and suddenly I'd settled my mind would

62
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:53,880
settle and would actually enjoy my meditation and I could go longer you

63
00:06:53,880 --> 00:07:00,120
know because the idea of all this long time period of of possible not not

64
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:06,660
enjoying it you know was I got in the way you know and um so these are the

65
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:14,100
games we play because we don't like that feeling of the impatient mind it's just a slight

66
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:19,560
unpleasantness right nothing so terrible nothing's that awful that time it's just

67
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:27,060
a slight low level unpleasantness but I find it really interesting

68
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:32,400
um that the English word for patience

69
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,699
comes from the Latin word Pati which means to suffer

70
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:45,979
and it means to suffer with you know the definition is a delay

71
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:51,919
difficulty and annoyance you know so it's the ability to to

72
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:59,460
suffer with to feel the pain of delay you know have you felt you know waiting

73
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:05,580
in traffic you know uh impatience arises right waiting in line and patience

74
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:11,639
arises you know that ability to be with that with patience

75
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:18,660
um you know with annoyance with with you know somebody who's just non-stop talking you know and you you know

76
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,819
they're knowing uh annoying us right and you know the ability to be patient with

77
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:29,240
that the ability to be with difficult things

78
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,940
um

79
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:42,300
when when we're feeling impatient what's really helpful is to realize that

80
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:48,959
there's something in our experience we're resisting we're actually resisting

81
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:55,260
there's actually a version when we're feeling that impatience I don't want something

82
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:01,140
and so the practice calls enough to turn towards it how do some patients feel in

83
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:06,600
the body you know maybe you feel you know maybe the body is tense maybe the body's

84
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:13,260
relaxed maybe part of the body is tense your shoulders are up the face different

85
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:19,080
parts how's the belly when we're feeling impatience um

86
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,180
or how does the mind what is impatient the flavor of the mind I don't know do

87
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:30,120
you know what I mean by the flavor you know like how do we know the difference between this is anger and

88
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,300
this is fear you know this is love you know it's a flavor of the mind and so what is the

89
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:43,860
flavor of the impatient mind how does that actually feel you know so we turn our attention to the actual felt

90
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:50,480
experience of the moment the actual felt experience of impatience

91
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,800
with patience you know we're practicing patience you know patience is uh

92
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,420
considered one of the most really important qualities to develop

93
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,580
and practice um you know in uh in the Buddhist

94
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:18,899
teachings you know many of you are familiar with the 10 part of me um the 10 Perfections the qualities that

95
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:24,080
we have to develop to wake up you know such as virtue patience loving kindness

96
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:29,640
you know energy uh wisdom you know all these wonderful qualities that we

97
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:35,880
develop uh but patience is a particularly uh interesting one because

98
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:41,600
um I think Gill is the one who told me this he he actually you know once we got

99
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,640
digitized digitized versions of the sutas he counted how many times the word

100
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,920
patients appeared in the majakaya compared to the other parmes I guess he

101
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,620
had a lot of time in his hands but um that they but um you know so it's

102
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:05,519
like it's that that commonly the Buddha you know said how essential patience is

103
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,880
to wake up now patience is only needed when there's

104
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:18,300
something happening that we don't want you know when there's nothing if we're

105
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:24,320
not resisting anything patience is no longer needed it no longer takes effort

106
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,640
and so there's always something going on that we don't want to see we don't want

107
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:34,880
to know we don't want it to be there we're pushing something away

108
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:42,120
um you know one kind of patience is patient perseverance

109
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:48,959
and that's for instance we can persevere and let's say we're

110
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:56,399
training for a marathon I don't know if you've ever trained for something that that you're really trying to get really good at you know and and so every day

111
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:03,060
you go out there regardless of how you feel regardless of how you feel and you can do that with the attitude of

112
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:08,760
gritting your teeth you know I'm gonna go out there and I'm gonna do this and and you can do it

113
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:14,820
or you can do that with a relaxed attitude you know oh um you know I'll show up every day but you can be very

114
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:20,700
relaxed they both get to the goal you know but the difference is is an

115
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:27,959
attitude with kindness you know and uh how happy we are you know how how at ease we are

116
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:34,860
and uh with almost anything we do bringing in kindness the quality of

117
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:40,800
kindness is what makes uh patience really possible the real patience

118
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:47,839
persevering patience it has to be with the softness with the kindness

119
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:59,100
you know and sometimes meditation is difficult it is unpleasant

120
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:06,180
you know and we can appreciate that this is hard sometimes sometimes it is hard

121
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:12,600
and and uh when things are painful and hard uh kindness is appropriate you know

122
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,360
it's it's like we uh bring that into our our space you know oh yeah this is I'm

123
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,519
suffering here this is hard you know my body's uncomfortable I'm in pain I just

124
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:31,320
I don't like doing this I don't you know at this moment this this moment I don't like you know oh yeah I'm suffering here

125
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,680
I can bring kindness and compassion to that moment

126
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:56,700
it's a couple of things you know sometimes when we're feeling that way it's hard to put our arms around it we

127
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:03,000
may have kind of an intellectual understanding of it so you can help to just remember that the first part of

128
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,279
working with this impatient stay is to recognize it

129
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:15,300
just recognize that it's there that already gives us a little bit of objectivity oh it's just impatience it's

130
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:22,019
only impatience it's just something that comes and goes you know and then we turn to our bodies you know this is

131
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:31,279
impatience in the body and we start getting interested in what is it really like what is it like to be impatient

132
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:38,959
sometimes focusing on a bigger picture can be really helpful sometimes that directness

133
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:45,959
doesn't quite work for us and for instance we can be stuck in in gridlock for

134
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:52,079
instance and we can instead of being all caught up in oh my how much longer and

135
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:58,920
it's going to take forever and all those kind of thoughts you know oh what a great opportunity to practice you know

136
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:05,519
we sometimes go I only have half an hour here I'm going to sneak it in now this is a great time to practice

137
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:11,040
um you know or if if you feel tight you know you can bring loving kindness into

138
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,680
into your space I know uh people uh some people who make it a habit whenever

139
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:23,100
they're stuck even at a red light they just like and look around and do loving kindness towards the people they see in

140
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:28,380
the other cars you know it's this very sweet thing to do it makes it a kind of

141
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:34,100
a joyous a choice thing to to happen

142
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:42,180
um you know or you can just settle into just meditating just watching the breath

143
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:47,579
open eye you know just just just want to make sure I say that

144
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:54,120
I gave um uh walking instructions once you know and um and at the end of The Walking

145
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:00,180
instructions they send people out to go for their walk and one of the young men said um

146
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:07,279
do we do this with our eyes closed it didn't never occur to me

147
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:14,639
um you know um and one of the things said to me is always a go-to and I'm suffering is

148
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,579
humor um like Chad cornfield used to say I'll be the first meditator to die of

149
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:26,399
impatience yeah and um I would just think of that you know and it would just kind of you

150
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,980
know break break a little bit of my serious seriousness out

151
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:39,899
um there's a cartoon you know it's in the New Yorker a long time ago and

152
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:46,440
um you know you see this group of meditators and um you know the teachers sitting in a Podium just like this and you know

153
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:52,800
there's like a poster you know it says journey to Enlightenment you know and then they have a little thought bubble

154
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:59,779
one of the mid I mean voice bubble one of The meditators Whispers to another one are we there yet

155
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,519
so a little bit of humor

156
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:21,120
so a kind of close relative of impatience is boredom

157
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,760
um boredom if you haven't noticed it's a state none of us like

158
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:32,700
we don't like to be bored and if we look at boredom a little bit more closely we

159
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,980
see that often what's happening is that the mind has very little stimulation

160
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:43,080
going on you know if we're in pain we're not bored we may not like it but we're

161
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:51,539
definitely not bored but in boredom there's just very low stimulation now in daily life in Norm in

162
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:58,620
regular life usually when we're bored we either go to sleep or we go do something different you know

163
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:05,039
we stimulate ourselves and as we get calm the Mind begins to

164
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:11,360
get calm it stops stimulating itself so much with all this thinking all that's going on

165
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:19,200
and we initially that calmness it's a little bit unfamiliar it's it's

166
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,799
not what we're used to during the day and it can feel really boring you know

167
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:31,679
is this it I mean you know I've been meditating and it's this sin it just says yeah a little bit of calm but hey

168
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:38,160
you know this isn't Fun you know and so um you know so there's a little bit of

169
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:44,220
something unpleasant not enough something going on in that state

170
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:50,760
and again we can turn our attention right to the boredom we can get

171
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,980
interested in the boredom what is boredom really like what is it really

172
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:03,600
like you know what is it like in what's the flavor of the mind that we don't like what is that flavor you know I really

173
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:10,140
notice how what that feels like what does it feel like in the body sometimes it's actually there's actually other

174
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:16,980
things going on underneath but it's not thinking about it and figuring it out it's like really seeing what is this

175
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:23,900
moment really like what am I resisting what don't I like what am I pushing away

176
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:31,640
um I read somewhere I don't know where they get these statistics but um 31 of Americans

177
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,960
wonder if heaven will be boring

178
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:42,000
um now what's interesting about it is that

179
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,880
um you know when we think of heaven we think of everything being good and everybody being nice

180
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:53,340
you know and you know it says something that we think that everybody being good

181
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:58,380
and everybody being nice is boring you know so we look all we have to do is

182
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:05,940
look at her entertainment and you know we're um what sells the most are horror movies

183
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:12,960
uh war movies violent uh Thrillers all this uh things that aren't good and nice

184
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,980
you know um and so even a lot of humor is about you

185
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:27,120
know you think about um uh slapstick you know people are falling you know uh a lot of humors put

186
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,580
down humor laughing at pain or laughing at other people's pain you know it's um

187
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:38,820
so there's something about all those things are very stimulating to the mind and the mind really likes being

188
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:46,340
stimulated and uh boy with no devices really stimulate us

189
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:51,780
we prefer a lot of us prefer Doom scrolling

190
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:59,520
looking at bad news after bad news after bad news for long periods of times over

191
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:06,419
being bored over that terrible horrible feeling of being bored let me look at how horrible

192
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:13,320
the disasters in the world are there's so much more stimulating than being bored so it's really interesting you

193
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,480
know to look at this at these aspects of mind

194
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:27,539
so we're used to um you know either stimulating ourselves externally

195
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:33,299
you know by the we can do it um as I mentioned you know in unskillful

196
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:39,679
ways watching things that are actually dark in our minds or we can

197
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:46,620
stimulate ourselves externally with wholesome things you know watching a movie that that has a lot of depth

198
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:51,659
reading a biography that connects us with people listening to wonderful music

199
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:56,940
having meeting with friends there's lots of wonderful stimuli out in the world

200
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:02,280
going out into nature going hiking there's a lot of wholesome things it's

201
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:07,440
not I'm not pointing at being wrong to stimulate the mind you know that's how

202
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,480
we learn that's how we grow you know it's really great for the cognitive mind

203
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,120
to stimulate it in ways that are productive um but we also stimulate the Mind

204
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:23,159
internally and how do we do that you know we can

205
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:32,280
stimulate the Mind internally with planning you know which can be really useful or it can be compulsively uh done

206
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:37,799
in a minute during meditation in particular sometimes especially in Retreat I find

207
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:44,220
myself like planning when I was going to say to the teacher when I met with them over and over and over again and just

208
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:50,520
kind of rehearsing you know this is what I'm going to say to them and and um you know and totally missing out on

209
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:55,799
my process just planning planning planning um

210
00:22:55,799 --> 00:23:04,260
so so we do stimulate ourselves internally um and because we like stimulus

211
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,320
um

212
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:15,960
sometimes just to avoid feeling boredom we'd rather we'll stimulate ourselves

213
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,539
with really uh thoughts that upset us even more because we'd rather have

214
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:27,440
upsetting thoughts than um then be bored

215
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:46,880
one of the things that happens you know with um giving something attention when we

216
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,559
become attentive of the Mind energy arises

217
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:57,659
when energy arises kind of Interest follows

218
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:04,140
um and so we um by turning our attention to boredom

219
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:13,140
that we bring energy to it and we bring interest and or the quality of or beingness kind

220
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:19,559
of increases in its uh um in its energy and its aliveness we

221
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:24,900
start getting connected with ourselves just by giving attention just an open

222
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:31,400
attention to what's really going on in the moment um

223
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:37,400
knowing boredom just knowing it really being close to it

224
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,539
transforms it into something interesting

225
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:49,559
and um you know when I say just one word about intimacy you know if you think about an

226
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:55,740
intimate moment you know maybe you know a young child or a lover you know where

227
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:04,020
you're maybe touching their face very gently you're very close to them you're very close to you know you you're right

228
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:10,140
there you're very soft there's there's no distance between the two of you and

229
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:16,200
this is the intimacy that we develop in meditation it's a little bit of a love

230
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:22,020
affair with with with the moment you know just being very close very close to

231
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:28,919
that breath very intimate very very open to it you know and if you touch if if

232
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:35,039
the if what you're touching is a child that starts to cry because they're sad that you don't lose that intimacy

233
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:41,340
because they're sad you don't lose their intimacy because they're laughing you know the intimacy

234
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:47,400
is there because of your willingness to be close your willingness to be connected that way

235
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:54,900
and in the same way you know we can be intimate with our experience being very close to it whether it's laughter

236
00:25:54,900 --> 00:26:01,799
whether it's a wonderful sense of peace permeating or whether it's a really

237
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:09,200
agitated mind just like the agitated child we can stay intimate

238
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:20,120
you know in the um 60s

239
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:25,679
Aldous Huxley wrote a novel I don't know if anybody ever read read it called Island

240
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:31,620
you know it was like a utopian novel you know I I don't remember hardly any of it

241
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:37,220
you know I was pretty young and but I remember it had birds that flew around

242
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:43,140
and you know they they'd go near humans and go pay attention pay attention

243
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:49,679
and it's one of the things that that periodically shows up in my meditation

244
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,200
when I'm distracted you know it's uh

245
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:04,200
um so um you know many of you um are familiar with mbsr mindfulness-based stress

246
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:10,080
reduction it's um secular mindfulness meditation program

247
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:16,260
that junk about Sin created in the when did he do that in

248
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:21,960
the early 80s you know for the medical community to

249
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:28,620
make mindfulness available to people who were having you know major surgeries

250
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:36,419
cancer diagnoses terminal terminal illnesses you know and so it needed to

251
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:43,320
be you know very very secular very specific and they would they do it in like

252
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:48,539
sessions of eight eight weekly trainings

253
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:53,779
and it encompassed you know sitting meditation similar to what we do here

254
00:27:53,779 --> 00:28:00,000
but it also included a guided body scan that's done lying

255
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,860
down where it guides you through relaxing each part of your body connecting with each part of your body

256
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:13,620
and it lasts about 45 minutes it's a long long guided scan

257
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:19,260
and um at the time that it was just beginning to take off and gains a little

258
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:26,760
bit of renown in the medical world the teacher said IMS which is a retreat

259
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:32,580
center in Massachusetts they thought well you know while we're you know we should know about this so

260
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:39,480
why don't we do the training and so we know how it is and so we know what people are doing you know and so several

261
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:46,440
of the teachers went to this class where they were the only people who didn't have either a thermal illness or

262
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:53,340
something severe really going on in their lives and you know they they did the sitting

263
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:59,460
meditation everything you know and then they went to do the guided the guided body scan and everybody in the room laid

264
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:05,179
down and did this and um every one of the teachers fell asleep

265
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:11,460
uh none of the students none of the other students and

266
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:17,400
um you know and one of the teachers was for you know after that she was reflecting back about it and she

267
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:23,760
realized that what had happened in in her practice or you know after all the years of like lots of Duke and lots of

268
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:30,480
suffering her practices gotten to a point and her life where everything was pretty good everything was was pretty

269
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,940
good she'd sit and meditate was pretty Pleasant it was kind of nice and she'd

270
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:41,039
become really complacent and um and it's it's such a tricky

271
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:47,940
seductive little thing you know to just oh yeah it's good enough it's good enough you know not that you know we

272
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:54,480
don't want to mistake it with the mind that says that's never good enough you know but but there's this quality of it

273
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,580
of of where we stop um uh we stop really paying attention to

274
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:08,659
what's going on and um a definition of complacency is

275
00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:16,380
self-satisfaction especially when accompanied by unawareness of actual dangers or

276
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:22,020
deficiencies so what does that mean in meditation

277
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:27,620
and it's not seeing the dangers of

278
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:34,080
reinforcing certain habits of mind which gets strengthened when we become complacent

279
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:39,740
we just strengthen the part of our minds that don't pay attention

280
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:46,140
um the teachings guide us to allow our

281
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:53,640
experience to accept or experience not to strive not to push not to have to

282
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:59,700
really be at ease with or experience but again that comes back to the issue of

283
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:05,279
intimacy when we allow we accept we allow and

284
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:11,880
accept something by being close to it by being intimate with it you know we

285
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:19,200
allow it accept that my my body hurts right now oh yeah my body's hurting you

286
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,740
know we're close I feel it I'm not pushing it away I'm right there with it

287
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:31,980
allowing it I see the reality of it complacency says oh yeah it's hurting I

288
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:37,440
don't have to pay I'm not going to pay attention to it I'm not going to be near it you know it's a distancing ourselves

289
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,580
from our experience

290
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:50,820
um you know the practice points to a balance between tranquility and

291
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:59,100
alertness we're trying to you know we kind of go to a meeting of those two where the mind is really at peace but

292
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:06,179
really bright and alert really curious and the words that I like that that have

293
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:11,700
been like a guiding guiding words for me in my practice is so much and tomato he

294
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:17,100
calls that affectionate curiosity it's it's the quality that we want to

295
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:22,260
bring into those moments that's what's missing in the complacency complacency

296
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:28,080
doesn't have either the affection or the Curiosity it's just kind of nice or good

297
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,840
enough um like those first 15-20 minutes of my

298
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,720
sitting oh yeah that's good enough you know good enough

299
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,120
um

300
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:52,080
you know when um some people when they first start meditating you know they take to it right away and they like it right away

301
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:58,559
and and they have nice pleasant sits right away that wasn't me you know for

302
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:04,620
me meditation was really hard earned you know the fact that I persevered was I

303
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:10,620
just had a such a strong intuition in you know in me I had a certain level of

304
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:16,799
trust that that this was the way for me even though mostly my first

305
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:23,539
quite a fairly long period of time was not very pleasant for me

306
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:28,799
and so when I finally finally started experiencing like this really nice

307
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:34,440
periods of calm you know and they'd go into this nice drifty peaceful calm

308
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:40,080
they're so nice it was so nice and there was so little sharpness or alertness but

309
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:48,899
it was such a pleasant change from from my agitated state that I I hung in there

310
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:55,919
for a long time and you know and it was very healing you know it was very healing for me to

311
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:01,200
do that and um and it allowed me just be feel enjoy

312
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,080
being with myself you know but as my practice grew then I saw that uh there

313
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:14,460
was more there was more and more engagement you know I don't want to make that wrong you know but then I would

314
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:20,099
find my patterns you know like I would be um like especially in Retreat you know if

315
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:26,520
any of you have done Retreat we have a lot of ups and downs on Retreats sometimes we have uh you know a lot of

316
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:31,679
stuff can come up and sometimes really painful emotions would come up or really

317
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:38,280
intense physical Sensations would come up that weren't Pleasant you know and and you know maybe I'd spend

318
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,919
um you know like spend a couple of uh sittings just crying or or just feeling

319
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:50,339
all sorts of painful feelings and then it would be over and it'd be like ah

320
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:56,878
and then I'd reward myself with a fantasy you know it's like okay that was good enough I worked hard fantasy time

321
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:03,900
you know and uh you know and I kind of had that pattern for a while where I'd get really complacent instead of like

322
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:10,800
really okay now let's stay really engaged with what's next um so it took a while for me to see that

323
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:17,599
to notice that um

324
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:25,320
you know and as I mentioned I really want to stress that that as we meet complacency when it arises to really

325
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:32,040
notice a difference between that and not good enough you know it's um you know like the the

326
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:37,440
Taipei personality or the workaholic personality you know they'd get a lot

327
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:43,320
done you know they accomplish a lot uh but it's very tight very tight you know

328
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:49,619
and so um really you want to caution that attitude in in how we work with our

329
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:56,520
minds um we're more aiming for the quality of a musician really enjoying playing the

330
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:02,460
music but really be really listening to carefully not doing it automatically

331
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:08,820
really you know maybe they fight that song a hundred times but they still find something new in it

332
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:13,859
or maybe the the runner you know really engaged in the running and they might

333
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:19,440
notice oh yeah my shoulders are a little tense let me relax them a little bit

334
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:26,339
or maybe the artist who's you know painting you know and and um you know they they notice oh the

335
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:33,720
sunset could use a little more red over here you make adjustments but the adjustments are just part of the play part of the

336
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:41,220
play part of the engagement it's not that there's something wrong that we have to fix it's just an

337
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:46,560
adjustment always see that okay that's what we do there's no fixing needed we

338
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:51,599
don't need to fix complacency we don't need to fix some patience we just need

339
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:58,200
to get to know them and once we get to know them as we engage in them they reveal themselves

340
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,160
they transform

341
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:17,579
one of them real benefits of turning towards the challenging towards the

342
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:23,820
difficult in this practice this practice says if it's hard you turn towards it

343
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:31,440
you turn towards it we turn towards the wonderful we turn towards the difficult with the equal interest we can bring the

344
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,660
equal interest to it and by doing so by developing patients

345
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:43,079
we increase our capacity to be with a difficult I like to say we become comfortable

346
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:49,140
being uncomfortable we we can you know tolerate

347
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:57,359
be there for things that are very hard to tolerate and be there for and it and that capacity works both ways

348
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:03,680
it increases her ability to feel Joy to feel all the really wholesome happy

349
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:11,700
enjoyable things in life it allows that connection to so we increase that that practice of of

350
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:17,300
really being here fully full-heartedly into the moment

351
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:28,079
you know and I'll say the last thing I'll say you know sometimes the magic word for me in my mind is to relax just

352
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,480
relax let go and at other times the magic word for me

353
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:40,079
is like a very strong here now you know just here now show up you know and so

354
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:45,540
different times we we need like different little um this is my level of my pep talks to

355
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:51,000
myself usually these little singular little little words I shortcut them you

356
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:57,060
know that um you know I might sit up straight or pay attention you know little birds you

357
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:02,940
know pay attention you know um so you know keep folding in

358
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:10,980
everything that happens in the practice belongs it all belongs you know the the deeper states of mind

359
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:17,579
you know when you um we develop samadhi the the in meditation where the mind's really

360
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:23,359
steady we call it a unification of the Mind where the mind is United

361
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:28,920
and it includes everything and that's the thing about this practice

362
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:34,859
it does not exclude any part of who we are any part of our experience it all

363
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:40,440
fits in there it all belongs um

364
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,740
so I'd like to end with a poem by

365
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:51,660
Rosemary watola traumer I don't know if you know her work

366
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,720
um

367
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:04,200
so in in May I planted a whole row of beans

368
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:11,520
along the back fins of the garden pushed each of the small white seeds one

369
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:21,000
inch into the spring damp soil I waited weeks not one came up not one

370
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,220
I planted them again planted them in twos two inches apart

371
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:33,660
I waited weeks three came up there were over a hundred seeds

372
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:39,180
I'm trying to tell you that sometimes that we wish for doesn't happen

373
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:45,420
though we do everything by the rules that we have known success before

374
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:51,119
that we long for our plans to take for our plans to take root

375
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:57,260
to bloom to fruit then all through the rows

376
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:05,700
emerged this spring emerged this spring dozens of volunteer Cosmos

377
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:12,839
this morning a generous Riot of pink dark pink and white fluttering in the

378
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:18,680
spaces where I envisioned only the green of beans

379
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:23,180
so thank you
