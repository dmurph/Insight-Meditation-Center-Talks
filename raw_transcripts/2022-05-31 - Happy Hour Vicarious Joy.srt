1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,319
so hello hello and welcome everyone to

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:15,360
uh to happy hour so so for today's practice um

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:22,720
i thought it might be nice to turn our attention to the third brahma vihara the

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,160
third of the hard practices of the heavenly abodes

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,440
which um we sometimes practice but not as often as

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,760
meta so the first one being metta second one being meta translated as loving kindness

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,239
second one being karuna compassion the third one being joy vicarious joy

8
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:53,440
joy for ourselves and for others and the fourth one being equanimity so

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,600
so let's turn our hearts towards joy

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,799
and the word in pali is mudita mudita and

11
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,720
it's really the expression of loving-kindness kindness that

12
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:17,439
comes across gladness in the world whether it's somebody else's good fortune or whether

13
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,759
it's our own good fortune and there's always good fortune even if

14
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:30,240
somebody's having a hard time having difficulty suffering there's some other areas of their life where there is

15
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,680
goodness there's good fortune or blessings similarly for ours because we

16
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,439
usually just turn our attention to what is difficult

17
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:48,320
we get to see we tend to see what is difficult what's challenging and

18
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,079
lose sight of what is good what is beautiful what is

19
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,960
magnificent actually that so many things are going right and yes maybe a few things are not

20
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,360
going right with us with others with the world so turning turning attention and

21
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:14,800
intentionally looking at relishing what is good

22
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,599
about others fortune our fortune so that the heart can rest in joy and

23
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:28,400
again not as a way to to turn into la la land but as a way

24
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,599
to empower nourish the heart

25
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:40,080
the states of joy are really important on the path to liberation the states of

26
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:47,360
joy and contentment and bliss are very important this practice this buddhist practice

27
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:54,640
mindfulness insight to the pasana different ways to translate it it's not about hard work and engagement

28
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,159
yet there is plenty of engaging being noticing with with

29
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:06,239
awareness what is happening internally externally but the heart needs a lot of

30
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,959
joy bliss contentment to

31
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,640
be settled on the path in fact there are many steps uh practical the steps in the

32
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:26,080
step-by-step instructions and what the buddha taught towards the path of liberation that end in nibbana in

33
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,599
awakening but they go through bliss and joy actually

34
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:37,200
gladness joy and bliss and concentration so those steps

35
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,000
are one after another anyway so so the practice of joy

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,040
modita gladdening our heart is not escapism

37
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:56,640
but it's a way of enriching enriching our capacity to hold more we can become

38
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,879
more available for ourselves and for others [Music]

39
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:10,480
to relish the beauty the the mystery the mystery that this life

40
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:17,359
is this world is so so without further ado let's practice

41
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:23,520
together as i've set the frame so so

42
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,919
arriving landing in your body

43
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,320
landing in this moment notice what the body needs if the body

44
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:54,880
needs to maybe shift or move or lie down or stand up it's all okay

45
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,080
turning the intention

46
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,210
towards the body first and foremost the body

47
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:26,400
[Music] the feed the legs the sit bones connected to the

48
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,400
earth

49
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,600
inviting awareness to rest

50
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,809
to lower to lower the center of gravity [Music]

51
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:14,639
of our awareness from our head with habitual thinking move it down down down from our chest

52
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,160
to our abdomen belly lower abdomen somewhere between the

53
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,440
belly and the sit bones receiving the breath there very low in

54
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,600
the abdomen

55
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:02,479
ah let the breath be received in breath the out breath released the whole body

56
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,479
releasing

57
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,440
and as thoughts arise can we release thoughts that there's anything wrong with

58
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:07,120
thinking but the benefit of

59
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,759
this cultivation this moment of taking refuge

60
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,479
can we release

61
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,519
letting awareness be intertwined

62
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:48,240
with the breath appreciating the gift of the breath

63
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,399
it is a goodness not to be taken for granted

64
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,920
to tune into enjoying appreciating

65
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:23,519
being calmly perhaps contentedly collected in the

66
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,519
breath

67
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:57,079
same way often pets collect themselves cozily in their bed

68
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,880
wrapped in a ball comfy cozy

69
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:13,800
can the breath be that bad for us cozily

70
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,399
collecting ourselves in it

71
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:26,680
with ease relaxing the body resting resting

72
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:36,880
and now like to invite us as we continue to stay embodied

73
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,040
relaxing receiving the breath

74
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:50,880
collecting ourselves enjoying the gift of the breath

75
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,240

76
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:11,000

77
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:22,760
we want the best for them ideally someone with whom we have an uncomplicated relationship

78
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,839
bringing this person this being to mind could be a pet

79
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,160
it could be a human a child

80
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,680
conjuring them up as well as possible in this moment

81
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,560

157
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,720

it has been um i actually went on a one-week spring inside meditation retreat at um

219
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:07,520
spit rock for one week from 14th through 21st with my um long time meditation teacher

220
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:14,160
matthew bren silver so i when i was there i actually experienced

221
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:21,520
the most wonderful relaxation and calming

222
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:27,280
joyous moment and i was able to kind of reach it and i

223
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,400
would be able to brought it out and matthew and i had a discussion

224
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,920
don't be surprised if you maybe go back in some way in other way and i just sent

225
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,960
him an email over the week i've been able to maintain it and

226
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:49,040
they're and i wonder if because because i've been practicing with the spirit rock and then now i

227
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:57,680
started with the gills morning climates yeah and then sunday and then this this uh loving kindness

228
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:04,240
and also spear rocks as well as uh i'm a jew a lot of continuity so yeah and yeah

229
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:09,520
yeah and then also i've been also practicing with the mic synagogue group which is

230
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:15,599
meditations the combination and everything is literally still making me

231
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:23,680
in state of a calmness and relaxation right as i left

232
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,359
that was 21st and despite all the bad news that was happening

233
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:35,359
i was able to send loving-kindness to myself and others

234
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:42,560
and the persons the people that i know who are losing their jobs yeah yeah so so that becomes compassion

235
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:48,960
yeah so so so what i'm hearing is that this is lovely bernadette you have a lot of continuity you decide to retreat

236
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:55,200
beautiful and and now you're having a lot of continuity and really supporting yourself with these different conditions

237
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:00,240
so there's a sense of continuity beautiful fantastic lovely and don't get

238
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:05,359
attached because when conditions change state of mind changes too and not you

239
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:12,400
know i'm not saying this to to to burst your bubble but you know this it's it's enjoy it's made up of conditions which

240
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,680
is great so so you get to enjoy it while elastic yes and know that yeah there

241
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:24,079
might be some challenges but can i also have equanimity and ease and joy in the midst of challenges because you know

242
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:30,400
you're coming from retreat but there might be other people today joining from a really hard day and they're tired and

243
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,680
yet there's a sense of oh this is nourishing this is refreshing this is

244
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:42,160
gosh i can dip into this even though i haven't just sat a retreat and there haven't been sitting all so so

245
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:49,520
