1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:15,139
so hello everyone and welcome to this period of meditation

2
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,020
and one of the ways that meditation can

3
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:28,140
unfold develop over time is through appreciating

4
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:35,719
some of the beneficial States beneficial ways of being that come with meditation

5
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:41,820
and sometimes in doing this appreciation

6
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,940
it's uh maybe keep the bar low

7
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:53,940
keep it um uh maybe in micro moments

8
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:00,660
of beneficial States because as we appreciate these

9
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:07,560
beneficial States that validates them it makes room for them it

10
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,860
supports them to grow more and they can last more than just a micro moment maybe

11
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:20,600
they last three or four or even who knows maybe even a second or two

12
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,860
so um the idea of appreciating something

13
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:32,520
and one of the things to appreciate is the moments the mind is not

14
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,640
preoccupied and I think meditators sooner or later

15
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,759
will begin being sensitive aware of how much thinking goes on in the mind

16
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:51,479
and how much uh our attention is pulled into that world sometimes people are Swept Away in their

17
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:57,540
thoughts and um and or they have something they're really churning on or ruminating

18
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,880
about and uh you know it just seems like the most natural thing in the world to be

19
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,899
thinking about it even uh in for about the present moment there's a continual commentary about it

20
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:17,340
it just seems like the most natural thing but it's a kind of preoccupation of the Mind the mind is occupied

21
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,440
with thoughts and some people because they identify

22
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:29,340
with their thinking uh well I have this idea there's nothing wrong with the thinking this is who I am and I should

23
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,700
be free to think whatever I want to think it's important and certainly those are you know it's a

24
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:41,160
fine attitude to have in and of itself but it doesn't really support the

25
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,220
deepening of meditation the deeper beneficial ways that meditation can

26
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:55,080
improve our lives benefit us free us and um and uh it seems so it's important

27
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:01,019
to begin being sensitive to the difference between being preoccupied

28
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:08,940
and the mind being I don't know if unoccupied is the right word but the mind being ready

29
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:14,879
receptive that it's getting to be malleable and

30
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:22,980
soft that it's here and this transition in a period of meditation from being preoccupied to

31
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:29,819
being here now I'm present and kind of being present that doesn't

32
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:36,300
require thoughts to tell us that there's a knowing I'm here

33
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,940
that's there before we have a thought oh I'm here

34
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:49,940
and so to appreciate having arrived

35
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:56,280
appreciate an awareness that's here for a micro moment

36
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,720
without being preoccupied available

37
00:04:04,099 --> 00:04:10,980
to be aware available to sense to feel to be present for

38
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,239
what is actually here

39
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:23,639
now in this moment sometimes this is called arriving

40
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:29,220
we finally arrive in the present moment

41
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,660
with our attention

42
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:41,000
rather than attention being swept up in or directed to or he

43
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:48,479
utilized by all kinds of concerns preoccupations

44
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,500
in on an unoccupied mind

45
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:05,759
isn't it's not a blank mind or a lazy mind it's like a glass

46
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:12,780
a window which has finally been cleaned

47
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,460
and now we can see

48
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:26,000
in the preoccupations interfere with that seeing

49
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:32,539
so assuming a meditation posture

50
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,360
and if your eyes are still open maybe lowering your gaze

51
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:55,880
and then gently closing your eyes

52
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:26,160
and gently paying careful attention to the body and

53
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:34,520
what's happening in your body take a few long slow deep breaths

54
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:55,880
maybe the Deep inhale is kind of like saying hello body

55
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,639
connecting being present

56
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:19,199
and then letting the breathing return to normal and continue for a few more while

57
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:26,060
you breathe in and breathing out feel your whole body

58
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:30,259
the whole breath body

59
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,758
relaxing as you exhale

60
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,300
noticing

61
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,720
that while you're being present for the body breathing

62
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:12,360
is it also a pull into the world of thoughts ideas preoccupations

63
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,539
and what's it like to have both

64
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:27,800
an intention to be with your body breathing

65
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:35,459
and a mind wants to be with concerns

66
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,300
underneath the mind's concerns preoccupations

67
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:03,320
is there mental tension pressure to think

68
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,500
and if there is as you exhale

69
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,240
relaxing the mind

70
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,660
letting the Mind spread out wide

71
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,920
and still

72
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:24,560
taking a few moments to acknowledge any thoughts and concerns you have

73
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:35,360
and by acknowledging them maybe they can be put aside for now

74
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:43,639
so you can settle more into your meditation

75
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:53,519
more into him and embodied connection

76
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,079
to the present moment

77
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:07,399
and even face the smallest degree of being present for Here and Now

78
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:14,779
see if you can appreciate the attention you have

79
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:29,180
appreciate the micro moments of unpreoccupied attention

80
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:37,399
to being here and you're breathing your body in your experience

81
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:15,960
if you give your awareness intention attention over to breathing your body

82
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:22,280
it's almost like giving it life animating it

83
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:29,760
instead of animating energizing the thinking the

84
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,600
preoccupation

85
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:54,600
to be unpreoccupied is a matter of degrees it's not all or

86
00:21:54,600 --> 00:22:00,120
nothing appreciate the degree to which your mind

87
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:07,039
is less preoccupied more here

88
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,519
in your experience

89
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:00,559
as we come to the end of the sitting

90
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:08,059
to turn our attention now out to the world

91
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:16,200
there's a difference between being available for others

92
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:22,620
with our Attention our hearts our care to be available

93
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:29,059
versus advancing on people

94
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:38,840
asserting ourselves being available rather than asserting

95
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,179
being available is to be unpreoccupied

96
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:52,140
to be unbiased

97
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:58,820
not to meet with judgments and preconceived ideas

98
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:05,700
and what we learn in meditation about being unpreoccupied

99
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,639
but available receptive

100
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:19,559
is invaluable for how to be with others

101
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:27,960
to be available not in some passive withdrawn way

102
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:34,380
but available to respond kindly generously

103
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:39,960
lovingly delightfully

104
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:47,419
respectfully to be available

105
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:59,539
to wish people well rather than caught up in our reactions

106
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:05,240
we are coming from our good will

107
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:21,179
on this day May the people that I encounter

108
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:29,059
or know about may they be well may they be happy

109
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:36,240
on this day the people who I will be encountering or

110
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:43,399
knowing about may they be safe

111
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:50,580
on this day the people that I'll have contact with

112
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:57,740
or know about may they be peaceful

113
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:06,179
on this day May the people who

114
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:14,120
I think about or meet may they be free

115
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:18,559
and on this day

116
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:27,720
may I be available to have this good will

117
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:36,200
wishing for the people that I become aware of

118
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:43,559
May everyone we have encountered or think about or learn about today may

119
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:46,220
they be well

120
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:52,768
[Music]

121
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,840
thank you

122
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,720
so

123
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:14,399
continuing with the theme of this week which is

124
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:22,919
to be ready for change to be able to have been willing to change in a good

125
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:29,279
way by the life that we live and

126
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:35,640
to the Dharma practice is walking on the path of being changed

127
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:40,679
to being changed for the better being changed out of the ways that we

128
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:47,159
live that are harmful for ourselves and harmful for others into a way of living that is beneficial

129
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:55,980
for ourselves and beneficial for others and so to prepare or to help the mind or

130
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:02,760
the heart or Who We Are be available for change to for beneficial growth

131
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:08,279
there are these five different areas one is

132
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:13,860
um it did already this Readiness to be ready for something new ready and

133
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:19,620
available to be receptive the second is we talked about yesterday

134
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:27,720
is to have a mind that's malleable uh the mind which is a workable that

135
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:33,899
um you're you're not not holding on to uh ideas opinions identities in such a

136
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:40,380
way that things are stuck or hard holding a stance we're stubborn we're

137
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:46,799
resisting we're asserting but but instead where there's a softness there's

138
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:52,200
a malleability there's a workability where where a work of art that we can

139
00:33:52,200 --> 00:34:00,840
work on ourselves and today the topic of these five is

140
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:07,919
um um being free of hindrances and the hindrances are major

141
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:15,020
preoccupations that we have that we get caught in they're kind of like um

142
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:25,138
you know like vacuum cleaners so that get close to it and we get sucked into this vacuum cleaner and we swirl around

143
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:30,358
inside if this until somehow we find our way out

144
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:35,940
that these are very powerful forces that keep us preoccupied churning ruminating

145
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:44,179
caught up wanting not wanting um clamped down shut down Frozen

146
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:51,480
agitated spinning all kinds of things and there are five of them but the

147
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:57,859
shorthand is that there are preoccupations of the Mind and they're also they're poly word

148
00:34:57,859 --> 00:35:05,820
nivarata translated as hindrances also means coverings and sometimes I think of them as there's

149
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:11,099
this wonderful Greenhouse that maybe because of it was going to be

150
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:17,160
a freezing night it was covered with big blankets big blanket

151
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:24,660
but then the farmers forgot to take the blanket off and it stays that way for months

152
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:29,760
and the plants inside can't grow and the warmth of the sun can't get in there

153
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:36,079
really and things shrivel and dry and and um get really thin and it's related

154
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:42,359
until you know they all fall over the plants so this idea that we have these

155
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:49,380
coverings that cover something precious that we don't see when we're preoccupied

156
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:55,079
and to let go of these preoccupations the image of just like pulling the the

157
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:02,760
blanket off so that something gets deeper within the seeds that the seed beds and seeds can

158
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:09,960
begin growing uh something beautiful can begin to happen we do have beauty within us beautiful

159
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:16,260
capacities beautiful potential beautiful attitudes motivations thoughts feelings

160
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:22,800
and to be available is to uh to be unpreoccupied and available so allow

161
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,320
something deeper to happen that can't happen when we're preoccupied

162
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,540
so one of the uh really important

163
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:39,599
features of doing vipassana practice inside meditation practice mindfulness practice

164
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:46,859
is to really become an expert on the hindrances on Central desire avariciousness wanting

165
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:52,140
greed uh ill will hostility

166
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:59,099
resentment and then uh kind of uh I call it

167
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:04,140
resistance and frozenness stiffness it's usually called sloth and

168
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:10,020
torpor but these are more strategies of not being present that shut us down

169
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:15,420
and then agitation and resentments regrets

170
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:21,359
and then um doubt so there are these five and there's

171
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:27,240
Dharma talks about them there are essays on them I have a little book about the hindrance is called it's

172
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:34,440
called unhindered that it's important for people who do this practice here to not be discouraged

173
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:40,200
turn away from these when they occur for occur to us but rather really take them

174
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:46,680
on as a worthy area to study to understand how this works

175
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:52,200
to until we really begin to see and how the magic is done that we no longer

176
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:59,160
tricked by the magic into thinking that something is real there and we start seeing you know how the the

177
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:04,500
the sleight of hand of the hindrances of why we get caught in it and why we think

178
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:11,220
they're so important and so valuable and they're just a trick of the mind to get us preoccupied and caught

179
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:17,760
and um and to find ourselves without the hindrances

180
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:26,119
is one of the great Delights so to begin having an unpreoccupied mind

181
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:32,040
is a pleasure so one of the ways to be prepared to

182
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:38,099
change and to grow is to begin appreciating valuing enjoying

183
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:45,660
being inspired by the degree to which we are unpreoccupied

184
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:51,540
and that's a hard thing to do because of the preoccupation seems so important

185
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:58,740
being un preoccupied can seem like nothing and you know I mean that's not any good what's good is doing things and

186
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:05,400
thinking about things and and um but this unpreoccupied mind that's available that's present for the

187
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:11,520
fullness of this life the fullness of our hearts and our minds just here

188
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:18,300
and present unpreoccupied and to appreciate take the time to

189
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:23,339
appreciate it take the time to Value it when it's there

190
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:30,119
and um and rather than having it all or nothing it's either preoccupied or unpreoccupied

191
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:36,200
um it's a matter of degree and hopefully we're tipping the the balance towards

192
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:43,140
more being unpreoccupied than preoccupied but begin appreciating the degree to

193
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:51,839
which you're unpreoccupied the degree to which you're available and present then um and that also then allows you to

194
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:58,560
have the same kind of attitude of availability receptivity of of kind of a

195
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,660
softness around the ways which we are preoccupied

196
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:09,119
it's not like setting up a battle between them the more we have this

197
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:15,359
availability of attention we can hold all the ways that we are caught and

198
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:20,460
attached and involved hold it generally generously

199
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:26,339
hold it non-assertively non I don't Advance upon it to blow it

200
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:33,599
away or fix it be available to know it fully in meditation maybe everything difficult

201
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:40,619
within us is something that um is a door

202
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:47,000
to a deeper understanding of of life and of ourselves

203
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:55,140
so this um so that if you if you really want to be to change in a beneficial way

204
00:40:55,140 --> 00:41:01,079
begin appreciating at the unpreoccupied mind

205
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:06,599
and make time for it begin to learn to recognize when you're

206
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:14,099
preoccupied when you're spinning out when you're kind of you know being Carried Away by the

207
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:21,300
trains of thought and and really kind of oh that there it is there it is again and then step off

208
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:27,060
the train take off the blanket let the thought bubbles kind of Drift Away

209
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:34,740
let the tension and the pressure the need to solve and fix and judge and and

210
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:42,119
remember and plan settle for a while so you can be here in a deeper and

211
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:47,940
Fuller way so as the mind so that you're available

212
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:53,820
you're receptive you are maybe starting to becoming softer

213
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:59,280
in a place where creativity can occur in a place where deeper wisdom and deeper

214
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:05,820
understanding can arise it isn't like you lose your ability to take care of your life

215
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:14,520
if you're no longer preoccupied with your concerns you gain a new vantage point in which to

216
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:21,060
take care of your life when you're not preoccupied and it's possible to have the important

217
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:29,359
issues of your life come into your mind to be thought about it being a preoccupation

218
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,000
it's just something to think about in a light way an open way and a peaceful way and

219
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,779
have tea with your thoughts and think what needs to be thought about

220
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,820
so for today the

221
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:54,240
the topic now is to appreciate non-preoccupation

222
00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:03,079
appreciate when you're not caught up in your thoughts and appreciate the alternative

223
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:11,640
appreciate what that's like to not be preoccupied caught I appreciate the the openness

224
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:18,119
the subtleness the availability the receptivity

225
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:23,520
appreciate maybe even the delight and the joy

226
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:29,660
of not having lost yourself to your thoughts

227
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:35,700
there is a way in which we lose ourselves when we get too preoccupied

228
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:41,520
and then we gain ourselves when the preoccupations the clouds part the preoccupations part

229
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:47,280
and we're ah we're here we're back here I am

230
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:53,220
and for the Buddha the absence of hindrances the absence of preoccupation

231
00:43:53,220 --> 00:44:00,799
is a source for gladness for Delight for kind of happiness

232
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:09,060
so what today I'd like to suggest to you is you notice the times that you're not preoccupied

233
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:15,500
where you're available rather than asserting yourself

234
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:24,060
see if you can taste or find the hints maybe or the small ways big ways in

235
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:32,000
which there is something some gladness some happiness in this ability to be here

236
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:39,000
in an available way and think of it as micro moments

237
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,339
sometimes think of it as a degrees but see if you can find that the

238
00:44:44,339 --> 00:44:50,040
well-being and the Delight the gladness the

239
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:57,000
appreciation for not being caught up wow I'm not caught up I'm just here

240
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:05,400
for this second and may you have a lots of wow today may

241
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:14,040
you have lots of appreciation and joy oh here it is here it is I'm back I'm back

242
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:21,119

244
