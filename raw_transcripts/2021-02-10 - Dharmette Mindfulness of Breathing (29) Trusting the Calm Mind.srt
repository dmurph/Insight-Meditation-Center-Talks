1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,640
so

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,120
the eighth step of anapanasati

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,240
is one trains oneself

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,480
experience one

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,720
calms the mental activity

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,919
one relaxes the mental activity

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,320
you most english translations will use

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,599
some language of

9
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,640
a tranquilized which makes tranquil

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,480
the mental activity and um

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,320
and the mental activity here is usu

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,200
often translated as mental formations

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,760
the formations the activity the

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,079
constructs the constructing

15
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,840
aspect the doing aspect of the mind

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,920
so i think activity works relatively

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,520
well

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,199
that and we now begin to calm

19
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,320
the mental activity

20
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,960
and this doesn't have to be a big

21
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:05,840
project

22
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,360
if it's easy to relax and

23
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,080
please by all means do but it's also

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,400
recognizing this is a natural process of

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,560
settling that goes on

26
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,560
and as we gets more and more settled in

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,439
meditation

28
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,759
more focused on the breathing and and we

29
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,439
start shedding a lot of the

30
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,200
concerns of the day and we're just more

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,119
and more here

32
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,040
uh their tent starts being a heightened

33
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,560
sensitivity to

34
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,040
different aspects of our experience one

35
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,159
of them is

36
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,400
experiencing bodily tensions the way we

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,640
hold tensions in our body

38
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,479
and of course there's a feeling that

39
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,799
well enough the body itself wants to

40
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,479
relax and let go

41
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,399
and there's almost a natural letting go

42
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,159
and relaxation

43
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,079
just from knowing and recognizing what

44
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,360
goes on but we can also be participate

45
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,960
in that if it's easy enough and we don't

46
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,479
get busy

47
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,398
we can help ourselves relax more

48
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,880
so as we begin having more well-being

49
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,240
and more settled and

50
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,520
in meditation at some point also then we

51
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,200
develop a kind of a special sensitivity

52
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,319
or awareness of the mind thinking

53
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,920
of course we can know that earlier and

54
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,360
we're letting go of our thoughts coming

55
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,959
back to the breathing

56
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,560
but it uh there's more and more

57
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,480
sensitivity as we go along to the

58
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,599
unsatisfactory quality of thinking the

59
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,360
way that we start noticing that

60
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,360
when we're involved in thinking it's

61
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,480
almost like an alienation from ourselves

62
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,400
that's unimaginable for people who

63
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,239
identify strongly where they're thinking

64
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,800
like a thinking is who they are

65
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,480
and uh but we realize that thinking is

66
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,959
just in one aspect of our life

67
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,840
that there's a fuller range of who we

68
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,560
are that

69
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,400
really becomes apparent as big and

70
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,160
settled and calm and

71
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,760
more embodied and present here in

72
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,160
meditation we start seeing that thinking

73
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,120
is just a piece of what we are

74
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,599
and if we get lost in thought we

75
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,760
actually lose touch with the fullness

76
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,239
the fullness of who we are the wholeness

77
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,680
of who we are in a sense

78
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,519
there's a kind of alienation even if the

79
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,000
thoughts are really great and exciting

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,519
or important so called

81
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,080
and but we also become sensitive to the

82
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,640
in the

83
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,360
impact that thinking has so one impact

84
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,720
is the alienation

85
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,400
another impact is that

86
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,640
unskillful and wholesome thoughts

87
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,879
attract more unwholesomeness

88
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,120
so if we're thinking a lot of with

89
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,400
agitated ways

90
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,159
angry ways greedy ways

91
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,640
that those tend to kind of perpetuate

92
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,640
themselves and attract more of the same

93
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,080
agitation and preoccupation and we also

94
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,159
start feeling the impact it has on

95
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,560
very subtly sometimes on our musculature

96
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,120
that i could go around all day long

97
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,760
somewhat calm and engaged in life but

98
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,439
when i sit down to meditate

99
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,319
i realize that my thinking has somehow

100
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,000
created a little bit of tension around

101
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,040
my eyes and

102
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,640
just behind the forehead that i'm too

103
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,159
busy kind of with life

104
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,959
to really notice the subtlety of it but

105
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,799
as we settled in meditation

106
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,880
that subtlety of where the whole tension

107
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,880
and tightness

108
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,479
becomes more and more apparent and

109
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,479
and the tension associated with thinking

110
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,160
the pressure the agitation that's

111
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,560
physical almost in nature that's more

112
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,000
closely connected to

113
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,960
thinking rather than the surface muscles

114
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,080
that we often kind of

115
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,560
we can relax more actively or something

116
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,600
i call that the thinking muscle and

117
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,080
part of the meditation is to is to relax

118
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,000
the thinking muscle

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,280
and um and um

120
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,320
and so as we feel this there's a natural

121
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,840
tendency for the system the

122
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,759
psychophysical system to want to relax

123
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,880
the more we are mindful of tension

124
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,560
the more we feel like almost in the

125
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,080
tension itself is a momentum to relax

126
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,840
but we can also soften and relax

127
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,360
ourselves softening the mind

128
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,039
relaxing thinking mind and

129
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,880
and certainly this is very helpful

130
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,360
because the more the mind is calm

131
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,440
the more it tr that attracts more

132
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,639
calmness

133
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,199
the more the mind is calm the less we're

134
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,000
likely to

135
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,759
be so interested in being caught in our

136
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,440
thoughts and wonder often thoughts

137
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,440
it's easier to stay focused and continue

138
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,479
with this process of meditation

139
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,080
but also there's a very important

140
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,240
lessons that can come

141
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,039
about how our mind works as we get

142
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,800
calmer and calmer

143
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,440
and one of them is that there's a

144
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,000
certain

145
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,120
wonderful intelligence creativity that

146
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,199
can happen when the mind is calm and

147
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,000
settled

148
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,440
that's much more difficult to happen

149
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,759
when it's agitated

150
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,280
it's a little bit of a trap for some

151
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,440
people because sometimes they start

152
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,039
composing

153
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,360
you know the great world novel by

154
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,759
you know they have some great idea for

155
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,560
something

156
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,880
and the creativity and the intelligence

157
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,400
of the mind is really kind of

158
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,240
operating it just feels so good and

159
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,680
engaging and

160
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,280
and right to be involved in some

161
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,520
wonderful creative thoughts

162
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,960
and so so but it's a dead end

163
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,800
for the purpose of meditation it becomes

164
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,319
actually another way of being kind of

165
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,319
self-alienated even though it feels so

166
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,360
good

167
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,120
and exciting and like finally i feel

168
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,720
fulfilled i'm doing something very

169
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,919
important writing the

170
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,880
greatest poetry that's ever been written

171
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,199
and

172
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,639
um and um so so to not get sidetracked

173
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,600
by that

174
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,400
but the process that got us there is

175
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,000
showing us that there's a natural

176
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,520
intelligence or

177
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,400
creativity or wisdom that can operate

178
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,120
when the mind is not so active

179
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,240
that the in the principle that actually

180
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,560
the um the mind operates the best

181
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,639
when there's no extra energy no

182
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,080
unnecessary energy operating

183
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,759
and that's a great lesson and a

184
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,639
difficult lesson to really take in

185
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,800
that um it's so it can be so compelling

186
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,039
to get to worry so compelling to feel

187
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,199
like i have to accomplish i have to fix

188
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,720
something i have to do something and i

189
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,479
have to think my way to it

190
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,039
and and we get agitated and pressured

191
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,880
and sometimes we feel like

192
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,440
we have to if we're responsible we have

193
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,520
to engage the mind and

194
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,240
show ourselves and maybe even show other

195
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:34,960
people

196
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,720
how serious we are in thinking and

197
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,400
taking care of things

198
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,199
and that if we allow the natural quiet

199
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,319
calm mind

200
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,199
to operate then it looks like we don't

201
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,160
care

202
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,680
and looks like we know that we're just

203
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,160
being kind of letting things just go

204
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,039
you know whatever way they go but uh

205
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,360
what i'd like to suggest is that

206
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,240
our love our care responsibility even a

207
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,599
sense that things are really important

208
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,199
to take care of

209
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,680
even then they can be taken care of

210
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,479
better

211
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,919
if the mind is relaxed and calm

212
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,039
and we don't build up this extra tension

213
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,039
in the mind of doing and

214
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,800
accomplishing and fixing and thinking

215
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,479
about things

216
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,840
and to learn this this um this

217
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,960
shift of perspective

218
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,800
to learn how to trust a calm mind

219
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,280
and have that combined be engaged

220
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,360
responsibly take care of things

221
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,159
is a process of trust process of

222
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,399
familiarity of experiencing oh this

223
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,839
actually works

224
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,479
i don't have to believe in the in the

225
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,680
messages even from

226
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,279
society around us that i have to be

227
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,720
anxious preoccupied angry

228
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,480
apologetic i have to kind of engage my

229
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,519
mind in some way

230
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,560
to please other people or please myself

231
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,680
it's possible to stay peaceful and love

232
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,959
and intelligence and creativity and

233
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,279
responsibility all can operate when

234
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,399
there's no extra energy going on

235
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,640
so um unnecessary energy in mind

236
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,680
and so uh this learning to to relax and

237
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,920
to calm the mind

238
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,839
it very much depends on our ability to

239
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,000
recognize

240
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,720
how we're over efforting in the mind

241
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,880
where the agitation of the mind is that

242
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,279
tension in the mind is the pressure in

243
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,160
the mind

244
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,200
the closing down of the mind that goes

245
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,160
on

246
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,920
and and so the seventh step is to feel

247
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,040
that

248
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,240
and to feel what's going on uh and then

249
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,959
this eighth step is to relax it

250
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,800
and this has a wonderful effect where

251
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,880
some of our problems that we have in our

252
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,720
lives that we feel like we have to fix

253
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,639
and care and take care of

254
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,320
maybe some of them don't have any

255
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,839
solutions

256
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,560
but rather than solving them we can

257
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,399
dissolve them

258
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,720
so for example someone who wants to know

259
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,480
the meaning of life

260
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,440
they might have a lot of agitation

261
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,079
around this

262
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,600
even some anxiety around what's the

263
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,200
meaning of life

264
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,560
i need to know because i need to know

265
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,320
where i fit in this universe and what's

266
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,200
happening with me

267
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,000
and have a purpose and all this stuff

268
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,399
and

269
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,320
there's a lot of agitated thinking

270
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,440
around searching for the meaning of life

271
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,079
but if they do this meditation process

272
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,760
and all the agitation

273
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,839
and anxiety associated with this

274
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,680
question

275
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,880
abates dissolves goes away

276
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,839
then lo and behold they might discover

277
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:42,160
that

278
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,519
it still might be an interesting

279
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,360
question the meaning of life

280
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,440
but there's no personal need or

281
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,240
investment or desperation around it

282
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,079
it just becomes an abstract question and

283
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,560
the existential

284
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,360
power that held our grip around it has

285
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,480
dissolved

286
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,880
without solving it it's no longer a

287
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,680
problem

288
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,680
it just becomes in maybe an academic

289
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,240
interesting question

290
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,519
that might not have been the best

291
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,480
example but i'm hoping that you can just

292
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,320
apply that to yourself that

293
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,279
think about what are you concerned with

294
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,200
what are you preoccupied with

295
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,560
that maybe doesn't need to be solved

296
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,600
maybe more valuable is to dissolve

297
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,600
the underlying tension fear anxiety

298
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,279
pressure ambition greed that might be

299
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,560
the very thing that's

300
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,560
keeping those thoughts pumping up and

301
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,920
going

302
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,480
and to relax the mental activity

303
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,160
trust softening the mind

304
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,200
and it's a wonderful thing so this is

305
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,959
especially true in meditation so as

306
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:49,760
meditation

307
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,560
con continues to develop there comes a

308
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,680
stage

309
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,399
where periodically it comes and goes

310
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,000
where it's really clear

311
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,560
that the what's really good to do is to

312
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,519
trust

313
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,560
the calm mind and letting go of all the

314
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,320
unnecessary energy that's there

315
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,480
so thank you very much and

316
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,560
we'll continue this process of step

317
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,160
seven and eight

318
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,959
for another couple of days thank you
