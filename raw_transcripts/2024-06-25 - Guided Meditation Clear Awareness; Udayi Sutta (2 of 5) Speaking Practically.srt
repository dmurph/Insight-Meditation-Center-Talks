1
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,280
so hello everyone and

2
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:21,519
welcome and um I was just looking out the window we

3
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:28,000
have these very high Windows here looking up at the sky Through the Windows and the clouds that are here

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,960
and and um

5
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:40,360
um if the begins to rain

6
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:46,680
then first there has to be the clouds the clouds are the condition for the

7
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,199
rain and the idea of conditionality that things appear because of other

8
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:58,480
conditions that have to be there is a central feature in Buddhism that's uh

9
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,920
one of the purposes of which is to help us break through

10
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,439
the the U Break Out of the delusion of permanence that something is there

11
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:16,759
forever it's and the delusion of self that many of us will live under and the

12
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:25,119
particular delusion of self is the idea that there is a permanent self that anything defines Us in an permanent

13
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:32,000
way and uh and there's a movement in the mind of attachment M that is very

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,759
closely connected to the ideas of self ideas of permanent selves this is who I

15
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:47,880
am and the idea is that uh something is fixed and so in meditation practice one

16
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:54,520
of the ways that the teachings on conditionality can function can support

17
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:02,479
meditation is that when you're aware of something occur ing in the present

18
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:09,959
moment whatever it is that experience is a conditioned

19
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:17,239
experience certain conditions have come together to bring forth this particular

20
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:23,400
thing and but now that you're aware of it now that you really see it and know

21
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:31,280
what it is that's happening you've introduced a new condition into the ecosystem into the

22
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,680
into the moment and the idea now is

23
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:45,560
to uh um trust that that's enough for your part of the for your

24
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:52,800
contributions to causes and conditions a clear awareness you not try to fix anything

25
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,040
you don't have to think about it don't have to um analyze it and you don't have

26
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:06,280
to uh use what's happening as a basis for judging yourself all you do is recognize oh it's

27
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,680
things are here for now for causes and conditions maybe it's obvious to see

28
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:20,239
what the conditions were and um and uh maybe you know your

29
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,760
mind wandered off and that's a condition that when you see that that uh you

30
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:33,319
criticize yourself that I'm not a good meditator because my mind wandered off that's a delusion of self that's

31
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:40,799
operating there making a def defining oneself by that as opposed to just recognizing clearly this is the mind

32
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,080
that wanders off to say I'm a lousy

33
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,200
meditator that's a condition for feeling lousy and we feel that lousiness we see

34
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,480
oh that's a rose because I had this belief and each steps alongs the way

35
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,760
what we take refuge in in mindful practice in meditation is Simply Having

36
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:09,040
the clarity that things arise because of conditions we don't have to take own

37
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,400
them we don't have to Define ourselves by them we don't have to see them as

38
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:22,240
it's going to be this way forever it's just the conditions of this moment and now I contribute a new

39
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,520
condition and the condition is uh uh uh

40
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,600
being aware of what here and if it's obvious that it's you can see the

41
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:39,000
conditionality then you can you can Rec that helps the clarity oh this is here because of these conditions but not

42
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,919
because you're analyzing or thinking about it just oh it's here because of conditions and the the goal is to find

43
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:53,680
Clarity in The Knowing uh Clarity crispness

44
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:02,080
crispness um openness spaciousness um to just know this is how

45
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,120
it is right now and uh and in knowing in doing that

46
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,360
we you are contributing a new condition nothing stays the same no

47
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,600
conditions stay the same when they're observed that's kind

48
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:25,000
of the the premise here and maybe if you look at a chair the chair doesn't change

49
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,800
but if you look at a chair and just look at it you change

50
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:39,960
what we're aware of as we're meditating of ourselves changes because we're aware and don't try to make the change

51
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,880
just be aware and then notice what the how the conditions

52
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,639
change and the conditions are always changing and every changing condition

53
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:57,120
every condition is an opportunity for further Clarity clear

54
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,000
awareness that's what we contribute so to

55
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,080
begin to recognize the

56
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:17,800
conditions of what has contributed to how your body feels right

57
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:26,360
now how does your posture contribute to how your body feels right

58
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,080
now and at the before we start

59
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:40,960
meditating adjusting your posture is

60
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:49,639
contributing the proper or better conditions of of the B for the body to

61
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:56,879
participate in the meditation the body participating in the

62
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:04,759
meditation the body is just not an appendage that you kind of have to kind of make comfortable enough so you can

63
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:11,400
meditate the body is here to be part of the meditation and a

64
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,120
posture of

65
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,720
participation and to gently close your

66
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:30,400
eyes and to invite the body into the meditation to be part of it

67
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,639
taking a few long slow deep

68
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,198
breaths relaxing as you exhale

69
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,680
letting your breathing return to

70
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:20,759
normal and given the what's happened just so far in

71
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:27,599
meditation those are the conditions for how you some of what you

72
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,800
feel right now maybe some has shifted

73
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:44,279
changed and to if that's the case to be aware of it in a simple clear

74
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:58,399
way and a way of being aware and being clearly aware that

75
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:05,160
something like giving room space for each thing we're aware of to

76
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,879
be as it

77
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,040
is letting your breathing breath breathe

78
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,200
normally and if you're aware of your breathing in your body

79
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,880
the breathing now is participating in your

80
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,920
meditation as you exhale relaxing

81
00:09:51,800 --> 00:10:00,000
more exhaling and maybe relaxing the thinking mind

82
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:19,640
maybe relaxing the belly and so the weight of your torso settles a

83
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,560
bit into your sitting

84
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,279
bones e

85
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,920
and then continuing with your meditation on your own in the

86
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:18,200
silence and from time to time when something new

87
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,800
arises recognize it as arising occurring because of

88
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,040
conditions that's all

89
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:41,079
and rely on simple awareness of what's

90
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:46,920
Happening contributing a new

91
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:53,200
condition contributing being

92
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:05,480
aware and the more clear the aware awareness is without changing anything

93
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:11,279
intentionally the more it contributes to a new way of

94
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:19,519
being it's a condition for what's going to happen

95
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
next

96
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120

for for

104
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:11,558
when clear relaxed awareness fills the field of awareness

105
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:19,319
the field of attention thinking is no longer at the

106
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:22,319
center

107
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:40,520
clear awareness a Clarity of [Music]

108
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:48,760
knowing is not nothing it's one of the most

109
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:54,919
significant acts

110
00:17:54,919 --> 00:18:03,400
conditions we contribute to this moment and the next

111
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
moment

112
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720

for e

125
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,559
and now as we come to the end of this

126
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:59,320
sitting how do you feel how are you

127
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:08,320
have the conditions of this meditation somehow contributed to you being different now

128
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,799
than you were at the beginning of the

129
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:20,000
sitting what might have the conditions

130
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:26,520
been that contributed to how you are now

131
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:39,200
and was one of those conditions your practice of

132
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:46,919
mindfulness of clear awareness clear knowing of the present

133
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,240
moment how was that a condition

134
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:10,559
and may it be that what we we learn through meditation what we learn about being

135
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:17,480
aware translates to how we live the world in the world of other

136
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:25,519
people that we learn to hear listen to

137
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:35,600
people with clear listening we learn to see others with clear

138
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:43,720
seeing there's a little saying that says that adults need to be

139
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,320
heard children need to be

140
00:28:50,880 --> 00:29:00,039
seen may it be the practice we do helps us to contribute

141
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:08,200
a positive conditions to This World by listening and

142
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:14,559
seeing Others May all beings be

143
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:23,960
happy may all beings be safe may all beings be

144
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:30,039
peaceful may all beings be free

145
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:37,799
and may the way that each of us listen the way that each and one sees

146
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:43,399
others be done in safety and peace and

147
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:49,799
fr offering others to be free of our attachments

148
00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:04,930
[Music]

149
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:11,399
thank

150
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,960
you e

151
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:10,399
so hello and welcome to this second talk u based on the upai

152
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:18,600
suta and um I'll read you that suta again so this is a suta where the

153
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:24,519
Buddha um talks about what should be established what qualities or Char

154
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:29,840
characteristics should be established in someone who wants to teach the Dharma so

155
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:38,880
you know last week last two weeks I talked about the core teachings that I have and but as as important as the

156
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,880
teachings is how we teach and certainly I aspire to teach in

157
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:53,240
the way the Buddha encouraged us to be the how we teach so I'll read the five

158
00:31:53,240 --> 00:32:00,399
again uh the Dharma should be taught to others thinking I will speak step by

159
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:05,639
step I will teach I will speak of a gradual

160
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:12,559
path the dhma should be taught to others thinking I will speak for practical

161
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:19,200
reasons the Dharma should be taught to others thinking I will speak grounded in

162
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,200
kindness the Dharma should be taught to others thinking I will not speak for material

163
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:32,960
rewards the Dharma should be taught to others thinking I will speak without wounding myself or

164
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,639
others and when I introduced these yesterday I said that these five care

165
00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:44,760
qualities are equally valuable as as guidelines for how we speak with others

166
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:50,600
even if we're not teaching them and um so I'll talk about mostly the teaching

167
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:57,639
side of it but I'm hoping that those of you who are not going to be teaching that uh you consider these as invaluable

168
00:32:57,639 --> 00:33:04,159
way ways of looking at your acts of speech how you speak and today I'm doing them a little

169
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:09,760
out of order but today coincidentally it's I'll talk about the second one for the second

170
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:15,440
talk uh the Dharma should be taught to others thinking I will speak for practical

171
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:22,120
reasons the some translators will translate this uh as a speak uh based on

172
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:28,519
causes and conditions explaining causes and conditions the um

173
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:34,519
uh the word that's being used here can also mean instructions and I like that because

174
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:40,639
rather than teaching people uh truths uh like abstract truths things to believe

175
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:46,440
in um the emphasis is always instructions of what we can do what we can

176
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:53,159
practice and now this goes along with what I talked about last week as the second Core teaching principle that I

177
00:33:53,159 --> 00:34:00,200
have that uh that of no views uh not Rel ring on beliefs not

178
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:08,440
relying on dogmatic ideas and uh but rather relying

179
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:13,878
here relying on what's practical what we can do ourselves we can see the cause

180
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:19,520
and conditions uh um and so some people might say wait a minute we have to

181
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:25,599
believe in things and um and uh then so someone might come up

182
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,638
with the idea that in order to to get water out of the faucet we have to

183
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:39,118
believe that turning the the handle of the of the faucet the water will come out so this is pushing the this idea of

184
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:44,638
belief to an extreme um and uh but the um yes there's

185
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:53,040
a kind of belief but it's a belief that we can immediately see whether it works or not the proof is right there it's

186
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,320
practical the condition for the water coming out is turning on uh uh turning

187
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,400
the handle and so it's not uh exactly a belief uh maybe there's confidence that

188
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:10,160
it will work because the the whole plumbing system is in order and

189
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:17,000
um and uh so it's that kind of practical way like this you know that uh we

190
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:23,880
there's a cause and condition for water coming out uh there's a cause and condition for uh developing this

191
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:29,320
practice it's a cause and condition for our suffering and a cause and condition for the end of

192
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:36,280
suffering and um and uh so when we teach we're constantly using that as an

193
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:43,480
orientation that uh teach practically teach what's useful and um and teach the

194
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:50,400
cause and conditions so we can really see what's going on there's a wonderful teaching of the Buddha that's called the

195
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,720
preservation of the truth and this is where the Buddha says that um um if you

196
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:02,640
say something if you have a belief you should uh explain to people the basis

197
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:09,040
upon that belief so if you believe it because uh you have faith in something

198
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:15,160
so it's no what there's no uh proof there's no no seeing why this is the

199
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:22,040
case then you say I believe this because of Faith you don't say this is true you

200
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:27,920
say I believe this is true because I faith it is so if you say it that way you're preserving the truth because

201
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,760
you're saying you're stating this is my I I base this on faith and so people

202
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,720
know you're not making an absolute claim but you're making a claim for yourself and they

203
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:46,920
know the Assumption underneath that that people know the basis underneath it so they can be in conversation with you if

204
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:52,599
you just say something is true dogmatically or declaratively uh people don't know how

205
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:59,480
to find themselves they either have to believe it or not believe it or or you they can't participate in it in a in a

206
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:05,800
robust way but if um we preserve this Truth by saying it's based on faith he

207
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:11,040
goes on to say that if it's if we base it on what we've heard from our

208
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:17,280
teachers uh uh what I'm say what I believe is based on what's popularly

209
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:27,040
believed by the society around me I believe it because it's in my sacred books I believe it because um I uh uh I

210
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,680
um I thought about it logically and my logic or rationality led me to uh

211
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:38,839
believe what this is each of those cases when you say that to someone they can go

212
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:45,319
back and check with you uh the source of the belief is that Source a useful a

213
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:52,720
useful Source uh do they want to uh uh do they want to rely on that Source too

214
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:58,839
but if you just make a declarative statement which then becomes a view then it

215
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:05,680
um uh you the conversation can't people can't really participate or or you know

216
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:11,359
engage in a more realistic way to find out what's really going on here so this

217
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:17,079
idea of speaking based on reasons practical reasons and one of the great

218
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:23,680
questions uh is uh is asking yourself why do I want to say what I want to

219
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:29,800
say why do I want to do what I want to do and to take the time to ask ask that

220
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:35,880
question is uh not to ask metaphysical looking for metaphysical answers but

221
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:41,480
right now what what am I trying to accomplish what is the Practical re uh

222
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:46,520
the Practical reason for why I want to say what I want to say and um the first

223
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:52,000
time I kind of really clearly saw the value of asking myself that was

224
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,359
um uh just before I was going to give a Dharma talk many years ago an old friend

225
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:05,599
showed up and we had a little chat and I went into the meditation Hall to sit down meditate and give a talk so and I

226
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:11,760
and so just before um uh I went to sit down I just said to my old friend um you

227
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:17,040
know I haven't prepared for this talk today and um and because I sat down to

228
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:23,640
meditate right after saying that I said why did I say that and I realized the reason was I was trying to protect

229
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:30,240
myself from the my friend judging me in in case I gave a bad talk if I had asked my that myself the

230
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:36,240
question before i i g said what I said why why do I want to say that I didn't

231
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:42,160
prepare the talk today I would have seen the reason I did it and then I probably

232
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:48,720
would have done something different so understand the reasons the Practical

233
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:57,880
cause and effect relationship the conditions underlying what we do this is the alternative to having uh

234
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:05,560
beliefs having fixed views having dogmatic views having you know metaphysical views that Buddhism

235
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:10,920
emphasizes we don't have to have any uh we don't have to believe in anything we

236
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:16,720
don't uh see for ourselves the emphasis in the Dharma is

237
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:22,280
come and see for yourself it's a visible here and now and because of that you can

238
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:28,400
count on that the teachings really are meant to be uh practical be instructions

239
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:33,760
they're meant to be uh something that uh is reasoned out

240
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,839
there's reasons for how we say it and reasons means it's based on conditions

241
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:45,440
based on uh cause and effect based on how conditions influence how things

242
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:51,079
are and um so uh to in teaching the

243
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:58,480
Dharma uh I interpret this particular uh phrase I that says I speak for practical

244
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,720
reasons I interpret it as um as

245
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:08,960
um um as explaining the conditions for

246
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:15,000
why we're uh what we're teaching what are the what are the reasons what are the rationalities what is it can be how

247
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:23,560
can we see this for ourselves what's the basis for what we're saying and so what I just did now was a

248
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:28,920
little bit the case I said I'm going to interpret this text way and that's a

249
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:34,880
preserving the truth that's kind of I'm giving you the reason uh you know uh for

250
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:41,200
why you know the background for why I'm interpreting this way I'm saying it's an interpretation and I use this

251
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:48,079
interpretation and the reason for it is I would like the teachings I do to um uh

252
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:55,760
to um guide people away from fixed beliefs dogmatic beliefs declarative

253
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:02,319
statements to what they can know and experience for themselves and and verify

254
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:07,400
for themselves oh this is true I see that this works it's as true as turning

255
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:14,480
the handle on the faucet and the water comes out um and uh and it's that practical

256
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,760
that immediate uh what we can do so in the

257
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:28,040
meditation uh I don't want to just make a declare statement that some that can be made that mindfulness is always use

258
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:36,760
ful what I'd like to say is that um uh mindfulness is useful in many

259
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:43,280
circumstances and um and uh we can discover that by paying attention to the

260
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:49,559
effect that being mindful has on us that if we bring clear awareness to our

261
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:56,559
experience that's a condition that then changes the ecosystem of our experience what's going

262
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:03,960
on and if you really pay attention to uh what happens when you bring clear simple

263
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:09,680
relaxed attention um uh then you'll see that this is

264
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:15,480
useful and um and the place to look to to see where the evidence is is

265
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:22,400
primarily in yourself though sometimes clear awareness uh that translates into

266
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,960
listening carefully to others listen seeing them clearly does also change the

267
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:34,480
environment we're in the situations we're in somehow and so we can see that change other people relax other people

268
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:41,680
feel cared for other people uh feel understood feel respected and you see

269
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:50,559
that that changes a circumstance so um uh to cultivating clear

270
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:58,000
awareness is a condition that can have an effect

271
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,359
that is beneficial so that's uh speaking for

272
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:09,160
practical reasons that uh the reason to be mindful

273
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:16,200
is to benefit self and others and that's something that you can see for yourself as we learn to do this

274
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:22,480
practice and in fact we're supposed to see it for ourselves all the Dharma

275
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:28,200
everything in the Dharma I believe I believe based on how I read

276
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:35,359
the ancient texts everything in the Dharma should be verified the core Dharma of the Buddha

277
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:44,240
should be verified in our own experience through our own practice so um may that be for you and

278
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:50,640
may you see as you go through the day today um May you ask yourself the

279
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:55,800
question why do I want to say what I'm going to say now or why do I want to do

280
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:01,280
what I'm want to do now and see if that kind of brings forth a

281
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:08,200
better understanding of the conditions that uh influence uh your

282
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:12,400
life thank you
