1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,759
so uh the one announcement i want to make before we

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,759
i start the talk is that today's the last day then that we're going to do the fundraising for save the

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:18,560
children for their work with the refugees from the war in ukraine and it's kind of not very nice that so far

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,720
we've raised directly seventy three thousand dollars which is a lot of money for us the

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,320
community and some people have donated uh inspired by this and donated directly to save the

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,920
children rather than through us for their own reasons so uh

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,960
it's i think it's kind of powerful when a community comes together and does something like this and you see

8
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,079
the aggregate you see the coming together of shared

9
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,120
goodwill intentions desires to make a difference so thank you all those of you who've

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,199
contributed and i think the treasurer will kind of close

11
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:06,239
down the everything tonight and and send save the children to check

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,400
so um so the topic for today's talk

13
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,439
it can seem like some people roll their eyes maybe when i give the title

14
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,920
but hopefully by the end your eyes will have settled down and that is

15
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,078
meditating for peace meditating for peace

16
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,240
and so many people for centuries have associated meditation in the buddhist

17
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:47,119
context with the goal of liberation often for personal liberation

18
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,960
one of the remarkable things is that there can be other motivations

19
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,320
for doing the same practice in other words the same practice doing

20
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:07,119
the same thing can function for different purposes even purposes you didn't attend

21
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:14,800
and one of the purposes of meditation is to contribute to a peaceful world

22
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,760
and it turns out that if you dedicate your practice to liberation and dedicated to

23
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,920
your practice to your meditation practice to supporting a peaceful world you pretty

24
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:35,040
much do the same practice it's not that different except for the motivation

25
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:42,160
and uh but it makes a difference the motivation you do it and so and it's also possible that

26
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,640
dedication for liberation can remain

27
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,840
and and it can join with the motivation to contribute to peaceful world

28
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:01,280
and the benefit of that is there might give a wonderful and healthy and stress-free perhaps

29
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:08,239
sense of urgency for the meditation practice like the practice is important it's

30
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:15,840
valuable it gives it like and right now with the war in the ukraine

31
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,400
the wars in yemen and

32
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,360
it's different places in the world myanmar all kinds of horrible things the world's

33
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,640
doing but for many of us i think that what's happening in ukraine is so horrific and

34
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,680
so dramatic and seeing it so clearly with images and everything

35
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,159
that uh you know it's really something that and also it represents for many people

36
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,280
a real turning point in human history and our situation here things are

37
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:00,560
changing in such a big way it's going to affect the whole globe in a way that some of the other wars may don't affect it so dramatically

38
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,400
the whole the whole the whole globe

39
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,120
and so if we're meditating anyway

40
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,199
meditate for peace and how is it that meditating can

41
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:23,360
contribute to peace in the wider world that's the topic for today

42
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,400
and so one of the things is that uh what we learn how we how we're transformed

43
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,600
and what we learn about ourselves changes us into a person who can then

44
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:41,520
uh approach the conflicts in the world the suffering of the world in a more useful way

45
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:48,720
the very things we learn about being present for ourselves and plumbing to the depths of ourselves in meditation

46
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:56,000
is the is transforms us so that we can bring some of the same benefits into the world

47
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,039
so there's a number of things that meditation can do or is it it's about in our tradition

48
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:10,080
one is to be a witness for what is true the second is to heal what needs to be

49
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,800
healed the third is to liberate what can be liberated

50
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,240
and the fourth is to cultivate the best in us the best qualities within

51
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,320
us best best of our character and those those four things are being

52
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,360
cultivated when we meditate and it's powerful to do this

53
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,360
as we do it for ourselves and learn what it means to do it for ourselves

54
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,520
those very same things can be offered in how we attend to a present for the world

55
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,720
we can be a witness for the world witness of what's true

56
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,319
we can be a healer for what needs to be healed we can be

57
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:02,000
liberate help liberate what needs to be liberated and we can cultivate the best qualities

58
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,520
that are needed for this world so how does this work for in

59
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,759
meditation and so we part a huge part of what mindfulness

60
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:21,360
is is being honest but i like the expression of being a witness to what is true because it has

61
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,479
two qualities first is that um

62
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:33,360
we're you know we're trying to see what's really true here for ourselves in ourselves

63
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,479
and sometimes what's true about ourselves is not exemplary

64
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:44,800
sometimes it's not even things we want to share with other people because we feel embarrassed or worse

65
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,400
sometimes what's true for ourselves something we don't even want to admit for ourselves

66
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:57,520
or we have trouble understanding it or seeing it the truth of it because we don't know how to be a witness

67
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,520
so the other aspects of being a witness for the truth is witnessing and one of the things we're doing in

68
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,639
this practice is learning to be a a clear

69
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,240
calm open available witness to what's there

70
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,639
to be a witness before we're a judger to be a witness before we're a fixer

71
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:27,280
to be a witness before we're an escaper getting away from it all

72
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:33,360
that we have cultivating the ability to be present and witness even the most difficult

73
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,160
things that humans can needs to see sometimes and we're doing that with ourselves

74
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:46,240
now some of you might have completely might be saints and so maybe that's what you get to

75
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,680
witness but for most people there are parts of ourselves that are not necessarily what

76
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,240
we're most proud of and difficult challenging

77
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,400
and so part of meditation is to learn to be a witness to what is hard for us to

78
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:09,840
witness to witness how we're attached to witness how we're afraid to witness howard

79
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,360
have caught in the grip of desires or preferences

80
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:22,800
judgments how we operate with hostility we're all saints beautiful calm and peaceful

81
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,840
until the unexpected happens and then it triggers all kinds of

82
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:36,080
frustrations and angers and things these poor computers that some they've

83
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,159
been recipients of so much frustration and anger some people like i want to throw them across the room you

84
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:49,760
know but you know but to learn to stay keep stay calm and work

85
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,880
with it so uh to be to see what's going on to be

86
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:02,240
a witness in ourselves which means to witness all those things the anger the frustration the desires the fears the

87
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:08,560
the judgments and to be able to witness it in a way that we're not automatically approving

88
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,920
it not automatically participating in it we're kind of stepping back and being

89
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,040
the witness of it it's a powerful thing to witness

90
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,320
and there's something healing about witnessing it to say it could be honestly seeming

91
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:31,120
space in room thought this is what's happening and for some people what we get what

92
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,680
we're witnessing is the inner wars some people live with all kinds of conflict within themselves

93
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,760
so people live with sides of themselves parts of themselves that they don't want to admit don't want

94
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,320
to accept they want to push away they want to deny they're angry at hostile even towards part of who they

95
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:58,320
are and uh and don't even want to talk to those parts or relate to them

96
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,480
maybe because they we grew up and thinking we're always supposed to be strong and so there's parts of us that are weak

97
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,560
maybe it's because uh parts of ourselves uh uh is uh

98
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:18,000
you know is uh afraid and we're we don't wanna accept the part that's afraid and tender and vulnerable

99
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,279
maybe uh you know there's parts of ourselves that

100
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,880
we want to deny or we feel like is wrong or or maybe there's parts of ourselves that

101
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,880
is that that is from which we've been hurt in the past and we don't want to ever look at that

102
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,760
again we don't want to admit that we're hurt and so sometimes there's these inner

103
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,839
wars or two sides of a person even and that so to be a witness to that war

104
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,440
to be witness to that conflict sometimes uh

105
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,600
it's uh you know just it's not so much like we're split but sometimes it's just like you know we're horrified or upset

106
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:06,160
or embarrassed by parts of who we are in this mindfulness practice we're

107
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:12,240
trying to show up to be a witness and be honest oh this is this is a truth

108
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:20,000
there's inner conflict there's inner challenge of who i am i'm not kind and calm and reflective

109
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,920
about what's happening for me i'm actually trying to avoid it or trying to push it

110
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:32,079
away or repress it or deny it and uh

111
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:40,000
and you know it's certainly not something i would admit to other people so we sit in meditation to be a witness

112
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,079
the good the bad and the ugly to really see and it can be hard to to

113
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,920
to accept the possibility of just witnessing because we're supposed to fix we're supposed to

114
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,680
be different we can't we can't just if we if we just witness it it's like that means i have to admit it or i'm making

115
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,880
room for what shouldn't be but slowly we're learning

116
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,000
to discover to trust that it's it's actually quite powerful and useful to be

117
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:15,200
a witness to see the truth witness to the truth though this is what's happening

118
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:22,800
and learn to overcome or to recognize all the ways in which we avoid the truth

119
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,839
so that we can become a witness of the truth those don't things don't get in the way

120
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:37,200
and then there's healing what needs to be healed so sometimes this divides within us

121
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,880
it's not so much a matter of making what making what we don't like about ourselves to go away

122
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,880
but when there's a war divide or split within us is to heal that

123
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,320
bring bring bring together bring and bring into our hearts in a deep way

124
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:01,839
the things about ourselves that are difficult and challenging to hold it kindly to open to it

125
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:08,320
the heart that knows what to do the heart the inner life knows how to

126
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:15,040
unfold and heal itself if we create the conditions for it to heal

127
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:21,440
or we break the conditions that help it heal we bring kindness and compassion and love

128
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:30,160
we bring honesty honesty is powerful just more truth and really really say it

129
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:37,279
we bring uh making amends sometimes we have to kind

130
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:43,600
of do something only by doing not just the meditation sometimes by doing it does something have a chance to

131
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:50,079
be healed maybe we have to apologize to people maybe we need to

132
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,240
engage in the world in a way that informs the heart

133
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,639
that there's a new we're under new management so something can begin to relax and just

134
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:08,880
heal sometimes there has to be expressions of gratitude

135
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,240
for what was there's a beautiful powerful for me story

136
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,560
i've told this many times now i'd like to tell it again when i was a growing up

137
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:27,040
in los angeles we get the los angeles times and periodically in the 1960s there would be

138
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:33,040
this little article in the newspaper about uh japanese soldiers from world war ii

139
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,959
who were still fighting world war ii uh in 1960s because they had been sent into the

140
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:44,959
jungles in the philippines by their commanders to be kind of guerrilla fighters or something and so they were told to stay in there

141
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:50,240
and fight the war until we come and get you the war ended but they weren't no one

142
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,279
came to get them and so they continued living there dutifully

143
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,959
and they were stealing chickens from local farmers somehow they managed to make do for so i think the last one was

144
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:06,079
like 25 years later and uh and

145
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:11,120
so then they were found and then brought back to japan

146
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,720
the story that i've been told about how they were brought back to japan that's what's so significant

147
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,120
is that uh the japanese would bring out a very senior military officer still alive from

148
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,399
world war ii who'd put on his best uniform and maybe the samurai sword as

149
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:34,720
symbolic and would walk to the jungle in japanese calling out for the soldier to come out

150
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:41,680
when the soldier came out the first thing that the officer would do was to do this deep

151
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:47,680
balance that they do in japan and offer gratitude thank you for your service to

152
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:54,079
the mother country i'm here to bring you back they put them on the they go together on a boat they

153
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:59,120
had to go back to japan just before the

154
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:05,680
soldier was going to get off the boat to step onto japanese soil the officer would say again thank you so

155
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,800
much for your great service to the country and then maybe with a lower voice would say

156
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,279
and by the way the war is over

157
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:24,160
for some of us the wars we're fighting are long over they've continued from childhood

158
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,600
and what's significant about this story is the great is the gratitude

159
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,800
sometimes the wars we've been fighting the struggles we're against and the ways we're you know fighting against

160
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,079
ourselves even were ways to try to manage to survive

161
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:47,360
in a horrific issue so situations growing up and we're survived we're here and maybe

162
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,560
that was needed that's what's what that's how we managed

163
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,000
maybe there would have been better ways to do it but as a child you didn't know what it

164
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,038
was and you this is kind of kept you alive and so this idea that we have these

165
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:11,918
so-called you know unfortunate unhealthy sides of ourselves that we don't like or is difficult or embarrassing

166
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:20,400
who knows why they're there maybe they were an attempt to try to take care of ourselves at some point probably it was

167
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,880
so maybe before it can be let go or put to rest to express gratitude thank you

168
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,799
and once the thank you has happened imagine that thanking your fear or thanking your

169
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:38,000
greed or thinking your anger what a different relationship

170
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,080
appreciating that this was a attempt to try to take care of yourself

171
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:50,559
and then reminding yourself oh by the way the war is over

172
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:56,559
it's okay so that's an example of healing

173
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:05,520
and the connection between truth and healing is quite important in california now there's a council a state

174
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:12,240
age state created a council called the truth and healing council

175
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:18,320
that is a start i think i don't have started i think in the last few months that it's going to go for two years

176
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:24,640
two or three years uh just similar i think to what the truth and recon conciliation council in

177
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,480
south africa did but with the indigenous people of california the native americans

178
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,919
there's never been a time when the state with its important role

179
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:41,039
that is going to really take in the truth of what happened to the native americans in the state which was

180
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,720
horrific it was kind of genocide and uh

181
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,240
and uh and to really hear it take it in and then heal

182
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,360
it's interesting that the word is not reconciliation but healing

183
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:04,320
i'm not sure why they chose that but it's maybe he has a different does something different

184
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:10,880
and so here you know so there's now a meeting you can go to those meetings they're online and

185
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:19,679
as a state kind of gathering information hearing the truth in preparation for some kind of healing

186
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:28,399
so so if we as we learn to be a witness for the truth in ourselves

187
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,160
then there can be healing in ourselves as we learn to be a witness for

188
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,440
ourselves we can learn to be a witness for what goes on in the world

189
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,360
if we can be a witness what goes on in the world we can maybe contribute to the healing of the

190
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:51,280
world we need people to be witnesses of it so

191
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,520
you know as some of us are figuring out how much to learn about

192
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,640
what goes on in ukraine what to look at and what to take in

193
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:09,280
part of what we're doing is being a witness for it it's important that the world has witnesses for this that we

194
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:14,480
don't deny it or don't overlook it or don't go asleep

195
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,000
it's very important for people to know the truth of it

196
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,280
to bear witness because without that there can't be any healing there's not going to be any healing it's not going to be any movement in a in a good

197
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:35,158
direction at some point how much can we bear being a witness

198
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:43,519
how do we bear witness and so the best qualities of who we are are summoned in that witnessing

199
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:49,520
we don't get despair we don't despair we don't get angry we don't get you know all these other things that might get in

200
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,559
the way of a deeper full or productive healing

201
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,600
witnessing i'd like to suggest that that's one of the things we're learning through

202
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:06,559
meditation as we witness ourselves how do we witness the truth of ourselves

203
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:13,919
so that we don't succumb to more anger more conflict more fear more

204
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:19,919
hostility all these things we're more overwhelmed and so we're

205
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:26,799
developing this muscle of being a witness in ourselves we're learning about how what goes on inside of us and what gets

206
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,840
in the way and so we're ready when those when that

207
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:37,440
what happens in the world happens that we can be a witness

208
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:46,320
i think it's so important and then to liberate what needs to be liberated

209
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:53,520
so we learned how to do it in ourselves we learn where we're holding on tight where we're attached

210
00:21:53,520 --> 00:22:00,720
where we cling where we resist in some deep way where the heart is contracted or it is

211
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,640
made dense and small and we learn to open it we learn to free it

212
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,799
we learn to let go in some deep full way so there's breathing room for this heart

213
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:19,200
of ours breathing for the mind so there's space for the good qualities

214
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,400
inside of us to flow part of the paradox is that a lot of the

215
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,679
paradox it's the more

216
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:38,480
we are attached the less space there is

217
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,360
for the best qualities in us to grow and develop

218
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,880
the more we've let go of attachment the more space there is more breathing room

219
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:55,360
for the best qualities we have inside have to grow so to liberate

220
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,120
to learn to be truthful to recognize not just what wants to be

221
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:08,159
healed but a deeper place is to recognize where liberation

222
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:13,360
is to like recognize where we're stuck

223
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,280
and uh some of this more you know some of the more deeper places some are difficult

224
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:25,679
things to see because some of the most deep seated attachments we have

225
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:31,120
are not seen on the surface mind the surface of our life we have to that's one of the functions of meditation is to

226
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:37,440
really get quiet enough to see the depth of what's happening that's overshadowed by you know a lot of

227
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,000
discursive thoughts and ideas and reactivity

228
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,559
as we learn in ourselves more and more with liberation is

229
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:54,158
then we can appreciate that other people have that capacity too

230
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:01,760
and in some ways it'll break your heart even more than more than seeing war

231
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:08,159
is to see how this wonderful profound capacity of the human

232
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,760
heart gets squashed by war

233
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:20,000
gets lost in the pain and the fear and they could go on for generations

234
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,240
the effect of war now there can be some healing

235
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:32,400
but to really for people to discover the best possible form of happiness and

236
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,760
well-being that can only happen when we're free of our attachments

237
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:44,559
work and really kind of make that hard and difficult to be a witness not only for what's

238
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:51,200
difficult in the world but to be a witness for the possibility for people to be happy

239
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,840
the possibility that what's beautiful and best in them to come forth to be a witness for the capacity of

240
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:05,919
people to start becoming free both politically and you know societally

241
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:12,960
but also free in their hearts i think something in people's hearts

242
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:20,159
maybe by osmosis or subconsciously resonates when there's people who know something

243
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:29,799
about liberation and they can be a witness to that possibility capacity in our world

244
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:37,120
so to liberate what needs to be liberated in a place like ukraine

245
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,640
there's not going to be any deep or very little deep liberation of the heart

246
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,919
without supporting this country to become liberated from the oppression of russia

247
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:53,200
they're losing their freedom there and so i think that the dedication of

248
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,960
coming out of meditation is to appreciate that yes we have to kind of support these people

249
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:05,360
to become free and where all the freedom is

250
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,840
you know is it only with the russians but is there other places but to appreciate liberation

251
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:20,000
and then the fourth part of meditation is to let the best qualities of who we are come forth to grow and cultivate and

252
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,559
and expand it's remarkable what our hearts are capable of

253
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:35,120
love of all forms what a great world would be if we let all the different flavors 32 flavors of love

254
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:41,520
grow in us kindness good will

255
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:47,919
care compassion friendliness

256
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:55,440
appreciation taking delight in other people respect

257
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:04,840
you know there's all these words that i associate with love and uh to let those grow and develop

258
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:10,480
generosity wisdom peace

259
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:18,000
non-reactivity as we learn this for ourselves

260
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,760
let this grow in ourselves then we become a carrier of that into

261
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:31,679
the world and we become a you know it's kind of like contagious

262
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:38,399
and whether you have a mask on or not it's contagious the uh

263
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:45,840
and so to be able to come into the world oriented around these good qualities

264
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:52,640
if we don't do that then there's very little hope for the world we need people who are

265
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:58,399
demonstrating the possibility of meeting even the most horrific things

266
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:03,679
free of hostility free of

267
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:09,520
the greed of self-protections i'll just take care of myself and not other people

268
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:17,440
but to come with this beautiful capacity for love and care and support for others

269
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,480
to appreciate that maybe we live in this world in mutuality

270
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:30,559
cooperatively the world is a cooperative place earth nature societies

271
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:37,200
are cooperative enterprises and so how do we live cooperatively

272
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,799
how do we let the whole cooperative function well and completely what do we

273
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:51,679
contribute how do we support those of us who can the welfare and happiness of others

274
00:28:52,799 --> 00:29:00,000
so this is my attempt to say that maybe it's healthy for to have a sense

275
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,200
of uh appropriate urgency

276
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:12,559
around doing you if you're meditating already in any way anyway that's what we do

277
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:18,080
please continue but maybe you can add

278
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,679
a important rich valuable motivation and understanding

279
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:29,600
that the meditation is you're not just doing it for yourself but that

280
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,840
at the same time as you're doing this deep practice for liberation for yourself maybe

281
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:41,840
you can also do it for the welfare and happiness of the world to support this world that's also

282
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,039
challenged and there's an urgency to do that

283
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:53,919
not to put you not not not for you to hurry through your meditation because it's urgency that way but rather

284
00:29:53,919 --> 00:30:00,240
but rather not a hurry but rather to give a kind of wonderful

285
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,960
ballast or wonderful seriousness wonderful weight

286
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:16,159
to the practice so that you're like i'm going to do this this is important

287
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:23,039
and so you don't so easily wander off into daydreams or wonder often into

288
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,640
you know doing sudoku problems in your head maybe

289
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,240
but you kind of you're really there with some gravitas some sense of this is important

290
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:41,120
this is where and to meditate for the world so this way

291
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,559
we can meditate for peace

292
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:56,480
so we have a wonderful practice i hope that it will serve all of us

293
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:02,000
to be able to contribute to the welfare of this world that needs

294
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,320
a lot of help let's be the helpers for it all

295
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,679
let's help not hinder hinder what this world needs

296
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:20,880
so thank you very much and uh

297
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,559
you know the usual format has been to end at the old days 10 45 and

298
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:32,640
the youtube time ended right around now so 10 30.

299
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:39,039
so um but if some of you here and i could try to look at the chat if some of you would like to ask any

300
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:46,120
questions or make any comments you're welcome to do it

301
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,640
it's kind of nice to hear from the community now that we're together and

302
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:02,880
so you and if you could say your name when you uh

303
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,960
start then we could also get us sense richer sense of ourselves

304
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:14,519
your voice will go on youtube unless you yeah

305
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:26,159
um yeah i didn't know it was going to be on youtube but anyway um my question i'm yolanna

306
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,200
and my question is when you witness

307
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,440
the fear or the worry

308
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,159
what happened to the emotions i mean i have a lot of emotions

309
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:47,200
you just shut them down while witnessing you know the fear you

310
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:53,360
witness them you make room for them you don't act on them you don't

311
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,640
pick them up and think about them and reinforce them but that's where learning to be a

312
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:04,320
witness is you want to see at all it's almost like you can step back

313
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:12,080
and not live in the emotions not live in the thoughts but you almost like step back and see oh this is

314
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:19,519
these are emotions look at this this is chaotic this is and uh and learn the art of stepping

315
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,880
back so the seeing the witnessing

316
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,799
is not entangled in what we see

317
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:38,799
so what you're saying is witness the emotions too okay yes

318
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:45,440
thank you and uh one of the one of one of the ways of understanding it with fear

319
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:53,840
is to when we witness fear we're helping the fear feel safe

320
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,960
because fear is kind of if we're attacking fear trying to get rid of it and have some idea it shouldn't be there

321
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:09,200
and i should be better i've been meditating for years i should not supposed to have fear and this is an embarrassment to the buddhist world

322
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,800
then you know the poor fears is going to feel terrible and what we're trying to do is to help

323
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,638
just to witness it oh it's fear in a way that the fear finally feels safe

324
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:28,878
okay it can just be there it's not it fear doesn't have to be afraid

325
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:36,320
okay great thank you yes

326
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,839
hi i have a question exactly about witnessing certain

327
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:50,320
brains i would say certain experiences have created a fear-written brain

328
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,520
a fear dominated brain yes right

329
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:02,079
and in the witness scene because sometimes a fear-dominated brain

330
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:09,760
will continue to bring up again and again really fearful

331
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:16,320
experiences right and in the witnessing of that

332
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,320
i have a fear that the neurology of the fear

333
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:28,640
and the same would be with anger that ultimately the neurology

334
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,320
of witnessing and experiencing something that's coming up so quick so

335
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,680
frequently that it will amplify yeah

336
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:45,680
and i you know there i have a certain concern about that but you know there are certain brains that

337
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:52,640
are so prone to that and i'm just wondering mindfulness in that kind of context so one of the core

338
00:35:52,640 --> 00:36:00,000
principles of the dharma is to be mindful of the effect the consequence

339
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,200
of what we do so if the consequence of being a mindfulness bringing mindfulness or

340
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:11,040
bringing witnessing to our fear produces continually produces more fear

341
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,160
that that's not that is not helpful and then so that but it's useful to know

342
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:22,800
that so part of the benefit of mindfulness is see oh this is what happens when i am present for fear i

343
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:29,760
get more afraid i shut down i this stuff kind of happens so once you see that's happening

344
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,800
that is then you have the information you need which tells you i need to find a

345
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:41,200
different way and uh and so in meditation some people switch their

346
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:48,000
meditation practice to do loving kindness or compassion meditation some people find it useful to do a very

347
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,240
uh emphasize a lot of body meditation just rest in their body rather than in the

348
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,440
emotion and to find a neutral place in the body where they can kind of stay with and be

349
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,480
with some people find that uh they need to do something very different sometimes

350
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:12,480
there's you know there's there's a we have a wealth of uh of uh what's called trauma therapy now

351
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:18,480
and so which is the working was very issue that uh it's too hard for some people to

352
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,520
just be present for their own fear and a hurt and pain

353
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:29,760
and so there's all these techniques or ways of working with it indirectly or or not indirectly but

354
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,359
wisely that is not really the place not really the strength of

355
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:41,359
buddhism buddhism historically helps people a lot of

356
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:47,119
people work through trauma but more than just maybe

357
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:53,280
a lot of other things but sometimes we need extra help extra support and so specialists who know

358
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,320
about it and to find out how to work with work through it and all that is uh

359
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,760
and uh and nowadays there's a lot of things to try besides meditation when when when

360
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:10,240
the repeated contact with fear produces panic or more fear or shutting down

361
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:17,359
yeah thank you and uh and also but also sometimes one-on-one conversations with a meditation teacher

362
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:22,800
can sometimes show how mindfulness or how you know what you can do that's

363
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,000
different how to practice mindfulness differently so it can be helpful so

364
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,520
you know so it's all these things are possible but this answer your question

365
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:38,560
yes i my intention was to bring up this to the light in the in today

366
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,720
in today's talk yeah thank you

367
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:51,280
hi my name is molly um i have found that uh people are so vocal

368
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,560
uh about their opinions in the media and

369
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:02,160
so strong-willed that they almost make it sound like it's factual so

370
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:07,520
sometimes i feel that it's a struggle not to be judgmental

371
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:14,920
it might help for today to distinguish being judgmental from being

372
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:23,280
from being evaluative or judge judgmental versus

373
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:29,119
recognition so it's possible to recognize what someone's doing or suspect what

374
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,880
someone's doing and uh and it might be evaluative where you say well they know i don't think

375
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:42,720
this is a healthy thing for that person or for all of us and uh and that doesn't have to uh

376
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,480
be a hostile or devalue the person

377
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:55,440
or or you know push someone away

378
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,359
and so sometimes one of the reasons why the word judgment is so powerful

379
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:06,800
is that it's it's not a simple evaluation of the situation

380
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,839
it often comes with this hostility itself or this pushing way or shutting down or

381
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:16,960
creating a strong sense of other they're wrong as a person

382
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,480
so but if you want to if you stop being judgment some people think that if they stop being judgmental they're not

383
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,680
supposed to be evaluative anymore and so that just makes the whole thing

384
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:33,200
more harder so you might see if you can relax a little bit

385
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:38,880
and switch the orientation of what you're doing to being evaluative

386
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:45,520
to recognize and evaluate what's going on and see if that takes the sting out of it

387
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,520
so behind you i'm

388
00:40:53,520 --> 00:41:00,079
hi my name is grace i just want to say that yeah i really appreciate it there's a question louder please because my

389
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:06,160
hearing turn it back on oh okay my name's grace i just want to say that i really

390
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:12,640
appreciate how you point out it's all starting with end trying to work on internal healing

391
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:19,520
and that's how we can relate to things differently so that's really really um eye-opening

392
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,560
and profound for me thank you wonderful thank you i appreciate that

393
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:35,480
you know one of the motivations i have for being a buddhist teacher is is to contribute to a better world

394
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:41,200
but i have a strong belief that this practice does that hi

395
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:46,240
i'm gaurav thanks for the talk and meditation

396
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:53,520
one of the things that came up in my mind about witnessing was like i have this mistrust of the media

397
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,800
and that's how we how i witness what's going on in the world

398
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,920
so there was a conflict there like how do i witness when

399
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:11,200
media has an incentive to manipulate my emotions yeah this is a really important question

400
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:17,839
so how do we become wise consumers of the news

401
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:23,359
so i think one of them is to ask yourself the news that you are listening to

402
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:28,839
can you figure out find out what their bias is and recognize sometimes it's very

403
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:35,200
clear and uh and then when you're when you're reading it you're looking at it you remember that and you say well i should be

404
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:41,839
careful here to how they're doing it the other is to uh is to look for

405
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:48,000
sources that maybe don't express as obviously bias there may be more neutral

406
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:55,760
there's a website called i think it's called all sides maybe allsides.com maybe or outside something

407
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:03,200
and uh and it's uh they'll have lined up three columns one newspaper that's uh has news from

408
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:09,119
the the right political right the other one another column on the

409
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:15,440
other side has political left and then the middle is some news that they value it as more

410
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,880
middle and sometimes it's fascinating to read news from all three

411
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:28,560
because then you get a sense of the range and it's clear how people are biased if you see that way

412
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:34,480
another thing that i like to do is i learned this many years ago when i was living at the monastery

413
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:41,359
in the 1980s that we were deep in the mountains and uh the

414
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:48,640
newspaper would come in uh maybe once a week or something so then the new uh almost always the news

415
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:54,079
was old in the newspaper and uh and i learned it was really

416
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:59,200
eye-opening to see when i was reading news that was two three four days old

417
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:05,920
that my my body my mind my heart would not

418
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:11,599
get excited would not get alarmed the way it did when i thought the news

419
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:17,440
was fresh is and so you might try reading the news late

420
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,359
you know or read in a weekly magazines or monthly magazines that to talk about the same

421
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:29,359
thing you know you don't have to be right on top current by the day

422
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:35,760
and uh maybe just read the headlines currently and then but to go deeper maybe you could do it

423
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,880
something is you know what a little bit older just because then you then you also have

424
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:47,119
you yourself will be able to pick up more not be as reactive to the bias or what goes on

425
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:52,160
and then a neutral source that i've i've i've enjoyed doing sometimes

426
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:58,480
is sometimes i go on wikipedia and read about the particular news event in wikipedia

427
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,800
and it's kind of like an encyclopedic entry and i'm sure it's biased there too

428
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,560
but it's it doesn't have the charge and not not written with the the

429
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:16,480
the kind of the charge of popular news where they're trying to get kept your attention and really kind of keeping you

430
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:22,560
there with the news and the writing is a different style it's like an encyclopedic okay so okay okay okay it's

431
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:28,800
kind of a matter of effect and it tends to be broader and simpler and does so i find that sometimes very

432
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,839
helpful for me to go check there so is this give you some ideas

433
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:40,400
it's it's a really important topic you bring up so it's becoming being wise and how we relate to the news is

434
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,680
important part of this and so one of the things to do in terms

435
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:50,800
of whitney being a witness is to be a witness of how that how your

436
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:57,040
reaction is to the news and uh and that's really important

437
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:04,160
can you not getting can the best of you come out rather than the worse than you when you read the news

438
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:11,280
okay well thank you and uh very much and uh

439
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:18,440
may you be a peacemaker within and without
