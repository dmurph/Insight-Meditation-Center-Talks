1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:08,559
lot of people from the West Coast here the west coast of this

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,360
continent yeah but all over nice to see everyone

3
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:21,359
welcome welcome and

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:27,560
uh yeah we'll continue today with an

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,640
exploration of what are known as the five faculties five spiritual faculties

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:40,000
what I've been calling five Divine human capacities I was just reflecting as I

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,280
sort of watched people come in for the chat just how remarkable it is that

8
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,320
these the ability to be awake in the world is something we're all we're all

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,680
born with um we don't have to go acquiring anything or looking

10
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:05,000
outside we we we look Inward and there we can find

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,640
the capacity to to awaken so the second spiritual faculty

12
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,720
is energy viia and the there's times when it seems like

13
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:25,000
the whole path of practice is about finding an appropriate a skillful balance of

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,799
energy and in the guided sit we'll kind of bring some attention

15
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:38,960
to noticing this balance establishing balance rebalancing and then in the daret we'll

16
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:46,200
we'll dig a Little Deeper to look into three aspects of the energy that we can call upon to

17
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:53,399
strengthen our practice support our practice so let's

18
00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:01,079
sit as uh I've been doing I'll guide I hope just just lightly enough to sort of

19
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:07,520
bring people bring people some some

20
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:13,920
support so we can find our meditation posture find ourselves into it maybe

21
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:22,720
make some adjustments to the posture and as we do so we we balance

22
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,680
our energies the first thing we do I think is sort of notice where the energy

23
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:35,400
is and and as we close the eyes or bring the eyes down or unfocus the eyes if we

24
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:44,760
keep them open focusing them in the middle distance we can notice a

25
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:53,680
rebalancing we move from the visual

26
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:01,440
attractions of our experience to the inner inner World our inner life

27
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,599
and typically we rebalance a little bit from the head to the heart or the head to the body bringing our attention

28
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:15,599
Inward and downward into the body and then we connect with some

29
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:22,120
aspect of the bily experience in which there's Natural Balance the breath

30
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:29,280
being a typical go-to the breath just doing its thing

31
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,920
finding it's Natural Balance and maybe we can just notice

32
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,799
this morning or this afternoon this moment at any rate how

33
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:49,319
the breath is maybe it's a little quicker maybe it's a little slower maybe it's shallow

34
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:55,280
maybe it's deep maybe as we bring attention to it

35
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,719
it shifts toward a more relaxed state

36
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:13,599
in all of these ways we establish a balance of energy between effort and

37
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,759
allowing and if we notice that we get a little drowsy a little

38
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:31,479
dreamy we can in various ways add a little more effort a little

39
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:35,919
more alertness a little bit more

40
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:47,520
energy and if we notice ourselves getting kind of caught up in the mind maybe wrapped around a thought

41
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:56,199
pattern typically we'll notice that that involves a quickening and a tightening and sometimes a subtle or

42
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:01,639
obvious sensation of being a little off balance off kill

43
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:10,560
and in that case we can maybe take away a little energy open up a bit soften a

44
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,639
bit maybe softening the body letting the shoulders L lower back

45
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,720
down relaxing any tension around the eyes

46
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,880
noticing any holding or bracing in the upper body or in the

47
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,479
jaw and in this way

48
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,720
rebalancing as in riding a bicycle pushing a scooter flying a kite sailing

49
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:49,240
a boat walking we never just establish balance

50
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,880
and then it's fixed it's a practice of always

51
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,000
rebalancing coming back to balance

52
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,240
so as we sit and the mind gets entangled in things looking into the

53
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,400
future considering reconsidering replaying the

54
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:24,039
past thinking about other people thinking about ourselves as we bring our attention back

55
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:30,520
to the breath as we open our attention maybe back if it's become tight around ideas and thoughts

56
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:37,400
opening it back up to the breath opening up to all that's available and

57
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,919
experience we can be aware today of the rebalancing that

58
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:50,720
happens finding again our way back to a place of balance between alertness and

59
00:06:50,720 --> 00:07:00,599
being at ease between the effort that's needed to

60
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:08,199
maintain attentiveness Attunement and the ease

61
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:12,160
that is Central to the

62
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
practice

63
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440

e e

101
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:34,520
so coming to the end of this said noticing where the energy

102
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:42,240
is and once again reestablishing

103
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:49,200
balance between alertness and ease if we've gotten a little dreamy a

104
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:55,679
little foggy a little unfocused we can add a little Spritz of attention of

105
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,919
Attunement and if we've gotten a little tight and

106
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:07,760
over over efforting we can relax back

107
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:13,279
into a more skillful balance between alertness

108
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,279
and

109
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:27,279
relaxation let's bring the sit to a close by sharing the benefits of our practice

110
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:32,880
which some sometimes we hold a little close sharing the benefits of our

111
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,399
practice with

112
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:45,919
others when we give freely of the benefits of practice it doesn't diminish the

113
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,080
store seems to increase the

114
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:59,080
goodness so wishing all beings well wishing all beings

115
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:05,480
safety security good health wholeness in body and

116
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:10,000
mind wishing all beings

117
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:19,880
Freedom wishing all beings freedom from suffering may all beings be content know

118
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:25,880
happiness and live at ease

119
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:47,440
[Music]

120
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,080
welcome again

121
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:08,200
somebody has added to the chat love the silence and it made me hesitant to break

122
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:14,159
the silence to to say

123
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:21,039
anything it was indeed for me as well kind of a nice

124
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:27,240
quiet quiet time so this week I've been revisiting

125
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:33,320
the five faculty IES I I uh again I'm certain I I know for absolute certainty

126
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:39,320
that Gil has talked about the five faculties and I think he's spoken at

127
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:46,080
length about the second one which we'll just explore just a little bit today energy

128
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:52,480
Ria the uh the way we bring energy to practice and the various aspects of

129
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:58,039
energy that are available to us and again I would emphasize before plunging

130
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:03,200
into a little discussion of this second faculty this

131
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:10,080
second uh competency or or quality of mind or

132
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:17,760
capacity that all of these things are found within and uh something just strikes me

133
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,760
as very wonderful about that today that the capacity to awaken is is

134
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:30,399
within don't have to go looking for something outside and maybe that's an important aspect of

135
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:36,679
effort we we expend or energy we expend so much effort trying to get things

136
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:42,639
trying to acquire things trying to and this is true I think for Spiritual Goods

137
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:49,279
as well that we we put a lot of effort in and so how we use the energy we have

138
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:54,480
and particularly how we balance it is a is a critical part of the of the

139
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,320
practice and an important support for practice so let me just

140
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:07,679
mention three aspects of energy that we're all probably aware of but by

141
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:13,200
spending a little time thinking about them and perhaps more consciously

142
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,720
bringing them uh into practice noticing their role in practice we strengthen

143
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:25,159
them and I'll emphasize that too that sometimes the mechanism of the practice

144
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:31,639
can be a little unclear uh what what what is it that we do when we bring attention to things when we're mindful

145
00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:38,360
of things when we in the case of energy seek to establish a sustained sustained

146
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:44,559
mindful attention to our experience one of the very important thing that's that's going on when we do

147
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:50,760
that is that it's by bringing attention to those things that we strengthen them

148
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,960
this is true of bad habits of mind or unskillful habits of mind and UNH

149
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:03,039
wholesome mind States as well that when we give attention to them they're

150
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:09,919
strengthened and um over time in the practice we seek to balance and increase

151
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:16,200
the increase the attention we give to Wholesome States skillful

152
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:21,880
actions knowing that as we do so that those capacities are

153
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:27,360
strengthened so a first a first really important

154
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:36,519
aspect of energy is what we can call uh initial energy and obviously

155
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:41,639
maybe most obviously there's a there's quite a bit of energy and skillful

156
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:49,679
effort that's needed just to begin practicing this is true dayto day sometimes it takes a lot of a lot of uh

157
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:56,039
a lot of energy just to sit just to get make that time and uh get to the get to

158
00:33:56,039 --> 00:34:02,760
the cushion and once we're sitting it can take

159
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:10,398
additional energy to keep bringing attention back to um back to back to the Here and Now

160
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:17,878
of our experience and maybe for each of these we can emphasize a particular aspect of

161
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:24,599
energy for the for the energy needed to

162
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:30,760
said um sometimes it's useful to uh in

163
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:39,118
in terms of bringing the energy to a place of balance to start to think about the sit maybe 10 minutes before it

164
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:44,480
starts and start to um start to bring

165
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,480
the energy down to a place where it's easier to sit you've probably noticed that if you're rushing around doing

166
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,960
things I'm going to sit at 7 a.m. with Gil or David this week y last week and

167
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:01,400
you're rushing around getting a bunch of stuff out out of the way so that you can actually make the sit at 7 and if you

168
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:07,680
you know if it doesn't happen right on time maybe you can get there by 7:30 that creates a certain certain

169
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:13,359
energetic uh imbalance that can be addressed by starting to practice maybe

170
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:20,040
15 minutes before you sit down starting to uh starting to let a little bit of

171
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:26,200
that energy go and so by the time the butt hits the cushion there's already

172
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:31,359
there's already a rebalancing happening and then within the

173
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:37,480
practice the um the the the this this kind of energy this initial energy

174
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:43,720
that's needed shows up in that this commitment to begin again when we return

175
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:50,400
to the breath when we've gotten knocked off the breath you know or when the mind's gotten all tied around something

176
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,079
we can spend a lot of energy beating ourselves up about that it shouldn't have happened I'm not it's not working

177
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:03,440
and it's not happening today I'm no good at this this practice isn't any good any of those kinds of doubts that arise can

178
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,599
be addressed by which doubts which by the way take a lot of energy away from

179
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:16,200
just getting back to Here and Now that can be addressed by just beginning again we begin again and again

180
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:23,280
new in this in this practice and it's true each time we sit down that we can

181
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:29,720
balance energy by thinking a little bit be kind of bringing the Mind into mod where this is the first time I've ever

182
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:35,000
sat in meditation similarly each time we go back to the breath it is in fact the

183
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,640
first time we've returned and met this breath this moment of experience and to the extent we can just begin again

184
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:47,480
without any baggage about anything that's just happened anything that might

185
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,880
happen what other people might think what we think letting all of that go and

186
00:36:52,880 --> 00:37:00,800
just beginning again is an important aspect of this initial the initial um or initiating

187
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,240
energy that we bring to

188
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:12,920
practice so a second type of energy I'm only going to mention three three is a good number easy to

189
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:18,800
keep track of um time constraints but also the constraints of mind and

190
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,200
attention so initial energy and then continuous

191
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:30,760
energy the uh the wellness known translator of many of the ancient texts

192
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:37,920
that underg this tradition biku Bodi uh says somewhere you know this

193
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,920
practice is very straightforward there's really only two two steps one begin and

194
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:50,880
two keep going makes it sound very straightforward but this keeping going

195
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:57,520
part you know initial energy maybe is this taking that first step sitting down preparing the mind to do so and then

196
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:03,319
each time we return to Here and Now beginning again the the second the

197
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:11,760
keeping going part the sort of energy that is more sustained over time is um

198
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,960
is super important and I think it's where the faculty we talked about yesterday the confidence that comes from

199
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:24,319
meeting our direct experiencing knowing that this is true for for this moment that this is happening that it's like

200
00:38:24,319 --> 00:38:31,640
this in my mind bringing that confidence um forward in a sustained way provides this sort of

201
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:38,440
energy of return so that each time we REM we come back to this moment we're

202
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:44,960
able to um do so in a way that creates momentum if you think about it

203
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,160
rebalancing energy on a bicycle on a scooter flying a kite walking sailing a

204
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:56,520
boat whatever metaphor uh is is useful in your life um whenever we rebalance

205
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:03,680
we're also taking advantage of the momentum that's there this is true on a bicycle it's true on a scooter sailboat

206
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,800
walking that we're not just in Walking for example which vast majority of us do

207
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:18,240
with some facility we're not just uh balancing in a particular in a um three

208
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:26,480
what would it be three-dimensional space we're actually also moving forward and creating momentum as we go so this the

209
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:33,359
second kind of energy is that is that way of balancing energy that creates momentum in the

210
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:39,480
practice and this is a lot of the rebalancing that I mentioned in the guided meditation where we're constantly

211
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:46,280
sort of noticing oh getting a little foggy here or getting a little tight and doing whatever it takes we get very it

212
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:51,880
becomes very second nature to go oh I need to ease back this way sometimes it's physical it's in the posture the

213
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:57,000
shoulders have gotten hunched up around the ears sometimes I'm like I become aware that I don't think it really looks

214
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,280
like this when I'm sitting but basically in my body my shoulders are up around my

215
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:07,800
ears and I can simply on an usually on an out breath just notice and without

216
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:18,640
doing very much the shoulders go back down and the the momentum and the sustained balance of energy is is re re

217
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:25,160
recreated this sustained sort of effort or energy is is

218
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:31,640
attracts all sorts of wholesome Minds States the ability that we the capacity

219
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:37,520
we begin to develop of bringing mindfulness to everything is sort of it's it's an outgrowth of this ability

220
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:43,200
in the meditation to keep sustaining that momentum so that when we meet a new

221
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:49,079
situation um and in the meditation it may be a snippet of conversation a door

222
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:55,040
slamming a disturbing thought a memory we get we get better and better at sort

223
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:01,119
of just coming back to to balance and similarly in daily life practice when

224
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:09,079
you know an energetic conversation happens at work at home something comes up something happens while we're heading

225
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:17,440
to IMC on the 101 for those of you in the in the immediate geography around

226
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,960
IMC we have a way to just kind of keep keep sustaining that sense of balance

227
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:29,720
without getting thrown off so this is the kind of sustained

228
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:36,640
attention or balance of energy that allows us to stay here to stay

229
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:43,319
open to remain receptive to what's going on in experience to continue to be

230
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:52,720
connected to our experience um to be very much um a

231
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,839
member of this moment you know a member of the community of of this moment

232
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:04,319
instead of kind of floating off into other other moments the past the

233
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:09,440
future and like I emphasized yesterday this sustained kind of energy is very

234
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:15,079
pleasant very pleasurable and that is to be enjoyed because it helps it helps

235
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:21,760
further strengthen our ability to get back here we know something very um that

236
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:30,119
builds confidence we know when we come back to this feeling of restfulness and ease that this is good and that that

237
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:37,119
helps us drawing on that confidence that comes with it it actually also helps strengthen the balancing and rebalancing

238
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:44,839
of energy we go oh this is right now now I'm back here now I'm back here in the center of things because I can feel it

239
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:52,480
now I'm more more at ease but also very much here very present very

240
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:59,680
alert um finally at least for today because one could go

241
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,880
on and on the third the third aspect is um

242
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:12,480
something that you we might call effortless effort we get to a place where the energy hardly needs attention

243
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,960
and we really get in a flow of it the kind of flow that maybe we associate

244
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:24,359
with playing a musical instrument if we play one or being engaged in a hobby

245
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:30,680
where we lose track in a way of things like time and the self very profound actually

246
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:38,920
those flow states in the meditation we actually can harness that sense of effortless energy to really be very

247
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:47,280
easeful around things like time the constraints of the past and future or around self all the baggage and the ways

248
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:53,200
we the energy we expend and possibly waste to some extent defending the self

249
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,280
aggrandizing the self creating new selves all of which are useful or not

250
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:03,599
all of which all of which are um have their let me put it this way some of

251
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:11,319
which have their place some of which are skillful but all of which have stress in them all those all those identities we

252
00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:17,000
create and use

253
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:26,559
um each of these three in the final minute each of these three forms of

254
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:32,079
energy ways of thinking about the capacity that we have to to to bring

255
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:39,280
balanced energy to our practice involves some letting go and I just mentioned that in the case of the third one but to

256
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:45,200
review them in this way that first one that initial sitting down and then in as

257
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:51,880
we meditate beginning again and again has this letting go of it in terms of

258
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:58,079
sitting down just letting go of other activities but also letting go of

259
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,400
our sense of um preference or judgment coming back to the present moment

260
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:10,319
without any sense of having done anything wrong or anything having gone wrong we're letting go of a certain

261
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:15,960
something important there with the continuous or sustained energy we're

262
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:24,200
letting go of a lot of preoccupation with things a lot of worry about about things where we're just um floating back

263
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:31,040
to Here and Now keeping connecting with it uh in a way that's sustained constant

264
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:38,280
quite soft and then third this idea of effortless effort or energy that's

265
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:45,440
extremely well balanced that here there's a lot of letting go around things like self and holding on to

266
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:51,920
things attachment uh even if it's momentary even if it's brief it's extremely

267
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,400
easeful and restful for the Mind these these small moments of freedom from

268
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:06,920
attachment freedom from suffering freedom from holding on so these each of these five faculties

269
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:12,880
and this one in particular today has within it the seeds of freedom and when

270
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:21,000
we connect with it when we bring our attention to it when we notice the balancing when we're um explicitly and

271
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:27,480
consciously aware of the energy we're actually bringing our attention to the letting go that happen happens in the

272
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:33,559
practice too so it's not just something we're trying to build to strengthen but also

273
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:39,599
something that has within it the um the the teachings of the Buddha around

274
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:44,880
letting go and being present for the letting go of suffering in

275
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:53,839
particular so that's it for today tomorrow we'll talk about the third faculty third divinely human faculty as

276
00:46:53,839 --> 00:47:00,800
I'm calling it that of mindfulness you may have heard of mindfulness um and yet we'll we'll we'll

277
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:06,040
take a look at some because everybody's heard of mindfulness I'm going to kind

278
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:11,240
to take a look at some different less thoughtabout less considered forms of

279
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:16,760
this very important faculty which lies in the middle uh of these five for good

280
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:22,559
reason it's the fulcrum it's the center point it's the point of balance um so

281
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:28,040
look forward to looking into that with you tomorrow take care everyone today take take care of one another take care

282
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:33,880
of yourselves and see you tomorrow bye
