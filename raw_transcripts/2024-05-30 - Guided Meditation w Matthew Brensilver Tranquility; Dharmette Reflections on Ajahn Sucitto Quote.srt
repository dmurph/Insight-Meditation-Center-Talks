1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:11,480
okay uh welcome uh welcome folks yeah nice to uh nice to be with

2
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:17,439
you ah very sweet

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,640
okay um all right let um let's uh let's

4
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:39,760
sit following the cicada thread but uh we should

5
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,520
meditate um

6
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,280
so yeah let's uh let's just see what happens here let's um find a posture

7
00:00:52,280 --> 00:01:00,640
that feels uh like the appropriate balance of uh alertness and

8
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,640
relaxation

9
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:51,040
so in uh the Dharma we

10
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,759
uh we calm down nurture

11
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,840
Tranquility just to enjoy tranquility

12
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:16,200
but Tranquility is also associated with Clarity clarifying our inner

13
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:25,000
landscape there's so much happening so much of the

14
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:33,560
time it's very easy to lose the

15
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:46,159
plot and so part of why we nurture a factor of

16
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,040
Tranquility is so things

17
00:02:53,159 --> 00:03:01,720
can slow down enough in the field of perception things can slow down enough

18
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,159
that we can perceive more clearly

19
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:39,560
maybe you're tired already long day long

20
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,519
week so there may be some measure of Tranquility built

21
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,720
in but ad that fatigue sometimes there's another

22
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,480
layer of

23
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:18,280
overstimulation and so this is a kind of form of awake rest

24
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:37,039
maybe you elongate the inhalation and the

25
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:45,759
exhale just a few beats more for the in breath and the out

26
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,680
breath e

27
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,639
maybe you sensing to see is there something in you that's it's

28
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:07,080
already deeply resting tranquil

29
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:57,240
letting tension drain with each breath letting tension

30
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:05,720
drain down into the center of the Earth

31
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:04,000
do what we can to breathe

32
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,360
into or

33
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,599
clinging the energy of of grasping of aversion of

34
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:24,120
control it's this sort of epitome of non tranquility

35
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:43,399
and there's no sin here this is what the Mind Body

36
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:55,080
does we breathe into the clinging

37
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,279
and soften

38
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
widen

39
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
e

40
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

41
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,279
e e

42
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:52,240
maybe your body's a resource here you just take your cues from that

43
00:11:52,240 --> 00:12:00,160
which is already resting in your body

44
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:09,800
some zone of sensation feels like a nectar settling

45
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:16,480
to a bottom of a glass of of juice tnan

46
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,079
said maybe you anchor to

47
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:37,279
silence the sound of a

48
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:48,880
silence or distant sounds sounds as they fade out

49
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:13,839
there's really a sense not of

50
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:20,040
inferring Silence from the absence of sound but

51
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:25,000
hearing silence itself

52
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:42,839
doesn't have to be silent all around you maybe there's a

53
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,680
sound to your right but if you listen to

54
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:56,839
the space on the left you hear silence

55
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:27,519
maybe you just take your cues from the

56
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
silence

57
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

58
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

59
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,959
e e

60
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:37,160
Mother Teresa described prayer

61
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:44,759
as silently listening to God God silently listening to

62
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:04,720
her you don't have to believe in God to listen like

63
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
that

64
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

65
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,760
e e

66
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,240
your body

67
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:20,200
soundscape the visual field even with the eyes

68
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,720
closed my gaze in a very gentle relaxed

69
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,158
way Darkness brightness behind the closed

70
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:57,919
eyes there may be images flashing by images of your own

71
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:05,000
body IM of this the device image of

72
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:15,679
me just kind of gently gaze through that into the

73
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,320
darkness of the mental

74
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,280
screen we rest our visual tension

75
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,280
there take our from the

76
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
darkness

77
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

78
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520

79
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520

e e

82
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,760
back to

83
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:39,679
it but not

84
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
now

85
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

86
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,200
e e

87
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,159
for

88
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:56,399
okay so uh thank you um it's good to sit with

89
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:02,159
you is a quote from uh aent suito saw

90
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:08,519
recently and thought to uh to uh to share it and and just say a

91
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:16,440
few words about it so uh said

92
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:24,080
um generosity is about sharing and not just in material terms it's an attitude

93
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,159
to life it's a response to the interrelatedness that is the basis of all

94
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:35,480
life most importantly you share dhma by advice and by

95
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:41,039
example aiming one's concern and goodwi for the welfare of others as much as for

96
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:48,799
oneself helps shift the self view to one in line with codependent

97
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:54,600
arising action based on the that view of interdependence generates a shared

98
00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:01,399
blessing The Giver feels joy and the receiver feels feels the effects of kindness everyone

99
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:07,760
gains morality leads to self-respect and the trust of people around you

100
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,200
renunciation draws you out of the grip of the materialist energies that control much of

101
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,880
society discernment cuts through the blur of feelings to tell you cooly and

102
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,320
clearly what qualities are skillful and what aren't at this moment such

103
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:30,880
discernment is required to Steward and moderate energy so that it isn't frittered away on the

104
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:36,760
one hand or strained on the other the result is Right

105
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:43,640
persistence and that brings around patience to not rush to allow things to

106
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:50,240
move at a harmonious rate and to bear with the tangle of Social and personal

107
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:57,360
conundrums that we Face patience is great for willful got

108
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:06,440
to get it done mindsets there's a whole life of cultivation in this param me

109
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:15,080
alone so um yeah John packed a lot into

110
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:22,679
that so generosity is about about sharing

111
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:28,440
generosity is about sharing our depth of dependence is

112
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:35,440
invisible most of the time like possible to fantasize about being an island most

113
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,480
of the time an interdependence is an

114
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:47,880
insight and then it's everywhere I remember uh Jack cornfield

115
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:54,080
telling a story of a yogi who I think struggled with generosity some kind of

116
00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:01,639
you know miserliness whatever holding and uh the instruction was just

117
00:32:01,639 --> 00:32:09,240
uh to pass a ball from one hand to his other from his right to his left and

118
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:14,799
back that was the first lesson on uh on

119
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:22,039
generosity relations are are the basis of life everything belongs to everything

120
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:31,919
else and in a sense generosity is just like our attempt to tip or cap to the

121
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:39,159
universe thank you and one aspect of course is sharing

122
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:46,760
sharing the the the the Dharma dma as a said sometimes by advice but mostly by

123
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:52,480
example most people really if you haven't gleaned this yet most people

124
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,679
don't really want to hear about Buddhism

125
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:07,279
but they do want to taste the Dharma and in a way you must tellor it

126
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:15,799
for them wisdom wisdom is always wisdom for this moment for this person this

127
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:23,720
time and our advice needs to reflect the kind of

128
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:31,000
uh landscape of their heart Our advice is informed by our own

129
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:37,639
very deep understanding of of the architecture of of uh the

130
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:45,559
human nervous system of our nervous system that um we learn a lot about

131
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:51,480
that right we don't have to know neurophysiology or something to know a

132
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:57,960
lot about how this body mind works

133
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:04,000
and we don't give advice to consolidate our faith in practice we're not speaking

134
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,520
as a way of affirming what we are already committed to we're unattached to

135
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:17,280
view there may be Faith but we're unattached to view and most of the time the generosity

136
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,720
is not in Sharing advice or something right it's our our

137
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:29,480
evangelism comes in the form of our example our life

138
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:36,079
and when someone you know when someone sees a deep habit shift in you even if

139
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:43,440
it shifted just a little bit that's prompts some

140
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:52,000
curiosity we all know how hard it is to change you know just how hard it is to

141
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,960
move and grow from those habits that are carved seemingly in ground plan

142
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:05,400
it and when you see it when you see someone making a move you got to wonder

143
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,359
like what's this person

144
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:17,359
doing so it's my life it's my life I must tend

145
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:25,880
to it with more energy than yours but how much more what level of privileging of my own

146
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:32,599
happiness above that of others is ethically defensible that's that the heart of

147
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:38,119
Ethics aent says action based on the view of

148
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:42,160
interdependence generates a shared

149
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:49,400
blessing last uh last year I remember reading it sort of got a lot of press

150
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:57,119
and so a research on on on um random acts of kindness generosity you know

151
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:04,760
like where they did experiments you know it' be like they would assign people in the uh experiment to like at an ice

152
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:10,640
skating rink I think as I remember like go give this go give this random person

153
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:16,599
a cup of hot chocolate you know and uh and then they would like assess okay how

154
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:24,520
did The Giver feel how did the rece recipient feel right they both felt maybe unsurprisingly really good and The

155
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:33,160
Giver systematically underestimated how good the recipient would feel you know and

156
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:39,920
part of why was that the giver kind of focused on the value of the gift rather

157
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:46,960
than the value of the warmth the aect the connection The Tipping the cap to

158
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:53,560
interdependence right and I I was kind of um yeah touched by that that finding

159
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:59,640
and it resonated because I know I know if a re SE Archer told me to go give a

160
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:05,440
hot chocolate to some random person at an ice skating rink I would

161
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:11,880
be there that my shame would come out it' be sort of bashful and you know like

162
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:17,560
you know I don't know what I would think but it would be something like um here it is here's here's the hot chocolate

163
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:25,720
I'm I'm sorry it's not a ventti you know or something that would be like the vibe for me right but I know at the same time

164
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:30,800
if I were skating if I could skate if I were skating and somebody gave me a hot

165
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:38,280
chocolate I would like that would be like a a mark in my life probably you

166
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:45,440
know okay generosity then Aon he sort of packed a

167
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,480
lot into this quote you know it like he summarizes a lot of the

168
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:56,640
path morality leads to self-respect self-respect and the trust of others

169
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,000
it's the path of non regret it it really

170
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,000
feels bad to live out of alignment with one's own deepest values there's a kind

171
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,839
of agitation that's built into that self-doubt that's built into it a lack

172
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:19,920
of self-trust and then

173
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:25,640
renunciation uh maybe relatedly said the you know he's elsewhere said the hardest

174
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:31,680
question for a human to answer is like what's enough because you can always want

175
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:38,480
more and so we we have to get uh good at assessing the value of stuff things that

176
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:45,880
you will actually love right things you will actually love and

177
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:51,839
uh I sat a SAT a retreat with uh with aan suito and you know at the end is was

178
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:59,040
like I'd love to buy let please let me buy you something you know like I like just overflowing

179
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:06,240
with sort of gratitude and sense of debt and you know please let me let me you know I had to kind of push let me buy

180
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,720
you something I said he sort of relented he said okay duffel bag you know for

181
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:18,200
travel so I got a duffel bag in the color of uh his monastic robes you know

182
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:24,920
it's like okay I trust he will appreciate that you and we have to

183
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:31,040
discern for ourselves like is this going to work is this purchase going to work

184
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:36,960
is this hatred going to work is this clinging going to work discernment is

185
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:44,280
largely about prediction about prediction a prediction about what can work what will

186
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:50,000
work and this is important to clarify what

187
00:39:50,000 --> 00:40:00,720
might work you know uh because if we don't we Fritter away our energy on uh

188
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:06,480
what is not meaningful and is sort of amazing and

189
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:13,640
tragic sometimes just to see people investing in huge projects

190
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:20,200
that I kind of know cannot work out for their heart even if they get exactly

191
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:26,280
what they think they want it cannot work out for their heart but there's this sense of like

192
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:32,920
they can't imagine what else to do what else might be satiating for the heart

193
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,520
and so you just keep doubling

194
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:46,880
down persistence is the the steadiness of our energy you know

195
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:53,319
um the uh Dharma Dharma cultivation is very

196
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:59,240
much about steadiness it's not about these kind of peak moments of intensity

197
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:04,960
where it's like okay I'm going all in on this that or the other like those can be

198
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,240
meaningful but it's more like the steadiness of our intentional stance is

199
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:16,000
what is associated with deepening and the path with sustained behavioral

200
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,079
change the steadiness just nursing this

201
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:29,240
intention day after day week after week year after year

202
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:36,040
and that involves patience which is not my favorite part ofy not you

203
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:42,760
know um but it's really Central to the path

204
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:48,079
patience patience

205
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:56,960
the we can practice deeply we can there can be some Vaga sense of like deep

206
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:05,480
practice practice commitment and patience you know they can go

207
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:13,839
together and the Long View informs the nearer term uh we can discern what's

208
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:20,000
what's urgent what's not and this patience helps us bear with

209
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,400
the tangle of conundrums we face and that is not like a

210
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:33,359
rationalization of apathy or disengagement you know it's more like a

211
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:40,359
way of probing like where can my energy be

212
00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:47,960
effective how do I spend my love well how do I suffer

213
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:57,880
efficiently elsewhere aan said um something like if I'm getting everything

214
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:03,559
done I'm not getting anything done

215
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:08,720
the the exacy of the

216
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:15,359
checklist sometimes so patience about uh waiting

217
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:21,280
for the ripness of conditions the ripness of

218
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:29,119
conditions it's a kind of uh Exquisite sense of of

219
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:37,760
timing and we um we come to discern something sort of

220
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:43,839
like like the deeper architecture of causality is not on the surface we're

221
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:53,400
like perceiving forces intuiting forces in a in a in ourselves in a

222
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:58,400
relationship in a in an organization

223
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:05,240
perceiving something deeper about causality and we detect this and

224
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:12,200
we uh we have a better sense of when it's ripe to make a

225
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:19,319
move when is it uh a stretch but not exactly a leap

226
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:28,160
when when are the conditions right get better and better at sensing into that that entails patience

227
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:36,079
so um in a way um yeah it summarizes a lot

228
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:44,800
of practice way grateful to uh Ain suito for that quote and offer this for your

229
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:50,680
your consideration and uh wish you all a good

230
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:58,160
uh good week yeah practice life whatever whatever it is we call it yeah and uh
