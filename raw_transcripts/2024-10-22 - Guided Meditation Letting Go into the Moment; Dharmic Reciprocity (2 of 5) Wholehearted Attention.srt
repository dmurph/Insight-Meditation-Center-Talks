1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:08,200
and so now the invitation is to start to settle

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,880
into a posture

3
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,920
acknowledging however you are wherever you are right

4
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:29,678
now sensing into whatever confidence or trust is there

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,239
and meeting back with

6
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:47,320
appreciation with kindness so I hear the people saying

7
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:55,160
that you can hear me but it's santam Mushi unfortunately I can't do anything about that um so I'm not sure why it's

8
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:01,079
different today than yesterday but um hopefully

9
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,760
we will be able to work our way through

10
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,040
[Music] it rooting

11
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,560
yourself in the Integrity of your

12
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,759
posture taking a moment to really notice whether you're sitting standing lying

13
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,159
down [Music]

14
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:41,360
down entering your weight over your hip points your

15
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,479
feet allowing your head and your spine to be

16
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:55,040
aligned and with a couple of relaxed more

17
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,680
intentional perhaps deeper breaths

18
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:08,479
relaxing into that uprightness that

19
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,610
posture softening your [Music]

20
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:25,760
eyes and letting go releasing offering the exhale

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,239
receiving the inhale receiving awareness of this moment here

22
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:05,239
now allowing the eyes to to be soft the tongue to be

23
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:17,120
soft then inviting the breath to be natural normal

24
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:42,519
and for the next few minutes whatever your anchor of attention is breath sound

25
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:51,080
body the invitation is to give yourself over completely to

26
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,599
it but go into

27
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:27,319
it being in contact with the moment

28
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:39,120
you're calling your intention for meditating today for being here

29
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,080
today then allowing body to completely

30
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,160
relax inviting the [Music]

31
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:15,039
mind to relax

32
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:49,919
and attentively

33
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,080
completely being with each

34
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639

36
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,919
if distractions

37
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,960
come the instruction is to meet

38
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,160
the distracted mind with kindness

39
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,360
respect and graciously including that too in this

40
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:50,240

41
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,199

42
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440

attention by getting interested in each little arising in the

46
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,040
moment

47
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:40,279

responded about the theme of confidence and Trust

117
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:40,760
yesterday going to continue today on um with this

118
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:47,440
exploration of gifts we can offer the Dharma dharmic

119
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:53,320
reciprocity and how those can resonate and return to us maybe in a slightly

120
00:33:53,320 --> 00:34:00,240
different form and feed the meditation feed need our

121
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:06,279
um maturity happiness presence in our

122
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:14,480
lives so today yesterday we talked about I talked about trust confidence

123
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,320
conviction and today we'll explore the benefits of wholehearted

124
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:26,800
attention respect in the practice the Buddha named these

125
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:33,200
qualities is Gifts of a good person and this obscure little discourse one of the

126
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,839
things I'm drawing on riffing on this week gifts of a good person a person who

127
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:44,040
offers with integrity and the language itself to me

128
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:50,118
suggests that he's talking about the attitude of the person as well as the

129
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:56,480
process of giving itself wholehearted

130
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:02,839
attention is was experienced as Respect by

131
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:09,040
others and recently I I heard an anecdote about this um a letter written

132
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:14,839
by the famed abolitionist Frederick Douglas sort of Civil War era person and

133
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:21,040
in this letter he recalled with be being deeply impressed by meeting Abraham

134
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:27,839
Lincoln and even though he and Lincoln were on the same side of the abolition kind of

135
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:36,200
perspective they differed in their approaches and in some ways Douglas had been a big critic of Lincoln but dougas

136
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:43,200
when they met was moved by how completely Lincoln paid attention met

137
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,960
him wholeheartedly completely respectfully where he

138
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:54,839
was I was moved by that there are accounts too of the

139
00:35:54,839 --> 00:36:02,240
Buddha himself offering this kind of resp respect through wholehearted attention the Buddha paid close

140
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:09,599
attention to all kinds of people who came to ask questions debate receive teachings regardless of their point of

141
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:17,839
view or their cast back in Ancient India there's this story um of a leper

142
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:24,760
who came to the outskirts of a large Gathering where the Buddha was teaching and he'd initially come hoping

143
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:30,480
there would be food there he was hungry and and then he heard the Buddha

144
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:37,240
teaching and decided to stay and just listen to the teachings and the Buddha scanned the

145
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:44,520
crowd and attentively noticed that this man was there and that he was ready and

146
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:50,160
he offered the teachings specifically tailored to

147
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:57,640
him and the man reached full Awakening so rather than casting the

148
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:03,599
person out or ignoring him because he I mean lepers didn't look very good and

149
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:10,760
they were kind of reviled the Buddha met him where he

150
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:18,560
was this kind of wholehearted attention respect doesn't just benefit people on a

151
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:25,280
relational level it also applies kind of seamlessly in my own experience to the

152
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,520
practice of meditation itself

153
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:38,240
wholehearted attention complete attention to the most ordinary moments

154
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:46,520
of practice has this resonance it begins to increase interest in the

155
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:51,680
moment it's not giving to get gaining mind they call it in this scene that

156
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:57,119
doesn't work rather giving of one's self and one's attention so completely so

157
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,240
whole wholeheartedly with such

158
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:08,920
respect it's like an offering a deep listening that naturally inspires a

159
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:14,000
response and that invites more gifts of the

160
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,680
practice some of those are that gradually mindfulness mindful awareness

161
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:27,040
can come become more continuous stable awareness itself becomes more

162
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:34,240
resilient less thrown off by momentary distractions there's a deeper presence

163
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:43,000
and then the heart and mind begin to receive all kinds of benefits of gifts from that

164
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:52,880
more continuous attention Joy can arise For No Good

165
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:02,720
Reason good good news is that setting all of this in motion

166
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:12,079
including the joy can be cultivated through this kind of completeness this giving

167
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:18,040
over to being in the moment to attending closely with respect and here's some

168
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:23,680
ways that can work first it can be really helpful to set a

169
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:30,680
resolve an aspiration to get in interested to be

170
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:36,359
attentive this includes getting interested in interest and its opposite

171
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:42,400
interested in boredom which is often got an element of

172
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:50,720
aversion in it another way that can help is having a

173
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:56,480
respectful unhurried attitude towards whatever is coming up to give it its own

174
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:02,280
time turn to it

175
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:11,880
completely and just like with deep attentive listening you don't have to agree with what's there it just it still

176
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,480
helps to offer

177
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:25,200
respect and speaking of respect it can be incredibly

178
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:31,079
beneficial to offer yourself self internal respect for doing this practice

179
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:36,800
no matter how it's turning out respect for everything that's coming up

180
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:43,760
everything you meet when I served as a hospital

181
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:50,400
chaplain I would go into rooms all day long with people from different walks of life all kinds of

182
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,400
backgrounds and I soon discovered very early on that offering this kind of

183
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,560
complete attention and respect opened the door to much more interesting

184
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:08,119
conversations it served them better and it served me better too it felt better

185
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:13,760
in the moment and this was especially true when encountering

186
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:20,760
difference getting interested in someone who didn't seem all that open at first

187
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:28,680
or had a very different way of being often revealed not obvious but

188
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:35,520
very important points of contact between us or feelings thoughts World Views that

189
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:42,400
would open into a deeply satisfying even loving

190
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:48,119
conversation with wholehearted attention can also feel like

191
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:56,920
love doing this even improved my own resiliency

192
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,839
so this is equally true of being in rapport with our own experience just as

193
00:42:02,839 --> 00:42:08,839
an attentive listener can help the words and ideas and feelings to flow the

194
00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:15,280
conversation to flow complete wholehearted attending to the

195
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:22,960
moment that also opens things up and opens a possibility for a whole range of

196
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,599
experience that might not normally be available at all but metabolizing

197
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:34,720
emotions and obvious thoughts stories that's just the beginning an

198
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:39,800
important beginning and a powerful moment in

199
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:46,599
practice there's also taking a wholehearted learning

200
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:52,160
mindset towards the tiniest foots of the beginning of a thought the beginnings of

201
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:57,880
sensation sound can all become apparent and this

202
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:03,960
supports a whole another level of freedom in relationship with the

203
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:09,440
moment the simplest objects the simplest

204
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,559
experiences can become beautiful with the sense of wonder and

205
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:20,160
awe for the ordinary so

206
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:25,240
notice notice these simple moments the

207
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:30,640
satisfaction that can be there and all of this feeds a

208
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:36,680
flexible fluid continuity of mindful awareness which in

209
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:42,640
itself feeds contentment opens the

210
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:49,440
possibility for a deeper more subtle way of seeing and

211
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:58,480
being in other words if you offer yourself give yourself over completely to the

212
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:06,280
practice the gifts received can include intrinsic interest and beauty of the

213
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:11,920
ordinary there's a resonance between the offering and the

214
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:18,119
receiving the gifts we receive Echo but aren't identical

215
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:26,440
necessarily to the gifts we offer and these benefits open the heart and mind to still other beautiful experiences

216
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:33,880
well including ining the kind of trust and confidence we talked about

219
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:53,119
practice wide in a sense it echoes a very famous teaching by aan cha one of the root

220
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:58,160
teachers in this tradition the Tha Forest tradition

221
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:03,240

222
