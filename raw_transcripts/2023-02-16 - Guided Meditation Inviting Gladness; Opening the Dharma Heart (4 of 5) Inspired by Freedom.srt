1
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:05,600
welcome everybody

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:17,640
and thank you for being here and I especially want to thank you for

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,880
your practice for your sincerity

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:34,760
I was thinking today that if I were looking for a word to describe or characterize our

5
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:41,280
far-flung meditation community of practitioners I think I'd pick

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:49,140
sincerity so let's begin by taking a moment to

7
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:57,260
recognize Where We Are in this particular community

8
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,239
with each person sincerely doing their best to practice

9
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,760
meditation and to walk in the footsteps

10
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:16,520
of the Buddha so I'm sending out to you

11
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:23,700
a silent expression of appreciation or the sincerity that each of you is

12
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,520
bringing to our practice together if you like

13
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,758
feel free to make take a moment to do the same

14
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,659
so far this week we've cultivated three of the wholesome mind states that

15
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:02,399
prepare the mind for awakening or allowing the full impact of this

16
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,840
Dharma practice to come alive in our own hearts

17
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:16,379
these qualities of Mind are receptivity softness

18
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:21,599
and being free of self-centered preoccupations

19
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,980
free of the hindrances which function as barriers

20
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,239
obstructions to Awakening

21
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:42,360
and when we have just a brief moment on the thinking mind is taking a break

22
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:51,180
from all the commentary I think perhaps the most natural response to that is gladness

23
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:57,720
because now the mind is ready for the sunlight fresh air

24
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,900
and spaciousness of the Dharma to reveal itself to us

25
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:10,739
Moment by moment so let's begin

26
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:15,800
by setting Our intention for this meditation

27
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:22,080
so what is your deepest wish for how this practice could

28
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,019
benefit both yourself and others

29
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,700
and now taking your meditation posture

30
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:59,099
feeling the contact with the Earth and sending your roots down deep into

31
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:03,920
the Earth letting it support you

32
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:13,920
lining the spine so that the energy flows freely

33
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:22,459
you might think of opening the lower chakra in the perineum

34
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:30,720
to receive the energy of the Earth and the topmost chakra at the crown of

35
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,780
the head or there's a little space between the plates of the skull

36
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:42,720
opening that to the heavens allowing the energy

37
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,120
of the sky to come inside as well

38
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,580
it's good if your posture gives you a feeling of stability

39
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:15,680
and now begin relaxing the body scanning down from the head

40
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,600
relaxing these shoulders the arms

41
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,580
the hands and the fingers

42
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:32,660
the Torso in the belly the hips

43
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:38,900
the legs the feet and the toes

44
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:47,180
taking a long deep slow breath

45
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,639
and relaxing into the process of breathing

46
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,300
and as we stay with the breath we can

47
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:27,300
let the bread awareness of the breath be slightly in the background

48
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:34,819
and just do a few minutes of loving kindness meditation

49
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,699
creating a set space where we're protected by this warm-hearted feeling

50
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:54,139
of well-wishing towards our self and all beings

51
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:03,240
may I and all beings everywhere be safe

52
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,319
and protect it

53
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:18,680
may all beings everywhere including me be happy

54
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:26,180
be peaceful and free

55
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,479
and with this warm-hearted well wishing

56
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:45,300
we bring in the wisdom to vow that we'll sit

57
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:51,620
quietly quiet body

58
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:59,099
Quiet Mind leaving our preoccupations outside the

59
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:04,440
door and now bringing the breath back into

60
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:11,360
the foreground and connecting with the breath

61
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:16,280
the flow

62
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:31,199
breathing in noticing the felt Sensations

63
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,940
of the beginning of the breath

64
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:45,020
and the continuation of the in-breath the pause at the top

65
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,839
which gives way to the out breath

66
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:57,180
and as that flows down with a pause

67
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:03,899
at the bottom sometimes I enjoy thinking about the

68
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:13,220
cycle of the breath as a as an oval of energy and Flow

69
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:19,620
so closing the eyes you can imagine

70
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:25,100
the in-breath beginning at the base of the spine in the back

71
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:33,720
and reaching its end at the top of the head and then the out breath

72
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:42,180
flowing down the front of the body reaching its end

73
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,380
in the perineum

74
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:56,540
or just staying with the breath flowing in

75
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,220
and out

76
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:16,579
and giving your breath as an offering to your mindfulness

77
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:24,839
as a beautiful non-static object of meditation

78
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:30,660
constantly changing perhaps you may feel it flowing up the

79
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,660
back and down the front

80
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:57,839
if it feels right to you lighting a little candle of gladness in

81
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,200
the heart

82
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:10,279
breathing in welcoming gladness

83
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:17,160
breathing out spreading gladness as far as it wishes

84
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,579
to go

85
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:31,860
but if you're struggling with loss depression despair hopelessness fear

86
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:38,399
I trust you have the wisdom to know that repressing your emotional state is

87
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:46,100
counterproductive and if that's the case recognize your pain

88
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,720
perhaps you can appreciate just being here in a safe space

89
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,379
breathing

90
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,200
inviting gladness on the in-breath

91
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,140
radiating gladness on the out breath

92
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:33,000
and like all these wholesome States like loudness exist on the in a wide

93
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,120
spectrum so if you're really free of the

94
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:47,279
hindrances you might feel elated but if life is difficult right now

95
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:53,100
then you might just be able to access a little hint

96
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:58,760
of gladness and that's fine

97
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:10,519
that's to be honored or you could try these metaphrases

98
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,920
may I live with an open heart

99
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:24,019
May whatever clouds my heart he dispelled

100
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:33,560
so if you feel that support would be beneficial to you please go ahead and

101
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:39,839
do the well-wishing of living with an open heart

102
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:46,399
and letting whatever clouds there be dispelt

103
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:03,019
perhaps we can be satisfied just to be here

104
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:08,339
a sincere practitioner in this spot on planet Earth

105
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:10,940
breathing

106
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:33,980
breathing in welcoming whatever gladness may be present

107
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:43,320
and allowing yourself to feel it and breathing out

108
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,620
hearing it with all beings

109
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,059
and by staying contentedly

110
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:45,419
with the flow and ebb of the breath allowing yourself to perhaps

111
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:50,880
glimpse their freedom that is possible

112
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:58,100
when the mind and the body settle down even for just a moment

113
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:07,380
perhaps you can be glad that wow this Freedom Is Possible

114
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,400
even for me

115
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:22,200
and in this openness breathing in

116
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:28,980
radiating gladness inside breathing out

117
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:36,440
radiating gladness giving it away

118
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,380
foreign

119
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,260

foreign

122
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:36,000
and as we come to the end of this sitting

123
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,360
with a mind that has benefited from appreciating some of the goodness

124
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:50,580
in ourselves and in our world and through the goodness of our practice

125
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:58,080
may we are Center of appreciation and gladness

126
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,840
now radiate our heartfelt wish

127
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:09,140
that all beings everywhere be safe

128
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:14,658
may we all be happy

129
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:21,980
may all beings be peaceful

130
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:29,700
and may all beings be free and may our meditation practice

131
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:37,559
help us to contribute to the safety happiness

132
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:43,820
Peace and Freedom of all beings everywhere

133
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:01,579
[Music]

134
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:09,740
foreign

135
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:46,700
friends I'm very glad to be here with you

136
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:54,140
and this is the fourth talk this week on the theme of opening the Dharma heart

137
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:59,580
the early polytext talk about opening the Dharma eye

138
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:06,659
when a follower of the Buddha awakens and fully penetrates and realizes the

139
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:13,140
Dharma from themselves and what's necessary for this insight to

140
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:20,360
happen is to understand the truth of how things really are

141
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:30,600
the wonderful artist Mark Chagall said if I create from the heart nearly

142
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:37,520
everything works if from the head almost nothing

143
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:46,460
and I believe this is especially true for everyone who has suffered greatly

144
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:54,059
I talked earlier this week about this Dharma practice as a process of

145
00:31:54,059 --> 00:32:00,679
sculpting ourselves as though we're creating a beautiful work of art

146
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,440
where more and more through our practice we've become a force of beauty and

147
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:14,880
goodness for both ourselves and others so I think I coined this expression

148
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,940
opening the Dharma heart which by the way is not canonical

149
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:26,700
because for me uh opening the mind was not enough

150
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:32,279
for getting ready for the insights that give rise to liberation

151
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:38,399
I had to progressively little by little for a long time

152
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:45,960
learn how to open the heart and this wasn't going to happen if I

153
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:51,799
couldn't fully accept myself warts and all

154
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:01,919
so the heart had to open for the mind to be able to settle down in my case

155
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:07,320
to be comfortable resting in moments of emptiness

156
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:13,140
and to open the doors and windows to let in the sunlight and spaciousness

157
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:19,860
of the Dharma like many of you I'm a creature of this

158
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:25,260
Western culture and it's quite intuitive for me to

159
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:32,039
distinguish between the mind and the Heart but this may not have been the case for

160
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:39,539
the Disciples of the Buddha it's fascinating that chitung

161
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:45,559
the word in Pali that means mind also means heart

162
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:51,179
and even today when you ask someone in the Indian subcontinent to point to

163
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:56,419
their mind most people will put their hand on their heart

164
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:03,720
so this week we're talking about the qualities of mind that the Buddha held as valuable

165
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:10,080
in preparing for awakening we've seen that we need to cultivate

166
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:16,858
receptivity making space in the mind to receive the Dharma

167
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:22,679
we need a soft mind which in Pali is moodu

168
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:29,540
and when I talked about this on Tuesday I mentioned that the etymological root would

169
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:34,980
means not only soft but also happy

170
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:40,980
and then I went for a walk afterwards and I had sort of a mental light bulb

171
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:47,300
and I said to myself but of course when the mind is soft even temporarily

172
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:55,080
if it really doesn't have sharp edges one can't help but feel happy

173
00:34:55,080 --> 00:35:02,520
so it completely makes sense actually that the root of this quality could evolve into either softness or

174
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:10,020
happiness and yesterday we evoked the quality of

175
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:17,420
having a mind that is free of preoccupations again even just temporarily

176
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:25,980
and likewise uh the absence of the hindrances is naturally a source of

177
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:32,040
gladness because we're no longer slaves to our preoccupations

178
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:37,320
what a relief we can be here

179
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:44,339
in the present moment with more agency when the hindrances are not pushing us

180
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:51,060
around and moments like that are really moments

181
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:57,920
of freedom and this taste of Freedom

182
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:05,240
leads naturally to the Quality that will evoke today foreign

183
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:12,000
word for today's wholesome quality is udaga which comes from the prefix good

184
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,700
and the word Aga and UD means upwards

185
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:24,859
and AGA has a number of different meanings as an adjective it means highest

186
00:36:24,859 --> 00:36:32,599
foremost supreme ultimate superb and as a noun Peak top

187
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:36,140
conclusion result

188
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:43,619
so this may sound a little abstract but in fact udega is usually translated as

189
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:53,040
elated or inspired it can also mean enraptured or exalted

190
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,500
and this kind of intense Rapture is an early phase of deep concentration in

191
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,980
meditation

192
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:09,300
and in this context I think it's important to recognize that there may be

193
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:16,020
dangers if when we experience uh being elated like this it

194
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:23,280
can be pretty um and rapturing and uh

195
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:30,060
it could become a preoccupation in itself if we uh cling to the intense

196
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:36,980
pleasure that it produces and I think uh this quality the way the

197
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:44,700
Buddha was intending us to um welcome it is

198
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:53,839
more equality of being inspired in a way that allows the mind to settle

199
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:03,900
so that the dregs can filter out and we have uh

200
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:11,540
the genuine Clarity to be able to uh receive these insights

201
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:18,619
so we don't want to be captured by being unladed

202
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:27,300
um and as I said earlier um all of these wholesome qualities exist on a broad spectrum

203
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:33,960
and they're of course easier to access on a long Meditation Retreat

204
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:40,619
but it's worthwhile uh tuning into and recognizing even

205
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:46,619
subtle occurrences of them during our daily meditation and daily

206
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:55,579
life as the Buddha teaches in the dhamapada

207
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:02,460
all experience is preceded by mind led by mind

208
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:09,780
made by mind speak or act with a corrupted mind and

209
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:15,180
suffering follows as the Wagon Wheel follows the hoof of

210
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:22,560
the ox all experience is preceded by mind led

211
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:30,359
by mind made my mind speak or act with a peaceful mind

212
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:37,520
and happiness follows like a never departing shadow

213
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:51,140
that we are constantly creating our experience by what we focus on

214
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:58,740
and the news is full of disasters and unethical Behavior

215
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:05,280
but it's worthwhile taking the time to make space in the mind for what inspires

216
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:11,660
us perhaps we can think of

217
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:16,740
the courage and generosity of all the rescue workers

218
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:22,320
in Ukraine and turkey and Syria and elsewhere in

219
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:30,260
the world who risk their own lives to help others

220
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:39,900
and in our meditation practice even if we have

221
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:47,820
short moments of receptivity softness and malleability

222
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:53,760
and the freedom from being pushed around by our preoccupations just a tiny moment

223
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,260
of that is worth celebrating

224
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:05,280
and for me to have confidence that this dharmic path I'm trying to

225
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:11,099
walk is the right place to be brings me great

226
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:17,099
gladness I know that I'm in good hands

227
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:24,119
I know I'm on the right track and it's okay

228
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:29,660
to walk this path even with imperfections

229
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:41,220
so I I hope you can take that in and Trust yourselves to be

230
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:46,440
um worthy practitioners don't uh

231
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:53,880
be impatient this Dharma path is made for slow

232
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:59,460
Bloomers as well as fast bloomers and there really is

233
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:08,060
um space for all beings to be here

234
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,660
so we can be inspired by tasting and

235
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:23,760
celebrating even short moments of being free of the

236
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:31,980
hindrances so as you open your hearts and Minds in

237
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:38,160
your meditation practice and in your mindfulness throughout the day

238
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:46,339
be sure to honor those tastes of freedom and let them bring you gladness

239
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:55,560
so that's your homework making peace with who you are

240
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:02,640
and recognizing and even letting yourself be inspired by

241
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,680
whatever Taste of freedom are offered to you

242
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,818
Moment by moment

243
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:19,039
thank you for your practice

244
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:27,480
may your day he sprinkled with moments of

245
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:35,119
gladness and may your practice inspire you
