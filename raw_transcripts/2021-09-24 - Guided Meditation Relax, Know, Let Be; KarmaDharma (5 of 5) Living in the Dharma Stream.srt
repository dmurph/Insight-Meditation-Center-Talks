1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,200
so hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,240
and uh we're here to

3
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,039
be mindful of our present moment experience

4
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:27,279
here while you're first paying attention to me

5
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:33,040
that who is there for you it's amazing this uh connection we have

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,280
to through youtube and online and and what it means to

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,640
teach mindfulness and being in the present moment and over such long distances

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:53,840
but certainly you're at you are where you are and that's where mindfulness practice

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,879
comes alive yesterday i talked about a simple

10
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:06,320
technique for mindfulness that some people like to have kind of a nice rhythm of a little technique to

11
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,000
that uh to do and also it represents some of the qualities from the aspects of mindfulness

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,920
and that was to be here to relax and then to recognize

13
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,759
so to establish oneself here to relax into here

14
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,040
and then to and then to recognize what's here and

15
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,479
that is the act of recognition is quite important so

16
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,159
another way of doing this that's related and maybe it could be done

17
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:49,360
afterward the first one in the same meditation and that is um

18
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:56,159
to relax let go to recognize what's here

19
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:03,280
to recognize what the experience of the moment is and then to

20
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,759
let it be let it be

21
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,480
and as we kind of continue in this relax recognize let be

22
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,680
the relaxing becomes extra becomes work becomes just keeping yourself busy

23
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:29,120
and it's just been nicer just to recognize what's here and let things be

24
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,599
as meditation goes deeper and deeper and quieter and quieter then maybe even the recognizing seems too

25
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,440
much and the primary thing to do is just let things be

26
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:47,760
and this letting be is uh is a

27
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,840
is a

28
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,000
kind of in the family of letting go it's a form of letting go and a

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,120
very profound form where we're letting go of things needing to be different than how they are

30
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,120
in the moment at least in meditation certainly in life we have to change things but in meditation

31
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,480
that we relax and then at some point the freedom comes

32
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,920
because we're not picking anything up we're not reacting to anything or we're

33
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,920
not believing the reactions or getting involved in them that the ability to recognize

34
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,920
is strong enough that we recognize whatever passes through whatever is happening and we find

35
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,040
ourselves letting it be not being for against it not

36
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,200
being wanting it or not wanting it just here

37
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,879
rooted here letting it be so letting b is a quite a profound form of letting go

38
00:03:52,879 --> 00:04:01,439
and it um it uh in some ways it's more wise

39
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:07,439
than the action of letting go that when you do the letting go um it just uh

40
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:13,920
we're just there letting things be and and one of the advantages of that is

41
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,759
that at some point things let go of themselves rather than we letting go

42
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:26,880
and the ability to just be to let things be in the field of recognition

43
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,320
and and then see that things are let go of because it's trust is so

44
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,680
deep the ease is so deep our non-involvement is so thorough

45
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,000
is quite inspiring quite inspiring to see what how things can unfold without us having to be the

46
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,840
agent for the change so assuming a meditation posture

47
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,840
and gently closing the eyes

48
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:07,120
and taking a just a little bit deeper breath than usual

49
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,639
just a gentle deeper breath almost as if you're

50
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,520
being tender to yourself as you breathe

51
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:27,199
breathing in breathing out

52
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,520
as you exhale to relax

53
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,479
soften

54
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,639
and letting your breathing return to normal

55
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:15,000
and on the exhale to relax the muscles of the face

56
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,319
on the exhale relaxing the neck

57
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,479
and then the tops of the shoulders

58
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,759
and then deep inside the shoulders

59
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,319
exhale relaxing the chest

60
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,199
deep in the chest

61
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,919
and relaxing the belly

62
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,160
softening the belly

63
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,960
on the exhale relaxing the hands the arms

64
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,919
and then the legs and the feet

65
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,160
and having relaxed this way

66
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:27,319
now become aware of your breathings centering yourself in the body breathing

67
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:01,680
and recognize how you are

68
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,720
recognize how it is to breathe how it is to be in your body

69
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,800
and let it be

70
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,440
recognize how you are in your mood and emotional state

71
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,800
no matter how subtle or how big

72
00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:00,160
and let it be and breathe with it

73
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:07,040
sometimes breathing with things we can accompany our difficult states

74
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,160
without being for against easier just let it be

75
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,319
a company

76
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,040
so as what other whatever rhythm that's nice for you

77
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,880
relax recognize

78
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,600
and let be

79
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:53,600
and if relaxing is too much then just be breathe

80
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,320
recognize let be

81
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:09,279
experimenting with how is it you can be present

82
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:17,199
knowing what's happening but give it space

83
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:24,680
allow it to be itself without being involved

84
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,959
to recognize clearly

85
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,959
is to begin the process of letting be

86
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,320
when we only recognize

87
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:21,440
and then as we come to the end of the sitting imagine yourself comfortable and safe

88
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:28,240
at ease being with someone maybe someone who is

89
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,400
suffering in some way challenged

90
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,919
imagine that you are present for the person

91
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,519
but you allow the person to be

92
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,240
would it be like for you to take in someone to really pay attention and to recognize

93
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:04,240
someone without being involved with wanting something or

94
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:10,400
not wanting something fixing or any kind of way of asserting yourself or

95
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:16,960
judging the other person just letting the person be

96
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:24,240
and taking them in experiencing them more fully

97
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:34,480
offering them a chance to feel safe around you and feel like you want nothing more than to

98
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:42,080
be be available and be present allowing the person to be as they are

99
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:49,039
that sometimes is a profound gift sometimes people do not do not have the

100
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:56,240
experience of someone who is with them and allows themselves to be

101
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:06,320
it may be our ability to sit and meditate breathing with how things are letting

102
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:13,760
things be learning the art of letting be the deep art

103
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,760
will support us and how we the gift we can give others

104
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:28,000
offering them the kind of respect the kind of love where we recognize someone

105
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,840
and allow them to be who they are

106
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,559
maybe in such a way so it's easier for them to find their own way

107
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,320
without our interference

108
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:00,960
in the innumerable ways that we can in this practice that we do can

109
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:08,960
translate into caring for others maybe may we be motivated to care for

110
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:16,880
the world motivated to live for the welfare and happiness of others

111
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,919
and the welfare and happiness of ourselves

112
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:32,720
may all beings be happy

113
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,120
may all beings be safe

114
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:44,559
may all beings be peaceful

115
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:49,640
and may all beings be free

116
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:54,778
[Music]

117
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:05,829
[Music]

118
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,559
so the topic for this week has been the karmic stream and the dharm extremes of

119
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:24,080
our lives and many people are swimming in the karmic stream only

120
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:29,120
that's all they know and by all because they that's all they

121
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:35,600
know that they think that's all there is

122
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:41,120
and so they're constantly navigating negotiating that that world

123
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:47,919
and uh we can do wonderful things in the karmic world

124
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:53,919
uh the and terrible things the

125
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:59,519
buddhist tradition divides up the activities of the karmic world into two

126
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,559
areas that which is unhealthy or unwholesome

127
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:09,919
and that which is beautiful and and the encouragement is to do the

128
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:15,279
things that are beautiful those things are healthy they're wholesome

129
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:20,399
because it's for your own benefit and for the benefit of others

130
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:26,720
and so learning how to live without hate without greed without delusion

131
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:33,760
without criticism and animosity or resentment or

132
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:39,679
equals acquisitiveness to learning to live with generosity and

133
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,398
love and kindness

134
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:52,399
but the car for something to be the karmic stream

135
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:59,039
the karmic stream is based on um as its root

136
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:06,000
a certain kind of attachment very can be very very subtle

137
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,760
and maybe the easiest way to understand it is attachment to self

138
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:17,120
some kind of idea of ourselves as being somehow

139
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,880
a solid or substantial or a reference point

140
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:32,720
and or the subtle attachment to maybe not to ourselves exactly but more

141
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:39,519
basically uh the there's two base three basic attachments that kind of propel the

142
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:46,960
whole karmic world and it's not easy not to use easy to see it's uh to really tap into it to be

143
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,880
usually very attentive and sensitive um at the deeper levels

144
00:32:52,880 --> 00:33:00,640
and uh one of them is attachment to sense comfort and sense pleasures

145
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,679
human beings are very oriented sometimes in a very deep way to be comfortable

146
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:11,840
and to be of pleasantness it's kind of very closely related to being safe

147
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:19,440
the other is a very subtle attachment to existing to being alive

148
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,559
to being and then a very subtle attachment to not being to not existing

149
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:32,720
some people and it takes the form something if you watch your own mind stream

150
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,799
and you're watching how this karma plays out in your own mind you can watch and track what you're

151
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:45,440
thinking about and you can see is your thinking involved with something to do with

152
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:51,200
comfort and discomfort make things pleasant or unpleasant

153
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,559
is it in some way uh an uh in a certain assertion of identity

154
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:04,720
is there some uh being someone in your is that part of your mindstream an identity

155
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:11,520
or is there a movement to not have an identity to not be seen a certain way not be presented some way and not be

156
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:17,599
recognized certain way and this movement towards being and non-being

157
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:24,079
to sense pleasure in the buddhist tradition is considered deeply deeply rooted

158
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:29,679
so that even beautiful karma has that attachment as well

159
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:36,079
and and so we can only go so far we can in the in the beautiful karma

160
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:41,599
with good karma we are shaping our future we're shaping

161
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:48,398
and conditioning ourselves as you can watch your thoughts and see the thoughts that you have kind of condition the next

162
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:55,200
thought the next thought and and kind of can keep certain minds mental preoccupations going in a way

163
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,560
that can have a negative influence on us or a positive influence on us

164
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:08,800
but it always involves work it always involves mental activity and over months and years and decades

165
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:16,079
it takes a toll there can be a wariness a tiredness from always navigating negotiating existing non-existing

166
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:22,720
identity non-identity pleasure comfort and all that the dharm extreme

167
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:28,640
uh is uh is not like a dualistic radical different

168
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,640
way of living than ordinary life you might be doing many of the same things

169
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:41,520
that you do in ordinary life shopping and cooking and caring for family or friends or going to work and all kinds

170
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:47,200
of things you might be doing but um

171
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:54,880
it's done without this attachment without any attachment but inc at the at

172
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,320
the deeper level if the dharm extreme is really matured then

173
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:06,880
there's no attachment to sense pleasures comfort no attachment to existence even to life

174
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:13,040
and also no attachment to non-existence non-identity to not being alive

175
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:18,240
one navigates lives a life could be fully

176
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:24,240
unconcerned with this attachment this preoccupation this fear this desires around these

177
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,359
three areas on the way to that dharma stream

178
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:35,200
it's learning how to let go of coarser attachments and how to do

179
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:41,520
care for friends family go to work take care of ourselves do all the things ordinary things people do

180
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:47,280
but to learn to do them without attachment without clinging to anything and

181
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:54,880
and but even the subtler ones and so then we find ourselves able to do these things without this layer of work

182
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:01,680
in the mind of navigating negotiating the self in the middle of it all nabbing and

183
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:07,040
negotiating how to make ourselves comfortable in the middle of it all it releases a whole level of

184
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:12,320
preoccupation and the buddhist reference point for this is

185
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:18,400
there's freedom one goes about the world free and

186
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:24,400
one does the things that ordinary things that people do that may be appropriate for you

187
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:30,320
but there is a freedom in doing it there's an ease there's a peace there's an absence of a certain

188
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:36,640
agitation or contraction that exists always exists in the karmic

189
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:44,079
stream and to be in the dharma stream is to begin appreciating

190
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,599
how it's possible to live in the world without clinging an attachment

191
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,960
and so it begins with maybe beginning to letting go of bigger attachments

192
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:02,240
maybe it begins by meditating for some people it's eye opening to begin meditating and realize how much of the

193
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,520
ordinary preoccupations of the mind and how they translate to bodily tension can

194
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:14,320
be put down and can relax and become quiet and it can be a life changer to realize

195
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:19,599
how much extra uh preoccupation the mind is spinning

196
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:25,440
and churning and ruminating that can be put down can be relaxed

197
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:32,560
and uh and so we begin seeing where it's possible and then the dharma stream is that is to

198
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:40,400
see that as an open door that as we relax as we let go as we don't act

199
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:47,119
with attachment the absence of attachment clinging craving resistance is kind of like an

200
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:54,480
open door that's inviting you hey come here come take a look at this

201
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:01,520
and and so the dharma stream is found by stepping into that through that door into that new stream

202
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:07,359
and in the teachings of the buddha reality

203
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:13,440
is always inviting you welcoming you into this new stream

204
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,880
into the dharma stream there's a wide open door that's ready for you

205
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,480
if you can put down your burden put down your attachments your clinging

206
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:30,720
and you get to keep your life perhaps because it's not this is not a judgment

207
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:38,400
about what people do in their lives it's just an idea that do them without clinging

208
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:44,400
if what you do in your life is completely dependent on clinging

209
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,000
you're doing it because you cling then how you live your life might change

210
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:55,359
as you let go of clinging and i'm pretty confident that

211
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:01,520
it'll be for your own good to do that and for the good of the people around you it's not a good

212
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:07,040
con not a good result to live a life and do things in the world that are

213
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:13,359
propelled with attachment and clinging that need to have craving uh as part of it

214
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:18,960
and even that fundamental one the uh attachment to being alive

215
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:25,760
or the attachment to not wanting to be alive or attachment to identity and non-identity

216
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,440
happiness is not found through identity happiness is not found being preoccupied

217
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:39,200
with life or death there's a way of putting this down and experiencing a profound peace

218
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:44,880
and which will help you live your life peacefully and happily and

219
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:51,359
and wisely and that's maybe one of the key reasons to to put down the attachment so we can live

220
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:57,200
wisely in the world and live in a way that is really beneficial for others maybe even

221
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:02,480
inspiring for others being an example for others that's

222
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:08,240
possible to live a life that's not anxious possible live a life was not greedy or a

223
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:14,480
life that's resentful or hating and it's a wonderful gift gift to the

224
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:20,400
world to give that example and now i think one of the clear ways to see it

225
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:26,960
is in raising children if children see the model of

226
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:32,160
hate and greed and fear then that's what they think is needed to

227
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:38,480
live this life but if they have a different model what a gift it is to the children

228
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:45,599
and uh it's a gift to yourself because if you can live this without this fundamental attachments if you

229
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:50,800
enter into the dharma stream and really trust it then

230
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:56,640
when it's your turn to die and if and if you die in a conscious way

231
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:03,119
chances are you won't be afraid chances are it won't be a difficult thing to do because you don't you're not

232
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:11,039
attached either way so the dharma stream and the

233
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:17,440
and the karma stream if you're going to do the karma stream

234
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,960
do it well do it beautifully bring beauty to the world which

235
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,838
spiritual beauty walk in beauty

236
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:34,960
and uh and one of the ways to walk in beauty to do that is that to realize also that the the

237
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,880
beautiful karma is a precursor support is as a

238
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,240
can point the way to the dharmic stream and uh

239
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:52,240
and the beautiful stuff that we do just gets done better when it's done

240
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:57,039
from the dharm extreme so

241
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:03,440
hopefully this is an interesting distinctions to explore your life understand your life

242
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:10,400
and as i've said repeatedly one of the primary reference points i'd suggest for you for really studying

243
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:16,240
these two streams is in your moment-to-moment uh tracking of your

244
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:21,839
thought streams what you're thinking about and uh right there you'll see all you need to know

245
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:28,400
about um to really get a sense of the karma stream and the dharma stream

246
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:34,880
may your thoughts flow in the stream where there's no attachment

247
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:41,599
so thank you very much and i look forward to being back here next

248
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,599
