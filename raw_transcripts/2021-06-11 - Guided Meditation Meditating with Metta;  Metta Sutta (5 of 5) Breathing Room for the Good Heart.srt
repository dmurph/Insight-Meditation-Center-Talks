1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,800
i was just sharing my delight and being here with all of you and

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,480
wishing you a wonderful day if it's a beginning of a day for some of you in california

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:21,199
or continuing of a day or end of a day

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,840
so

5
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,160
so let's see

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:44,960
so the topic of uh this week is loving kindness

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,920
and one of the you know there's a lot of emphasis in

8
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:59,359
buddhism on these emotions these social emotions that connect us to each other and

9
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:06,159
and and allow our hearts to be touched by others and

10
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:12,159
and maybe to touch the hearts of others and loving kindness in our tradition is

11
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,240
preeminent in those and but one of the things that's important to appreciate

12
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,000
it's not an obligation to be loving or kind or friendly friendly

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,880
but it is very helpful to do so it is a way of loosening up some of the

14
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,759
constrictions and and um fears and

15
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:45,360
tensions that we carry with us it's also a byproduct

16
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,479
of becoming peaceful and to think of love and loving kindness meta as a

17
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,600
something that that follows uh becoming free the free year we become

18
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,960
the more peaceful we become uh the more available the more

19
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,920
more open and more space there is for our good hearts and

20
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:17,760
uh and we all have good hearts i believe um you know if you just uh clear enough

21
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:26,239
of what's covering it over and so buddhist practice can be um

22
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,040
so no sound let's see a lot of people saying that there's

23
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,080
trouble with youtube but i don't know

24
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,760
it seems that uh it's okay here

25
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,879
um so

26
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,249
so [Music]

27
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,159
so we all have a good heart

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,040
so let's sit with our hearts and uh if you believe if you don't believe you have a good

29
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,879
heart if you don't believe that somehow inside of you there's a source of peace

30
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:28,400
a source of love even and kindness then why don't you used to

31
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,120
maybe you can just kind of carry along my confidence that it's in there

32
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:42,959
and maybe for these next minutes that we're meditating together at least put aside any idea

33
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,720
that it's not there you don't have to believe that your heart is good at the center

34
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:56,400
but maybe you can put aside any belief that it's not good any belief that gets in the way

35
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,360
of what i call the good heart so you don't have to believe

36
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:14,239
it's good just don't believe it's not good so taking a meditation posture

37
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,560
and

38
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:29,280
then maybe you can uh sway forward and back and side to side

39
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:36,800
maybe even twist a little bit as a way of kind of just making room for your body to limber up

40
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:44,479
and be a little bit more relaxed and soft and and for you to be connected

41
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:55,930
to your body and gently close your eyes

42
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:04,000
[Music] maybe in a gentle way

43
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,639
taking some deep breaths three quarters full feeling little bit the stretch as you

44
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,199
breathe in

45
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:23,280
and as you breathe in more deeply than usual when you get to the top of the three-quarters full breath you

46
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,918
might pause for a second

47
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:35,120
just long enough so it feels a little bit more significant that you're going to exhale

48
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,639
like it's a relief to exhale as if you're doing a good thing for

49
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:52,880
yourself to exhale and then a long relaxed exhale

50
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,199
maybe releasing at the end of the exhale so you exhale continues just a little

51
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,440
bit

52
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:11,440
and if you'd like at the end of the exhale you can also pause for a second or so

53
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,680
again so that you don't inhale automatically but when you allow the

54
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:34,960
inhale to continue to begin it just feels like a good thing you're doing for yourself

55
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:49,840
it is a good thing to be breathing

56
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,680
and then to let your breathing return to normal

57
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,680
and to allow your body to relax

58
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,840
the ways that you have been maybe

59
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,280
busy engaged in life and you've been holding your body tight and tense ready to do and

60
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:44,560
go on to the next thing relax maybe an overactive body

61
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,960
perhaps you hold yourself defensively

62
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,479
against the world against danger

63
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,400
holding fear in your body

64
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:13,680
and just maybe only as much as you're comfortable with maybe you can also relax the fear body

65
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:27,840
the defensive body

66
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,000
relaxing the shoulders

67
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,839
relaxing the belly

68
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:10,320
and there can be a lot of agitation and tension in the mind

69
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,839
maybe in the area of the brain

70
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:26,480
see if you can let your mind relax release

71
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,959
the brain also the mind also overworks we overwork it

72
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:43,440
we require so much of it to do and figure and

73
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:50,399
figure out what's going on

74
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,519
allowing the mind to relax rest

75
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,079
and then bringing the attention to the center of your chest

76
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:13,600
maybe the place where your heart is or your heart center

77
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,640
feeling maybe any tenderness that might be there

78
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,760
any warmth

79
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:33,839
any gentleness or maybe even vulnerability

80
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,600
and for a few couple of minutes see if you can just allow the feelings

81
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,200
that as they are in the heart to be there

82
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,560
and breathe with them breathe through them

83
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:01,440
as if what you're feeling there is allowed to be there whether it's pleasant or not

84
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:09,680
a generosity of attention to just feel and sense what's in your

85
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
heart

86
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,000
and then maybe connect it to the heart

87
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,440
can you find within you

88
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,200
the simplest possible good will

89
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:12,320
for yourself the simplest possible

90
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:24,399
friendliness or well-wishing kind regard of yourself

91
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:31,440
and to breathe with that breathe through it

92
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,839
holding yourself in a kind regard

93
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:35,839
letting go of your thoughts letting go of any kind of belief

94
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:49,839
that you're anything less than a good person at the heart

95
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,800
letting go of any idea thought feeling

96
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:07,199
that you're anything less than a good person at least for these minutes they were

97
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,839
meditating

98
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:36,240
and to sit quietly with your breathing breathing in and breathing out

99
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,320
breathing in that space in that heartfeltness

100
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:52,720
where we might have freed ourselves for any negative view of ourselves

101
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:04,639
and if we're not free of it and see if you can hold that negativity

102
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,680
in a kind way

103
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,199
the negativity might need

104
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:25,199
to be held in a wholesome way and not condemned or belittled

105
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:41,839
just known kindly

106
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:58,320
gently letting go of your thinking

107
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,520
chances are you don't need to think what you're thinking

108
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,559
and instead breathe with your heart

109
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,840
breathe

110
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,960
breathe free of any negative

111
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:33,120
any thinking view of yourself just breathe in what's left

112
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,840
with the absence of negativity

113
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:19,679
and then as we come to the end of the sitting to once again see if you can relax

114
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:26,000
more deeply let go

115
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:34,480
of tension in your body soften the body

116
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,960
see if you can let go of tension in the mind

117
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,039
softening the mind

118
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:57,840
quieting and letting go of any beliefs

119
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,679
that you're you're anything less than

120
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:17,039
good and if you can sit here quietly openly

121
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:24,640
peacefully without any idea that you are less than

122
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:32,158
good you can be confident you have more to offer the world

123
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:39,360
then perhaps you can bring a simple kind regard

124
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:47,440
in your contact with other people not dramatic loving kindness

125
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:56,240
not great acts of generosity and care for others

126
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:07,840
but a simple basic human good will kind regard

127
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:15,679
and may it be that as we come out of this meditation and

128
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:25,120
engage in the world of other people today and tomorrow

129
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:35,200
may we bring this kind regard with us

130
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:41,919
so that in our hearts we may be delight

131
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:49,600
in wishing people well

132
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,880
there's a kind of joy simplicity

133
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:03,840
a smile in the heart may others be happy

134
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:16,720
may others have smiling hearts

135
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,520
may others relax in safety

136
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:33,760
may others find ease in a peaceful environment

137
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:42,480
and may others be free of any belief

138
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:50,000
that they are less than good at least in the depths of their hearts

139
00:28:53,360 --> 00:29:00,000
and may we believe that under the layers and layers of

140
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,200
where what people how people live that there is

141
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:13,840
goodness in there there is beauty in each person

142
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:24,320
and may we contribute to the possibility of

143
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:41,840
letting each person's beauty come forth into this world

144
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:46,409
[Music]

145
00:29:52,840 --> 00:30:01,279
so then we come now to the fifth talk on the meta suta so i i guess on monday i

146
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:07,760
said there'd be four parts but because of the five parts week you know i divided into five

147
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,840
parts and so we come to the last part and uh it should be there on the youtube

148
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,200
description of the youtube underneath if you want to read along with me

149
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,799
and also if you don't not on youtube and you can find this uh my translation of this

150
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:31,279
in um in the home page for imc's website under uh reflections from gil on the

151
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:36,399
bottom right hand corner there and

152
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:42,880
let me read you the last section so the section before it talks about

153
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:49,440
cultivating loving kindness meta goodwill in a boundless

154
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:56,080
in way unlimited way and meaning it's not held in check or restricted by any

155
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:03,760
attachments any hostility any greed any kind of way in which we um

156
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:10,159
define and limit ourselves and there's a kind of openness

157
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:15,919
and freedom within which or in which this good will

158
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:23,120
this good heart can kind of radiate and then it goes on and it says standing

159
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:30,960
or walking sitting or lying down as long as one is alert may one remain

160
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:37,279
with this recollection with this perspective this

161
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:42,320
is called a sublime abiding here and now

162
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:49,039
this is a sublime abiding here now so abiding means a way of living a way

163
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:55,200
of of existing and whether you're sitting quietly in

164
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,399
meditation or you're going about your life there's a sense of that we're kind of

165
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:09,039
resting in a lot of goodness they were resting in in the case of loving kindness

166
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:15,200
resting in loving kindness resting in good will and in a sense it's almost like a disposition

167
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:22,080
it's almost like a a attitude that just comes along with us

168
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:27,919
as opposed to something we keep practicing and for it to be that way then whether

169
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:34,799
we're standing walking sitting or lying down and whatever we're doing when we're awake during the day

170
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:41,279
it really is really imperative not to be caught up in our thoughts not

171
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:47,200
to be ruminating not to be lost in preoccupations

172
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:56,080
not to be involved in resentments and annoyances and complaints and everything that's wrong in particular

173
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:03,360
not to be cut up and involved with negative self-thinking and um and a lot of what buddhism

174
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,480
focuses on is the absence of any thing unwholesome

175
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:15,360
in the mind and the heart so the the one the description descriptions of the ultimate goal in buddhism

176
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:21,279
is to be free of greed hatred and delusion and we realize that hatred and delusion

177
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:27,440
and greed are kind of embedded very can be embedded very very subtly in us

178
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,640
and some people say well being free of greed hate and delusion is not good enough we should have a greater goal

179
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,960
like for example love but it's pretty wonderful to be free of

180
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:45,360
greed hate and delusion uh great hate and delusion causes a lot of harm to ourselves and others

181
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:51,760
and just simply be free of these things so like being free of any negative self-thinking

182
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:59,360
being free of any hostility towards oneself any criticalness any free of any idea

183
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:06,399
that you're anything less than beautiful there was a song from i think about 30 years ago that

184
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:13,919
the lyrics went how could anyone ever tell you that you're anything less than beautiful

185
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:21,040
how can anyone ever tell you that you're less than whole

186
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:26,320
well some people tell themselves that and so as a minimum what we're trying to

187
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:32,079
do in buddhist practice is to free ourselves from that and have an experience of ourselves without the

188
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:37,280
negative self-thinking and to somehow

189
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:44,000
feel confident that it's okay to do so that there's no authority that's hanging

190
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,040
over us telling us that we should be that we're wrong we're bad

191
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,398
we're somehow less than or unacceptable in some way

192
00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:00,000
and to let go of all this negative self-talk to let go let go of all the ideas that

193
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,359
more more and more only if i have more then i'll be happy only if i get more

194
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:10,800
then i'll have more then i'll be happy then i'll be respected then people will love me or something

195
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:18,320
greed is also a way of limiting this good heart so how could anyone ever tell you that

196
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:24,720
you need more to be beautiful how could anyone ever tell you that you need more

197
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:31,680
in order to be whole your wholeness and your beauty doesn't depend on getting more things

198
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:38,000
and having more experiences it's already here waiting for us

199
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:45,599
so to rest in that and find that attitude and just trust that and then live that uh in our lives to

200
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:51,040
carry it with us remember it and so to remember to have a kind regard

201
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:56,079
as we go through the life so this is kind of what the text is saying

202
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:06,160
and then it goes on to say whoever is virtuous endowed with vision not taken by views

203
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:12,640
and having overcome all greed for sensual pleasure so i'll read the last line later but

204
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:20,160
virtuous to be virtuous is again to not be caught in the constrictions

205
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:26,880
of unwholesomeness not to be caught in meanness and

206
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,560
hostility towards anyone or greed in relationship to other people

207
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,680
it's a living from a very different place than from greed hatred and delusion

208
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:45,280
endowed with vision to be quiet enough and still enough or calm enough so we can really see clearly in a way we

209
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,480
can't when we're agitated and spinning in thoughts and jumping from one thought to the other and jumping

210
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:58,240
to conclusions endowed with vision to be able to see well what's going on here

211
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:04,160
and then not taken by views means not to be involved in fixed use not to

212
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:10,880
be attached to a particular view there are views ideas opinions which have some value

213
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:17,040
interpretations that have some value but when we hold on to them tight and insist that we're right and this is the right

214
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:23,359
way it tends to cause harm to self and others and buddhism puts a tremendous

215
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:31,119
emphasis on not holding on to fixed views and um and being fluid and relaxed and

216
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:37,760
and flexible with things and not insisting always our views has to be hammered into other

217
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,880
people and overcoming all greed for sensual

218
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:50,000
pleasure so these are very high level of maturity in buddhist practice so this is

219
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:57,760
kind of kind of talking about where buddhist practice is meant to go to evolve

220
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:06,240
to drop into to to be virtuous endowed with vision

221
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:12,880
not taken by views and overcoming all greed for sensual

222
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:19,599
pleasures since your pleasures are okay it's the greed that's the problem

223
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:25,359
all if you do all those things then uh you will not the text goes on says one

224
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:30,960
will not be reborn again and and this is a code word code

225
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,320
expression phrase not being reborn again for a heart which is liberated

226
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:44,000
because a mind that has a heart mind that has no clinging no grasping no attachment

227
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,720
the theory goes that when you die the the heart won't reach out grab on

228
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:57,280
and to the next attachment to the next life and that without that attachment that

229
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,440
greed we allow the uh what in buddhism is considered a beautiful thing

230
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:10,000
a freedom to be the the end result of life and

231
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,160
end of life we kind of let go into kind of a freedom not one more grasping we've done enough

232
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:23,920
grasping in our life and and to come back and grasp grasp more and buddhism is not considered ideal

233
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:30,560
i tend to interpret this stuff about rebirth as being uh how we get born and reborn

234
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,000
moment by moment day by day and and that when we no longer get reborn

235
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,359
this moment moment's way then we live in freedom we also live

236
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:46,720
in love or in goodwill or in metta and this is one of the great things

237
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,839
about liberation it really releases and frees up the

238
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:57,040
goodness of the heart the goodness that we all have and uh the good will that's there

239
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,720
the compassion that's there the the care we have for our fellow humans and our fellow living

240
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,480
beings on this planet may be care even for the planet itself

241
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:16,640
that um we see in the text in the ancient text teachings of the buddha that uh with liberation

242
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:25,838
comes an ease easy access to all four of the brahmaviharas to to

243
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:35,920
loving kindness compassion appreciative joy and equanimity so these things

244
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:43,839
in a sense live in us and and they get revealed they have a chance

245
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:49,520
when we've let go of all the things that get in the way

246
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:55,440
and some of the things that get in the way is not believing in ourselves not believing

247
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:02,400
and trusting and valuing the goodness our own the goodness of the

248
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,440
good heart that we have and um and it seemed like other things

249
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,920
are so much more important but i'd like to say that the good heart we have is probably the most important

250
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:20,960
wealth that you have the most important asset you have stay close to it protect it allow it to

251
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:28,800
grow so much goodness so much wonderfulness comes when the good heart has a breathing room

252
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,880
to be part of our lives and when we lose contact with that good heart then

253
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:41,440
in the buddhist perspective were impoverished and no no

254
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:48,480
amount of wealth and and defensiveness and acquisition

255
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,800
will ever be enough to

256
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,200
to fulfill us we're fulfilled from the inside out when

257
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:07,040
we relax and open and give room breathing room for our good heart

258
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:15,599
so the meta the discourse on loving kindness and so i hope that my

259
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:21,119
my uh spending this week with it is a nice

260
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:26,560
thing it's a wonderful text and uh you might consider

261
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:34,640
memorizing it uh it's said in buddhism that it's one of the protective chants

262
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:41,680
that if you have these chants and you can say them to yourself they protect you and the loving kindness

263
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:47,760
one in particular is that and probably it protects you most from yourself

264
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:53,839
and that's probably where we need the most protection but also who knows how it uh what kind

265
00:42:53,839 --> 00:43:01,760
of wonderful field of goodwill it helps to create when we chant that text and that

266
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:07,280
maybe it protects us from others as well so um i certainly encourage you to

267
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:13,359
memorize it and and and recite it to yourself

268
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:20,880
so thank you and may you be be happy and well and

269
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:27,838
appreciate yourself thank you
