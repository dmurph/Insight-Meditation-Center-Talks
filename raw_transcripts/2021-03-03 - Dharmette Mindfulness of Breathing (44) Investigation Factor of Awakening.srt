1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,639
so

2
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,240
so let me talk a few minutes about this

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,520
uh

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,440
what's often called the investigation

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,040
factor

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,760
um so not quite loud enough someone says

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,720
so let me see

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,199
[Music]

9
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,920
so i think now is it better now the

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,320
sound

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,960
okay so let me

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,800
say a few minutes here about the

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,320
investigation factor of awakening

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,559
and it's usually called investigation

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,320
and people who look into this

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,920
will say that it's probably not the

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,160
right best translation

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,480
but it's a pretty good one overall it's

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,199
an overarching

20
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,039
generalization because

21
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,120
it involves uh a exploration

22
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,040
a discovery a deeper discernment

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,159
of what our experiences and

24
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,720
this process of exploration is in

25
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,080
english is often called investigation

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,759
and but investigation if it means a kind

27
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,320
of a deeper probing in searching

28
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,200
it's not what we're what is referred to

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,000
when we're doing this

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,040
vipassana practice but rather it's a

31
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,479
state of

32
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,079
openness and receptivity to allow

33
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,880
the experience to show itself fully to

34
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,000
us

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,079
and for me it's represented by the

36
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,759
question what

37
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,720
what is happening here what just what is

38
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,439
it

39
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,360
but we never look for an answer

40
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,880
as more that the what prompts a clear

41
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,799
looking a clear discovery

42
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,399
of a kind of a silent kind of

43
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,799
sensing or feeling or looking or

44
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,000
perceiving

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,920
of what is here and and in doing so

46
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,360
we're beginning to

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,040
in enact or tap into

48
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,160
our capacity for freedom that

49
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,599
uh it's so easy to be

50
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,080
caught and entangled by our experiences

51
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,920
by our thoughts by our feelings by

52
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,920
what's happening in the world

53
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,959
and there's so many ways we get

54
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,200
entangled so many ways in which we get

55
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,640
attached we get

56
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,120
reactive to how things are and when

57
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,560
there's reactivity

58
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,440
reactivity by itself is the is not is

59
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:39,840
not

60
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,920
freedom to respond

61
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,800
with choice to respond with wisdom can

62
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,280
it be an enactment of our freedom but

63
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,080
but to react is not so if we're always

64
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,160
reacting and being pulling around by our

65
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,360
thoughts and

66
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,640
hijacked by our thoughts if we feel like

67
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,879
we're a victim of experience

68
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,920
then we haven't discovered freedom

69
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,840
and one of the ways it can begin this

70
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,480
freedom is in acts of mindfulness

71
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,319
to be mindful of what's here but also

72
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,519
acts of mindfulness can also

73
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,319
grow to be a little bit stronger forms

74
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,360
of freedom

75
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,760
which is investigation to uh

76
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,879
to see to discover what is here

77
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,959
and the kind of core investigation

78
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,000
that's part of vipassana practice

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,840
is uh is what further on the retreat

80
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,319
inez talked about yesterday dhamma

81
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,760
vichaya

82
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,840
and vichaya comes from the word prefix v

83
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,799
i

84
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,599
and then the root word c-a-y-a

85
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,400
and um chaya means to heap up to

86
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,840
accumulate

87
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,439
and v means to separate and human beings

88
00:03:59,439 --> 00:03:59,920
have an

89
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,080
amazing and a very important capacity to

90
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,680
generalize to

91
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,720
lump things together to to

92
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,319
hold concepts of things altogether and

93
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,120
and they're useful but also they can

94
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,159
limit our ability

95
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,040
to see clearly what's here to discern

96
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,160
distinguish

97
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,440
the details of our experience so if i

98
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,560
say that i had

99
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,400
um a you know

100
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,680
a difficult morning with the technology

101
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,040
then well that's a generalization but

102
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,120
what specifically was the experience

103
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,479
like of being here with

104
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,800
technology for this morning some of it

105
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,479
was quite delightful and

106
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,720
enjoyable and inspiring to see the

107
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,320
people in the retreat to

108
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,840
see the people on on youtube and

109
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,840
and with the chats for example and and

110
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,160
some of it was quite nice to be

111
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,000
exploring for me exploring the dharma

112
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,240
as i spoke it was nice to sit and

113
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,360
meditate well

114
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,320
while there was some quiet for me and i

115
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,000
was meditating

116
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,919
and and then there was the issue of

117
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,199
the technology that there's so many

118
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,240
different

119
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,080
devices and things here that i got

120
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,680
confused about

121
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,080
which charging battery charger that

122
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,440
was supposed to be at home and what was

123
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,600
supposed to be here and so the

124
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,759
so this with the you know it suddenly

125
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,919
went dark my laptop and

126
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,919
it wasn't actually unpleasant experience

127
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,520
at all it was just kind of it just was

128
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,199
what it was

129
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,120
and um suddenly this was there and there

130
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,720
was an issue to look into

131
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,360
and probably the most unpleasant part of

132
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,479
it all was

133
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,320
needing to ask my wife for some help

134
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,800
when she's busy at home and

135
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,919
and also wondering how i was going to

136
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,759
get back and having running in time for

137
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,520
the zoom people

138
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,000
and then the awkwardness of realizing

139
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,360
that you could hear what i was saying

140
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,479
some of you once

141
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,600
on youtube and um

142
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
let's see you know what what impact did

143
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,080
that have on people meditating and

144
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,319
but that was all very particular and as

145
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,080
i distinguished all the different parts

146
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,720
of it

147
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,319
i wouldn't say it was a challenging

148
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,000
morning here

149
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,400
it was it had its unique challenges its

150
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,919
own particular things

151
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,759
but i didn't lump it all together as

152
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,440
like a lousy morning with

153
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,039
technology it was all these little if

154
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,600
i wrote out the details the distinctions

155
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,000
of moment moment what was happening

156
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,600
there were challenging parts and not

157
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,039
challenging parts there were pleasant

158
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,560
parts maybe some parts that were not so

159
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,759
pleasant

160
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,919
and this ability to begin distinguishing

161
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,600
and not lump

162
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,360
and in sense buddhists are you know if

163
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,960
you know the distinction between lumpers

164
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,280
and splitters

165
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,759
buddhism thrives on on being splitters

166
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,000
on really seeing more and more carefully

167
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,840
what's really happening here

168
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,520
what are the details rather than

169
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,759
generalizing about things

170
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,039
and so this idea of this uh disability

171
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,240
this clarity of mind

172
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,160
that gets cultivated through mindfulness

173
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,479
when the mind gets clearer and clearer

174
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,639
and the details the particular

175
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,560
particularities the details of

176
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,680
experience the

177
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,880
unique little component parts of

178
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,319
experience

179
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,400
begin revealing themselves more and more

180
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,240
and more

181
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,919
and where that becomes particularly

182
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,560
important is when the capacity to

183
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,800
distinguish to see the particularities

184
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,280
the details of what goes on

185
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,919
is is

186
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,639
goes together with wisdom the wisdom

187
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,840
factor

188
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,280
and the wisdom factor is uh the

189
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,960
one the many things that are considered

190
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,560
wisdom

191
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,120
the factor of wisdom in in this practice

192
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,080
we do

193
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,639
but one of the core aspects is being

194
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,879
able to make the distinction

195
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,720
between what is helpful and what is not

196
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,800
the distinction what is wholesome and

197
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,639
what is not

198
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,360
what is healthy and what is not or the

199
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,199
distinction between what

200
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,240
has a an ouch in it or an ah

201
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,440
this is good or a distinction between

202
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,000
what is where freedom is or where

203
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,759
freedom is not

204
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,879
that distinction is a is the what wisdom

205
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,720
is capable of making

206
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,759
mindfulness puts us in the clarity that

207
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,240
we see things as they are

208
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,120
and see them clear and clear and wisdom

209
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,599
sees

210
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,959
what is useful and what is not and that

211
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:34,479
distinction

212
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,760
is where we discover the path where we

213
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,839
discover

214
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,320
uh where the choices can be

215
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,640
and so the simple distinction between

216
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,120
being entangled in experience

217
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,959
and being free when we investigate it

218
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,880
with wisdom we see actually it's better

219
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,000
to be free

220
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,880
than entangled and so to the degree

221
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,640
which we have in a capacity

222
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,680
we put effort and energy into going in

223
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,480
the direction

224
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,839
of freedom and in this case investigate

225
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:06,480
or

226
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,440
discern or see more clearly what the

227
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,240
experience is

228
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,519
and so it said that the the the

229
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,600
investigation factor of awakening that

230
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,680
clarity of mind that can really see the

231
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,800
details

232
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,880
of experience not lumping the

233
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,040
generalization of what it is

234
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,560
that that ability

235
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,480
then inspires the effort factor of

236
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,000
awakening the energy

237
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,080
because we see oh this is the direction

238
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,360
to go

239
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,160
this is where freedom is this is where

240
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,880
peace is

241
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,920
this is where um

242
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,160
the lack of stress the lack of suffering

243
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,040
is found

244
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,440
and that's inspiring to make that choice

245
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,200
and go in that direction

246
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,080
to go in that direction is another

247
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,120
manifestation

248
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,959
of our capacity for inner freedom

249
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,360
and as we walk this path we keep

250
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,760
discovering more and more ways

251
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,200
in which we can manifest or enact

252
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,399
our freedom until at some point freedom

253
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,839
becomes a state

254
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,880
that we live in as opposed to

255
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,120
something we find in the details of our

256
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,880
you know of how we live and the choices

257
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,680
we make in our life

258
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,360
so the investigation mindfulness

259
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,959
leads to the capacity to see

260
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,480
clearly that's called discernment

261
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,160
making distinctions investigation

262
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,760
and that in itself then is a

263
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,800
prompt or a catalyst for the effort

264
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,519
factor in practice so that the effort

265
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,800
factor of awakening can get born and

266
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,079
and come to fulfillment

267
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,440
and that'll be the topic for the next

268
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,360
topic for the retreat and the next topic

269
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,079
for

270
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,839
youtube and like tomorrow morning

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,519
so um thank you and

272

and i think this hopefully this uh

273
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,000
little technology issue today um

274
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,200
