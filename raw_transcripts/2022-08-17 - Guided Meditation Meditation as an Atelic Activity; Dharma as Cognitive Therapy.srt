1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,720
so good morning uh good morning to to uh some

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:15,040
afternoon and evening uh lovely to see where everyone's calling in from

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,279
um it's raining here in berkeley which is very unusual

4
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:27,760
um for this time of year and it feels whenever it rains even in the rainy

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,679
season feels very good these days in california

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:42,800
so um i'll uh share a few thoughts and we'll sit and have uh our usual uh form

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,079
so this is from um a book um from kieran kieran sataya

8
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,760
who's a philosopher talking about goals the goal directed

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,840
life the value of goals and then the limits of goals

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,600
says um what gives purpose to your life is having

11
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,240
goals yet in pursuing them you either fail not good or in succeeding

12
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:19,040
bring them to a close if what you care about is achievement earning a promotion having a child

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,680
writing a book saving a life the completion of your project may bring may be of value

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,680
but it means that the project can no longer be your guide sure you have other goals and you can

15
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,200
formulate new ones the problem is not the risk of running out

16
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,200
it is that your engagement with value is self-destructive

17
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,240
the way in which you relate to the activities that matter most to you

18
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,240
is by trying to complete them and so expel them from your life

19
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:01,119
your days are devoted to ending one by one the activities

20
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,920
that give them meaning

21
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:17,200
for me that captures something important important really about what

22
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,280
the buddha said of of dukkha of uh

23
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,680
unsatisfactoriness that if we live exclusively in this goal

24
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:35,200
directed life our relationship to those projects is

25
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:43,200
self-destructive we complete things and expel them from our life and then have to look for more

26
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,480
and there's something fatiguing for the heart in that

27
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,200
now is meditation like that too i think in some ways you can say yeah meditation

28
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,800
is a goal-oriented activity to heal to wake up

29
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,920
but if it's not just a goal-oriented

30
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,360
activity some of meditation practice

31
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,680
is about stepping out of goal orientation entirely

32
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,680
and resting with nowhere to go

33
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:33,840
and no goals to achieve and nothing to do other than

34
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,440
be present and so it's confusing i think for us

35
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,560
practitioners to sense the goal directed dimension of practice

36
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:54,959
but then also the [Music] the language and philosophy like atylic

37
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:02,000
not goal directed and atylic activities are

38
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,280
only ever done in the present moment that's where it happens

39
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:17,680
and so this morning or just try to guide us in that that atylic

40
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,400
side of practice of like really stepping out of the realm of

41
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,320
goal orientation where we strive and achieve and expel our goals from our

42
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,160
life something in the heart is restored when we

43
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,880
take a walk with nowhere to go or listen to a loved one

44
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,240
with nothing to achieve or sit in meditation

45
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,080
with nowhere to go nothing that needs to happen

46
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,080
whatsoever

47
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,759
so please uh find your posture

48
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:14,680
just uh arriving right here

49
00:06:50,880 --> 00:07:01,319
maybe using using the your body breathing as a way of arriving

50
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:15,199
maybe there is something that

51
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,960
just gently put down

52
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,960
but from here on out and this said

53
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:57,000
we're not trying to go anywhere

54
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,000
we're not trying to engineer

55
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,840
concentration

56
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,279
not seeking insight

57
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,800
or even tranquility

58
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:59,600
just a little bit fed up with the relentlessness of our goal

59
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,600
seeking

60
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,880
and so we put it down all at once

61
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:32,160
so deep is the habit of goal making

62
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,920
striving and expelling

63
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,839
goals from our life

64
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:52,760
that we turn our meditation into it too

65
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:04,759
and we turn ourselves into self-improvement project

66
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,040
but for now we surrender

67
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:41,040
all notions of progress of regress of moving

68
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,160
somewhere anywhere no

69
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:53,839
refuge outside this moment

70
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,639
and the anchor if you have one the breath at the

71
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:27,839
nostrils or belly the whole body

72
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,079
sound the whole sphere of sensory experience

73
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,160
whatever the anchor is

74
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,880
it's only a way of reminding you

75
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,320
to surrender striving

76
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,680
to be here

77
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,678
thinking is uh can be

78
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,000
a powerful tool for solving

79
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,319
for achieving goals strategizing

80
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,840
but we're practicing non-achievement

81
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:57,039
and so our thinking strategizing simulating futures

82
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:03,840
problem solving it's not wrong it's just beside the

83
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,240
point

84
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:18,360
it's just a way that our goal making creeps in the side door

85
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:46,000
so we keep relaxing [Music] into all that's already here

86
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,679
keep relaxing into non-achievement

87
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,559
everything that strives in us finally gets to rest

88
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:49,120
and everything that evaluates and contests our enoughness

89
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,400
also gets to rest

90
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,559
because the only refuge

91
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,639
is the imperfection of this moment

92
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,360
and its beauty and brokenness

93
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,440
this is the only point

94
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:12,890
foreign [Music]

95
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:22,099
[Music]

96
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,760
okay thank you it's good to uh

97
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:40,559
good to sit with you um i tried to uh

98
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:45,600
ring the bell more loudly my little electronic bell

99
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:51,840
hope you heard that this morning um

100
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:59,919
okay well more to be said about those kinds of instructions

101
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:07,200
so um let's keep going

102
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,680
um [Music]

103
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,799
i i am uh often amazed that um

104
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,360
kind of short low-dose mindfulness interventions uh eight-week

105
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,720
interventions that have a lot of wisdom in them but they that's a there's a low

106
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,840
dose yeah they seem to develo actually deliver

107
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:44,799
positive benefits results and my sense is that if if

108
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:50,080
mindfulness and these kinds of mindfulness-based

109
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,440
interventions were merely attention therapy

110
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,880
i don't think we'd see benefits after eight weeks it's too short too small a

111
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:07,840
dose but this path of practice is many things

112
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:16,399
yeah it's not merely an attention therapy even in an eight-week mbsr program for

113
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:21,519
example mindfulness-based stress reduction there's social support and a

114
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:27,120
lot of new views that are introduced

115
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:36,640
religions are really a kind of attempt at a cognitive therapy

116
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:42,000
in part yeah and yesterday i spoke about

117
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,200
the dharma as an attention therapy

118
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:55,278
and today the the second mechanism dharma has a cognitive therapy

119
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:02,960
and so cognitive therapy is um [Music] this approach suggests that maladaptive

120
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:11,039
thoughts about self and world and future lead to emotional pain psychiatric

121
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:20,000
symptoms and so uh classically this is um beck

122
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,480
says schemas which are central to information

123
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:32,880
processing reflect various beliefs expectancies evaluations and

124
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:40,080
attributions and serve to order everyday experience

125
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,279
when information processing becomes distorted other systems affective

126
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:50,320
motivational behavioral begin to function in a maladaptive

127
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:55,760
manner schemas can be modified in response to

128
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:02,399
potent new information adaptively modified schemas deactivate

129
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:09,599
dysfunctional schemas which leads to a reduction in symptoms

130
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:18,398
so we're living our life in a situation something happens it elicits

131
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:25,440
schemas which elicits emotions and motivations and behaviors

132
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:32,398
and so the treatment is that maladaptive thoughts are explored and challenged and

133
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:37,599
self and world and future are reappraised

134
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:45,040
reappraised we we reconstrue self and world

135
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:52,960
and classic kind of distortions of over generalizing or catastrophizing

136
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:58,640
or dichotomous black white thinking

137
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,720
these distortions are corrected

138
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:10,640
and those corrections are said to lead to more adaptive appraisals of the world

139
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,880
more adaptive functional schemas

140
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:24,480
it's the structure of cognitive therapy cognitive behavioral therapy

141
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,800
uh a blend and um

142
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:35,359
practice is a cognitive therapy too

143
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:41,119
in part it begins with wise view right with understanding

144
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,799
right understanding right view

145
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:52,640
the buddha says with wrong view wrong everything follows

146
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:59,280
yeah with wrong view wrong effort wrong action wrong speech

147
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,480
all the stuff that gets us into trouble this follows on the heels of wrong view

148
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:11,520
so we pick up wise view right and the dharma introduces so many

149
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,640
views yeah so many views so many ways of perceiving

150
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:24,960
experience that are adaptive functional a functional schema

151
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:31,200
this is how you divide up experience not good and evil

152
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:40,480
but suffering and freedom from suffering that's the distinction to attend to

153
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:49,039
it invites the view that clinging hurts always trying to

154
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,160
control experience hurts

155
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:02,880
the view that suffering can be redeemed this is a path of purification

156
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:10,480
and suffering is not a brute fact in the way we imagine

157
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:17,839
it can be redeemed it can be transmuted into

158
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:21,800
wisdom love

159
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:30,320
the view that everything you are is a facet of nature

160
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:37,920
and that the story of me is forever at least

161
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,680
a little wrong and so the buddha invites a view of the

162
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:50,640
self that is fresh the self as a kind of to use

163
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:57,440
some philosophical language from gilbert ryall the self as a

164
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:03,839
category mistake so this is ryle

165
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:10,560
foreigner visiting oxford or cambridge for the first time has shown a number of colleges libraries playing fields

166
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:16,240
museums scientific departments and administrative offices

167
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:21,599
he then asks but where is the university

168
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:28,640
it has then to be explained to him that the university is not another collateral

169
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:34,560
institution some ulterior counterpart to the college's laboratories and

170
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:42,000
offices which he has seen the university is just the way in which

171
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,480
all that he has already seen is organized

172
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:59,720
the buddha introduces a view of the self like this

173
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:07,440
now part of what we're doing is uh in our practice is beginning to detect

174
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:13,960
the s stories and schemas we live by

175
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:23,280
some of which are quite obvious and some are very subtle but all the things we believe without knowing we have fidelity

176
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:30,480
to them these kind of wild absurd

177
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,960
beliefs that if we actually said them out loud they would seem utterly ridiculous

178
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:44,480
but there's a part of us that has fidelity to them i should be

179
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:51,440
perfect yeah should be loved by everyone

180
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:57,520
the next possession is going to

181
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,520
make me finally happy

182
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,920
i shouldn't experience physical and emotional discomfort i

183
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,359
shouldn't get sick maybe should never die

184
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:22,079
we're much more suggestible than we believe if

185
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,680
we feel so autonomous these are my views but they're

186
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:33,359
conditioned by a million factors right so

187
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:38,560
we are all of our time in a way

188
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:45,520
and so many cultural inheritances and stories about our bodies and about

189
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:53,119
our affective life stories about strength and weakness about the nature of

190
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:57,039
happiness and the good life

191
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:05,280
and um and we just take these things on we take these things on we're more permeable

192
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:12,560
than we recognize and so we look we look we investigate what are

193
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:19,280
the stories we live by and our stories about ourselves are so

194
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:27,040
often charged with a kind of moralism yeah kind of infantile

195
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:35,800
toddler-ish moralism our egos are a kind of tangle of moralism

196
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:43,040
and so we start to see i have a lot of maladaptive beliefs

197
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:50,240
about happiness we basically assume the opposite of the

198
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,640
three characteristics

199
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:04,960
suffering unreliability impermanence not self

200
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:13,119
fantasy that some some pleasure will end all seeking

201
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:18,640
fantasy that the more choice we have the better we are

202
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:28,240
the researcher about choice yeah how could five choices possibly be

203
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:35,040
worse than two but yeah sometimes the proliferation of options can have a

204
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:41,040
variety of negative effects on well-being as options are added within a domain of choice three problems

205
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:47,599
materialize first there is the problem of gaining adequate information about the options

206
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:53,520
to make a choice second there's the problem that as options expand

207
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:59,599
people's standards for what's acceptable rises and third

208
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:04,720
there is the problem that options expand people may come to believe that any

209
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:12,160
unacceptable result is their fault because with so many options they should have been able to find a satisfactory

210
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:19,200
one in dharma

211
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:25,040
a lot of our happiness comes in narrowing choice narrowing the menu

212
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,079
in all spheres

213
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:40,279
we have the sense that if we worry in just the right way we'll be able to game out aneesha

214
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,480
to manage uh uncertainty

215
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:54,040
and anxiety is is um is the intolerance of uncertainty

216
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:05,200
we have the sense that um if i accomplish this or that become this or that i'll finally feel

217
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:11,839
like a grown-up yeah finally land in a kind of identity and

218
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:17,280
feel at home and

219
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:22,680
that moment never comes as far as i can tell

220
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:30,560
and so we look what are our organizing assumptions and how is the cognitive

221
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:36,599
therapy of dharma relevant

222
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:44,480
yesterday i spoke about the attentional dharma as a kind of attentional therapy

223
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:50,800
and these two interact the cognitive therapy and the attentional therapy because

224
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:57,839
as i was alluding to yesterday when the mind is steady stable concentrated it's

225
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:02,880
very valuable very elastic

226
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:09,440
and the cognitive changes the new views we introduce

227
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:16,880
has um more staying power the learning induced

228
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:22,079
has more staying power makes deeper

229
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,520
marks in our being

230
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:33,838
so i offer this for consideration and

231
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,838
yeah happy to be with you and look forward to

232
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:51,119
tomorrow okay uh thank you uh thank you all i wish you a good

233
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,400
good day
