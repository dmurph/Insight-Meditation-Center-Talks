1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:09,319
so um let's uh let's sit together here

2
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,439
had a yoga teacher sometimes say uh what what is

3
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,960
what does light make heavy what is heavy make light

4
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:35,079
yeah in a posture and an asana what is light make heavy what is heavy make light

5
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,200
pointing to this gesture of uh

6
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,680
smoothing out smoothing out body mind

7
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,719
evening out the energies of body mind

8
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,400
we can use the the breath

9
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,959
as a way of unifying smoothing

10
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:39,319
energies of the moment

11
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,920
so what is hyped up hyperactive

12
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,200
bring the soothing breath to

13
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,360
ah that constellation of feeling in my chest let

14
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:31,319
me breathe into that

15
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,280
soon that

16
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:18,639
maybe there are places of of numbness or fatigue sloth

17
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,560
and we breathe life into it

18
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,199
spine reaching upwards to the sky

19
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,160
the rest of the body hanging loosely

20
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:04,360
just unifying the field with the breathing feeling the breath in your whole body

21
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:54,440
what would we do if we weren't busy clinging

22
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,479
clinging is inherently agitating

23
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,479
complicating

24
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:36,240
it's so easy to repeat our habits of greed

25
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:43,880
version as we said

26
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,440
and yet practice is practicing

27
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,040
non-clinging and i use that word practicing in the

28
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,800
same sense that one might practice a free throw

29
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,200
playing basketball

30
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:40,480
or clinging was like a little whirlpool

31
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,040
of energy somewhere in body mind

32
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:57,120
what does light make heavy what is heavy make light we smooth out

33
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,120
the energy especially of our body

34
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,640
and rather than acting out greed we practice

35
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:29,839
practice equanimity with longing

36
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,759
rather than act out aversion

37
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:48,120
we practice equanimity with imperfection

38
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,240
this way

39
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:14,880
our moment starts to get very simple

40
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,680
clinging is complicated

41
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,519
letting go feels very simple

42
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,959
simplifies

43
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,799
the moment can get very simple

44
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,559
sacred really

45
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:05,880
sense of the dharma coursing through it

46
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:49,080
and just to rest there is no

47
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,840
my

48
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:07,120
sometimes i i'd say like that it um

49
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,559
it feels like the the first

50
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:19,760
noble truth contains the other three yeah

51
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:27,039
that somehow uh if we can open the dukkha yeah

52
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:32,640
that's there's no joke and um

53
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,480
it's easy to get familiar with with suffering in a way and say oh yeah i get

54
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:45,520
i get the truth of dukkha but um but do we realize it

55
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:53,440
in the sense that sedgwick talked about realization of making

56
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,398
something real

57
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,640
a friend who who recently

58
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,240
finished a long retreat said during during this time

59
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,559
sometimes the memory of the suffering of a pet from

60
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:23,279
decades ago would just like pierce her heart

61
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:31,120
and there's a bumper sticker that says i break for suffering

62
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,278
but the question is like would we

63
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,600
would we ever hit the accelerator right

64
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:51,760
it's a major project to open to one's own suffering

65
00:30:51,760 --> 00:31:01,518
major but sometimes the the suffering of the other is even more evocative

66
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,799
yeah it can be evocative in ways that open us

67
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:15,200
to deep compassion yeah so we see the suffering of a loved

68
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:22,240
one and the heart just naturally opens

69
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:29,200
and sometimes of course our care gets tangled up

70
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:35,200
with our clinging and our control

71
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:42,000
and with our preferences or our needs

72
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,600
and we have entrusted our our heart to

73
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:53,360
another by choice or by birth and

74
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:58,799
what that means is that in a sense all of their suffering feels

75
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:03,200
like our business yeah

76
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,360
as a child the the suffering or imperfection of a

77
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:18,559
parent has huge implications for our sense of of uh safety of protection

78
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:25,120
and so their pain their confusion their greed their hate

79
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:30,159
is itself destabilizing for

80
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:35,518
for the child right for ourselves as children

81
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,600
and there's a kind of yeah there's a deep wobble that can

82
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:47,440
happen in our own heart when we see

83
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,600
loved ones in pain or we see loved ones

84
00:32:53,600 --> 00:33:01,159
acting acting out their own defilements

85
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:07,679
and in a sense their neurosis

86
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:14,159
could be just a kind of opportunity for our own care compassion

87
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:19,760
but their neurosis usually interacts with our neurosis it's like

88
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:25,399
they're clinging tangles with our clinging

89
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,600
friend teacher was was telling me that

90
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:37,360
you know at a family gathering i kind of you know this is pre-coveted

91
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:44,320
family gathering with the uh you know his family his wife's family

92
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:49,919
and he says to his wife like uh you know can you believe how my mom's acting i'm

93
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:56,080
sorry and his wife says no no no your mom is

94
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,679
fine can you believe how my mom's acting right

95
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:08,560
sort of like oh yeah something particular gets evoked in us

96
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:16,320
along these lines of of connection of love of clinging

97
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:23,118
and um you know researchers have uh

98
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:29,520
have done um brain imaging you know when one person

99
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:36,240
is seeing a loved one suffer you know in some way do a pain task actually

100
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:43,280
some way of of um of knowing that a loved one is is um

101
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:49,358
you know uh is is uncomfortable there's they're actually part of the research is for the

102
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:54,398
other one too to be in some pain

103
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:00,720
and a lot of our brain lights up regions uh associated with understanding the

104
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:07,200
state of the other but also a kind of affective resonance

105
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:14,520
and some of the same things happen in our brain as if we were in pain

106
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:23,040
um kitty sorrow and tenisra beloved

107
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,720
teachers in this lineage were monastics for for many years and

108
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:36,560
then left the monastic lineage and where i've been a couple for a long

109
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:42,880
time now and still you know very

110
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:48,320
obviously serious practitioners teachers and they're asked at one point like what's

111
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:56,240
it like to be in relationship and um and kirisara said it's like two people

112
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:01,839
under one robe yeah referring to the monastic experience two

113
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:09,040
people under one robe their goodness their suffering

114
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:17,760
all under one robe and when we when we see suffering in our

115
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:25,359
own life it can get us just naturally scrambling to re-order

116
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:31,040
circumstances yeah and when we see suffering of someone

117
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:36,320
close to us it kind of does the same thing

118
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:42,800
we habitually move into this mode of just we're trying to reorder

119
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:49,280
circumstances but that often means we're trying to reorder them

120
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,480
who they are and so the compassion the care becomes

121
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,560
entangled it becomes

122
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:06,880
it's no longer free and our aversion or our fear

123
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:13,200
or that's what's driving the show we get

124
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:19,599
frustrated get controlling and then we try to change them through

125
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:26,800
our own frustration and

126
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:35,119
you know when i think about what what do i want in all my relationships

127
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,240
well really i want them all to be our hearts

128
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:46,480
yeah to be fully enlightened i get to be

129
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:52,240
a basket of defilements but they better be

130
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:58,960
deeply enlightened right and

131
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:06,160
the greed the aversion the delusion the non-enlightenment i perceived in loved

132
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:13,040
ones is especially evocative for me it spins me

133
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:21,520
and on the one hand i know if i respond to my own suffering in that way it's

134
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:28,200
totally unproductive but it's somehow harder to resist

135
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:34,640
interpersonally yeah for their greed aversion delusion not to spin me

136
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:40,800
in a way i know is unproductive so yeah may they all be enlightened

137
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:48,560
right but then again in the end

138
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:54,640
even if i lived with the buddha i know i would get irritated by

139
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,640
something you know

140
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:07,040
honey you know uh lord buddha

141
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:14,680
can't you see i'm angry yeah why are you so calm

142
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:22,240
yeah there was a an interview with a writer who was asked if literature changes

143
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:27,839
people and uh the writer said

144
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:36,000
i don't think people change very much to the extent that people change at all

145
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,839
it's because of some encounter that has love in it

146
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:51,920
it's hard to uh hard to change it's hard to grow we know

147
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:59,839
that yeah sometimes it happens in a flash but a lot of times

148
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:05,839
it's very incremental it's hard to grow it's hard to change

149
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:14,160
and if we're gonna do it for sure love will be involved

150
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:22,160
yeah and the irony the

151
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:28,160
the people we most want to change are the ones

152
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:34,319
we tend to be most enraged by yeah

153
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,440
even if that frustration is subtle you know

154
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:48,079
and yet we know anger anger aversion that is the single

155
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:53,359
worst way to support someone in their change in

156
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,318
their evolution

157
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:07,680
so we're going to have to tolerate some ambivalent and

158
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:13,280
we're going to have to open our heart to the imperfection of the other

159
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:20,760
just in the same way we open our heart to the imperfection of ourselves

160
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:27,520
compassion is not an insistence that someone change

161
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,839
it's not an insistence that someone changed

162
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:41,040
deep deep acceptance

163
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:47,359
forgiveness it doesn't mean condoning harm but

164
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:53,200
forgiveness and what is forgiveness other than

165
00:41:53,200 --> 00:42:02,440
really just understanding understanding their inner life

166
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:11,599
so we investigate uh what does the

167
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:19,280
