1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,960
so hello everyone and

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,040
and we come to the end of this week the end of this five part series on

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,480
i'm calling it finding our way and

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:27,519
these days have been somewhat progressive um with the pointing towards

5
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,680
first to contentment then to gladness

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:42,239
then to joy then to happiness and today the topic will be peace

7
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,800
peace and agitation finding our way with that

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,160
and um and so this week uh the idea in my mind

9
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,000
or in my heart my body is that uh with the practice

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,320
we begin settling into ourselves settling in to these uh

11
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,880
places that inside the states inside which are available to us

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,799
but are often eclipsed by agitation by

13
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,479
preoccupations by busyness of life and to become quiet

14
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,000
to be able to let go relax enough to be able to touch into

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,200
our capacity for contentment and gladness joy happiness and now peace

16
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,479
so today the topic is peace and

17
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:49,920
i think it's really really important to understand that how peace can begin with ourselves

18
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,960
and then in buddhist practice that's where we tend to start if we want peace we start with ourselves

19
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,360
and we start by being peaceful so that seems a little hard

20
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:10,560
to start with to want what we don't have and then start with it the idea is that

21
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,040
two things around this one is

22
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,120
bring into the meditation whatever sense of peace peacefulness that's available

23
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,400
to you and one of the important areas of that is

24
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,040
in the knowing in the attention you bring to whatever is happening here and now

25
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,879
if you're bringing attention to your breathing to your posture your body if you're bringing attention to your

26
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:45,519
emotions or your your inner mental life your thoughts can you let that

27
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,680
attention can you bring that attention or evoke that attention

28
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:58,239
engage that attention in a way that has some kind of peacefulness to it

29
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,080
it doesn't have to be dramatic but that's where it begins

30
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,560
and then the second thing which is uh different than the first but the two can go together

31
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,440
is rather than

32
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,519
being too active and be making yourself peaceful

33
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:31,879
avoid agitating yourself avoid agitation

34
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:39,120
rather than become peaceful don't participate in the agitation don't

35
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,400
go along with it and one way not to go along with it is

36
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:52,719
to be aware of it peacefully there it is my agitation my old friend

37
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:02,720
peace begins with oneself so taking a assuming a meditation posture

38
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:10,000
and giving some care to the posture in a

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,840
peaceful way so that the attention to the posture and getting things lined up and settled

40
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,960
is done not in a hurry and not ambitiously

41
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,000
but peacefully

42
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,160
and then to gently close your eyes

43
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,280
taking a few long slow deep breaths

44
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:25,199
letting your breathing return to normal in an

45
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:33,360
unhurried way go through your body and as you exhale

46
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,198
relax and soften in your body

47
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,560
and then if it's appropriate you can center

48
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,440
yourself on your breathing

49
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,560
and as you exhale

50
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,160
to quiet the mind

51
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,960
maybe you can't stop thinking but can you quiet

52
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,199
your thinking

53
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,039
and in the times in your life where you felt peaceful

54
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,080
where in your body that sense of peacefulness reside

55
00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:01,360
might there be a place in your body that you associate with peacefulness

56
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,280
a place that feels quiet or calm

57
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,840
feel settled or content

58
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,520
feels unagitated

59
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:27,840
calm tranquil

60
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,120
and to maybe breathe

61
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,760
with this place

62
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,600
maybe the memory or the sense of this place being peaceful

63
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,959
can help the awareness your attention to be peaceful too

64
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,519
so

65
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:07,120
whatever degree of peacefulness you have right now no matter how small a little peace there

66
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,160
is notice the peacefulness

67
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:25,920
and then see if you can avoid becoming more agitated

68
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:34,279
and if that's all you do that will be a great meditation

69
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
so

70
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,399
so then as we come to the end of the sitting

71
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:12,760
to [Music] consider

72
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:20,640
how healthy and helpful it is for this world for there to be more peace

73
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:28,960
that the people we run into in our lives today chances are

74
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:35,360
they could use a little bit more peacefulness maybe being agitated being afraid being

75
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,559
angry confused

76
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:48,399
so to um consider how is it that whatever peace

77
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:53,840
that you have whatever way you live your life

78
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,799
can you in some gentle way

79
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,480
bring peacefulness to this world a sense of peace

80
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:12,158
and probably best that it's not too noticeable

81
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:19,600
just that you're calm or centered or available in a nice way

82
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:27,200
may it be that this practice that we do serves for the welfare and happiness of

83
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:34,480
others and for this world may all beings be happy

84
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,799
may all beings be peaceful

85
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:46,960
may all beings be safe may all beings

86
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,919
be free

87
00:30:53,930 --> 00:31:07,860
[Music]

88
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,640
thank you

89
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:24,000
so in buddhism is often associated with peace

90
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:30,640
and in fact the emotional

91
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:37,200
um manifestations of awakening of freedom that the buddha

92
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:43,279
points to is most commonly associated with happiness and peace

93
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:48,640
peace and happiness and

94
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:55,600
and the opposite of peace is maybe agitation conflict

95
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,159
and and that's part of our world we navigate a world where we get agitated

96
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,519
we get we're calm and then we're not so calm we're maybe somewhat peaceful but then

97
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:15,840
we're not peaceful we're agitated and then we're less agitated

98
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:23,679
and and so how do we fall how do we find our way in this world of navigating in all

99
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:30,559
this when do we emphasize peaceful peace

100
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:37,919
appreciate it value it cultivate it when do we um

101
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:43,440
allow ourselves to become agitated or less peaceful or

102
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,760
allow there to be energized in a dynamic way that doesn't feel very peaceful

103
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:57,120
and there are times for both and as we're living in this world there are times when it's appropriate to put

104
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:03,120
aside our peace and let ourselves kind of enter into the world of doing and activity

105
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:09,760
and not being so concerned about whether we're agitated or not or lost our calm or not

106
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,799
so there's times for peace and there's times where peace is not

107
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:20,000
really the name of the game not really appropriate and and there are times when there's

108
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,159
agitation which is inappropriate and really a challenge and it makes our life much more difficult

109
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:32,880
and there's a time to allow ourselves to become agitated or lose some of our calm

110
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:39,760
if you're you know they're you know it's easy to argue that it's maybe always good to be calm

111
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:45,679
but realistically i don't know if that's really going to happen unless we're living

112
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:51,679
you know a solitary quiet lifestyle if you're living in someplace in your

113
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:59,120
neighbor comes knocking at your door with a i don't know with a big injury and asks

114
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,960
you to take them to the emergency that's not the time to

115
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:12,240
be excessively concerned about your calm and as you get to the emergency and your maybe your

116
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:18,320
neighbor can't talk much at this point and so you're having to explain and

117
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:24,320
and be engaged in the activity and and i think that chances are is that that's going to be

118
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:31,200
you're not going to keep your calm you're going to be activated in some strong way and enough so that when your

119
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:38,079
friend is finally being taken care of and you can sit quietly you see how much activation there is you're spun up

120
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:44,638
and but that's not wrong to have that happen in the circumstances in fact to be holding on to the calm and

121
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:50,638
the peace and let's let's kind of make our way to the car slowly and peacefully and

122
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,240
you know and count our steps and every step say peace that's not really the name of the game

123
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:03,760
it's uh we have to let go of any emphasis on peace and just engage in what's needed

124
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,359
being in the world with what's needed is part of what dharma practice is about

125
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:16,240
and so certainly it's possible to be attached to peace and hold on to it it's possible to kind

126
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:22,880
of pretend we're peaceful or kind of hold ourselves kind of hold ourselves kind of contain ourselves

127
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:29,119
in certain kind of ways so it's kind of like we're not agitated physically we're not moving around a lot or

128
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,160
we're kind of staying close to something that looks like peace but it's more attachment and

129
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:41,359
manufactured and not really real the the ability to navigate between kind

130
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:47,359
of activated states and peaceful states it's a lot easier if we're fluid to go

131
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:53,520
between them and this fluidity if we can't if we resist one or hold on to one

132
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:59,680
then we're not fluid and then it's not easy to go back and forth between them in fact one of the

133
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:07,200
principles of dharma practice that i value a lot is not that we have any we attain any

134
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:13,680
particular state as if that's the state that we're supposed to be in there's all kinds of

135
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,880
mental states embodied states that we can experience and to be free

136
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:25,040
is to have fluidity to be able to move between them and back and forth

137
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,720
uh and if we have that fluidity then we can kind of navigate this world

138
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,839
of all the differences much quicker and more easy if we don't have that fluidity we become

139
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:40,880
fragile we're holding on we're resisting we are threatenable and because what

140
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,079
we're holding on to is threatened or what we're afraid is going to happen will come and overwhelm us

141
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:52,720
but if we kind of can kind of surf with it kind of navigate and and um

142
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:59,520
with fluidity with ease with relaxation not holding on to anything and not resisting much in at least in the

143
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:06,400
inner life it's much easier to let go it's much easier to not be troubled by things

144
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:12,240
so there's activated states in life and there's peaceful states calm states

145
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,079
and sometimes it's healthy just to move between them with fluidity and it's okay

146
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,920
to be activated it's okay to kind of lose our calm sometimes and sometimes it's not

147
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:31,040
sometimes we lose our calm and we make mistakes and we make the whole thing worse agitation can create a lot of stress and

148
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:36,880
exhaustion and so navigating between this

149
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:42,560
is part of this and and uh it's a the uh it's much harder if

150
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:48,079
we're as i'm saying we're clinging clinging grasping holding on resisting

151
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:54,320
all those create more agitation and less peace

152
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:59,440
non-clinging non-attachment create more fluidity

153
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:06,160
less attachment more appropriate peace and a greater capacity to

154
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:14,560
flow out of that piece when something else is needed and was no longer needed flowing back to a calm state or be centered

155
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:22,800
so so finding our way with peace and activation peace and agitation

156
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:29,920
some of this has to do with becoming connoisseurs of both not just become experts on peace but

157
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,520
become experts on agitation itself that mindfulness is really to see and

158
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,560
understand how our life works what's really like these things we go through

159
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:46,560
and so spend time and when you're agitated what and with the question what is this agitation

160
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:54,079
how am i experiencing it what's being triggered where does it live in me what's my relationship to this agitation

161
00:38:54,079 --> 00:39:01,440
do i believe it do i go headlong into it am i resisting it am i judging it am i

162
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:07,040
um critical of myself for being agitated there's all these things to study and

163
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:12,320
become much more aware of and we can study it we can bring a

164
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:17,680
peaceful mindfulness to that a non-conflictive mindfulness so this is

165
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,800
how it is this is how it is and equally well we want to study peace

166
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:29,920
we want to get to understand and become connoisseurs and recognize it even the small hints of it even when it's a very

167
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:35,280
minor piece be able to recognize when it's available

168
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:41,520
peace is much more available than most people realize most situations we're in

169
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:48,800
have more peace somehow somewhere in the center of them in the corner of them than the busy activated mind allows

170
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:55,280
ourselves to tune into so to study these things get to know them more

171
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:01,680
and that brings us into the capacity to recognize when we cling when we resist

172
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,800
where our attachments are and as the practice deepens

173
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:13,040
there's a process of letting go or relaxing or softening our

174
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:18,640
attachments it goes deeper and deeper and deeper more and more to the core of who we are

175
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,760
and we start letting go of small things that's a training to let go of the

176
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,520
deeper attachments and the deeper attachments and and then we don't want to

177
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:35,839
become attached to letting go we don't want to be attached to these deeper states of well-being and

178
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:43,920
peace that might be there that is a recipe for agitation again unhealthy agitation

179
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:49,520
and then and then to drop down deeper and deeper

180
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:54,800
to to some of the deepest places we can let go

181
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:01,599
to and so the deepest piece is what's called release

182
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,880
release is peace the deepest peace comes from a profound

183
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:14,079
release where we're no longer in the world of polarities between peace and agitation

184
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:20,480
where we're centered in such a way that the kind of a peace goes with us a comp

185
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:28,480
goes with us even when we're busy and activated and doing things it's not far away

186
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:35,119
that the deeper the letting go can be the more thorough it can be it's like it

187
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:42,240
creates a space of absence a space where there's kind of a spaciousness

188
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,680
in our minds and our hearts and our bodies someplace and that spaciousness can feel calm can

189
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:54,000
feel open and that kind of because it's like more like space

190
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:01,200
things can happen to us and they go right through that space if they're if we're peaceful but

191
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:07,280
peaceful is kind of like we're holding ourselves peaceful or it's very palpable a kind of state of

192
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,880
peace that is a kind of feeling that's wonderful

193
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:19,040
but that also is not an empty space of freedom where things can just go through or

194
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:24,160
there's space to hold everything and so this letting go is what creates

195
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:29,760
this inner space which provides a qualitatively different kind of piece

196
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,359
different kind of calm different kind of well-being and

197
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:40,800
and room for all of ourselves so

198
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:46,960
to navigate this world of ours with the

199
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,240
idea that we want to make room for all of who we are

200
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:58,480
in this way this particular wave where there's no attachments no clinging

201
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:04,480
and on the way there we have to make room for our attachments and get to know them as well

202
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,920
so it's a wonderful journey finding our way and i'd like to end this little series

203
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,520
on finding your way with these different states that

204
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:21,200
one of the lessons i'm trying to get across is don't have a categorical

205
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:26,480
right and wrong for almost any state that you have any way that you are

206
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,000
take time to look at it and sometimes almost this part almost a time for everything

207
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,800
and um and certainly a time to study it and get to know it and that finding our way navigating this

208
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:44,560
world of ours when we're a mindfulness practitioner has a lot to do

209
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:50,480
with bringing mindfulness and space mindfulness and room

210
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:56,720
to how we are so we can learn to find the most

211
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:04,960
the wisest way and the freest way to navigate this life of ours

212
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:11,200
so thank you for

213
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:19,920
participating in this and maybe for this weekend it can be a theme for your your

214
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:28,079
homework home practice to study your relationship to agitation and

215
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:34,480
peace agitation and calm or tranquilly whatever you like and to see how you uh if there's a

216
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:40,400
pendulum that swings between them do you prefer them do you hold on to them what can you

217
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:47,520
what happens if you spend time with each studying them or getting to know them becoming more familiar with them

218
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:54,319
become the connoisseur of your agitation and of your peace

219
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,560
thank you
