1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,720
so welcome welcome everybody some of you may know that this

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:11,200
is the third class in the introduction to mindfulness meditation it's perfectly

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:18,000
fine if you haven't been at the earlier ones just be building on what we done

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,560
before but I'll also be reviewing what we talked about

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:29,320
before so here at IMC we teach mindfulness in a particular progression

6
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:36,879
it doesn't have to be taught this way there's plenty of you know perfectly valuable legitimate ways to teach it but

7
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:41,960
um how we teach it here is I think Gil

8
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,559
frol came up with us you know maybe in a few decades ago this idea that I really

9
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:53,120
like and that is this idea of practice is having concentric

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,239
circles so in the center is more stable

11
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:04,478
then as you get rings around that these kind of get a little bit more wobbly so

12
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,799
in the center is mindfulness of breathing just of the experience of

13
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:15,240
breathing it's always available we're always breathing or you hope so

14
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,840
right or and then a little bit out there is the body this is also stable right

15
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,119
this the body is always available and it's espcially stable compared to the

16
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:35,240
third ring which is emotions it's what we're going to talk about tonight and then the fourth is

17
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:41,200
thoughts right the world of thoughts is like right we always are getting pushed around by them and it's very slippery

18
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,159
and tends to be the least I'm using this word

19
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:56,360
stable so on the preceding weeks we talked about mindfulness of breathing and mindfulness of the bodily

20
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:03,200
experience and what I'd like to highlight is that that it's

21
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,319
um it's so much about

22
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:15,640
experience Sensations as opposed to thoughts or

23
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,480
ideas and sometimes we kind of get confused to like we we think that it's

24
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,000
about Sensations but not recognizing that it's actually we're

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:37,360
thinking and next week we'll talk a little bit more about about thinking but when we do mindfulness it's

26
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:46,480
it can be like done without any words like the experience can be without words it's just the experience of for example

27
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,400
feeling like the chest expand and release the

28
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,599
stretch just these movements or maybe with breathing the belly goes in and out

29
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:05,360
or maybe you feel the temperature of the air going in and out of the

30
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:12,319
nose so it's not so much the concept or the idea of breathing because you know

31
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,720
breathing it's it's not so much what we experience instead we're experiencing

32
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,840
the movement of the body in these different

33
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:29,519
ways so we start with mindfulness of breathing and just we're having the breath and we're using this word anchor

34
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:37,280
on then the mind wanders this is what Minds do and then we just very simply come back to the breath the mind wanders

35
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,599
we come back to the breath the mind wanders we come back to the

36
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:50,239
breath it doesn't matter how many times you have to do this in the beginning it'll be a lot where the mind is maybe

37
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,400
even wandering more than it's even on the breath that's fine that's how it is when we start it's always like

38
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,879
this and then with mindfulness of the body body what we're pointing to is we

39
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:07,959
have the anchor here with the breath resting attention on the sensations of

40
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:13,120
breathing and then let's say there's a compelling bodily

41
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,880
sensation just a discomfort in the back I'm just making this up and then you

42
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,280
might feel like oh I can't be with the breath cuz my back really hurts and like

43
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,759
we just try to keep on being with the back but then we're think I'm sorry being with the breath and we're thinking about the back and then want to be with

44
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,280
with the breath oh in the back then going to be with the breath so instead of getting into a

45
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:43,400
wrestling match or struggling with this we just let go of using the breath as

46
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:51,560
the anchor and turn towards having the experience in the back be the

47
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:57,560
anchor and we feel it this might be exactly what you do not want to do but

48
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:05,759
it turns out that to actually be with our experience is a way to have more freedom

49
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,560
with them to no longer be pushed around by them and to have a different

50
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:17,840
relationship to our experience and we might say that mindfulness practice is all about

51
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:24,120
changing our relationship to what's happening so we turn towards the

52
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,199
experience of in my example what's happening in the back

53
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:35,520
and if we were to use words they would be adjectives

54
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,240
stabbing throbbing pinching hot

55
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:50,759
cold um vibrant or you know something like this so we're just noticing the

56
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:57,840
exper the uncomfortable experience in the back we're not thinking about it but the

57
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,160
mind will want to go into a story oh my gosh this thing in my back probably I'm

58
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:09,840
going to have to check in with the chiropractors as I get home why did I decide to go to a mindfulness class

59
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:16,919
anyway or you know something like this right there'll be stories that will happen as best we can we just let those

60
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:22,039
go to the background be with the experience in the

61
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:29,960
back until it's either no longer compelling it just kind of diminishes

62
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:35,400
this happens not always it does happen though and then come back to the

63
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:41,080
sensations of breathing or maybe you're with the back

64
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,160
and it's uncomfortable and the mind just goes off into fantasy or something about

65
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:53,800
this and you completely forget that you're meditating and then you wake up oh yeah I'm supposed to be doing that meditation thing then start back with

66
00:06:53,800 --> 00:07:00,039
the breath and then when the body is compelling turn towards the body when

67
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:05,280
it's no longer compelling turned towards the the breath so we're just very easily

68
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,440
gently going back and forth between these different

69
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:17,919
experiences so now I'd like to introduce this idea of how to be have mindfulness of emotions because mindfulness practice

70
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:24,160
includes all of our Lives all of it there's nothing left

71
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,319
out emotions are a part of the human experience of course it is so how can we

72
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:36,720
breing bring mindfulness to emotions well first of all I'll say that

73
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:43,680
emotions have a two components at least two components often we tend to think

74
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,080
again I'll just use this as an example sadness we tend to think like oh I'm

75
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:54,319
just sad and I'm sad because I have this grief this terrible loss that happened

76
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:00,159
in my life of course I'm sad but

77
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:06,400
emotions have more than one component they have this sematic

78
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:15,360
signature and they have F mental aspect thoughts somatic signature is sadness

79
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,759
how does it feel in the body like how do you know you're sad for

80
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,599
example very often there'll be like this heaviness in the shoulders kind like maybe a little bit of a

81
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:34,279
slumping and there can be maybe pressure behind the eyes maybe even feeling like tears arising but

82
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:41,560
there's there can be kind of like this little bit of a collapsing of the posture maybe there's a lump in the

83
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:49,160
throat something like this and the mind is saying oh so sad

84
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:57,040
that so and so a sick in the hospital or so and so died or whatever it might be

85
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,640
that we're sad about and we're going to let the thoughts just

86
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:09,399
take care of themselves they're going to want to hijack the the experience and that's

87
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:15,279
okay we'll just let them take care of themselves and we are going to pay attention to the bodily

88
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:21,240
experience of the emotions and partly because the bodily

89
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:29,079
experiences they move at a different tempo as thoughts right I mean what's happening in the body is more stable

90
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:37,279
it's uh slower it's more tangible like we can feel it we can like really have

91
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,640
the get an experience of what it's [Applause]

92
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:50,440
like unlike the thoughts which are you know running really quickly and going all over the place the past the future

93
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:56,839
all kinds of things so in some ways that I think about this is that we are like

94
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:04,120
translating emotional experiences into bodily experiences being with the

95
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:10,640
experience of the body and in this way we actually are

96
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,680
honoring and respecting our bodily

97
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,839
experience we're not suppressing our emotions we're not pretending that

98
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:28,320
they're not there we're not trying to wish the that they were different or anything like this we are actually being

99
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:36,160
with our emotional life and this alone can add so much

100
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:43,040
freedom to one's life what would it be like if you felt

101
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:49,200
comfortable with all emotions you didn't have to you know move away from them or

102
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,600
avoid them you could have difficult conversations you could have tender

103
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,639
conversations you could comfort people in the midst of their terrible grief you

104
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:05,959
could hold your own grief adds a lot of freedom to our lives

105
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:12,600
CU we start to notice how much that we're trying to avoid emotions or trying to only have particular emotions and

106
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:18,760
have more of those but it doesn't work that way right we don't get to control our emotional

107
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:24,639
life we try we try but when we're trying to only have

108
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:31,959
certain emotions there's a way in which we there's this kind of like shutting down of our

109
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:43,319
experience so mindfulness of the emotions is this way that allows us

110
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:51,560
to no longer be in conflict with our emotional life and to have some

111
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:58,000
confidence with regards to our emotional life but maybe importantly it enables us

112
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,680
allows us to have some intimacy with our life there's this way in which if we're

113
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:10,519
trying to avoid our emotions that we're a little bit disconnected from ourselves from others

114
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:15,560
perhaps and then our life just is kind of like passing Us

115
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:22,800
by this way in which we feel like and I don't know like it's not very

116
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,880
satisfying our life but to be present for our inner life brings this richness

117
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,920
and fullness of The Human Experience emotions are an integral part

118
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:41,519
of our Lives of course it is so it can be transformative there's

119
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:48,839
this way in which also turning towards and honoring and respecting like yes

120
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:54,720
this is what anger feels like I have this heat in my face I feel like my legs

121
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,160
my arms want to move there's this restlessness here and uh

122
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,920
maybe like the chest gets puffed out a little bit too and like some of these subtle

123
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:12,720
things and we think about with the emotions they can show up but if there's this way in which we

124
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:20,360
can be with our emotions they can evolve there's this way in which they have the

125
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:27,399
freedom to arise be present and then pass away this

126
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:33,440
is the nature of emotions to just arise and pass

127
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,440
away and the physiologists tell us and the neurologists tell us right emotions

128
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:46,680
really only last 90 seconds and you're like wait I've been sad for longer than 90

129
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:52,360
seconds I've been sad for days weeks months years

130
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,399
even well what happens is it's like the sadness

131
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:02,959
arises and then we get tangled up with it and it's the getting tangled up with

132
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:10,639
it that causes it to persist oh no I wish the sadness weren't here I'm always sad I'm I'm going to be

133
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:17,279
sad again everybody else is having a good time and I'm not maybe I should do

134
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:23,839
that thing I saw on that YouTube video where you know I don't know maybe I should go learn to meditate I don't know

135
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:31,040
something like this that uh but there's often this subtle way in which we're trying to make them be different or go

136
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:37,160
away or it's often not even noticed that we get tangled up with and

137
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:43,800
it's the tangled up itness that perpetuates the emotions so instead they

138
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:51,120
can arise and pass away and so how can we allow them to be

139
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,279
there so that they aren't persisting is to just be with the bodily

140
00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:01,959
experience and I'll talk a little bit about how we can do

141
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:10,000
that so maybe one more thing I'll say before I do a guided meditation is our

142
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,880
relationship to emotions in general will show up in this way we

143
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:24,120
might not be aware of it it might not be obvious it might not even be I'll say this it might be very

144
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:30,000
subtle but for some people they are emotional about emotion

145
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,759
they think that it's the true expression of who they are and they should announce and share all their emotions at all the

146
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:43,480
time I feel this way and therefore this should happen and now I feel this way and therefore that should

147
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:49,440
happen on the other end of the spectrum is like emotions they are a pain I don't

148
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:56,959
I try not to have any of them in fact I'm not even sure if I do have them so we have these two ends of the

149
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:03,040
spectrum these are two legitimate ways depends on you know so many things

150
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:09,399
it depends on which uh attitude towards emotions that you have but if you're on

151
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:15,680
the different extremes I would like to encourage just a movement more towards the center where just the CU some of the

152
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,120
most beautiful Sublime experiences of our lives are

153
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:28,040
emotions when babies are born right kind of like newborn babies that emotion or

154
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:33,519
love falling in love or the love that we have for others

155
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:39,839
or also you know fear right is very frightening of course it

156
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:47,600
is so the encouragement here is just to recognize that you will have a

157
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:54,800
relationship towards emotions and can we loose I don't know move towards the

158
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:00,560
center like we don't have to express every emotion and we don't have to pretend like we don't I'm saying the

159
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,760
word pretend a lot of people are just not aware of their

160
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:13,039
emotions okay so with that we're going to do a little bit of a guided meditation

161
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,240
here so let's take an alert posture

162
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:35,919
posture that expresses your intention to

163
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,360
meditate and also has some

164
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:56,840
ease has some uprightness the spine is

165
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:04,120
upright if your body Al allows it it can be helpful to not be using the back rest in the

166
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,919
chair but to be sitting

167
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,440
upright and then to connect to

168
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:29,360
this experience of sitting right now part of that is we can connect to to

169
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:35,320
the sitting surface if you're using the back rest

170
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:40,759
feel the pressure on your back from the

171
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:52,519
chair feeling the pressure on the buttocks from the chair or the

172
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,720
cushion feeling the pressure on the back of the leg

173
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:10,440
leg the feet we're

174
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,080
here want do a small little body scan

175
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:35,159
see if check in with some common areas of tightness or

176
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:42,600
attention the eyes around the

177
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,880
eyes the jaw we're just

178
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:58,240
noticing what do they feel like the eyes and the jaw

179
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:05,280
it might be that bringing our attention to those

180
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:11,480
areas allows some softening of

181
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:24,559
tension relaxing the shoulders letting the shoulder blades

182
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,799
slide down the back

183
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:43,640
and then can just check in like what is your emotional state like right

184
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:51,240
now what is your mood what are the feelings

185
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:09,399
and then you can notice how you're feeling about how you're

186
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:17,000
feeling your relationship to whatever the emotional state is right

187
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:32,440
now and if it's not clear your emotional state can you be okay with that with it

188
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,120
not being

189
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:47,158
clear and then we'll bring our attention to the sensations of

190
00:21:52,320 --> 00:22:00,480
breathing feeling the belly moving in and

191
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,840
out with the

192
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:13,720
breath or feeling the chest stretch and the

193
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,559
release of the

194
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:25,720
stretch or feeling the air moving in and out of

195
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,880
the nose

196
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:38,760
whichever of those three choosing one of those three

197
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:45,200
areas and just resting attention there

198
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:29,440
breathing naturally the body knows how to breathe we don't need to change the

199
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:36,640
breath in any way we're just noticing the sensations

200
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,400
the experience of breathing

201
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:26,880
we're just hanging in there with the rhythm of breathing

202
00:24:56,399 --> 00:25:02,600
when you discover that you're lost thought just very simply

203
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:09,158
gently begin again with the sensations of breathing

204
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,399
nothing in particular needs to be happening

205
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:06,278
we're just here now noticing the sensations of

206
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,278
breathing e

207
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:16,440
letting the thoughts just be in the background and being

208
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:23,000
with what it feels like to have an inhale

209
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,200
what it feels like to have an

210
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
exhale

211
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,080
for for

212
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:07,840
and now and let go having attention on

213
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,279
breathing and again notice the emotional

214
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:19,760
state the mood or feeling that is

215
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,320
present very simply offering it a kind of simple

216
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:32,480
awareness and see if you can discover where in

217
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:39,640
your body that emotional state or mood or

218
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,000
feeling is

219
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:53,640
experienced what Sensations in your [Music] body that you know that you're having

220
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,679
that emotional state

221
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,120
this might be

222
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:19,799
subtle might be

223
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:32,600
vague can you make a distinction between experiences in the

224
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:38,440
body and what's the mental events that are

225
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:45,240
happening we're turning towards the bodily experience

226
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,679
and then again can rest your attention on the

227
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:07,480
sensations of

228
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,880
breathing for

229
00:31:47,700 --> 00:32:05,470
[Music]

230
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:26,080
so we often we're putting like the breath at the center and often starting with the

231
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,120
breath is a way that can allow the body and the mind to settle down maybe

232
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:38,200
with a little bit of a body scan to notice if there are some areas that are

233
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:46,919
uncomfortable and then just to rest there with the bodily

234
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:54,120
experience until something becomes compelling and this could be a bodily

235
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:59,720
you know discomfort in the body often Joy too or uh there can be this

236
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:04,880
energetic uplift joy and happiness this absolutely isn't part of this path of

237
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:10,519
practice it absolutely is experience that as

238
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:17,399
well but is there's this way in which we can use

239
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:23,679
this the stability of that we discover with a mindfulness of breathing to help

240
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:30,080
us create the container so to speak in which we can be with the

241
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,919
emotions and emotions are often felt not exclusively but often felt in the face

242
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:43,399
and in the Torso chest throat

243
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:48,000
belly face these types of

244
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:55,519
things and sometimes it can be a little bit tricky with emotions because we want

245
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:00,600
to resist them or judge them um we want to do anything except to have a simple

246
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:07,120
awareness of them but turning towards the bodily experience is a way in which we can have

247
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:13,320
this more simple relationship and experience of

248
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:20,638
emotions and with that I'd like to open it up to some questions or comments about anything I've

249
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,000
said and I'd love to hear a little bit like how that meditation was for you was

250
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,800
that obvious this whole idea of looking for the bodily I like this expression

251
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:39,158
the somatic signature of the emotions in the bodily experience or was that

252
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:44,800
perplexing and and Sally's getting the microphone

253
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:51,320
for us does anybody have any comments about

254
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:58,240
what I said or how was that meditation I think it's

255
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:04,520
you can see that's the green yeah and then the yeah that's probably that's I think it's

256
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:09,680
um yeah here's a great question you have to push the button you know this

257
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:16,079
right poor Sally she's a is it WR so on the side there's a little button on the

258
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:23,560
side push that there you go so in my case it was a little bit difficult

259
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:31,960
to identify the emotion but once I felt it I was just like I just wanted to

260
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:39,520
start crying and then when you said that we should come back to our breathing it was

261
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,800
very difficult for me to let that emotion go like like I was probably like

262
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:51,400
blocking the emotion or not letting it feel it completely but once I started feeling it it was very difficult for me

263
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:57,280
to come back so I just found that interesting mhm and and how do you feel

264
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:03,240
now at this moment I feel fine yeah I feel good I feel relieved in some way

265
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:09,680
yeah so that was a little bit of a surprise for you the the crying and the yeah yeah I was not expecting that at

266
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:16,160
all yeah yeah thank you thank you this can happen right some I like this expression like emotions kind of like

267
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:22,520
bubble up and they even when we create the conditions when there's some quietness they Bubble Up and there's a

268
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:29,160
way that I think about it's kind they get metabolized in some kind of way when they get seen

269
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,680
and acknowledged and maybe they let themselves know a little bit more and

270
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:39,839
then they often just go on their way yeah thank

271
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:52,119
you so I think you mentioned um that think of what emotions you have

272
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:57,400
at the moment if you don't know I think you said Leb it's just okay to say unknown I think that I don't remember

273
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:04,400
the exact words but but you said that that can help a lot because many times I don't know really how I'm feeling when I

274
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,880
look at it and I can't label it specifically as something um that instruction was

275
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:16,040
helpful I think um my mind automatically labels certain

276
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:22,240
Sensations in my stomach as bad right it's it's it just has that so feeling

277
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:27,720
the sensation oh that's bad I need to avoid it uh that that Association seems

278
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:33,880
very very deep so what irrespective of what I'm doing if that's if that's happening I think it's a bad sensation I

279
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:40,040
don't know what comes what comes first is it the negative thing in the brain that causes the stomach is it the

280
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:46,880
stomach that caused the brain or do they happen together that's it's very perplexing it's a fantastic thing to

281
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,119
practice with to get curious about it like what's happening first here is it the sensation in the belly and then the

282
00:37:53,119 --> 00:38:00,240
mind or the mind or the belly it's a great thing to just you know bring some curiosity to not so much that you have

283
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:07,640
to find the answer but rather than me just telling you something just to like experience and see how it

284
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:15,520
is and then with regard to having I think I use something like vagueness of the emotion or something like this yeah

285
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:21,240
it can be helpful to maybe have a sense of um well maybe I'll say this sometimes

286
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:26,560
I wouldn't like know what I was feeling and I liked this expression out of sorts

287
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:32,560
just out of sorts I don't know what it is it's just out of sorts so sometimes it would be helpful just to like

288
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:40,760
acknowledge there's something there but I don't know what it is or there could be some other like uh kind like vague uh

289
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:46,480
label of I don't know but it's delightful or you know something like

290
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,720
this so there can be and I'll talk about this in a little bit it can be helpful

291
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:59,160
to have some specificity of our emotions but if there're it's not helpful to try

292
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:05,800
to figure it out and dig and like oh my gosh I got to get to the bottom of this that's not what we're doing so if it's

293
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:13,160
just not clear then to be okay with the vagueness but if there feels like there can be some clarity to um bring some

294
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:18,319
clarity to it is that helpful what I'm pointing to yeah you're

295
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:25,520
welcome anybody else have a comment or something they'd like to

296
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,359
say question

297
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:39,280
for anybody was this a new idea to have emotions in the body for me it certainly

298
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,640
was I'm trained as a scientist I have spent my whole life you know bece like

299
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:51,640
in my mind and then this it was just such a odd idea like what do you mean emotions are in the

300
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:59,079
body but I discovered that it turns out to be true so bit of a process to kind of like

301
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:07,160
just uh become acquainted with and I was was maybe back there

302
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:15,079
while the microphone is traveling I'll just say that um they have they've given like uh a a

303
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:21,280
pieces of paper that have like a silhouette of a human body and they ask people to color in where is you know

304
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:28,520
this emotion where is madness where's anger where is Joy where is Envy where is you know just all all these

305
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:33,560
emotions and there wasn't 100% concordance but there is this general

306
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:41,400
feeling as I said kind like in the face and in the Torso so if you ask people they can often point to them so yes you

307
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:48,119
have a beautiful way of explaining this in such detail that it's so helpful for

308
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:53,920
me especially when you talked about not getting entangled in the

309
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:59,599
thoughts it's like it gave me permission not to to you know become obsessed with

310
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:07,520
my thoughts of the day so thank you you're welcome you're welcome I was able to really come down I appreciate it yeah

311
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:14,280
yeah next week I'll talk a little bit more about this but there is a way in which we think that our thoughts are the

312
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:21,760
absolute most important thing that are always happening and our thoughts are important

313
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:27,440
I'm not going to say that they're not but you know so many of the things we think about

314
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:34,000
you think about them you know the first 1,227 times you think about it is uh

315
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,680
enough we don't have to continue thinking about things so and I think it's like you know holding on to the

316
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:44,760
busyness yeah right because we're all like working a lot in this area and so

317
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:52,960
you sit here and you're kind of like oh I'm familiar with this kind of feeling so thank you you're welcome you're

318
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:58,520
welcome anybody else have a comment or a question or you like to share how the

319
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:06,960
how that meditation was or maybe all the way you were

320
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:15,119
here thanks um I I think you asked twice

321
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,240
during that meditation about what was um the emotion that you were

322
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:27,960
thinking the first time the first time um the motion came up and it instantly

323
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:34,520
came uh manifest itself into a kind of pressure on my eyes behind my

324
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:41,720
eyes um kind of the weird light show and darkness and stuff going on and then and

325
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:47,119
then the second time was um just a um heaviness on my

326
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:54,440
chest um same emotion but two different ways um that it manifests

327
00:42:54,440 --> 00:43:00,480
itself so the the question I have is in then I was concentrating more on the

328
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:07,559
bodily the feeling the heaviness and such and not so much on the emotion

329
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:13,760
anymore is that um is that helping work through the

330
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:19,200
emotion that you're trying to work through or I guess that's a

331
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:26,000
question I have this is a legitimate question so I would say that actually

332
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,720
this uh happiness in in the chest for example is the

333
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:37,200
emotion it is the emotion it's they're not these are not separate

334
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:43,280
things to have this bodily experience and to have an emotion heaviness in the

335
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:49,720
chest pressure behind the eyes that's uh emotions they're actually kind of like

336
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:56,440
primarily bodily experience as it turns out but I appreciate what you're saying

337
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:01,839
also I think you're pointing to this uh it's not uncommon to have the idea of

338
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:08,319
like but no I need to um get in there with the emotion and somehow work with

339
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:13,839
it or understand it or do something with it there's often this idea you didn't

340
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:19,119
say this I don't know if you specifically have this right this is you know of course

341
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:25,640
cuz we have you know psychology a lot that's telling us uh that this is uh you know beneficial and I am going to say it

342
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:31,559
is helpful and beneficial but that's not what we're doing in meditation and it

343
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:37,319
turns out that these emotions can resolve

344
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:42,880
themselves if we give them the conditions in which they can I'm not

345
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:53,559
saying it's fast and I'm not saying it's always easy or straightforward but there's a way in which um the emotions

346
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:59,680
can I I'll use this word metabolize or shift or change without our having to

347
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:06,040
get to the bottom of them or completely understand them or connect them to that thing that happened when we were a kid

348
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:11,720
so I'm uh psychology is helpful and beneficial and sometimes is exactly

349
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:19,599
what's needed but meditation offers an alternative way and so I'll just share

350
00:45:23,319 --> 00:45:29,800
this and sometimes it's sful to like we don't want to tip into overwhelm that's

351
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:37,559
not the direction we're going so if we're like it's swimming in this ocean of

352
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:43,640
grief and like we turn towards the emotion and the bodily experience and it

353
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:50,160
just this huge well comes up we can see like can we hold it can we

354
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:56,960
be like wow this is really strong wow this is like just maybe you

355
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:03,240
you know often kind of like there's these waves like with a sadness sometimes that there might be tears and

356
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:09,000
maybe a little bit of sobbing if you can stay with a bodily experience that's

357
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:16,280
great but if you can't and you're starting to feel like oh my God this is too much I just kind of handle it that's

358
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:21,480
not the direction we want to go it's not so helpful so I would say just open your

359
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:31,800
eyes feel the pressure against the body like what you're sitting on feel your feet like no I'm here I'm here

360
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:38,200
now and if it's a particularly emotionally labile time for you it can

361
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:47,359
be helpful to even before you start the meditation to um look around the room

362
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:54,920
and like let's say you're in your meditation posture at at home or here or wherever it is and just identify like

363
00:46:54,920 --> 00:47:01,599
some things that are pleasing this like in completely mundane pleasing

364
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:06,680
I'm looking at this chair it's kind of nice how it has shiny

365
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:12,200
legs and I'm looking at this cushion here it has this softness to it it feels

366
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:19,200
like it might be comfortable in some kind of way and and I'm appreciating the

367
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:27,000
senu of this uh wire that's uh back there on the back wall so these are such mundane things

368
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:34,359
that we don't usually pay attention to but it can be helpful to like notice some things that are

369
00:47:34,359 --> 00:47:40,400
pleasing mundane and pleasing before we start our meditation and then if we feel

370
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:47,599
like oh we tip into overwhelm to open our eyes and then connect with these

371
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:54,880
objects again this is a way to help kind of remind us like no we're here now so

372
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:00,000
that we don't find ourselves I'm using this word overwhelm I don't

373
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:07,558
know if there's like tipping tipping into overwhelm I don't know if there's a better word but something like

374
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:16,319
that so I want to talk about uh another tool that you can use a specific tool

375
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:23,520
that you can use for working with emotions that can be really helpful so a tool is just like you know

376
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:29,800
something that's in a toolbx you take it out and you use it if it's helpful if it's not helpful you

377
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:36,440
just leave it in the toolbox so in the same way this will be this uh idea this

378
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:43,079
was uh developed by Tanya Weiser who teaches here on Thursdays and Gil

379
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:49,240
fronto and it has this very nice acronym raft R A

380
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:58,040
ft and some of you may know like this a raft is what carries you over the flood over to safety this is a common metaphor

381
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:04,880
that's that's used in Buddhist teachings so raft

382
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:10,400
or stands for recognize just recognize

383
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:17,680
the emotion that's happening sadness out of sorts Delight

384
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:24,680
whatever it is you can use a simple word just a little bit of note yep it's anger

385
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:33,079
Joy Delight Envy whatever it might be the A is for

386
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:42,040
allow that emotion is already there you are already experiencing

387
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:48,640
it can you allow it to be there because it is already there there's often this

388
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:57,599
way in which we like want to push things away cuz we feel like uh then we'll make it go away or if we ignore for it it'll

389
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:03,680
go away this is my favorite tactic right I used to like just try to ignore it

390
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:10,040
always but if we can allow it to be there there's this way in which we are

391
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:15,119
aligning with the reality of the moment the reality of the moment is that that

392
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:22,400
emotion has arisen that emotion is being experienced that emotion is

393
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:28,520
known and can we maybe stop with a often we there's this subtle way in which

394
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:35,079
we're pushing them away or we wanting more of them or we're getting tangled up with

395
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:43,280
them instead can there be this movement towards openness and like yes this eny

396
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:50,839
is here right now it doesn't you can have any emotion

397
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:56,200
right any emotion it doesn't mean that we're going to jump out of our meditation posture and go out and

398
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:03,040
express them and I mean we can have murderous rage we can have such incredible anger but we're not going to

399
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:09,960
act out them we're meditating we're going to stay in our meditation posture and allow the emotion to be known and

400
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:16,040
felt and experienced so this might be the only

401
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:22,079
like place in our lives in which we have complete permission to feel whatever

402
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:27,680
there is to be felt often we feel like you know we should only feel certain

403
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:33,640
emotions and in certain settings or something like this but you have

404
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:39,839
complete permission to feel whatever there is include

405
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:46,240
vagueness of not knowing so just to allow it to be there

406
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:52,280
this allowing is pointing to having some um for the moment for that just moment

407
00:51:52,280 --> 00:52:01,280
just recognize yep it feels like this and it's here so f is it feels like this and the f is

408
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:06,960
feel in the body feel the lump in the throat feel

409
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:12,160
the heat in the face feel those maybe there's a sense of like wanting to get

410
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:19,119
up and run or something like this restlessness can feel and sometimes in the arms or this leg or the

411
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:24,839
legs and there's this way if we can rest our attention on the bodily experience

412
00:52:24,839 --> 00:52:31,079
as I've been saying it uh takes the authority and the momentum out of what's

413
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:37,200
happening in the mind and the mind is making all kinds of stories about oh if

414
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:43,160
only that thing didn't happen next time I see that person I'm going to do this

415
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:49,599
or or you know I don't know like there's so many things so we're either rehashing

416
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:57,400
what happened or planning the future or you know around this or we're saying oh my gosh this means that I'm a bad person

417
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:02,799
because I'm having this emotion we making those stories it's quite something the Mind likes to take

418
00:53:02,799 --> 00:53:08,720
emotions and really run with them we're just going to let that happen

419
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:15,480
more in the background and again just turn towards the bodily experience so

420
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:23,319
feel in the body recognize allow feel in the body and then tea there's two

421
00:53:23,319 --> 00:53:29,880
different ways that we can um think about tea and I'll give both of

422
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:35,200
them one is to tease apart tease apart

423
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:40,520
the emotion let's just say it's

424
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:47,799
anger tease apart the experience of being angry from our ideas or commentary

425
00:53:47,799 --> 00:53:54,520
or or notion about what it means to be angry I shouldn't be angry they didn't

426
00:53:54,520 --> 00:54:02,280
really know that they were being so rude rude and obnoxious and I shouldn't be mad or or you know we just or maybe

427
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:07,680
we're working ourselves up like oh my gosh I still can't believe this has happened and I'm going to do something

428
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:16,200
else whatever it is to tease apart the actual Anger from our reaction to the

429
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:22,359
anger our commentary about the anger often these get conflated and this is

430
00:54:22,359 --> 00:54:27,559
how the Tangled upness happens and the emotions get perpetuated

431
00:54:27,559 --> 00:54:33,440
so just to notice what emotion do we have about the emotion if I'm just going

432
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:41,559
to make this up again let's say there's anger and then we just have this shame about

433
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:47,000
anger then we can just turn towards shame that's the new emotion let the

434
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,359
anger do whatever the anger is going to do and then feel the shame oh yeah okay

435
00:54:52,359 --> 00:55:00,839
there's shame here feels like uh heaviness on the shoulders and small little knot

436
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:07,599
in the gut or something like this so the T can be te's apart the the

437
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:14,400
emotion from the reaction to the motion and it might be that the reaction is another emotion that's not a problem

438
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:21,319
just turn towards that emotion and do the same thing recognize allow feel in the body tease apart and you might

439
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:26,720
notice that there's hatred and then hatred of the hatred and then there's hatred of the hatred of the the hatred

440
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:34,079
and then there's hatred of the hatred of the hatred of the hatred and off you go that's okay just yep hatred feels like

441
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:39,960
this so that's one way the tea can be teasing apart the emotion I'm saying

442
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:46,319
this a number of times because often people will ask me now what what were we teasing apart again the emotion from our

443
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:52,440
reaction that's one way we can understand te here's a second way we can understand

444
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:57,400
this letter T Trust

445
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:07,400
can we trust that at that precise moment we don't have to fix it at that

446
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:12,440
precise moment we don't have to jump up and do

447
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:18,559
something because that'll be the impulse often right it's like I I have to make this go away it needs to be different I

448
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:24,440
have to fix it I got to send that email I have to I don't or we just maybe

449
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:32,440
just wanted to Simply jump away from experiencing it can we

450
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:38,280
trust that moment it doesn't have to be

451
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:44,200
fixed just at that moment it it may get fixed later but at that moment when

452
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:53,200
we're experiencing it this is related to allowing and something happens when we

453
00:56:53,200 --> 00:57:00,280
can kind of like trust and put down and soften the wrestling that we

454
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:05,480
do then there's a there some wisdom often

455
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:12,160
arises when we kind of like open to the experience there's a little bit more space for a new way of seeing

456
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:17,480
things a new idea a new interpretation something that wasn't seen

457
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:23,200
before that can really shift our relationship shift our

458
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:31,079
understanding so trust that you don't have to do anything at precisely that moment maybe you can trust maybe there's

459
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:37,559
something that's meaningful for you that's bigger than you trust the universe trust your

460
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:43,240
favorite deity trust in Buddhism we have like refuge in

461
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:50,599
the Buddha drama and SAA maybe that's meaningful for you is is there that what it's pointing

462
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:57,039
to here this trust is the movement away from oh I'm feeling this terrible thing

463
00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:02,760
and I have to fix it the trust is moving in the opposite

464
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:10,359
direction recognize allow feel in the body tease

465
00:58:10,359 --> 00:58:18,520
apart the emotion from our reaction to the emotion and trust it's okay at that

466
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:24,760
moment our capacity is so much more than we give ourselves credit for it really

467
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:28,119
is it really is

468
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:37,160
okay so I'm going to do another short little guided meditation if you'd like to stand up for a moment just to kind of like stretch your legs before you uh

469
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:43,880
have to sit again can be helpful so we don't

470
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:49,720
uh get too tense

471
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:04,280
okay so taking a meditation

472
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:16,359
posture and I'm going to begin with something that we did last

473
00:59:16,359 --> 00:59:21,920
week and that is just encourage you to bring your

474
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:28,039
attention to the sensations in your left hand

475
00:59:28,839 --> 00:59:33,369
what the hand is [Music]

476
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:39,720
touching with the hand but it feels like to have a left

477
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:46,359
[Music] hand and I'm pointing to the left hand with the assumption that it's neutral

478
00:59:46,359 --> 00:59:55,160
experience for you if it's not neutral then choose another area in the body

479
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:01,359
what is it like to just

480
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:04,640
feel the

481
01:00:10,119 --> 01:00:15,519
hand allowing the hand to show itself to

482
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:28,480
you independent of any any commentary you might have independent of what

483
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:35,279
you're thinking just the experience of having the left

484
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:43,960
hand maybe there's tingling

485
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:48,880
pulsing heaviness vibration

486
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:01,000
just allowing those Sensations to be

487
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:13,520
there and then in the same way can you bring that kind of attention

488
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:20,000
to the emotional experience emotion and

489
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:27,760
attitude mood might be subtle

490
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:38,960
as if it were okay for that experience to be

491
01:01:42,359 --> 01:01:48,000
there can you recognize what the emotion

492
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,280
is just use a very simple

493
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:59,319
label sadness happiness

494
01:01:59,319 --> 01:02:03,279
Delight boredom

495
01:02:08,359 --> 01:02:13,960
frustration can you just allow that emotion to be

496
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:23,440
there can we just let it be without adding anything to it without insisting

497
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:27,640
or wishing that it were different

498
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:45,039
just allowing and then Feeling Again into the

499
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:49,960
body the bodily experience of this

500
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,559
emotion how does it feel

501
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:00,480
what are the

502
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:18,880
sensations and can you tease apart the

503
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:26,880
emotion from the mental events that are surrounding it

504
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:34,440
the commentary we might have about it can you tease those

505
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:52,640
apart can you trust that it doesn't have to be fixed

506
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:57,440
doesn't have to be different at this moment

507
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:20,200
and rest attention on the sensations of

508
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:28,680
breathing for

509
01:04:47,730 --> 01:05:08,849
[Music]

510
01:05:14,359 --> 01:05:23,279
so this idea of raft recognize allow feel in the body tease apart and

511
01:05:23,279 --> 01:05:30,799
Trust doesn't have to be in that order it's a nice acronym but maybe or maybe

512
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:37,160
you can just be recognizing like oh yeah there's that uh frustration again maybe

513
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:43,160
sometimes just like acknowledging it is uh sufficient and it just kind of uh

514
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:50,960
Peters out or there might be a way in which we just feel it in the body first and when

515
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:58,480
when there's a sense of oh wow I don't really know what this is but there there's a uh something like a tightness

516
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:05,760
in the chest or a knot in the gut or something like this and then maybe just allowing that

517
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:13,799
bodily sensation to be there and then there's some recognition oh yeah this is shame or

518
01:06:13,799 --> 01:06:21,520
sadness or whatever it might be so the point here is not to um figure

519
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:28,680
everything out which is often what we like to do we like to figure things out we like to

520
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:35,599
understand them they feel more manageable and certainly that has its place but the emphasis with this

521
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:43,599
practice is to experience them because there's this way in which when we're figuring them out is we're kind of like

522
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:49,200
shoving them to the side while we're trying to figure them out there's a way in which we're figuring them out as a

523
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:54,480
way to not experience them or you know we're kind of like a turn moving away

524
01:06:54,480 --> 01:07:02,279
from experience and running into Concepts like oh that must be because of X Y or Z that happened in my life I'm

525
01:07:02,279 --> 01:07:12,000
not saying those things aren't true I'm saying that this is a different way that turns out to be enormously powerful and

526
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:18,520
transformative to just as best we can to be with our

527
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:25,640
experience so I'd like to open it up for questions again see if there's any

528
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:31,079
comments or questions of about what uh I've said so far there's right right

529
01:07:31,079 --> 01:07:37,839
next to you Sally thank you Diana I was wondering if

530
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:44,799
you could talk a little bit about what freedom feels like um we talk a lot about Freedom when we talk about

531
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:52,440
meditation uh specifically let's say you're dealing with grief it becomes this thing you carry with you all the

532
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:59,680
time for a long period of time so I find

533
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:05,440
that inquiring or sitting with your emotions or noting for instance I was

534
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:12,640
trying noting today and it suddenly that itself is overwhelming to see how many what a mess you are like

535
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:19,560
what are the things that are going on inside of you you know um so then the

536
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:26,278
question becomes okay where is the freedom so I know my emotions but where is that so if you and also about

537
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:32,318
relating so how am I relating to it really thank you yeah yeah I'll say a

538
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:38,238
few things about the freedom what happens is uh a few things

539
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:44,960
one is emotions arise grief it's felt and it's not a problem

540
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:52,278
it's just grief it's grief it feels like this and it's like it's just it's not a

541
01:08:52,279 --> 01:08:58,440
problem so all none of the emotions are a problem and this is where freedom is it's not like where we have to avoid

542
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:03,560
anything it's like we can hold we have the capacity to be with

543
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:10,199
anything and then there I don't then we start to recognize like how much of our life we're trying to make sure we only

544
01:09:10,199 --> 01:09:15,400
have certain emotions and not other emotions but uh with this is we learned

545
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:21,000
that we can have any and a second way is a big part about mindfulness practice

546
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:29,560
not just what I've been talking about tonight but just in general is to we start to gain some more clarity and

547
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:36,080
maybe some seen a little bit more deeper about our inner life and that includes

548
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:41,400
noticing yes there's a lot of grief for example grief is a natural thing of

549
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:46,679
course there's grief there's loss when there's human life and there's grief this is The Human

550
01:09:46,679 --> 01:09:53,679
Experience but there's also so many mundane perfectly neutral things that

551
01:09:53,679 --> 01:10:00,199
are happening in our life that we often are just dismissing or there's often even little

552
01:10:00,199 --> 01:10:06,760
Delight the first for me it's the first sip of coffee in the morning I love coffee I just love the first taste just

553
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:13,679
makes me happy you know just all these small little things that are even delightful we tend to be dismissive of

554
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:19,320
them so the freedom starts to see like oh yeah there's a lot of

555
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:26,400
grief and there's other things happening too so we're honoring ing respecting the

556
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:35,158
grief but we're not letting like our entire uh experience kind of collapse into that does does this make

557
01:10:35,239 --> 01:10:40,400
sense anybody else have a comment or a

558
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:47,679
question we have this here thank you for asking that question

559
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:54,640
about Freedom thank you Dona um quick question

560
01:10:54,640 --> 01:11:02,239
on the labeling is it more helpful to label or does it just get you lost in thought or

561
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:07,520
is it more helpful just to just to stay do you want to share a little bit

562
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:13,280
what your experience was was this like you well okay

563
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:18,360
um I think I know what you're pointing to but do you want to say a little bit more so

564
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:23,400
um so sometimes trying to figure figure it out

565
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:32,600
mentally that can cause me to you know go on another roller coaster for a long time before I come

566
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:39,239
back yeah yeah so I would say

567
01:11:39,239 --> 01:11:45,120
um it's helpful to gain familiar for familiarity or for our emotional

568
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:51,080
vocabulary to kind of increase and what we don't want to do is just as you

569
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:56,280
described like trying to like oh okay now I have to figure this out does it feel am I this this or that or the other

570
01:11:56,280 --> 01:12:02,480
thing so I know a number of people who have uh spent some time where maybe

571
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:08,239
you've heard of this I don't know um starting with mad sad glad like okay

572
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:13,600
maybe it's one of these three it's you know A variation of one of those and they just start with that it's mad it's

573
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:18,760
not mad and I'm not sad and I'm not glad though or I guess you have to choose one

574
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:26,159
of those three is a family one of you know an emotion that's in one of those three families but then often there have

575
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:33,360
been individuals who will um uh look at a list of emotions and say yeah what is

576
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:40,040
this one feel like not not when they're meditating but at another time Jack cornfield talks about this in one of his

577
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:46,920
books that uh he you know was uh he was a monk for quite some time in Thailand

578
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:52,960
and in Burma and then it wasn't until he came back to the United States that he realized that he really didn't know his

579
01:12:52,960 --> 01:13:00,000
emotions at all and he spent time with lists of them and that really helped him to kind of like broaden his uh awareness

580
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:07,760
of what different things were so this is one way to approach it so I think it can be helpful to have

581
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:14,639
some uh like I said is it in one of those three families to start there and then

582
01:13:14,639 --> 01:13:21,280
maybe just bring some curiosity throughout the day not in meditation or other settings to have a little bit of a

583
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:27,679
sense of one's emotions without it having to turn into a big self-improvement project or you know

584
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:33,199
something like that some maybe to bring some curiosity too so if I could if I

585
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:38,400
may just have two more followups one is

586
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:44,000
that sometimes I get like random

587
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:49,760
feelings that aren't associated tangibly with with some mental formation except

588
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:57,080
for they cause discomfort right like like I said random feeling exam in in in the stomach for

589
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:02,400
example in my case uh um so that's one thing the other

590
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:08,080
thing is sometimes I have this irresistible urge to move and I'm I'm

591
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:14,199
not able to pinpoint it to one specific part of my body what is it that's just making me want to move right I mean

592
01:14:14,199 --> 01:14:20,280
that's that's another yeah so I'll say that it turns out that they're not so

593
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:26,400
Random they are emotions and as the mind and the body start to settle then we

594
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:31,600
start to see connections that we don't see with just our regular mind so that's

595
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:39,040
one thing and this uh wanting to move there's could be countless reasons and you could just label it restlessness of

596
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:46,360
we say oh there's this restlessness and then okay maybe that's something you could recognize allow feel in the body

597
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:52,880
and tease apart restlessness something like that you're

598
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:59,040
welcome okay so we're a few minutes over I want to let you all go but I'll stay

599
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:04,600
here if some of you have some questions you like to come up and ask me otherwise I wish you a wonderful rest of the

600
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:07,560
evening thank you
