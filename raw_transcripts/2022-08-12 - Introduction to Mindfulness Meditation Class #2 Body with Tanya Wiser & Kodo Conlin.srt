1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:07,200
burmese style and if i could make a suggestion from here

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,960
i would suggest maybe two things oh yeah go right ahead

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:19,359
one is you may end up needing that support cushion to support your right knee but actually the first thing i would suggest

4
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:25,359
you try is to bring your body forward on the cushion so that you're sitting on the front half

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,400
front third of the zafu if your right leg's falling asleep

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:37,120
it may mean that some circulation is getting cut off here yeah because if i lean back far enough i can feel the

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,239
blood just yeah then then i think what what you need to do is

8
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,719
experiment with a way to sit that's gonna that's gonna free that uh that uh vein that artery so it can

9
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:55,280
flow and it may like tiny adjustments will be will be enough

10
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,600
if you're if that didn't work or if your knee is floating which now

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,680
that you've moved forward it seems to be down the wedge would be to put underneath the knee

12
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,799
you don't need it though yeah it doesn't and then what i have noticed helps

13
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:21,759
and i know i know you mentioned this last week that it's probably not so good but if i just go like that sure what is

14
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,040
that what is that uh what effect does that have for you i know

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:34,079
oh yeah the um what you're sitting and now i know is quarter lotus and that's a great posture if it works

16
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:40,640
for you um it it's it can be a little hard for folks who are sitting sort of early in

17
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,640
their practice it's hard for me to do now um because it puts a little extra torque on

18
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,079
the knee and on the ankle or it can yeah one other thing i might suggest that not

19
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:59,360
a change that you have right here um do you alternate betw which leg is forward between sittings yeah

20
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:06,399
yeah that would be a that would be one thing yeah thank you so much you're welcome you're welcome

21
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:13,920
yeah so this is a time for questions and comments about uh the practice as as we were talking about

22
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,840
it last week maybe something you noticed in your meditation on the breathing maybe

23
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:27,599
something you noticed in the homework of your mindfulness during daily life or

24
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,120
your attention to posture throughout the day

25
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,480
um hello good evening koto and tanya i really liked uh what you said about

26
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,319
setting an intention first or sometimes like prior to the 20-minute sit

27
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,360
at least for me it was two 10-minute sessions from the calm app that i wanted

28
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,560
to that i kind of was following so i was just like okay

29
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:06,159
let me at least focus on the breath or or something focus on the breath and then after the session

30
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,640
i reflected on how i how it went and it was pretty good

31
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:20,560
i think doing the 20 minute meditations mostly guided has been very helpful for me i did try to do a 10 minute

32
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,239
meditation without anything and it was it was kind of difficult

33
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:35,200
just for focus and stuff thank you that's great i i usually tell people

34
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,360
you know 20 minutes is the goal if you can't do 20 do 15 if you can't do

35
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,040
15 do 10 you can't do 10 do 5. if you can't do ten

36
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,519
do two so and breaking it up if you need to break it up works

37
00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:02,159
so good for you and maybe if 10 minutes was too long to do without guided try five unguided

38
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,280
and if that's too long you know back it up but find how long you can do an

39
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,120
unguided for and practice every time maybe either before maybe

40
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,320
experimenting before you do your guided sits or after

41
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:25,360
try practicing with whatever where wherever you're at whatever makes sense to work on the breath or the body is

42
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,919
this week to build up your capacity bit by bit

43
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,639
yeah great

44
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,080
great so when we're talking into the microphone we want everyone in youtube to hear ya

45
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:53,520
and everybody on the recordings who listen for posterity stake and so speaking into the mic is great

46
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,160
thank you anyone else have any reflections from

47
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,919
their practice or questions or if someone from youtube has

48
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,479
any comment or question we can address that too

49
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,360
hi um i wanted to talk about laying down like i know you mentioned last week that

50
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,039
there was a little bit of time where you practiced laying down and sometimes i feel like my body just

51
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,400
really really wants to so what are the pros and cons and

52
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,000
benefits yeah sure have you had a chance to try it out yet

53
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,199
what laying down no but last week during class i like

54
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,400
i was really uncomfortable but didn't want to lay down you know so i

55
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,680
yeah yeah yeah the um maybe talk about the pros and cons

56
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,360
and then we can move in a little bit the

57
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,360
practice of mindfulness uh as tanya was just pointing to

58
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,479
meets us where we are and that includes all bodies

59
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,080
and sometimes say an injured body for example is uh better served lying down than it

60
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:25,199
is sitting up the downside to lying down meditation is

61
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:31,680
probably exactly what you would imagine it's easy to fall asleep very easy to fall asleep so

62
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,000
a trick or a tool that i i learned from andrea fayla one of the teachers here

63
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,720
when she does lying down meditation she does it so you imagine me flat on the back she was with a an arm straight up like

64
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,319
this that way when she falls asleep she knows it

65
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,240
and it wakes her up  and holding the holding the hand up

66
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,840
are two hands two hands straight up like this elbows elbows

67
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:08,319
it takes just enough energy to keep you up until it doesn't and then

68
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,919
you wake up so um there's always a there's always a

69
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:21,199
measure of discernment uh if it's if it's sort of everyday variety discomfort

70
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:27,680
that's motivating me to lie down then i you know i i try for a little bit longer to stay

71
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:34,560
stay up if um if it's actually an injury that i'm trying to trying to meet and serve

72
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,120
then i'm i'm more motivated to lie down more quickly

73
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:47,160
maybe time for one more and then we'll go to uh next thing

74
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,879
i'm just curious if you could just raise your hand if you practice this week

75
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,840
fantastic fantastic thank

76
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,919
you nice work nice work

77
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:21,680
yeah wonderful to be on the path together i think uh that was probably a good time

78
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:28,560
moving to a little bit of a little more formally at the beginning of our session here tonight

79
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,959
so there's a teaching by uh pikuboti who's a translator scholar

80
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:40,399
practitioner really good news for all of us

81
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,000
for this path just two things you need

82
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,279
you need to start and you need to continue

83
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:57,680
last week we started and today we have continued so we have everything we need

84
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,839
everything we need we started um we started this

85
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,880
sequential unfolding of the practices of mindfulness meditation

86
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:16,000
presenting them in a sequence as we do here beginning first with the breath

87
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,600
mindfulness of the breathing centering ourselves and mindfulness of the breathing

88
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,040
and then we'll continue today we'll talk about the body mindfulness of the body expanding our

89
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:34,240
awareness to include the body more deliberately in our experience and our attention

90
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:41,519
next week we will continue further mindfulness with emotions really important part of human life

91
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,120
um often a sort of challenging or vexing

92
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,160
curious making part of the practice how do i how do i practice with emotions

93
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:59,360
and we'll get into that next week after mindfulness of emotions we'll continue into thinking and then in the

94
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,640
fifth week we will tie it all together starting

95
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:11,600
continuing just to review a couple of the key points from last week

96
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,480
this practice of mindfulness has everything to do with the skillful use of it of

97
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,880
skillful use of attention nothing more mysterious than developing

98
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,800
our capacity to pay attention in the present moment

99
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:39,040
there's a way that what we're doing here unifies the mind and the body

100
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:45,040
in the here and now this present moment experience

101
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:51,440
if we are daydreaming about

102
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,120
uh say dinner tonight or something in our work tomorrow

103
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,720
our body is here our body hasn't gone anywhere it's right here in the present but our mind has

104
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:09,680
left the premises our attention has left the premises for now so in the practice we're just practicing

105
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,440
again and again bringing attention back so that the mind and the body can both be here

106
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:21,920
together last time in addition to talking

107
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:28,560
something some about attention we covered some of the key points of posture

108
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:36,640
of course one of the most important points is the alert upright spine that's well supported

109
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:44,399
if you're if you're seated either in a chair or on the ground well supported either by

110
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:51,680
the balance from your seat to your knees or your seat and if you're in a chair down the legs

111
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,560
into your flat feet if it's okay for your body sitting sitting with uh the back free and

112
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:05,120
independent long balanced spine so that the body can

113
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,079
relax relax and loosen around the spine

114
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:25,839
so along with attention and along with posture it was mindfulness of breathing

115
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:32,320
mindfulness of breathing so important uh i love this metaphor of

116
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:39,519
the human being as concentric circles and the center of the circle

117
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,560
we can think of as the breathing center ourselves on the breathing

118
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,680
and the other aspects of our life they're included in the in the circles

119
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,600
but they're all connected here in the center grounded here in the center of the breathing

120
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:03,240
so we think of course we think but have the thinking connected to the breathing

121
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:13,040
important distinction we brought up last week was direct experience this here and now the

122
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,560
felt sense of breathing for example as compared to our concept of the

123
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,839
breathing our idea about the breathing or idea of the breath another way

124
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,120
direct experience compared to our interpretations of what's happening

125
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,600
the comments or the layers we add on to the direct experience

126
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:42,079
and we introduced this this traditional tool this traditional helper

127
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:47,519
very soft note very soft label

128
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:53,680
if that's helpful for you maybe the in on the in breath out on the out breath

129
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,199
very soft just to help keep you here with the body

130
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,199
now

131
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,680
i think maybe just to highlight one more of the important principles we covered

132
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:20,399
the experience may be pleasant it may be unpleasant while our attention is directed to the

133
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,600
breathing may experience this as pleasant or unpleasant

134
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:32,639
that is not the indication that it's going well or it's not going well

135
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:40,000
if there's if there's attention enough if we're attentive enough to notice just what's going on as it's

136
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,720
going on we're doing the practice we're doing the practice

137
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:52,959
so for example if if we're breathing and some say uh say a sensation in our

138
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:58,560
body becomes predominant it's okay to let go of the breathing and be with that

139
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,959
if we're attentive we're doing the practice

140
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:15,199
maybe the last thing i'll say in this uh in this journey we started last week

141
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:22,160
and that we're continuing over these these next several weeks the trajectory or the arc of this whole

142
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,440
thing is that we include more and more of our experience

143
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:34,560
such that we are learning to be more and more skillful including everything

144
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,079
every bit of us gets to show up for mindfulness practice

145
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:45,800
so i think with that i'll i'll hand it over to you

146
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,199
does anybody have any concerns about my taking my mask off no

147
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,199
okay

148
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:30,160
i am i think it's worth just taking um i'm kind of going to repeat some of the things koto said maybe um

149
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:37,839
and some new things but one of them is i just want to kind of build back on this idea of

150
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:45,120
last week we started with attending to the breath and we talked about we used the word anchor

151
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,759
right so this idea of a reference point or

152
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:59,839
something that kind of holds us close to the moment right like an anchor would a boat

153
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,839
in the water right to keep it from drifting too far away

154
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:12,558
and i last week i mentioned something about how the mind sort of it's a weaver

155
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:19,438
and it weaves all of our experience all the data that's coming in together

156
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,558
and incorporates past information

157
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:31,760
probably even anticipatory information so this weaving brings all of these

158
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:37,600
parts of our experience and creates sort of a more what feels like a solidified

159
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,720
whole or how we are seeing things

160
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:49,360
and so what we're what we're helping ourselves do with this practice is to sort of try and pull this apart a little

161
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,960
bit to make ourselves a little bit more connected with the different

162
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,280
threads of our experience does that make sense so tonight

163
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:07,200
we're adding body we don't need to stop being aware of breath

164
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,200
right and the invitation is use your anchor if breath is your anchor

165
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:19,280
now if your breath is not your anchor right because it doesn't work for you

166
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,400
because it's triggering or just there's something else like sound or the body

167
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,520
can be an anchor good anchors so start with your anchor right when you

168
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:35,840
come into meditation use that anchor put it down drop it in get it hooked in

169
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,600
there and then the invitation is to open up to

170
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,720
noticing the body now guess what

171
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:53,039
do you think that that means that the mind is not going to offer thoughts

172
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:58,720
no and that it's emotions aren't going to come up

173
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:05,120
no so there's no expectation that your mind has to stop thinking or your heart has

174
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,400
to stop feeling so i just want to give you permission to

175
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,919
have your experience but to highlight

176
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,520
maybe use that noting practice that we talked about within out like

177
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,799
oh feeling emotion or thought just real simple

178
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:32,559
not we're gonna we're doing this sort of trying to loosening the pieces right

179
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:39,600
so we don't need to get in there and get tangled up in the thinking or the emotions trying to think about that

180
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,640
when you're working with strands of a yarn right like sort of how do you let

181
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:51,919
the pieces relax they can all be there and they don't have to kind of get caught up together and if they do

182
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:57,360
just sort of gently try and give them their own room

183
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:05,200
so we'll start with the breath with our anchor if it's not the breath

184
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:13,039
and then the invitation is to invite the mind to be interested in what's happening in this body

185
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:19,360
and one simple way is the whole body's breathing really

186
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,480
we can just start to kind of expand the awareness of the breath

187
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:31,600
start to notice it in many ways that maybe we don't usually notice it usually notice it more in this

188
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,880
the center area so just sort of

189
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:43,120
trying to create a sense of non-conflict for yourselves right

190
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,960
with what comes up and just kind of like okay and we're gonna try and be a little bit more

191
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:56,320
curious tonight about the body and what's happening in the body

192
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,880
so as kodo said the body is not thinking and ruminating he didn't use those words

193
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:14,000
but essentially the body's in the present moment right it's here

194
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,760
it's always here it's always in the present moment

195
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,120
it's our thoughts about the body that aren't right

196
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,480
it's our memories or our wishes or our fears

197
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:36,000
but the body ex itself is such a present moment anchor

198
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,520
such a present moment gift

199
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:50,960
so it's a very supportive very foundational part of our practice

200
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,640
it's mindfulness of the body it's it's uh

201
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,080
can be quite delightful to get really centered and connected

202
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:08,240
with our experiences in the body it can also be difficult if we have pain

203
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:15,120
or other things come up so i don't mean to say it's going to be all rosy

204
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:21,520
but even connecting with what's difficult there can be a beautiful connection to

205
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:27,360
the present moment right if we have pain sometimes it still can help us

206
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,919
stay here in a way that feels very wholesome nourishing even

207
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:39,320
even like a break from the mental activity

208
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:48,640
if you think about what we're doing maybe one metaphor would be that by tuning in and feeling the

209
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,760
sensations in the body the body has a language

210
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,840
and the language is sensations and by tuning in and feeling we're

211
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:07,720
listening the way of listening to the body is to feel the sensations

212
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:18,158
so the body doesn't have a narrative it doesn't ruminate and think

213
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:25,600
and so maybe a simile or a way to think about this we're trying to bring a mind that's more

214
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:33,360
simple to the experience of these sensations that are happening in the body

215
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:39,679
and um a simile might be

216
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:46,240
going to a sports bar people are

217
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,520
watching huge monitors with narrators not narrators what are they

218
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:57,120
called the the announcers right who are play-by-play talking about what's

219
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:03,200
happening on the screen people are chatting and commenting and

220
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,799
there's a lot of activity around this tv screen

221
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:13,520
right or the sports that we're watching

222
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,880
and imagine no sound in that environment

223
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:27,039
no more commentators room gets quiet

224
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:33,120
and just watching the game unfold without all the commentaries

225
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:40,480
without the stories about the players or comments about how great this was

226
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:46,080
or how unfortunate that was

227
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,760
just seeing the motion in a way this is what we're working to

228
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:57,520
try and experience is to be with our body and what's happening in our body

229
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:04,880
without all the mental comments all the interpretations all the judgments all the liking all the

230
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,120
not liking

231
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:26,279
is that a picture you can imagine yeah

232
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,919
voice is a little soft i think i start to put people in a little bit of a meditative space when i'm just talking

233
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,960
yeah so it's great i'll try and just keep

234
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,840
going with it we'll move into the guided meditation shortly

235
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,799
so maybe back to this scene of or the simile

236
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,158
of the quietness

237
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,840
and just sensing into maybe seeing yourself in nature

238
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:16,320
in the sense of intimacy that one can have with your own experience when we're in a a quieter

239
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,278
simpler space

240
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,559
kind of connecting in this deep listening which is

241
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,919
the receptivity to the feelings and the sensations the life

242
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,640
really it's our life energy

243
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:42,960
our life being expressed through movement through breath

244
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,919
so we're growing our capacity to be intimate and

245
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:55,919
connected with our with our present moment experience

246
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,080
it it has certainly felt to me

247
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:11,039
like a coming home it can feel like a coming home

248
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:19,360
finding sort of just this this familiar comfortable

249
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,559
centered space

250
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:31,039
and sometimes it's a coming home to a raucous place too

251
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:37,360
like going home to a lot of things happening but it still has that quality of coming

252
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:43,039
home that sense of really feeling like

253
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,880
embodied yeah

254
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:56,320
so now another simile is thinking about the body as a gateway

255
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:02,320
a gateway to the present moment to connecting with the present moment

256
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:08,480
sometimes it's hard when we're busy in life and our minds are racing

257
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:15,919
it's hard to find the present moment hard to feel connected to it and so the body is a way a gateway to

258
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:22,240
help us find it it might be as simple as noticing my heart is pounding

259
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:28,840
yeah and that starts to help us connect more fully more richly

260
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:37,039
so in the practice we want to invite ourselves to

261
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:42,398
be at ease as much as we can right

262
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,240
and to be curious curious about what arises

263
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,399
paying particular interest to the breath and the body sensations and maybe

264
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,600
curious but in a hey i see you sweet little thought

265
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:05,679
is it right here kind of way so it's not pushing it away

266
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:12,159
you know it's not arguing with it not saying you can't be here but just like okay yeah

267
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:18,158
there's room here to come over here and play

268
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,480
and it you know we're we're applying a gentle but persistent

269
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:30,240
energy to stay present it's so easy to get carried out to see by our thinking

270
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,960
so easy and you will and that's gonna happen it's not a problem the moment you

271
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:43,760
recognize it you're already back so there's nothing to do but notice that

272
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:49,120
you're back that's it oh i'm right here again

273
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:55,919
i'm right here right here there's nowhere like sometimes in instructions you'll hear somebody say

274
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:02,240
and bring your awareness back to your breathing i don't think it's necessary to kind of

275
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:10,159
quite go that way because what we're doing is cultivating knowing awareness aware you're aware

276
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:17,600
right as soon as you recognize you were thinking you're aware and the awareness is what we want

277
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,039
that's what we're building that's what we're growing so we can just okay

278
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:29,760
like just hold and sit with the awareness and then the breath might start to come back into

279
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,880
a present awareness or sensation right just sort of allowing the awareness to

280
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,240
start to connect in that way

281
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:47,600
and just a reminder gentle reminder to respect your body respect your edges

282
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:53,760
right so not push too hard if you're

283
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,360
ending up in pain or you think you might be hurting yourself or

284
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,559
you know you're trying too hard try and soften up or change your posture so

285
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:10,720
respect your edges all right so let's go ahead and

286
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,720
slide more fully into a practice

287
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,000
taking a moment to find a good posture

288
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,200
supports the spine its natural lift

289
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:34,399
maybe moving forward on the chair trying that out instead of leaning back

290
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:40,799
experimenting you can always move it's okay to get up and get cushions or things to put

291
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:46,399
you know i find it very helpful as well to have something right down near my lower back

292
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,480
just a little bit of support helps me

293
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:59,200
and so then just sort of see actually i have a preference my personal preference is to

294
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,039
lift my shoulders up toward the ears kind of squeezing the ears

295
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:12,240
and then rolling the shoulder blades back toward each other and really the elbows squeezing open

296
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,880
squeezing together the elbows right and it opens the front chest and then driving the shoulders and

297
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:25,760
elbows down the side so we've kind of really stretched and opened the front body and then you can

298
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:31,360
just sort of rest your hands on your legs

299
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:37,039
one hand on top of the other thumbs touching

300
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:44,240
or just palms down on your thighs or palms up it's all good

301
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:52,000
and for me once i do this i notice the body wants to take a natural big breath

302
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,640
all of a sudden i've created a little more room in this chest for breath

303
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:06,840
so just inviting the body to take a few longer slower deeper breaths

304
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:20,640
and another image for me is you know as i'm doing this as i'm taking these deeper breaths

305
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:27,360
my eyes tend to naturally want to close and they don't have to be closed we can

306
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,880
gently gaze a few feet in front of ourselves

307
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:40,000
but as we as we settle it's almost like putting a snow globe down

308
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,559
and all the glitter comes to the floor of the snow globe and the energy

309
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:52,320
in the body can feel the same way as things come in come down come settle

310
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,880
come home

311
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:07,840
and then there can be more room for the breath this anchor or whatever your anchor is

312
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:16,399
i'm going to just say one thing here which is everything i'm offering is an invitation

313
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:24,720
you are welcome to change the language i offer so that it feels more comfortable

314
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,480
for you in any way

315
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:36,159
you are welcome to disregard something i say

316
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,800
this is part of also respecting your edges and knowing

317
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,358
and tuning in to what's happening inside of yourself

318
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,240
there is no reason to deny your own truth

319
00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:00,079
deny your needs i offer

320
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:05,119
guidance and you follow in a way that works for you

321
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:13,920
so feeling into this experience here

322
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,640
breathing here

323
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,480
and for purposes of kind of orienting toward the body and paying attention to the

324
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:54,000
language of the body i'll invite you to pay particular

325
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,440
attention to your feet

326
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,359
maybe getting a sense of the whole foot

327
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,720
not creating a picture of the foot in your mind or looking down or touching your foot but

328
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:21,520
but feeling and sensing the feet from inside the body

329
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:32,800
so we're not the commentators in the sports game evaluating the feet

330
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:39,359
but just in that simple way feeling feet

331
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:43,680
these feet and this moment

332
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,280
and so what is the language of these feet

333
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:00,720
sensations that might be like tingling or vibrating

334
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,200
buzzing pressure

335
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,760
temperature

336
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:20,599
you may notice that there's parts of your feet that are cool and other parts that are warm

337
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,599
you may notice there's parts of your feet that feel hard and

338
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,560
others that feel soft

339
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:50,720
just holding awareness of the feet in a kind and gentle way

340
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:58,079
whatever you're feeling and sensing is okay even if it's uncomfortable

341
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,599
maybe just saying it's okay

342
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,760
just being present for whatever is being experienced

343
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,720
by being with our feet in this way we can see how it's possible

344
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,640
to explore other areas of our body

345
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:11,559
how we might be able to feel into the body with curiosity and sensitivity to whatever is present

346
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,040
so from here you can let go of attending to your feed

347
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:29,440
and just allow your awareness to go back to whatever is prominent for you the breath or the sensations

348
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,480
maybe noting thinking or emotion just

349
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,440
kind of getting clear

350
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:47,838
and seeing if you can't find your anchor feel into your anchor in the middle of it

351
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,520
bringing the same curiosity

352
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,560
to whatever you're sensing now

353
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:15,318
breathing in and breathing out

354
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:34,280
maybe noticing a cool breeze on the skin

355
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:43,400
or other sensation that calls your awareness to it

356
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:58,240
providing a sense of ease of intimacy and connection

357
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:05,040
just this just here

358
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:11,200
the body is a gateway to the present moment

359
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,160
feeling the sensations as a way of listening deeply

360
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,559
to our experience

361
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:45,680
and just for fun as we come to the end when i play the bell

362
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:51,400
see if you can feel the sound in your body

363
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:56,679
[Music]

364
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:03,560
[Music]

365
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
so

366
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:31,440
just noticing what you're aware of now

367
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:40,480
staying close to your experience and we'll we'll open this up for some comments reflections and questions and

368
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:47,359
including from youtube if anyone has anything richard will check the chat in a minute

369
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,359
and a reminder to use the microphone

370
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:11,000
so is anyone willing to share anything about your experience

371
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,480
i was able to feel my feet being warm

372
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:34,800
and i'd never been able to actually get in touch with a particular body part

373
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:40,319
but somehow the way you explained it i was able to feel it from the inside

374
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:46,960
and i always have cold feet so it was very interesting to have

375
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:55,000
warm feet maybe your feet liked being felt

376
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:21,040
um so i felt well my mind was wandering quite a bit and i

377
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:26,400
had to call it back a few times so

378
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:32,960
there's that thank you

379
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,920
how was that for you if i may ask

380
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:47,040
yeah and the the process you described right um i try to just use one word like

381
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:52,400
wandering or daydreaming and then bring focus back to

382
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:59,520
my breath or to feel different parts of my body just kind of going through the whole system

383
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:05,280
so a little distracting but overall good we're doing the practice

384
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:12,079
trying yes um now that you mention

385
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:17,599
the thought process that you noticed i also remember how i always have a

386
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:22,880
running narrative of what i'm thinking about it's like right now i'm thinking about

387
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,920
my feet now i'm thinking about something on my hand so

388
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:34,000
would you like to make a comment or should i go ahead sure um

389
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,160
now i'm thinking about my feet now i'm thinking about my hands it it sounds like the thinking was helping you to

390
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:45,839
stay present that's one of the um

391
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:51,119
one of the the bits of logic behind using a note

392
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:57,520
is that we're noting what the attention comes into contact with it's using a thought to keep us here

393
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:04,079
skillful use of the uh the mind that can stay active

394
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:09,119
and then uh it it is possible over time the body will settle down breathing will

395
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:14,240
settle down and the thinking will for a time maybe slow its tempo

396
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:21,160
but we'll see thanks

397
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:39,280
um i had what i thought was a very cool experience and that you had mentioned uh trying to move away from your mind's map

398
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:45,280
of what you think your body looks like and i sort of like felt into like some

399
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:51,280
like neck and shoulder pain that i have and i was just like i wonder like what this feels like from the inside and like

400
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:57,280
was so different than the like shape of like anything it was like sort of weird and

401
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:03,680
like felt like almost like symbolic like uh if that makes sense yeah yeah

402
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:11,280
but i just thought that was cool thank you uh that's going to be

403
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:18,240
um we're going to touch more on that shortly when we talk about talk about pain but isn't it fascinating how the

404
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:25,200
the sensations we're presenting maybe in a shape or a form or a texture or something it was

405
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:32,440
different than your idea of the neck and shoulders yeah thank you for that observation

406
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:57,599
okay so i have um a question that's kind of difficult and i hesitate to ask it

407
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:02,640
but um so i have a rare pain and maybe we'll talk about it when we

408
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:08,960
talk about pain but i have a rare pain disorder where if i focus on it it becomes a feedback loop and gets magnified

409
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:15,119
so if maybe in our pain discussion if you have any ideas about how to break

410
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:22,640
a feedback loop of pain perception i don't know it's a difficult one so that's a big question so

411
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:28,400
it is it is um i think we would be really well served why don't we spend a few minutes

412
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:34,559
together at the end of the session that's something i can say now is um

413
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:40,960
and and i'll talk i'll i'm actually going to say exactly this the experience of pain as you all know

414
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:46,000
is like it's composed both of both of nerve

415
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,680
information and the recognition up here or recognition where the recognition

416
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:57,359
happens yes oh this is this is danger yes and there's a way it sort of gets

417
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:03,359
stuck it can get stuck in itself when i was working with this injury

418
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:10,000
there came a time where i ended up actually talking with my pain and saying something like oh thank you

419
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:17,520
for the information i'm safe i the you've done your work

420
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:24,079
and um um we're safe here now and actually having that conversation

421
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:29,520
sort of let the metaphorically let the pain know it had done its job

422
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:35,599
and somehow for me helped undermine the loop but we can we can connect more no yeah

423
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:41,040
thank you for reminding me that because that's exactly what my pain psychologist says for two

424
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:46,240
different points so i don't know why it didn't occur so yeah

425
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:51,760
maybe one last thing about that i realized i went straight to process and the first thing is like that's

426
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:56,880
really difficult i'm recognizing it it's

427
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:04,680
it can be really challenging to work with consistent pain so thank you thank you for the practice you're doing

428
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:20,079
so i have a chronic illness and fatigue is a significant part of that

429
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:25,680
so i actually dozed off during that meditation and i noticed that i did that

430
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:32,079
earlier in the week as well when it was later in the day and so i'm not sure sort of how to

431
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:38,799
work with that knowing that that's probably going to be a challenge for me so any any just

432
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:44,480
comments or thoughts you have about that would be great maybe i'll just say something and then

433
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:50,960
you can pick up and take off on the next part um

434
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:57,119
maybe you're just learning the rhythms of your body right so um

435
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:03,440
something to learn to know about yourself and maybe it's perfect to fall asleep a little bit

436
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:10,640
in the evening because you're tired so just to to not make it a problem

437
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:16,000
to have it be information maybe have it help inform you about

438
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,520
when you practice and um

439
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:27,760
yeah and um it's great great you know you fell asleep and

440
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,839
hopefully you got a little rest [Music] i did

441
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:38,000
good yeah maybe i'll i'll add this briefly and then

442
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:44,000
segue into our our next section um

443
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:52,960
gil will often mention at the beginning of a meditation retreat how a great a great many of us are perhaps

444
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:59,200
sleep deprived and maybe could benefit from an early night's rest and a secret of the first

445
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:06,880
night of a meditation retreat is we always go to bed early and then the the other thing is that um

446
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,760
someone who's who's close to me has has made it a practice of

447
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:19,280
being like very uh acutely mindful of the state of sleepiness and has

448
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:26,960
discovered all sorts of interesting things like where it's living in the body uh and how it moves and functions

449
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:35,559
so just to just to say that that too can be part of it that too can be part of the practice

450
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:50,720
you know while we were doing the guided meditation i was really taken by this this uh image

451
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:55,920
of the anchor and because we uh we live so close to

452
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:01,599
the bay i was thinking i actually saw in my mind's eye i don't know how many of you had this happen an anchor in the

453
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:09,119
ocean and i was seeing the sort of sway of the seaweed and imagining the little

454
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:16,720
little sea life floating along the temperature of the currents the different aspects and i was thinking how

455
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:24,480
all of those all of those parts of the sea are right there with the anchor

456
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:30,559
they didn't disappear so our whole life in the same way

457
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:36,079
is right here with the anchor whatever it is the body is right here with the

458
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:43,119
breathing the emotions that are right here with the breathing our states our thoughts

459
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:50,079
and as we're as we're bit by bit

460
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:56,640
uh practicing with one aspect of our experience and then widening practicing with the breathing widening to the body

461
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:03,040
widening to emotions thinking learning to include more and more

462
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:09,760
so for now keep it simple our practice is with the breathing

463
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:14,799
our practices with the body sensations of the body i appreciated how

464
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:20,240
the the attention can be both directed as it was when we were feeling into our

465
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:25,599
feet we can direct the attention to the body to really feel into

466
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:32,000
sense into from the inside out what's going on in a part of the body

467
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:38,480
can also be a receptive attention that maybe takes in the whole body globally

468
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:43,839
can also be [Music] a mix of the body and the breath let's

469
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:49,359
say our our anchor is the breathing

470
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:55,359
say there's say there's a sensation that arises in the body that's calling awareness

471
00:58:55,359 --> 00:59:00,960
it's more compelling it becomes predominant letting go of the breathing

472
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:06,079
attending to that sensation while it lasts while it's compelling

473
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:11,280
and then when that fades going back to the anchor

474
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:18,720
the movement from object object not a problem attend like going along with attending

475
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:26,480
in the sense of going along with the attention we're still doing the practice whatever the experience is

476
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:34,720
for many of us and especially especially i think in the beginning months and years of practice there can be a lot of

477
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:40,000
discomfort in the seated posture or in the whatever meditation posture

478
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:47,838
you use so you may be experiencing sensations that are predominant

479
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:55,200
those two get to be included and there's a way that there's a way that whatever needs to be

480
00:59:55,200 --> 01:00:01,119
experienced will come up for you in the course of meditation uh i have a

481
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:06,559
i have a faith that we can trust that so the fact that a discomfort has come

482
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:12,480
up not a problem

483
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:19,200
not a problem how do how do how to engage with that in a way that's caring

484
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:24,319
and gentle and clear

485
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:30,240
so the discomfort can take uh take any number of forms and sort of be part of a spectrum

486
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:35,839
discomfort can be very mild it can be very intense it can come up in the form of agitation

487
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:41,359
it can come up in the form of pain this pain is a very

488
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:48,799
very interesting part of practice i think for all of us that comes up sooner or later

489
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:59,280
so i appreciate something tanya said earlier to respect your edges

490
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:04,559
we're going to talk about practicing with pain and very important to emphasize this for me

491
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:11,599
respect your edges stay in your choice choose how much you're going to practice

492
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:17,200
with pain for now there's a time and a place for sort of

493
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:22,720
strong determination with pain that can be a good teacher and there's a time and a place for being

494
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:27,040
very gentle so then you'll have to discern

495
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:36,400
to bring in another image i did something but right before the session i did

496
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:42,960
something i haven't done in a really long time i was sitting out here on the bench i was enjoying the trees the breeze in

497
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:49,200
the trees and i looked up at the sky and i watched a cloud just watched a cloud

498
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:56,480
who knew who would think and i was watching its shape

499
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:01,838
just really just slowly drifting slowly changing

500
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:09,760
some of it kind of fading away yeah it was so relaxing just to be there and watch the cloud

501
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:15,839
and it occurred to me this is perfect this is the perfect dharma for this is the perfect teaching for talking

502
01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:22,079
about pain clouds just like pain

503
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:27,920
they're composites a pain is not one thing

504
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:34,240
the exp and experience of pain is not made up of one condition it's not just a lump

505
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:39,359
it's interesting though because our perception says if we hold pain at a distance it's like

506
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:45,440
oh that pain is solid it's one thing it's over there it's pain

507
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:52,000
but really interesting just like the cloud actually it's made up of a cloud is made up of

508
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:57,359
some sort of particle it's made up of uh a sort of mist in the sky that's

509
01:02:57,359 --> 01:03:03,920
condensed around these things the right temperature things have to be just so and they're always changing

510
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:10,559
and the same with pain it's always changing and if we get close to in the same way

511
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:16,319
we're practicing with our feet earlier if we get close to if we get into we

512
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:21,359
feel pain intimately

513
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:29,440
maybe say at an appropriate distance if it's too much there's a way that it reveals itself

514
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:36,400
there's a way that it um it the threads that make up pain start to loosen tees apart

515
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:42,480
it might be that what we think of as pain what we think of as one pain if we get close to it it

516
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:48,400
might be that it's a combination of say pressure or

517
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:54,400
and heat and maybe a little bit of tingling or this particular pain might have a

518
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:59,760
feeling of twisting involved in it it could be any number of things

519
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:05,359
but the very same curiosity that we bring to sensation and bring to breathing

520
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:10,559
we bring to pain and it can reveal itself

521
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:17,920
what's very interesting about this is that as we tease it apart you might notice this any given any given

522
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:24,559
sensation pain included when we tease it apart it has a tendency to start breaking up

523
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:32,400
it might reassert itself very quickly but then it breaks up breaks up breaks up or changes

524
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:39,119
one of the things that keeps pain maybe seeming unitary

525
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:45,839
is the interpretations it's the uh it's the things that are that aren't actually physical sensation

526
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:50,960
but are other parts of our being kind of like the glue so say

527
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:56,319
i feel i feel a sensation that's unpleasant in my hip while i'm sitting

528
01:04:56,319 --> 01:05:02,319
the thought oh that shouldn't be there um

529
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:09,680
i think this me this means that uh i'm i'm i'm not going to be able to walk

530
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:17,680
pretty soon i'm pretty soon i'm like three four steps down the line from the physical sensation in a in a narrative

531
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:24,480
so just the same way we were talking about the difference between the game and the commentary

532
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:30,799
there's a way of relating to pain that's similar where we can experience pain as the physical sensation

533
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:38,640
and notice also what's what's added what's it what's the commentary what's the interpretation

534
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:43,920
and that can support this teasing apart process

535
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:53,280
i can say it as the as that practice starts to develop

536
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:59,440
and pain starts to reveal itself there's a way that there's a way that actually you can be

537
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:05,119
there with pain totally with pain and be independent of it

538
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:11,839
and actually uh totally unexpected maybe even relaxed some of the time

539
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:16,880
the big qualifier with all this some sort of talking about pain

540
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:22,079
in a general way working with working with our our own pain

541
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:29,039
it's particular we can use some of these same strategies but they're you know we never want to we never want to like

542
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:34,240
exacerbate our injuries by with this good dharma mindfulness

543
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:40,960
advice please take very good care of yourselves and follow your wisdom

544
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:47,599
follow your wisdom the practice we introduced of

545
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:53,760
uh maybe offering a note can help us to tease apart what it is

546
01:06:53,760 --> 01:07:01,039
that's making up an experience of pain can actually let the mind register and recognize oh this is a comment

547
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:06,799
pain pain heat vibration comment

548
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:12,319
oh fear there's emotion anyway that can help with this parsing

549
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:15,319
process

550
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:27,119
so in the practice that includes our whole life this um

551
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:33,440
this whole spectrum of discomfort will very likely begin to show itself

552
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:38,880
and can be a rich a rich field in which we discover more and more about

553
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:43,640
freedom of attention and awareness

554
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:52,400
it's not all pain of course we have great pleasures and meditation that can come forward an independence of

555
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:57,680
awareness and attention one

556
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:04,640
aspect of experience i want to note before we go into a guided meditation is

557
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:13,200
say the body is in some level of discomfort and you've discerned that oh this for

558
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:19,678
now for me for now this is too much this is too much

559
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:28,480
moving is an option a good one tuning into something neutral

560
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:34,880
is a good option i've also heard tuning into sounds

561
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:42,560
tuning into sounds if the body for now is too much opening up opening up to mindfulness of sounds

562
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:48,960
and we'll explore mindfulness of sounds a little bit in this guided meditation

563
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:56,839
so why don't we find our way back to our meditation posture

564
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,718
feeling the steadiness

565
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:24,239
the sensations of a upright balanced body

566
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:30,560
maybe even renewing the shoulder roll that we did earlier

567
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:40,000
the spine both alert and relaxed the chest open

568
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:42,960
belly relaxed

569
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:51,600
can lengthen give invite a little space in the top

570
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:58,400
vertebrae with the top of the spine and the neck she may find that tucks your ten your

571
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:02,040
chin just gently

572
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:16,760
greeting the body your companion for life

573
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:31,719
and connecting again with your anchor

574
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:37,840
be that sounds or awareness of the whole body

575
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:41,239
or the breathing

576
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:09,400
allowing a soft breath to be a soft breath and a full breath to be a full breath

577
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:23,040
just enough energy

578
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:29,960
to sustain contact and curiosity

579
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,920
and for the sake of an exercise

580
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:19,440
letting go for now of effort to stay with the anchor

581
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:26,840
opening up to the sphere of sounds

582
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:41,360
in a wide receptive way

583
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:51,840
receiving the sounds as they come in

584
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:58,840
and letting them pass right through

585
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:34,159
if the sound sparks a thought sparks a comment

586
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:43,920
to parse to discern to tease apart the sound

587
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:52,120
just the sound comment just the comment

588
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:24,719
relating to sound in this way

589
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:32,320
pleasant or unpleasant the sound does not

590
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:37,080
request a response

591
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:05,400
so

592
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:15,120
pleasant sound is just pleasant sound

593
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:18,080
passing right through

594
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:28,719
unpleasant sound is unpleasant sound

595
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:33,480
passing right through

596
01:15:56,320 --> 01:16:00,079
and again as i ring the bell

597
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:09,800
can you listen with the whole body

598
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:30,280
[Music]

599
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:36,800
and when you're ready you can open your eyes

600
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:47,239
as we transition

601
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:55,840
into a few last minutes of q a given our conversation of

602
01:16:55,840 --> 01:17:02,480
sound and commentary and pleasant and unpleasant today i

603
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:07,840
found i came across the perfect quote

604
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:12,960
from the founder of zen center suzuki roshi

605
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:18,719
you may have heard this before it says teaching on sound versus noise

606
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:27,040
and i think he was a tassara he says when we hear the bird

607
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:32,320
actually i'm not listening to the bird and then very cute he goes peep peep

608
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:37,520
peep he says when you are reading something you may think

609
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:43,360
the blue jay is on my roof but their voice is not so good

610
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:49,199
when you think in that way that's noise and then he says the most important

611
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:56,159
thing when you're not disturbed by the blue jay the blue jay will come right into your

612
01:17:56,159 --> 01:17:59,159
heart

613
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:06,320
when you're not disturbed blue jay will come right into your heart

614
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:11,520
so maybe you have some uh some something you'd like to share or some

615
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,840
question

616
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:29,280
i think for the second half of that meditation where i actually tried sitting on the floor for the first time

617
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:34,640
i tried not to be so disturbed by feeling uncomfortable and then i

618
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:41,280
felt comfortable it was really strange i was just like oh wow i'm not trying to move i was just

619
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:48,640
and i i wanted to hold on to that but i'm like wait if i hold on i'm gonna get attached to it so

620
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:55,520
i kind of just let it be and i'm like wow it was really cool so i think yeah it was nice thank you

621
01:18:55,520 --> 01:19:00,960
wonderful thank you thank you for sharing i love that you you tried it out and

622
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:05,840
had that experience or had an experience

623
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:13,280
that's a great example of um losing the commentator

624
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:20,480
right like we add so much to our experience with our comments and

625
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:27,320
reactions so it's like turning that tv volume off you know nice work

626
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:55,280
i um paused to give people time to ask questions and now i'll go ahead but um

627
01:19:55,280 --> 01:20:00,400
okay so that really helped the um the visualization with the pain this is

628
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:07,040
holly again um the visualization that you mentioned

629
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:14,159
code of the of letting the sound pass through you and being expansive like having an

630
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:21,440
expansive perception so it was like i gave space to my body and became like the size of the entire soundscape

631
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:27,360
and i think gill has talked about um imagining yourself as

632
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:33,520
more space if you have a lot of thoughts bouncing around like ping pong balls nice and it did the same i think it did

633
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:39,920
the same thing as with the pain signals or the pain whatever pain ruminations

634
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:45,520
it gave them space and also provided a little distraction

635
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:51,040
um while still maintaining that anchor of mindfulness in the breath or the body

636
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:57,679
so yeah that seems like a pretty good antidote i'm happy to hear it so it sounds like

637
01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:03,600
during the meditation on sounds it opened up your perception of space to be broader

638
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:09,520
and that gave more room for the the pain signals to have have some have some space around them or

639
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:15,840
inside them or yes yeah instead of being focused in one area kind of like you mentioned

640
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:22,159
earlier it wasn't so much pulling them apart it was just giving a ton of space to

641
01:21:22,159 --> 01:21:29,320
a concentrated location wonderful wonderful thank you

642
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:08,120
anyone okay great

643
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:18,880
um i was just wondering if there's a way to be like entirely like with sound uh

644
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:25,040
in the absence of kind of like associations and emotional charge that comes with it because uh

645
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:32,400
unfortunately i got a lot of emotional charge so um yeah i find that i can

646
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:39,440
fall into a place where i'm thinking about the feelings that come with specific sounds and oops

647
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:45,760
feels counterproductive sure i like actually sound meditation great i

648
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:51,280
like it a lot and one of the key things that helps me

649
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:56,638
is not to be imagining what's making the sound

650
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:03,440
because then i start to create a lot of mental fabrications and stories

651
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:09,679
and i like to um see if i can feel because i i really sense the vibrations

652
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:15,840
of sound you know like there's a car moving and you can feel oh it's shifting where

653
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:21,360
you feel it in your body so receiving that's another word i like is

654
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:26,719
receive the sound we don't need to go out and find the sound it comes to us

655
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:31,600
so more of a receptivity and

656
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:38,159
you know if you have particular associations with particular sounds that are very strong it's

657
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:45,199
it takes a long time right so maybe that there are certain kinds of sounds or things that are triggering

658
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:52,239
that have a lot of impact for you and so knowing that and then bringing compassion maybe to that

659
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:58,639
um is that helpful yeah you want to add anything

660
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:04,960
i was thinking i was thinking if um say the breathing is generally a more

661
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:13,040
useful anchor for example if that is true for you and you're exploring the world of sounds

662
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:18,960
one way to do it would be to ground ground yourself in your anchor and then decide okay now i'm going to open up to

663
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:24,960
this thing that i know is a little more stimulating for me and let's just see what happens let's see what happens and let's do that

664
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:30,239
for however long a few minutes if you want and then come back and settle and that

665
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:37,440
sort of back and forth so you can you can have your meditative resources about you

666
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:43,360
and then again if it if uh say meditation on sounds encourages a

667
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:50,000
response to note that response to be attentive to it you're doing the practice

668
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:56,239
thank you okay so we're about ending so i'm just

669
01:24:56,239 --> 01:25:02,639
gonna um if you didn't pick up a handout there on the stage as you come in over

670
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:07,920
by nancy thank you nancy and so

671
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:12,960
the homework for this week is to continue to practice 20 minutes a day

672
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:19,440
you can't do 50 20 through 15 can't do 15 to 10 can't do 10 to 5 right and

673
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:24,960
break it up maybe so you get your full 20 if it's possible

674
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:31,679
and there's an invitation to take two hours during the week

675
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:37,280
to do a devoted mindfulness of your body practice in daily life

676
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:45,840
so you know yoga swimming going for a walk those are all easy

677
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:53,120
places to kind of practice for a sustained period for more broken up one of the nice

678
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:58,719
things one of the practices i grew for a while was

679
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:04,560
every time i got up to walk somewhere practicing mindfulness of the body

680
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:10,719
moving so that's a nice way to build in something into the daily life is every time you

681
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:16,880
get up and walk somewhere it's practice [Music]

682
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:22,880
you know we're talking about the body so we've talked about sensations and then we just added sounds because the body

683
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:28,880
does hear the body also tastes and smells

684
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:34,239
so this week you're invited to have a mindful meal to spend a whole meal or

685
01:26:34,239 --> 01:26:39,280
start a whole meal as mindfully as you can it can be very

686
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:45,199
[Music] fun to do eating meditation like sometimes

687
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:51,760
a raisin or an orange you know so smaller bits

688
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:57,040
like that but really taking time smell it before you taste it listen to

689
01:26:57,040 --> 01:27:04,159
it you know notice that you start to salivate there's so many things you can feel your body wanting to swallow you

690
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:10,400
know there's just so much to notice so you might do a smaller eating experiment with a little piece of fruit or

691
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:17,199
something like that and then see if you can how much of a meal you can pay attention to

692
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:23,520
you can try putting your fork or spoon down between bites that can help

693
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:28,719
then you're really aware before you pick it up again wait till you're swallowed you know

694
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:36,880
so but one meal have fun with it see what you can notice and the fourth invitation for this week

695
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:44,320
is to be curious about the things that take you away that distract you

696
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:50,840
there's a lot of information there particular thoughts or

697
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:57,520
reactions or fantasies or you know just be curious what what is it

698
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:03,600
that that kidnaps my awareness what kidnaps me

699
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:10,400
what happens you know just just noting it and paying particular attention being curious about

700
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:16,800
it so thank you so much for being here and your practice and

701
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:24,719
if you have questions afterwards we'll be here and hopefully we'll see you next week

702
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:29,480
thank you thanks so much

703
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:10,639
you
