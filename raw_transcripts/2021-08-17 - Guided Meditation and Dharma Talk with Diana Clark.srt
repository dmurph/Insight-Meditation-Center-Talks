1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,160
good evening good evening welcome welcome

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:11,840
wherever you are and if you're here in person

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:19,599
live or if you're listening to this sometime in the future warm welcome

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,760
so we'll start with a little bit of a guided meditation i tend not to do

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,960
a lot of guidance

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,040
just maybe dropping in some direction

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,680
that we might consider

8
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,120
but checking in with the body

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,359
feeling connected and grounded embodied

10
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:27,040
and feeling the pressure against the body from the whatever it is you're sitting

11
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,520
on the chair the cushion

12
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,000
the bench the couch whatever it might be

13
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:57,360
and then letting the attention rest on the sensations of breathing

14
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,840
feeling the expansion and contraction

15
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,680
in the chest or the abdomen

16
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:25,239
or maybe feeling the air going in and out of the nose

17
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:04,519
nothing in particular needs to be happening

18
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,280
just being with the sensations of breathing

19
00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:00,560
and when the mind wanders as it's apt to do

20
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,400
we just very simply gently begin again

21
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,920
with the sensations of breathing

22
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,240
feeling the in-breaths

23
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,440
and feeling the out-breaths

24
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:15,199
and can we acknowledge feel into

25
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:24,240
that we're sitting together looking at the chat box

26
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,520
from ohio brazil seattle

27
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,400
chicago here in the bay area

28
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:44,400
feeling the support of sitting together with others

29
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:53,199
even if we are all of us in our own space

30
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,080
still we're sharing sharing this experience

31
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:30,720
there's a kind of delight to be connected with others

32
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,199
while we sit

33
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:39,760
in some kind of way we're connected to others who are

34
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:46,080
sitting right now but also

35
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:54,000
there are others who have made it possible for us to sit now

36
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,720
whether it's in a direct way they're watching the kids or

37
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:08,880
have agreed to not disturb us for this time

38
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:16,880
or whatever it might be or perhaps a little bit or indirectly

39
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,759
helped us with the food on the table

40
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,759
the person in the grocery store

41
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:40,240
the person who helped put the fruits and vegetables

42
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:51,720
maybe somebody helped you with your car if you drove an oil change

43
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:05,839
the clothes you wear were purchased most likely somewhere

44
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:15,839
a person made them package them sold them

45
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:23,279
drove the truck taking them from place to place

46
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:36,279
feeling this connection with others

47
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,120
can we feel supported

48
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,959
in this way

49
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:13,079
knowing that even if we are sitting alone in a room

50
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:19,000
are ways in which we are connected with others

51
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,920
you

52
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:26,880
this recognition that we're

53
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:33,120
not as isolated or independent

54
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,600
as it might seem or sometimes we feel

55
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:46,240
it's true certainly with this pandemic many of us spend time alone

56
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:52,799
but it's also true that we're not completely independent

57
00:28:52,799 --> 00:29:00,159
we're connected this just naturally becomes more obvious

58
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:06,720
as we practice and as we practice we just naturally

59
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:13,840
don't want to cause harm not only to ourselves but to others

60
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,679
so with this recognition of the countless ways and

61
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:30,960
which we are connected and support one another may this practice

62
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,880
be a support not only for us but for others

63
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,919
and may all beings be free from suffering

64
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:53,069
[Music]

65
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:44,720
good evening good evening welcome welcome

66
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:55,840
it's a buddhist practice might seem like it's a solitary affair something that we do

67
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:02,720
by ourselves there's certainly in this who does a lot of emphasis on

68
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:09,120
becoming awakened and this idea that

69
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:15,600
we we are the ones that walk the practice walk the path do the practice for ourselves

70
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:21,279
and certainly we sit in meditation with our eyes closed

71
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:29,360
but the more we practice the more we realize how we're connected and specifically

72
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:36,159
we recognize nothing arises for no reason no experience

73
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:43,600
no object nothing everything arises for a reason

74
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:50,799
maybe unless we want to talk about the unconditioned which i'm not going to talk about tonight

75
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:58,399
so with this recognition we could say that the path or this path of practice in some ways

76
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:07,039
brings us into the web of life more fully recognizing and appreciating feeling

77
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:13,840
some connections that perhaps before we weren't so sensitive to instead feeling

78
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,960
separated independent isolated perhaps

79
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:26,159
but rather than cutting us off from one another instead the this practice can kind of

80
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,600
highlight our relationships and

81
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:39,120
and nourishing an appreciation for the ways in which we're connected

82
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,000
and certainly the buddha is often depicted as a solitary figure

83
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,320
it's pretty rare certainly in this tradition to be see anything except a buddha by himself

84
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:58,640
sitting and if you read in the suttas some of them use this word seclusion

85
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:04,559
this idea of uh being separated but one way we can interpret that is

86
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:12,159
that in ancient india the society was a little bit different than how it is now and kind of the bonds of family and

87
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:19,039
community were really closely knit and so this sense of individuality or

88
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:25,760
doing something to quiet the mind maybe needed to be highlighted

89
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:33,120
in that time and to be sure also buddhism grew i mean that buddhism as a religion as a

90
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:39,519
tradition as a practice grew out of a sense of community and

91
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:44,720
connection to be sure right that at the time of the buddha

92
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:52,640
the community whether they were monastics or lay whether they were women or men

93
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:58,000
they had to rely on each other in order to hear the teachings

94
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:05,440
of course they certainly couldn't tune in to you youtube

95
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,560
or listen on audio dharma or something like this right they didn't at the time

96
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,158
of the buddha they weren't written down the only way you would hear about

97
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:22,079
the dharma is with an interaction with another person is with somebody

98
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:27,440
speaking it and you were hearing it and perhaps you was talking or maybe you were just

99
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,638
listening or maybe it was chanting and just listening so

100
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:38,720
individuals had to rely on each other in order to hear the teachings

101
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:46,960
and of course they were preserved right through all these thousands of years because people

102
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:54,000
thought they were valuable and even sacred and chose to preserve them

103
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,440
so buddhism these practices of course is really

104
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:07,040
dependent on some of these relations of people passing things on from one to the next

105
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:13,599
so one thing that you might notice or might know is that

106
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:20,160
actually the buddha he placed immense emphasis on the company we keep

107
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:28,960
and in this there is this passage where the buddha is saying i do not see even a single thing

108
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:36,880
that so causes wholesome qualities to arise as good friendship

109
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:44,240
i do not see even a single thing that so causes wholesome qualities to arise is

110
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,599
good friendship so this recognition that especially back then right they were

111
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,960
completely dependent on who they knew or who they had access to or who they

112
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,240
spent their time with there's also this passage

113
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:06,320
just as the dawn is the precursor for the arising of the sun

114
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:12,320
so too having a good friend is the precursor for developing the

115
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:19,119
noble eightfold path many of you know the noble eightfold path is a path to awakening has eight

116
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:26,800
elements to it hence the name i'm not gonna go into the details of what that is but just this recognition

117
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:34,240
that having a good friend is the precursor for developing the path to awakening

118
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:39,440
and maybe i'll say just for me that um

119
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,960
having meeting people that were practitioners of the dharma that had more experience

120
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:51,599
than i did and had such a big impact to

121
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:57,760
somehow to be able to talk about the dharma after

122
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:03,200
the dharma talks or something or to see people who

123
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,640
how they moved through the world and how they handled things to learn from them

124
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:14,560
and to see how they seem to have much more ease in their life than i was having

125
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:21,119
and to be inspired by okay so there were the teachings but there's also people who are listening to

126
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:28,079
these teachings and putting them into practice and i i think it's uh i could honestly

127
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:35,119
say that my life would have turned out differently if i hadn't had the great good fortune to

128
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:41,599
meet some drama practitioners and to develop some of these friendships

129
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:48,800
so this uh and maybe i'll say also that some of you

130
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:54,800
know that now when we do so many things on zoom and it's also on uh youtube

131
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:01,839
that and certainly when we um we're live here at imc in person

132
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:07,040
that there's so many um practices that we do so many courses that we do so many

133
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:13,680
offerings in which we try to make these opportunities in which people can connect with one another

134
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:19,599
whether that's the small practice groups for person or when we're on zoom we're

135
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,960
doing breakout rooms if you're sitting

136
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,079
retreats they're often practice discussions or group practice discussions

137
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:35,440
there's also in the beginning in the ending retreat often some breakout rooms

138
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:43,040
just this recognition that we learn a lot from each other and also this recognition that

139
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:50,000
everybody has some wisdom of course they do i heard this quote once now i can't give

140
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:57,280
an attribution because i don't remember but this idea that nobody is smart enough to be

141
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:04,000
completely wrong like you would have to know everything that's right in order to make sure that

142
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,359
it's wrong or i don't know i like this idea but all of us all of us have wisdom that we

143
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:16,240
can share with others so the buddha of course recognized this

144
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:21,680
as well so there's this story in the suttas about megia

145
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:27,119
megia was the buddhist attendant before ananda was the attendant

146
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:33,760
and going for alms around one morning megia saw a mango grove that

147
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:39,040
seemed attractive to him that seemed compelling and he wanted to practice there

148
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:46,640
so he asked the buddha i'd like to go practice there in the mango grove and meditate for the day

149
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:52,320
and the buddha said why don't you wait because nobody else is here and he he was the buddha's

150
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,760
attendant and the buddha wanted him to stay but megia

151
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:04,319
insisted and the buddha said okay you can go so then megia goes to the mango grove

152
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:09,520
and sits to meditate and he had a difficult time he had a hard

153
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:15,599
time so he returned to the buddha and reported what had happened when he

154
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:22,400
was at the mango grove and uh here's what he says pante which is a

155
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:28,960
word for uh like teacher or yeah of a teacher or something ponte

156
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:35,040
while i was dwelling in that mango grove i was overcome by three kinds of harmful

157
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:41,200
unwholesome thoughts sensual thoughts aversive thoughts and

158
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:49,200
cruel thoughts it then occurred to me this is astounding and incredible

159
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:55,280
out of faith i have left the lay life and became a monastic

160
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:02,318
yet i am filled with these three kinds of harmful unwholesome thoughts

161
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,760
right so megia is maybe like surprised that even though all of his practice and

162
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,200
he's dedicated his life to be a monastic he's dedicated his life

163
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:19,359
to practice and he still has these unwholesome thoughts sensual thoughts aversive thoughts cruel

164
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:24,800
thoughts and not only has he become a monastic he

165
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,400
is the attendant of some would argue the best meditator that humankind has

166
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:36,160
known and yet he himself is still he's probably heard

167
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:42,000
countless numbers of dharma talks but he's not quite able to

168
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:48,720
himself to find that meditation that uh is not without sensual thoughts aversive

169
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,680
thoughts and cruel thoughts so he goes back to the buddha

170
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:00,480
after and he tells him just what i said and then the buddha responds megy

171
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,599
when mental liberation has not fully ripened that is when they're not

172
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:12,400
completely awakened there are five things which are conducive to full ripening

173
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:18,800
what five so now that buddha is gonna let him know what here are some things that he can do

174
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:26,240
one the buddha doesn't says one this is a my editorial edition

175
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:32,160
megia when one has good spiritual friends

176
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:38,480
good spiritual companions good spiritual associates

177
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:44,240
two one is virtuous three one there are conversations which are

178
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:50,400
supportive for developing humility and helpful for opening one's mind

179
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:56,319
four one has energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and acquiring

180
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:01,520
wholesome qualities and five one is wise

181
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:08,160
endowed with the wisdom that knows the arising and passing of experiences

182
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:16,720
so then the buddha continues so magya when one has good spiritual friends good spiritual comrades good

183
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:22,079
spiritual associates it can be expected that they will be virtuous it can be

184
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:27,200
expected that they will have conversations which are supportive for developing humility and

185
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:33,119
helpful for opening one's mind when you have good spiritual friends it can be expected that you'll have the

186
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:38,480
energy for abandoning unwholesome qualities and and

187
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:43,520
acquiring wholesome qualities and when one has good spiritual friends

188
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:49,359
one will be wise endowed with the wisdom that knows arising and passing

189
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:55,680
so here the buddha is pointing out that what if we are associating with the right people it's more likely that we'll

190
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:02,160
have some of these other qualities that can help us on this on the path towards awakening

191
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:08,800
and we saw that with the earlier quote where the buddha is saying that just like the dawn is the precursor of the

192
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,160
morning so good spiritual friends is a precursor

193
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:19,440
to developing the noble eightfold path but one thing that i appreciate about

194
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:27,200
this passage is that there's these three different words spiritual friends companions and associates

195
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:33,280
translators can argue about you know exactly which way to translate them but the point is that it's three different

196
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:39,680
words so i'm interpreting them as three different levels of intimacy

197
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:45,359
some are good friends maybe some people are just those that you see maybe you

198
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:53,599
don't have a relationship with but you see there the way that they move in the world the way that they show up or

199
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:59,119
some action that they do sometimes when we're on meditation

200
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:06,079
retreats in person probably all of us have had this experience where we're

201
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:11,680
doing something going to the hall leaving the hole going into the dining hall whatever it

202
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:17,040
might be and we see somebody who is behaving really in a mindful way it's

203
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:23,280
like oh right i'm supposed to be mindful. so maybe that's just somebody that's uh

204
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:30,160
sharing the space a fellow retreat and so this this different levels there's

205
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:37,280
good friends that we might have maybe there's people that we would only chat with or when we see them in the zoom

206
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:45,280
breakout rooms for example i mean we don't speak with them outside but maybe then and we're happy to see them and

207
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:51,920
share with them our experience or or maybe there's people that we don't really know but we see

208
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,920
and are inspired by so we could interpret this that the buddha

209
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:04,160
recognized that our minds have a whole range of potential

210
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:10,240
we can have this selfishness aggressiveness and

211
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:17,359
sensual thoughts thoughts of cruelty thoughts of just some general unwholesome unhelpful thoughts

212
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:24,000
all of us have this potential in the same way all of us have the potential for

213
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,520
wisdom and compassion kindness and warmth

214
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:35,440
and the buddha also recognized of course that we don't live in these hermetically

215
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:41,680
sealed vacuums our minds are not completely independent

216
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:46,800
of course we are influenced by others of course we are influenced by our

217
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:53,599
environment this is why the buddha often suggested you know going to the foot of the tree

218
00:46:53,599 --> 00:47:00,800
and meditating you know going off into seclusion but he also suggested that you have good

219
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:06,000
spiritual friends and we can say well what's the definition of a good spiritual friend

220
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,880
and we could say it's one that supports your practice supports this movement towards greater

221
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:18,720
freedom some greater ease so which of these potentials for

222
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:24,480
unwholesome thoughts or wholesome thoughts which ones of these gets realized

223
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:32,079
is influenced by our environments our friends and maybe we could also bring into

224
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:36,880
this the which media we consume

225
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:45,119
dharma books or social media and which are the intention is to be inflammatory and

226
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:51,920
divisive or news sources this memory right the news news sources all of them have a business

227
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:57,599
model and their business model is to get readers

228
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:02,640
so of course they are going to point out

229
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:07,920
things that are catchy or grab our attention

230
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:14,079
maybe they're not all inaccurate but maybe they are have a particular point of view in which they're emphasizing the

231
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:18,800
worst or the best or something like this

232
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:26,720
and maybe others just silently speak to the hidden potentials within us maybe there's

233
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:32,640
something inside of us that gets inspired when we see another or

234
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:38,880
we read a dharma book or listen to a dharma talk or have some drama friends with we

235
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:46,839
talk about i think all of us probably can look back on our lives and see oh

236
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:52,480
yeah why being influenced by different people even

237
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,599
you know parents sometimes will restrict kids from you know i don't

238
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:02,960
think you should spend so much time with these kids i notice that when you do that you're

239
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:08,000
cussing a lot or whatever it is whatever it might be

240
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:16,240
so in the suit does there's also where the monastics help one another

241
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:22,720
at the opening scene of the anapanasati suta that is the discourse on mindfulness of

242
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:28,720
breathing mindfulness of breathing of course is a key practice that we do and

243
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:36,240
and reading that suta i was primarily interested in you know the steps with breathing these 16 steps the

244
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:43,520
four tetrads but i never forgot this opening scene that really did touch

245
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:51,119
me and it goes something like this now at that time the senior monastics

246
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:58,240
were advising and instructing the junior monastics some senior monastics instructed 10

247
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:03,599
monastics while others instructed 20 30 or 40

248
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:09,200
and being instructed by the senior monastics that junior monastics realized

249
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:15,119
a higher distinction than they had before so just this small little

250
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:21,280
i don't know often we tend to kind of like throw away some of these uh sentences in the sutras but this

251
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:26,960
recognition that the there's a teaching going on and i believe my understanding

252
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:34,400
is even in the today's monasteries there's a lot of teaching that happens between the monastics

253
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:41,280
and here's one that um i'd like to share this is from the terry gotta that is

254
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:47,599
these are the verses from nuns that have been awakened

255
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:54,720
and this is from the nan uttama and she's describing a little bit of her story of

256
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:59,280
how she became awakened it goes like this

257
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:07,119
four or five times i left my dwelling i had failed to find peace of heart or

258
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:12,800
any control of my mind i approached a nun

259
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:18,160
in whom i had faith she taught me the dharma

260
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:23,839
the aggregates sense fields and elements

261
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:29,599
when i had heard her teaching in accordance with her instructions

262
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:38,480
i sat cross-legged for seven days without moving given over to rapture and bliss

263
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:47,200
on the eighth day i stretched out my feet having shattered the mass of darkness

264
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:54,160
quite something to sit for seven days i don't know if we should take this literally or not

265
00:51:54,160 --> 00:52:00,240
but i appreciate very much she starts this nun i had failed to find peace of heart or

266
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:05,520
any control over my mind so then she goes to a nun in whom she had faith so

267
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:10,960
maybe she had noticed this other nun maybe she had noticed or maybe this nun

268
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:16,160
was patatara we don't know it might be panachara some of you know

269
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:21,280
that we had we have a padachara statue this right here now is the buddha

270
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:26,559
but we also have one that's padachar who's down at the retreat center and she was

271
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:33,280
one of the premier nun teachers one of the first teachers so perhaps it was patatar but perhaps it

272
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:39,119
was another nun that uttama went to received some teachings

273
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:44,880
and then she did the teachings and became awakened shattered the mass of darkness

274
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:50,079
the mass of darkness we can understand as pain ignorance or delusion so that

275
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:53,599
she saw clearly

276
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:01,599
so what is it what would it take to have these good spiritual friends

277
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:08,720
often it's not easy to i'm using this expression good spiritual friends it's a translation of

278
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:14,400
kaliana mita some of you may be familiar with that expression

279
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:20,400
there's a number of different ways we can translate it but i'll keep it as good spiritual friends

280
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:25,599
and so to develop these types of friendships probably requires some patience

281
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:30,880
some deliberate effort of course being friendly and having

282
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,800
warmth and being a good listener right everybody knows this you don't need me

283
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,839
to tell you this but maybe these types of relationships grow

284
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:49,359
of course like all relationships with honesty and being authentic and not trying to be

285
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:54,640
more spiritual or something like this right not trying to fit ourselves into

286
00:53:54,640 --> 00:54:02,240
some mold but not only that is a willingness to learn from

287
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:09,440
and be supported by others that is to be teachable

288
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:15,280
there are some people who just feel uncomfortable with the idea that somebody else might know something

289
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:21,520
that they don't know or they just have to spend their energy showing how

290
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:26,720
much they know and aren't really teachable

291
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:31,760
so in order to have these good spiritual friends friendships

292
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:38,160
we have to be willing to be teachable and can we be inspired by others with

293
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:44,720
without a feeling of envy without a feeling of

294
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:50,839
oh they have everything i don't have anything you know without our inner critic getting

295
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:57,599
activated maybe there's a little bit of envy maybe a little bit of the inner critic gets activated but not in a way

296
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:03,920
that it is a hindrance or is a burdensome or

297
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:10,000
problematic for our relationships can we just recognize that other

298
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:17,440
people's lives unfold differently than ours of course they do

299
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:23,760
of course they do earlier i was talking about how well kind of connected so there's all these conditions

300
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:30,480
people are have been influenced by different conditions different people in their lives so of course their lives

301
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:37,599
unfold differently than ours can we receive feedback

302
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:44,240
either directly or indirectly we might notice as i said earlier that

303
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:50,480
when we see somebody who's been mindful our mind mindlessness might be highlighted

304
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:56,960
or maybe when we see when somebody's their speech is really clean their their own gossip

305
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:03,599
they aren't divisive they're not you know speaking in such a way that it's

306
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:09,119
denigrating to anybody and that might be

307
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:14,240
a way which can highlight for us oh yeah when i was complaining or wanting to

308
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:19,839
talk about somebody else they didn't join me in this instead maybe they could

309
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:24,319
like skillfully change the topic

310
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:32,400
well maybe we do have some conceit about our meditation practice or our

311
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:39,760
attainments that we believe that we've had and we feel like we somehow feel like we have to show

312
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:45,440
them or let people know but maybe we it might be softened if we

313
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:51,599
spend time with people who hold themselves slightly or perhaps don't even show any interest

314
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:57,839
in our uh spiritual attainment so to speak but

315
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:03,200
instead they are interested in just us as individuals

316
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:08,799
so this is part of being a good spiritual friend and maybe also

317
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:14,160
say not to being attached to our views or

318
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:21,839
our group that is are we just looking for confirmation of what we already know

319
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:29,920
or are we open to learning from other people that are different from us maybe have different life experiences

320
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:35,760
have different backgrounds different meditation experiences

321
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:42,160
so this idea of cultivating good spiritual friends is such an

322
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:48,480
integral part of our practice and the buddha recognized this and i'm sure all of us recognize this

323
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:55,440
too how this practice to walk with others but of course not in a way in

324
00:57:55,440 --> 00:58:02,319
which we give up our discernment not in a way in which we give up our

325
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:09,520
ability to say this doesn't quite feel right and to

326
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:16,160
not give up our autonomy or anything like this but instead to allow ourselves to be

327
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:24,480
influenced and to use our wisdom so that we can be

328
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:32,240
not only have a good spiritual friends but be a good spiritual friend

329
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:39,119
and in this way can kind of um with this connectedness that we recognize

330
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:45,359
that we have with each other one another that we can support

331
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:52,559
one another and maybe those who feel supported can support yet other people and and in this

332
00:58:52,559 --> 00:59:00,880
way there the support can grow and more and more people benefiting from our practice

333
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:09,400
to may all beings benefit from our practice thank you
