1
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:09,240
so welcome [Music] welcome so today I'm going to continue

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:16,400
this exploration of poetry and practice and this has been such a rich

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,240
uh Endeavor for me some of you know that I'm certainly not trained in the Arts

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,800
I'm trained as a scientist so I come to this appreciation of poetry laid in life

5
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,160
and and so not as a scholar or anybody that's you know done any

6
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:44,480
um formal training or investigation but I just want to share like this

7
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,480
person's understanding interpretation of them

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:57,199
so and I like to use poems that have a lot of imagery because there's a way at least

9
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:04,119
for me that this uh imagery um it does it it touches us differently touches me

10
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:10,200
differently than just words than just uh something very

11
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,600
specific and explicit and to be sure I appreciate all

12
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,600
these different time different ways in which we can communicate and

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,400
share what's going on with us as individuals or ideas opinions

14
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,399
views but po poetry has this

15
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:41,040
distillation this of this pointing that I find really meaningful and

16
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:49,799
impactful and today's poem has a real gritty quality to it it's not all

17
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,439
beautiful and I mean I think the poem is beautiful but the content and I chose

18
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:02,719
this today partly because that's the truth of The Human Experience some sometimes it feels

19
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:09,440
gritty sometimes there are rough spots sometimes there are difficulties like

20
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,920
real difficulties and for me I think part of the practice the beauty of the

21
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:21,680
practice is to invite those parts of our experience

22
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,400
in not to just wash over them and pretend they don't

23
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:35,200
exist so well that is a short little introduction let's do a guided

24
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,239
meditation and I'll do a little bit of guiding get it get us settled and then

25
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:46,040
I'll drop in the poem and just a reminder with this poem

26
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:52,040
you don't have to do anything with it just allow it to touch you and maybe it

27
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,360
touches you and maybe it doesn't and that's okay how however we receive these

28
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,760
is perfectly fine perfectly fine

29
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:12,599
okay so maybe taking a big exhale as I find myself doing as I start

30
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:18,159
to settle in and with this

31
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:26,120
exhale can be a sense of Letting Go sense of a settling

32
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:34,720
in the neuroscience just tell us that these large exhales activate the

33
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:41,599
parasympathetic nervous system which is a way of you know this relaxing and

34
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:53,000
soothing so perhaps what we've been doing naturally the scientists are catching up and telling us it's good for

35
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,680
us

36
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:12,640
and then bring attention awareness to the experience of This

37
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:24,040
Moment The Experience includes how we what formation this body

38
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:31,600
is in how we're situated in space more specifically

39
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:40,160
the activity of sitting literally or

40
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,000
figuratively taking a meditation posture meditation

41
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:54,560
stance and how does it feel at this moment to be in this

42
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:01,560
configuration right now

43
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,440
some things that might be obvious is the pressure against the

44
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:30,360
body where the body is in contact the chair the cushion

45
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:38,840
the ground couch bed whatever it might

46
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,880
be feeling the pressure on our

47
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:16,639
feet as we're in contact with the Earth ground our legs if we're

48
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,840
sitting the

49
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:31,400
butex the back if you're leaning on a chair

50
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,599
maybe there's a very slight pressure of the hands that they're resting on or if

51
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:49,039
they're touching that if the two hands are

52
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,639
touching each

53
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
other

54
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:14,360
doing a broad sweep of the body noticing if there are obvious

55
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:20,599
places of tension tightness

56
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,680
contraction and just resting the attention

57
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
there

58
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:47,400
it might be that the simple bringing attention to areas with

59
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:54,199
tension allow the tension to dissipate let go

60
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:01,319
soften and maybe not there's no guarantees

61
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:10,280
but can we invite into our experience whatever is

62
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:19,319
happening in those areas of tension or tightness without insisting that they be

63
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:26,319
different but creating the conditions in which something different

64
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,240
might arise

65
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:46,600
bringing a quality of curiosity and care to the

66
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
attention

67
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,240
and noticing that the body is

68
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:31,639
breathing resting Awareness on the sensations of the body body

69
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,360
moving while it

70
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:51,600
breathes alternatively some of you may be resting attention on the feeling of the cold and

71
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,519
warm air going in and out of the

72
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
nose

73
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:58,040
right now there's nowhere else to

74
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:07,880
be there's nothing else to do we are just here now with the

75
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,639
experience of

76
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
breathing

77
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,759
can we bring a quality of care and

78
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,040
warmth to our

79
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,639
experience as if this mattered what we're

80
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:03,720
doing as if it were

81
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:11,639
important not in the sense that it has to be done but in the sense that it's

82
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
valuable

83
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,040
inhabiting this experience being

84
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:49,920
embodied not thinking about it or looking at it but

85
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:55,600
experiencing the sensations of

86
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
breathing

87
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:23,040
it wouldn't be surprising if the Mind wandered away we

88
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:30,440
don't have to make it be a problem we don't have to make a story about what that means

89
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:38,680
we just very simply gently begin again with the sensations of

90
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
breathing

91
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:14,320
what would it be like to give yourself

92
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,279
over to being with the

93
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,600
breath letting all other experiences being in the

94
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,279
background while in the

95
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:44,680
foreground is the sensations of inhales and

96
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
exhales

97
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,440
so I'm going to drop in a

98
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,320
poem there's nothing that you need to

99
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:47,679
do with this poem just allowing it to be

100
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:56,519
received you don't have to try to make sense of it evaluate it analyze

101
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:03,880
it just allowing it to

102
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,000
land in your

103
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:16,720
experience the PO goes like

104
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:26,159
this there's a bluebird in my heart that wants to get out but I'm too tough for

105
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:33,679
him I say stay in there I'm not going to let anybody see

106
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:40,039
you there's a bluebird in my heart that wants to get out but I pour Whiskey on

107
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:45,400
him and inhale cigarette smoke and the  and the bartenders and the

108
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,919
grocery clerks never know that he's in

109
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,960
there there's a bluebird in my heart that wants to get out but I'm too tough

110
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:03,120
for him I say stay down do you want to mess me

111
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:10,360
up you want to screw up the works you want to blow my book sales in

112
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:17,919
Europe there's a bluebird in my heart that wants to get out but I'm too

113
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:23,480
clever I only let him out at night sometimes when everybody's

114
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:30,279
asleep I say I know that you're there so don't be

115
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:36,159
sad then I put him back but he's singing a little in there

116
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:42,279
I haven't quite let him die and we sleep together like that with

117
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:54,080

118

[Music]

135
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,120
so this poem was called Bluebird by Charles P

136
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:03,799

00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:38,360
Bowski called Bluebird I admit that I didn't even know

140
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:44,760
until last night that uh Charles Bukowski was actually a well-known poet this you know poetry isn't something

141
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:51,200
that I've studied it's more something that touches me on the and I save

142
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:59,120
poems and I heard this poem just recently and somebody was reading it and

143
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,840
I felt really touched by it and it wasn't until last night that I

144
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:09,919

this uh the speaker in this poem I don't know if it's

161
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:08,919
autobiographical I imagine it is that has this tough exterior he talks

162
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:14,600
about how he's too tough and too clever and but yet he also has this sensitive

163
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:20,120
tender vulnerable emotional core that he's struggling to

164
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:27,080
protect and this real separation between what this

165
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:34,120
individual is showing the world being a tough guy and what's being experienced

166
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:40,360
inside some vulnerability or happiness right often we think about

167
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:45,960
bluebirds with they're the bluebirds of Happiness so we might imagine that this

168
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:55,960
person kind of like uh earned his living as a poet is kind of this gritty uh misanthropic kind of

169
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:01,000
character but really maybe there in was inside was

170
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:09,520
something that didn't quite align with what was being presented to the exterior and what was being presented as being

171
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,760
appropriate for his uh view of himself his

172
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:20,679
identity it's also a reminder for all of us that those individuals who seem to be

173
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:28,040
tough on the outside maybe even ourselves sometimes to have a gentler

174
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:34,919
tender side inside at least I want to believe this I

175
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:41,919
don't want to believe that people are just you know through and through of this

176
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:47,240
uh roughness about them we might say that the Dharma is

177
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:55,919
this part of the path of uncovering these positive qualities inside of us and then this

178
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:03,640
path of uncovering ing these in some ways we meet all the difficulties of our life difficulties

179
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:11,359
that are in our minds right the ones that we make up and everything that seems to obstruct or get in the way of

180
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:17,200
aligning with or discovering or finding our way with

181
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:24,920
experiencing the beauty the tender the vulnerability the emotional aspects of a

182
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:32,960
human experience so this poem has this refrain there's a

183
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:40,680
bluebird in my heart that wants to get out sometimes we ourselves have refrains

184
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:47,680
things that are we repeat to ourselves stories about ourselves stories about um

185
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:54,760
what it means to be us and I'm using this word stories not to be pejorative or to say that they're not true but to

186
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:04,040
maybe highlight that there's a way in which they're fabricated there's a way in which we are um creating them based

187
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:10,800
on experiences we've had but they are created nevertheless that is they aren't

188
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:17,119
expressing this some inherent truth about

189
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:22,920
ourselves so this reframes these things that we repeat to ourselves and this

190
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:30,240
poet here he's writing there's a bluebird in my heart heart that wants to get

191
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:38,520
out it's very powerful this maybe tenderness or things

192
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:45,480
that we feel like are inside of us but somehow we don't know how to get in touch with or Express or incorporate

193
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:51,880
into a view of ourselves but something I want to highlight here is that the poet or the

194
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:57,720
speaker in this poem is making a real distinction

195
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:03,640
between himself I'm assuming it's a masculine

196
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:10,760
person and what's inside like there's this Bluebird

197
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:17,680
inside and then maybe there's this rough exterior outside and this is part of what the

198
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,960
dooka of The Human Experience to is like thinking that or breaking up our

199
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:29,040
experience into like sub parts that somehow are like in conflict with one

200
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:35,760
another like this part of me wants that this other part of me wants this other

201
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:42,920
thing but part of Dharma practice is is this integration like integrating I mean

202
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:49,160
this wholeness and discovering that maybe

203
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:55,880
there isn't these different aspects these different parts to this entity to

204
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:01,079
this being but more there's just different

205
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:08,079
experiences without having to create identities and sub identities without having to say you know there's this

206
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:14,760
Bluebird character that's different than this other character instead we might say that oh

207
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:20,200
there's moments of vulnerability there's moments of tenderness there's moments of

208
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:26,800
sadness there's moments of singing this blue bird there's also moments of being

209
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:32,280
too clever moments of being too tough the moments of

210
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:38,599
hiding things from other people in our life maybe even hiding them from

211
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:45,560
ourselves and there's this way like one way it's kind of this um sub characters

212
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:52,560
that get created often is an inner critic of ourselves and that's kind of like help creating this divide between

213
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,760
these different aspects and then this poem The speaker is saying to this

214
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:06,359
Bluebird you stay in there I'm not going to let anybody see you stay down do you want to mess me

215
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:14,079
up I know that you're there so don't be sad this is a way in which sometimes you

216
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:21,160
know the inner critic we speak to ourselves with a sense of

217
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:26,720
harshness a sense of you know somehow you're inadequate or inappropriate in

218
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:33,920
some way ouch ouch this is Dua this is really

219
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:41,280
dooka and then sometimes our activities you know the way that we show up in the world is an expression of this I'm using

220
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:47,920
the word inner critic there's so many different ways we might consider this but in this poem The Poet is saying he

221
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:53,680
pours Whiskey on him and inhaling cigarette smoke and only let him out

222
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,400
sometimes but I haven't quite let him die

223
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:10,640
so these activities that the speaker of this poem is using about uh pouring whiskey and cigarette smoke and not

224
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:16,119
quite letting them die there's these ways of kind of like squashing down like

225
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:23,280
maybe this a certain aspects of his experience the tender happy vulnerable

226
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,640
side but there's also ways in which can do things that aren't so obvious as

227
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:34,599
drinking and smoking and other things that are unhealthy for

228
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:40,200
us but there's a way that we can use spiritual practice

229
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:45,319
itself as a way to avoid our inner life

230
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:51,839
we use these spiritual ideas and practices to sidestep some of our unresolved

231
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:57,240
emotional issues for example I love Jack cornfields expression and this

232
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:03,000
unfinished business of the heart some of these wounds that we

233
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:10,079
have so there's a way in which we might using this practice that's supposed to help us you like integrate and become

234
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:18,960
whole with all of our experiences but we actually use it as a way to avoid working with what's so difficult

235
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:24,119
there's a way in which we can disconnect from our feelings or not look at the big

236
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:30,680
picture or Shield us from the truth because we're just being mindful of each moment or reading the next Dharma book

237
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:37,640
or something like this to be sure there's nothing wrong with spiritual practice in fact you know I would

238
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:43,319
support such a thing but it's sometimes the way that we use

239
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:49,119
it to not be in touch with the grittiness of Our

240
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:54,760
Lives kind of chose this poem because the grittin is like so obvious we don't

241
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,960
have to work very hard to imagine

242
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:06,839
it and to be sure like working with spiritual practice is better than some other defense mechanisms better than uh

243
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:14,560
drinking whiskey and smoking cigarettes I don't know exactly when this poem was written but I'm imagine I know the poet

244
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:23,039
was born in 1920 so you know maybe 1950s 60s 70s I'm not

245
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:31,680
sure but I'd like to end with a maybe a um a challenge a

246
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:36,760
query what if they're actually is no

247
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:42,960
Bluebird and no tough

248
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:49,800
exterior what if we just put down stop the reification of these entities of

249
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:55,000
these experiences and it's just this

250
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,079
experience and and then this experience and then this experience what if life is

251
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:08,160
just a collection of experiences and of course we want to make meaning out of our experiences but

252
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:15,760
is there a way that we kind of are trapping the bluebird inside trapping having this rough

253
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:24,040
exterior that can only be rough by creating the these entities with what

254
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:30,760
are just in fact experience expences one after the other maybe these creating

255
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:35,839
personas or characters is

256
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:41,280
extra and is part of what is

257
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:49,040
Dua so the way to happiness is not to finally let the bluebird out to not

258
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:55,720
finally let go of the toughness or the roughness the way to happiness is to

259
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:00,960
kind of like let the bluebird and the roughness

260
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:11,280
integrate maybe the bluebird and so much not doesn't want to get out doesn't want to escape this uh character instead it

261
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,640
just wants to

262
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:28,000
integrate so I leave you with some of these thoughts with this poem Bluebird by Charles Bowski

263
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:35,680
thank you and I'm wishing you a wonderful day thank

264
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,640
you
