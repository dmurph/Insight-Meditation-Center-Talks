1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,660
so hello everyone nice to see you arriving

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,179
let's go ahead and get started together Okay so

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,059
settling in for meditation

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:25,580
sensing into the body arriving at your spot

5
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:31,939
and closing your eyes if it's comfortable for you to do so

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,120
maybe taking a couple of long slow deep breaths

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,020
really filling the lungs and then just allowing the breath to naturally

8
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:52,559
exhale just to really Connect into the feeling

9
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,620
of the body and then just letting the breath be

10
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,920
natural

11
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:16,260
and as is often helpful at the beginning of a sit inviting some ease throughout the body

12
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,439
sensing into the head area

13
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,299
softening the eyes and the eye sockets

14
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,020
letting go of all the little muscles on the scalp

15
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,520
down through the jaw and the throat

16
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:55,799
and releasing the shoulders entity holding in the upper back

17
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,619
so that the heart can naturally be forward

18
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,099
just letting the arms float freely

19
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:24,739
and all down into the belly area releasing the diaphragm

20
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,440
softening the area of the belly so that it can

21
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:39,260
kind of round out or drop down farther into the abdomen

22
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:55,640
releasing any holding in the low back so that we're just balanced on the spine

23
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:13,080
and releasing the hip joints down through the legs

24
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:21,780
the calves the Achilles and into the feet

25
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,860
just inviting is inviting some connection to the body

26
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,299
and it's okay however it is

27
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:54,739
bringing attention also to this state of the mind or the heart

28
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:05,060
first of all noticing what's there how are you right now

29
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,959
and then also inviting some ease in the mind

30
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:31,740
one way to do that is to find some bit of ease somewhere

31
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:39,960
and just connect with that kind of emphasize it in attention even

32
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,860
if there are other parts of the mind that are not so much at ease

33
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,300
connecting in with the sensations of the breath

34
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:30,360
scenting the breath maybe like a warm bath

35
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:36,199
something gentle

36
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,240
something that envelops the body

37
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:54,259
imagining that we can steep the body and the breath

38
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:19,820
just encouraging the body and the mind to be simple

39
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:36,259
if they're complicated or agitated parts we can put them more on the back burner

40
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:44,720
and keep the Simplicity of our awareness and breath and Body on the front burner

41
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:34,440
if you begin to sense some degree of peace or ease

42
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:42,560
or even wholesome pleasure in the experience of breathing

43
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:50,280
it's fine to favor that in attention to emphasize

44
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,819
that

45
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:11,300
this is actually how the instructions for mindfulness of breathing go

46
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:17,699
mindfulness is not always purely neutral

47
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:23,840
so go ahead in favor any sense of ease or peace

48
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,780
feeling the simple rhythmic rocking of the breath

49
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:30,839
and if we're getting to involved in the pleasure and the joy of the breath will

50
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:37,320
feel that as agitation or if we're resisting

51
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,839
this idea of enjoying the simple experience of the breath I

52
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:48,779
will feel that his agitation also finding the middle way that's very

53
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:55,940
simple intends toward ease

54
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,579
for now I will offer a shift

55
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:37,620
now turning the attention more toward the changing nature of the

56
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:43,019
breath it's the same experience but we turn

57
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:50,040
attention more toward the flow in and out Sensations that continually

58
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:56,480
changing experience of the breath

59
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,920
we see that it's never the same from moment to moment

60
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:18,920
but there is still some use in just resting with the flow

61
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:10,100
we can gently open just a bit

62
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:16,759
the investigation aspect of the Mind

63
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:24,120
acknowledging that the breath is a multitude of Sensations

64
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:29,339
that are arising shifting and passing away

65
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:36,720
in an overlapping kind of way really allowing the Deep acknowledgment

66
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,720
of that in the body in the mind

67
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:55,760
keeping the Mind soft as we open to the

68
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:01,860
flutter Kaleidoscope of change

69
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,880
that is the bread

70
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:16,160
and it will rest in Silence with that for a bit

71
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,899
and in the last few minutes of this meditation

72
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:28,620
we can reflect that what is experienced

73
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:34,440
just in the breath is

74
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:41,159
also paralleled in life daily life

75
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:48,720
as well as in the Arc of our life and if there's a continual arising

76
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,260
shifting and changing and passing away of things

77
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,940
and the degree to which we can acknowledge and rest in that

78
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,399
we're in touch with how things actually are

79
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,179
relationships change over time

80
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:27,320
there are new ones and sometimes they end our work has changed

81
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:34,700
our body and health shift over time

82
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:45,260
the weather the seasons it's always in flux in some way

83
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:50,520
and of course we know this at some level

84
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,200
but we also forget it

85
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:01,440
and often times when we're suffering

86
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:08,900
our times when we are out of touch with this natural flow

87
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:21,799
so we can reflect on the way meditation prepares us for Living Well in the world

88
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:29,820
it's not about knowing a lot about the breath it's about having that experience

89
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:39,559
and relating to it well that then somehow can come forth as we meet life

90
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:50,480
so we can hope that in our day today and going forward

91
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:56,820
we're able to discern these patterns of how things work

92
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:02,760
in order that we can relate well to people and

93
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:08,940
live in a way that is inspiring and reminds people in even

94
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:16,559
just a simple way that it's possible to flow along with life

95
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:21,080
in a way that doesn't have too much suffering

96
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,260
[Music]

97
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,380
foreign

98
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:16,140
we've made it to the last item in our list of five Dharma resources for

99
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:22,679
meeting life well we've talked about confidence SATA

100
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:29,279
ethical conduct or virtue Sila listening and learning

101
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:35,159
suta and generosity and letting go chaga

102
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:41,340
and then the last item can be seen as something distinct but it's also one

103
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:49,799
that emerges from and sums up the other four and it is discernment panya

104
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:55,799
that word is also translated as wisdom but we'll lean toward using discernment

105
00:31:55,799 --> 00:32:03,539
for today and there are many things that it's useful to discern on the path to Freedom

106
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:09,059
the most fundamental is understanding what is unskillful and what is skillful

107
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:14,220
so Discerning between what leads towards suffering and what leads away from

108
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:20,159
suffering so this links ponya to Selah virtue or

109
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:26,399
ethics but it also goes outside the conventional range of Ethics into areas

110
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:33,020
like choosing how to navigate the Mind during sitting meditation

111
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:38,940
sometimes people think that there shouldn't be any form of judgment in practice

112
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:44,159
we just accept everything all the time in a passive way

113
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:51,000
but this is too broad brush judiciousness is essential for waking up

114
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,179
this is from the Dharma Potter in a chapter called the just

115
00:32:56,179 --> 00:33:04,020
the wise person who as if holding a set of scales selects what's good and avoids

116
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:10,799
what's evil is for that reason a sage whoever can weigh these two sides of the

117
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:16,380
world is for that reason called a sage

118
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:24,360
so I apologize for the word evil that's what the translation said we could just think unskillful or unwholesome

119
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:31,799
and the same chapter also says one is not just who judges a case hastily a

120
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:37,740
wise person considers both what is and isn't right

121
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:44,039
so these quotes affirm that wise judgment is indeed part of practice

122
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:49,799
but they also imply the way these ones were written having some kind of time to

123
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:56,279
consider options you know weighing the two sides of the world considering both what is and isn't right

124
00:33:56,279 --> 00:34:03,539
and sometimes we have the space to do that and we should when we can this is part of living a conscious reflective

125
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:10,500
life um but there's also what happens in the moment so unfortunately there are other

126
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,658
ways that we can train our discernment so that it becomes a reliable resource

127
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:20,700
even right in the moment when it's combined with mindfulness

128
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:28,020
so to do this it's best to understand the ways in which we tend to make mistakes in how we

129
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:33,720
see things and then we can train to see in wiser ways

130
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:40,679
so um these are various ways that we don't properly discern what's going on you

131
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:47,700
know when we're making mistakes basically because we gloss over details or we focus on the wrong thing

132
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:54,000
so the Buddha identified three main mistakes let's say to watch for I think

133
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,960
he called them distortions so one gloss that we make is to see

134
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,300
things that are impermanent as permanent or things that are changing as

135
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:13,980
unchanging and in many cases this comes down to a matter of careful mindfulness

136
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:19,859
so you know suppose we're outside and we look across a clearing and we see a

137
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:28,079
black line across the ground it looks solid but as we get closer we see that it's

138
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,540
actually a line of ants it's lots of ants walking close together in the same

139
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:39,540
direction you can see this sometimes like on Retreats out in Retreat centers that are

140
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:45,060
in the jungle or out away from you know from the cities I've seen

141
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:50,760
several of these ant lines so as we get close this solid line breaks up into

142
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:56,220
individual ants in motion or maybe you've seen those um fire

143
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:03,300
sticks that people sometimes wave around on holidays maybe more often in Asia than here but you do it at night and

144
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:11,160
it's a stick that's burning on one end where these days it might be an LED or something and you it's twirled rapidly

145
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:18,060
in a circle and it looks like a solid circle of light because we don't see that it's a single light being moved

146
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:25,020
when it's going fast like that there are many things that are like this you know we look out and we see a tree

147
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:31,200
but if we get closer and closer and closer like really close eventually you'll be looking at

148
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:38,960
molecules that are that are all in motion you know how solid is that tree

149
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:45,480
sitting in meditation we might perceive pain in our shoulder to be a solid wall

150
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:52,560
it feels like a hardened area almost like a stone but with careful mindfulness if we're

151
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,740
willing to turn toward it sometimes the pain can break up into many little

152
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:04,260
Sparks of sensation often in quite a small area I mean it might still be there as strong

153
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:09,660
sensation but we can't quite believe in its solidity anymore

154
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:15,839
if we look with careful mindfulness so experiences like solidity and

155
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:22,560
unchangingness are actually products of how we're seeing uh if things are changing slowly or if

156
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:29,280
mindfulness is not very precise you know we're just catching a moment here and there not every moment then

157
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:35,640
they can seem relatively permanent it's a very important Dharma insight to

158
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:41,940
see into the impermanent in constant and changing nature of actually all

159
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:48,599
experience and this greatly assists in letting go because we discern in sort of at an

160
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:54,420
intuitive level that there really isn't much to grasp and we can train the mind to discern in

161
00:37:54,420 --> 00:38:01,260
this way we can incline towards seeing in that way and as we do we do that you

162
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:09,359
know just throughout the day and in meditation that way of seeing will be available to us as a Dharma resource at

163
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:16,520
moments where it's useful so then a second gloss or misperception

164
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:23,940
is to see what is ultimately unsatisfying as fully satisfying

165
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:29,160
so we typically carry the idea that getting something pleasant something

166
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:34,200
that we want is going to satisfy us maybe it's even going to be the thing

167
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:41,640
that really does it for us you know if I just get this one thing or if I just get rid of this one thing then then it will

168
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:47,040
be better for example we might think

169
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,380
ah I'm going to take a hot bath tonight that is really going to do it for me

170
00:38:52,380 --> 00:39:00,420
after a long day of work and if the conditions come together and we do get to do that we enjoy it but

171
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:06,060
does it really satisfy completely doesn't your mind just go on to the next

172
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:11,220
thing that will be just perfect so we're talking here about this quality

173
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:17,160
of dukkha unsatisfactoriness in human life and it helps very much to

174
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:23,700
understand that duka doesn't have to have this narrow meaning of suffering which is often how it's translated

175
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:29,599
definitely a nice hot bath is not suffering nor is it wrong to enjoy it

176
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:38,040
but a hot bath is Duca because it is not able to ultimately satisfy us and if we

177
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:44,280
don't know that we're actually setting ourselves up for genuine suffering

178
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:51,420
and if we're honest really all those special Pleasant things that we create in our life are quite temporary and

179
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:58,140
sometimes not even as good in the moment as we think they're going to be yes the hot water is nice but sitting in a

180
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:03,900
bathtub I find to be a little hard on my back resting on a hard enamel surface

181
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:09,300
and after 10 minutes anyway the water's cooling off a little bit so

182
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:15,000
there's an image given in the sutus for the hindrance of sensual desire which is

183
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,099
dyed water like water that's been tied a certain colors so we don't see very

184
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:25,859
clearly through it I think it's in sort of an early version of rose-colored lenses

185
00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:31,140
so it's helpful to train our mind to discern when we're looking with

186
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:38,460
rose-colored lenses and not allow ourselves to think that things are going to be more satisfying than they are

187
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:44,820
now definitely sometimes people resist this idea of training the mind to understand that a given experience

188
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:51,540
cannot be ultimately satisfying but I see it as actually very supportive

189
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:58,020
in fact the very fact that we have a distorted perception that some experience is going to make us fully

190
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:05,339
happy it actually diminishes the enjoyment of it because it places kind of pressure on it in a sense and when we

191
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:12,960
actually understand that no experience can inherently make us happy it actually makes it much easier to enjoy things

192
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:19,440
fully and then to let them go as they're as they're passing so you know it's really just a

193
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:27,839
protection for the mind don't worry life is still as many good things but we're just not distorted about them

194
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:33,599
okay and then the third Main gloss let's say or non-discerning way of

195
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:38,880
seeing things is to mistake or does not solve for an abiding self

196
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:46,140
and in this case I haven't found very much value in in really thinking about this cognitively it's really much better

197
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:51,780
just to do as a practice um a great practice that can be done in

198
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:59,040
daily life as well as on the cushion is found in the instructions that the Buddha gave to Bahia and I think some of

199
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:07,500
you are likely familiar with them he said in the scene let there just be the scene in The Herd just the herd in

200
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:12,900
the sensed just the sensed and in the cognized just the cognized

201
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:20,880
so we practice seeing experience in kind of an unadorned way a simple way

202
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:28,859
you know for example the sound of a bell just ring a bell I guess I could do that

203
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:31,640
have one

204
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:45,320
easier okay listen to this

205
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:57,180
so it's a simple experience of sound just arising and passing

206
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:03,540
it doesn't have much to do with our self unless we add one on

207
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:09,060
but really it's just the sound coming and going so in cases like this

208
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:15,780
that are simple we get a glimpse of the way fruiting yourself onto something it

209
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:24,119
would be actually imputed onto experience by the mind if we were to say that's my sound that's a special Bell

210
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:29,280
just for me you know things like that it's obviously something extra and

211
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:36,660
that's not to problematize that we do that sometimes it's just to be accurate that you know putting yourself on is

212
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:42,900
something extra it's additional to their experience see for yourself it takes

213
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:49,740
careful mindfulness but you can see this for yourself in the words of Joseph Goldstein only

214
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:55,740
six things ever happen seeing hearing smelling tasting touching and mental

215
00:43:55,740 --> 00:44:03,780
activity so the Buddha concludes his teaching to Bahia by saying this just this is the

216
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:09,180
end of dukkha so we can see exp when we can see experience in a simple way then

217
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:15,780
there isn't suffering or stress so essentially when we train not to be

218
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:21,300
fooled into these non-discerning ways of seeing then we're much more likely to

219
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:26,579
make good decisions in the moment so non-discernment is to think that things

220
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:34,380
are in the words of Ruth Kane I love the way she puts this we think that things are permanent perfect and personal

221
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:40,859
and what we want to train in is to not be fooled by that

222
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:47,040
so if we see more wisely more discerningly then we

223
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:53,940
won't be foolishly trying to hold on to or control things that are bound to change we won't be setting ourselves up

224
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:59,880
for disappointment in duka by tying our happiness to things that change and are limited

225
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:06,420
and we won't be getting wrapped up and thinking that things are inherently personal inherently ourselves and all

226
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:13,980
the Duca that goes with that so this is kind of a culmination of all the

227
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:20,040
things that have we've been practicing up to now the confidence the Seal of

228
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:25,560
Ethics the learning of the teachings and listening carefully to our experience

229
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:33,119
and then being willing to let go whether in the form of actually giving something or the releases that happen along the

230
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:39,240
path you know then we come to have this Discerning view of understanding the

231
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:44,460
changing nature of things and how to live well in the world

232
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:49,619
and as a reminder the Buddha said that these five qualities are a form of inner

233
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:56,579
wealth their form of fortitude of character their Inspirations when we think of how

234
00:45:56,579 --> 00:46:01,800
they can be known in the world we feel happy and people who possess them and

235
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:08,700
have them well at hand are said to be spiritually mature one that I didn't say up to now is that

236
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:13,980
these are also said to help us at the time of death and when these are well

237
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:20,240
established in the heart they assure uneaseful death

238
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:25,859
so these serve us both on and off the cushion to meet life well in the moment

239
00:46:25,859 --> 00:46:32,280
and we can strengthen any and all of them through training which is very worthwhile to do

240
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:37,740
and all of them are made potent by mindfulness practice that's the the core

241
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:42,780
Foundation behind all of them so thank you for being here for this

242
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:48,000
week I very much hope that something in it landed for you and that it will

243
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,160
support you and all those around you to take it into your practice in life

244
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,119
be well
