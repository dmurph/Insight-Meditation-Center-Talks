1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,720
so hello and welcome to our meditation session

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,879
and I met in India many years ago

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,880
Indian Insight teacher vipassana teacher named munindra menendrachi

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:29,039
and one of his sayings that he was well known for is that he said if it's not simple it's

5
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,880
not to be possum so this idea of simplicity

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:41,460
is challenging because we have our challenges that are

7
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,860
we think are complicated that we can't figure out we're confused about or lost in or

8
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:53,039
so many different factors involved but if it's not simple it's not to be

9
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,460
passing on if it's not simple it's not love

10
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:07,860
if it's not simple we it's not going to be uh

11
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:14,520
let's leave it at that and um so what I'd like to offer this morning

12
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:23,520
is something very simple a little technique that is can be used in so many different

13
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:31,140
situations a little technique that it's going to be hard to say there is no time for it

14
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,020
unless there's something really pressing happening really at the moment

15
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:45,079
and it's a variation of What's called the three breath Journey

16
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:54,000
and uh so let's do it together and taking your meditation posture

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,560
and just very simple and they don't have to do anything really just close your eyes

18
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:10,500
and with your eyes closed take three simple ordinary breaths but

19
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:17,360
really be present for those breaths really feel the breathing in the body

20
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,140
okay so then

21
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:55,340
is there a difference between how you felt before the three breath journey and afterwards

22
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:02,160
sometimes in daily life just taking three breaths to stop and close your eyes

23
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:08,280
can interrupt the Mind stream can we can step off the trains of

24
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,680
thoughts that are spinning along and uh

25
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,900
always in danger of derailing but to step off the trains

26
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,060
and uh and take a moment to just let go

27
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:32,340
be present can relax things we can let go things can give us a different perspective it can take the edge off the

28
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,500
challenges we have The Edge that comes with our alarm our

29
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:44,459
tension that we carry with us and I don't know how well it worked in

30
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:51,239
the morning the first thing to do this but I'd recommend that in your daily life you try

31
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:58,860
and now I'd like to suggest a different variation of the three jet breath Journey

32
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,560
and I'll go through a little bit slowly and I don't know if my speed is going to match

33
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:12,060
how how quickly or are you speed in which you breathe but if I go too fast

34
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:19,859
then just remember and just you know just do it you follow afterwards afterwards if it's too slow

35
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:28,160
then maybe you can do do it over again or do two breaths in a row doing the same thing or something

36
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,360
so with the eyes closed

37
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,139
take a breath and feel the breathing

38
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,740
then take a breath and on the exhale soften in your body

39
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,000
and then take your breath and on the exhale ask the question

40
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,139
where is the love

41
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:11,300
so we can do it again it prefers just to feel the breath one breath

42
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:16,860
second soften in the body and third

43
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:23,400
where's the love and let's do this two or three more

44
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,479
times on your own

45
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:38,419
and the softening also means letting go of any criticism or resistance to doing this

46
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:09,120
and to do this without any expectations or measuring or

47
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:16,919
or judgments about how you are just an open allowing

48
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:24,380
exercise breathe

49
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:32,400
soften something within and ask where is the love

50
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:39,860
and just dropping that question in allow whatever happens to happen

51
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:08,819
so having introduced this to you now that kind of starting over again in

52
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:14,280
the meditation maybe taking a few long slow deep

53
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:21,419
breaths to re-familiarize yourself with your body and your

54
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:30,440
meditation posture long exhales to settle

55
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:28,680
letting the breathing return to normal and still take a few moments to relax

56
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,700
let go the body

57
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:42,320
and also to relax and soften the thinking mind

58
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:27,000
and then if you'd like to continue with the three breath

59
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,540
Journey

60
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:39,620
first breath is to breathe just breathe and be present for it

61
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,700
second breath is to breathe and soften relax something

62
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:53,240
and the third is to ask where is the love

63
00:09:54,060 --> 00:10:00,360
not expecting an answer but maybe just opens

64
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,060
a sense of curiosity presence

65
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:17,160
or maybe you discover that the love can be found in asking the question

66
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,640
the care the tenderness from which that comes that question

67
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,399
and you can do this through the whole sitting just to go through the three over and over again or

68
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:36,440
periodically as you wish or just sit here silently

69
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:30,899
you could simplify the third breath

70
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:38,100
do not have a question but just say the word love quietly to

71
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:45,260
yourself in your mind maybe saying

72
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:54,420
breathing for the first breath soft

73
00:15:54,420 --> 00:16:00,980
for the second love for the Third

74
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,399
saying the words is quietly

75
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,139
as the mind is capable

76
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:07,280
if you find yourself thinking a lot during the meditation

77
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:15,200
then the three breath Journey might be a better alternative

78
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,159
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

79
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:38,520
perhaps a three-breath journey three breaths

80
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:45,179
can be done in preparation for ending the sitting and being ready

81
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:52,799
to enter the world again one breath to breathe

82
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:59,700
one breath to soften and one breath for love

83
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,840
where is the love

84
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,440
and then taking some deep breaths

85
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,700
and on the exhales sending out into the world your good

86
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:38,400
will you're well wishing Your Love

87
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:44,360
may all beings be happy

88
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,059
may all beings be safe

89
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:56,220
may all beings be peaceful

90
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:02,179
and may all beings everywhere be free

91
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,579
[Music]

92
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:23,180
[Music]

93
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,419
thank you

94
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,940
so

95
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:40,140
hello and welcome to the last talk on

96
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:47,419
working it including love as part of the practice of being in with challenges

97
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:51,559
love in times of challenge

98
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:59,000
and um I think that it's fair to say that

99
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,380
when we have challenges almost definition of a challenge is that

100
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:10,919
it preoccupies us it concerns us it affects us in some sometimes Deep Way

101
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:17,220
and it's easy then to in that preoccupation to lose track of some of

102
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:22,620
the important values important the capacities we have

103
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:29,760
and one of them is love that sometimes some challenges we get

104
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:37,320
caught up in anger and blame and that can be a loop of

105
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:44,640
anger kind of triggers more anger blame triggers more reasons to blame

106
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,659
we could be caught up in fear and that also can be a loop where fear

107
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:58,020
evokes more fear fear gives rise to more fear thoughts that produces more fear

108
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:06,899
there could be um greed or ambition or there could be Pro

109
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:15,659
the problem-solving mind comes into mind and the problem-solving mind is so absorbed in itself that it leaves out a

110
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:21,600
lot of the background of who we are that actually is there to support us and help us find a way

111
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:28,340
find a solution and so uh

112
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:35,220
to take to pause long enough so that more of who we are more of our resources

113
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:40,500
and our capacities and can be present as

114
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:46,620
we're there with a challenge so we're not uh the attention and the concerns haven't

115
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:54,000
been narrowed or haven't been hijacked or haven't been caught in Loops that are not so helpful

116
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,899
so one of the classic techniques for the wise life is to pause

117
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:06,120
and I'm a mindful pause can make all the difference in the world

118
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:11,760
so we're not kind of on automatic pilot but do we pause long enough to see where

119
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:20,279
we have some choice and one of the simple choices we can have is to pause a little bit longer

120
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:28,320
and this technique of doing using three breaths to ground ourselves to interrupt

121
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,380
the Mind streams to remind ourselves of what's important

122
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:39,360
is a valuable thing to do and three breaths hopefully you almost

123
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:45,299
always have time for three breaths and if you don't feel like you have time

124
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:51,120
for it then really take a good look at the situation is

125
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,340
you know the truck barreling down at you is the mountain lion

126
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:01,500
growling is uh so really some threat and danger that's immediate

127
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:07,500
or is it uh Nah if it not then question whether you can't just pause for three

128
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:14,638
breaths and one way of supporting that maybe is that to realize that love

129
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:21,540
does take time if love is important for you it takes time for it to make time

130
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:29,700
for it and make room for it and even if it's not readily available

131
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:36,720
pause and maybe recognize that and pause and recognize is not present

132
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:44,220
but find out is it how important is it for you is it important enough for you that you

133
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:49,858
wish it was there to wishing love was there is in fact the

134
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:56,520
beginning of love provided the wish is soft is without the

135
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:02,280
expectation without demands without comparisons and judgments just a very

136
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:07,920
simple wish so if you can take the time to pause for

137
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:14,579
three breaths three breath Journey and the simplest version of the three

138
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:21,119
breath journey is just simply stop and take three breaths mindfully presently

139
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,579
and sometimes in a busy life running around doing many things that's where

140
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:33,839
that's so powerful to take the three breath Journey maybe you drive someplace and then maybe

141
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:40,320
you're even late a little bit or you're a little bit tense around it before you get out of your car after it's parked

142
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:46,619
sit there quietly and take the three breath Journey and this busyness they're racing of the

143
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:52,380
Mind might be then quieted you might be reconnected to yourself just three

144
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:59,280
breaths sometimes can in a busy life can just kind of reset things maybe not dramatically but enough to make a

145
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:06,420
difference if you're standing in a line in a store a three-breath journey

146
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:12,540
if you turn on your computer to look at something

147
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:19,079
um before you look before you open the monitor take a three breath Journey so

148
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:25,220
that the the momentum of stress the momentum of tension or desires of doing

149
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:30,900
doesn't have the upper hand when you sit down to look at the computer so you

150
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:38,838
ground yourself in something else besides the momentum of the mind that's maybe been busy all day long

151
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:44,520
so um so then

152
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:51,180
another variation of the three breath journey is to to have the first first

153
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:57,660
breath just be a grounding in the breathing the second one is to use the breath

154
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:04,160
maybe the exhale to relax and soften and the third breath to ask the question

155
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:10,619
where is the love where is love or just say love

156
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:15,660
and sometimes in these three best Journeys it can be helpful if their breaths are a little bit deeper than

157
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:22,440
usual longer than usual and maybe it's a little bit hard to keep that up you might come out of breath but

158
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:28,380
for three breaths maybe you can do that so the longer breath maybe is grounding and connecting

159
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:34,079
but to ask the question where is the love and see what arises

160
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:39,680
it might that might be enough to reconnect you to it it might be uh

161
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:45,480
enough for you to realize that you think something is more important than love

162
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:50,579
right now and if that's the case it's good to really know that see that in yourself

163
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:56,880
wow am I pissed off at someone and yes certainly that's more important than

164
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,940
love and if I give in to love now or take the time to love during one breath

165
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:09,359
then I don't know it's uh I'm not following

166
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:15,420
my responsibility the need the requirements of the situation to

167
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:22,260
be angry to pause and see that's what the mind is

168
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:27,780
thinking and how it is might give pause give occasion to pause even more really

169
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:34,920
is that true is that really how I want to live my life um where is the love

170
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:42,119
can I be angry and have love at the same time maybe we can but maybe then the anger

171
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:49,619
takes it changes its nature to a very different form maybe it takes the hostility out of the

172
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:55,500
anger maybe there's still fear when there's love

173
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:02,160
but with love fear doesn't take the center stage it's not the only game in

174
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:10,320
town maybe what the love needs is love what the fear needs is some love

175
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:17,760
and that's often a good principle that when there's fear there's a need for love unless it's you know an imminent

176
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:25,079
threat um with the you know if there's not an imminent threat probably a chronic

177
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:32,820
anxiety underlying fear that's going on for some time uh maybe has more to do with reassuring

178
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:38,820
the heart in some deep way and uh and reassuring The Fear With Love

179
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:46,579
With Care with kindness with um acceptance with generosity

180
00:39:47,339 --> 00:39:52,380
so exactly what happens when you ask the question where is the love

181
00:39:52,380 --> 00:40:01,619
will depend on the circumstance depend on you at different times but it's a a powerful question to ask

182
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:07,200
and to keep it in the Forefront where's the love here where's the love in this

183
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:13,700
challenge oh I forgot that I care about this person

184
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:20,579
and or oh I forgot that there's love here for

185
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:26,339
myself that I'm so lost in the challenge that I'm not caring for myself

186
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:32,240
I'm actually harming myself with attention that I'm that I have

187
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:37,680
so taking time to pause the three breath

188
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,720
Journey It's a Wonderful technique it's

189
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:48,000
something that can be applied in daily life in many circumstances no one needs

190
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,180
to know you're doing it um it could be done in the bathroom when no one's around

191
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:59,579
it can be done as I said the cars when you park your car before you start your

192
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:06,720
car or when you're on your device and and in many circumstances and it allows

193
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:13,920
us to reconnect to some deeper value some deeper sense of of of being alive

194
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:21,240
which might change the orientation or the perspective for how you want to continue

195
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:28,800
because it's all too easy to be caught up in a perspective caught up in concerns which are not so healthy caught

196
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,520
up in self-preoccupation cut up and giving our beliefs

197
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:41,640
too much Authority and and so to have a way to cut through

198
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:49,800
that we have a way to interrupt that have a way to question that to reconnect to something deeper

199
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:57,420
and something as simple as the three breath Journey might do that and it might do it sometimes better than

200
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:03,359
simply pausing to be mindful of the situation that can still come that can come after

201
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:09,359
the three breath journey to really tune in but then the quality of the

202
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:15,900
mindfulness quality the attention might be a little bit different or softer or caring

203
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:21,380
um if you've gone through the three breath Journey first

204
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:26,700
where is the love where is the care where is the kindness

205
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:32,880
where's the friendliness where is the generosity where's their

206
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:40,700
respect where's the reverence where is

207
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:52,520
valuing yourself valuing your own well-being

208
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:57,960
valuing yourself respecting yourself caring for yourself

209
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:05,880
so that you don't perpetuate unnecessary stress tension hostility

210
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:11,579
criticism anxiety that

211
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:18,960
kind of enter into kind of automatic pilot that we're just kind of living that way and not questioning it not

212
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:25,079
dropping down not offering love to ourselves

213
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:30,180
in all the challenges that we Face life is challenging

214
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:39,359
sooner or later it's challenging for everyone it doesn't mean we can't stop briefly

215
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:47,000
to love and appreciate and respect ourselves

216
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:53,579
so thank you and um I hope that this week on

217
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:59,280
bringing love to bear or to inform how we go through challenges

218
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:06,119
is useful for you and um I appreciated the chance to talk about

219
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:11,640
it so um

220
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:16,859
