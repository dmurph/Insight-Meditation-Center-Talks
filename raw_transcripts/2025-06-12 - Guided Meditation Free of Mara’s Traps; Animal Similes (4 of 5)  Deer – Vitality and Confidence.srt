1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:09,360
okay so let's go ahead and get started with our

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,440
theme and meditation for today

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,920
and I think we'll just jump right in so let's go ahead and start meditating together

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:29,400
finding a posture that has some ease in it

5
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:39,960
allowing the body to settle in to sitting or perhaps you're lying down

6
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:50,640
gently closing the eyes if that's comfortable for you

7
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:59,640
it's encouraged and bringing the attention inward

8
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,560
sensing the contact points

9
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:25,159
the chair or the cushion that you're sitting on or the bed

10
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,000
your legs or feet against the floor

11
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:46,280
just allowing yourself to be supported by what you're sitting on

12
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,040
and bringing gentle attention

13
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:14,360
to softening the body into meditation

14
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,959
softening the eyes in the eye sockets

15
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,879
softening the jaw

16
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,920
allowing the shoulders to relax

17
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,000
maybe drop a bit

18
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:16,519
softening down through the chest and the belly area

19
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,799
releasing tension in the arms and legs

20
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,120
and sensing if the body feels aligned

21
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,920
balanced

22
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:10,120
i have found this sense of alignment or balance to be dynamic

23
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:18,280
so it's not that I can set it at the beginning and then it's there

24
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,639
more that I attune to it and find it to be helpful to keep adjusting toward

25
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,880
balance

26
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,120
and then bringing in the quality of mindfulness

27
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,080
consciously attuning to clearly knowing what's happening in

28
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,120
experience in a simple gentle way

29
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,120
and as we've been doing throughout the week

30
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,080
I encourage choosing some kind of an anchor for

31
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:53,039
awareness for mindfulness a common one is the breath the

32
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,880
sensations of breathing in and out

33
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,840
or more general sensations in the body

34
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:29,520
or sometimes what feels most natural is to just connect to the sounds in the

35
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:36,720
environment people can find a lot of ease in the way

36
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,160
the sounds just come and go

37
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,720
we're not controlling them

38
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:18,880
and the idea of the anchor is simply to have a home base for the mind

39
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:26,319
it doesn't exclude other experiences i sometimes see it as foreground and

40
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:33,199
background so maybe putting the breath in the

41
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:39,440
foreground and then other things come and go

42
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,919
thoughts or sounds

43
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,960
more peripherally or background

44
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,039
and inevitably the mind will

45
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:50,880
sometimes catch on to one of these other experiences and then we find ourselves

46
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:59,560
thinking or distracted did oring out in some way

47
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:09,959
and the invitation for today

48
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:17,680
is to see the return to mindfulness as an opening of freedom in a certain

49
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,760
way once we know

50
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,040
that the mind is being say tempted by

51
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:37,080
something that it wants or something it would like to push away

52
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:44,640
if we see that just stepping back enough to see it is a

53
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,120
little bit of freedom

54
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,240
and there's a wonderful phrase that people use sometimes

55
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:04,160
noticing forces that would take the mind out of

56
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:13,080
balance you can say I see you Mara

57
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,760
mara representing the forces of destruction

58
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,880
and then simply returning

59
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:41,320
to the anchor in the foreground and resting with experience

60
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:06,519
seeing Seeing the flow of the mind

61
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:13,880
and seeing the forces that distract

62
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:21,240
as somehow not really us

63
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,120
like winds that blow through

64
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,240
or Eddie is in a stream

65
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:47,360
and when we don't believe them or buy into them then the mind remains free

66
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,360
simple

67
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,760
and as we practice with

68
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,559
seeing the flow of the mind and its distractions

69
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,880
We begin to gain a sense of confidence

70
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,960
ah it is possible

71
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:07,919
it is possible to see just before the mind slips away

72
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:19,000
maybe there's a little wavering or a little flutter of energy

73
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:29,160
and there can be a moment where we see that and the mind doesn't go off

74
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:40,559
maybe it goes off again the next time but having seen that

75
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,600
there's increasing confidence

76
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:54,600
in the mindfulness in strengthening awareness

77
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,919
just seeing in this gentle clear way

78
00:26:52,480 --> 00:27:00,120
and as we come toward the end of this sitting

79
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:09,039
sensing that just as in sitting We started to realize

80
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:13,639
ah many things can be seen

81
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:23,760
carrying this out into the world we can also bring a sense of confidence

82
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:31,480
that it's possible to notice the state of our mind

83
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,520
to be able to see things reactions perhaps

84
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,360
before we say something

85
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:51,760
and understanding that this way of seeing clearly and with a caring

86
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:58,520
attitude will protect others as well as ourselves

87
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,320
and sometimes it helps to have a deliberate sense of yes

88
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:12,159
I know this can work not every time

89
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:20,960
mindfulness goes up and down but yes this is a way that continues to

90
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:28,759
support me and others and as I practice it it becomes stronger

91
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,559
potentially it's always possible to see the mind

92
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:42,880
and to realize how wonderful how wonderful that possibility

93
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,880
of bringing our care to the world in whatever it is that we're doing

94
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:55,919
in support of ourselves and others may our mindfulness

95
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:03,480
and our practice be of support to those around us

96
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:13,398
may all beings partake of the goodness of this path

97
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:19,400
[Music]

98
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:32,179
[Music]

99
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:45,290
[Music]

100
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:15,520
okay so our our dharma path of insight continues today

101
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:21,760
uh through practice the mind is learning to see rather than

102
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:28,799
fall into things like greed hatred and delusion that come up in the mind

103
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:35,520
and we start to understand through the journey of insight that these issues are

104
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:41,440
not really us you know we're not a greedy person inherently

105
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:48,399
it's just that wanting and grasping can arise in the mind due to certain conditions

106
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:55,600
and as our view becomes clearer and more accurate we can gain some confidence in this

107
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:02,720
skill of seeing clearly so we're using the animal similes this

108
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:12,640
week as a way to understand the path and today we turn to the deer

109
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:19,600
in sutas deer generally have a positive connotation

110
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:26,000
so we talked about the cow yesterday and notice that deer and cows are

111
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,600
similar in the sense that both of them are herd animals

112
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:40,159
but cows are domesticated and handled by humans whereas deer are wild so they're

113
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:46,159
inherently freer more independent-minded maybe they have to be somewhat smarter

114
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:51,200
and tougher than cows by virtue of living in the wild

115
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:59,600
and so in the Buddhist texts the deer is a symbol of not being tied down they

116
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:07,200
have some measure of strength and independence and yet at the same time deer can still

117
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,600
be led astray or trapped or hunted so they're still in some ways vulnerable

118
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:21,760
and need some protection but overall these qualities add up to deer tending

119
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:28,880
to represent a person who is on the path so someone who is making their way to

120
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:36,159
freedom so there's a text called the napa suta

121
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:43,039
which means the bait that contrasts different herds of deer in how they

122
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:50,960
relate to a trapper's traps and starts out by noting that the deer

123
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:57,760
trapper has bad intentions for the deer right deer trappers laying down traps

124
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:05,120
and this is likened to the way Mara goes to distract or take over a meditator's

125
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:11,440
mind or person's mind and

126
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:18,960
deer trappers uh lay down this bait with the hope that the deer will unwittingly

127
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:25,440
eat the bait and become intoxicated and then be at the trapper's mercy and then

128
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:31,919
in the same way Mara in the form of our own habits can trick us into becoming

129
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:37,200
unmindful and then we become vulnerable remember at the beginning of the week we

130
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:44,559
talked about how the quail and the monkey stray out of their ancestral domain of mindfulness and that's when

131
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:51,919
they can be harmed or trapped or attacked so when we believe the stories that our

132
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:57,840
mind tells us or when we identify strongly with things that come up like

133
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:04,480
anger or envy then we could say that we are intoxicated like the deer we've

134
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,760
taken the bait and then we're likely to do things that bring harm and in

135
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:15,200
Buddhist understanding we would say then Mara can do with us as he will

136
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:22,240
so that's kind of the framework for understanding these uh herds of deer

137
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:30,720
that are described in this suta so it's said that the first deer uh goes

138
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:36,800
right in among the bait and gets trapped so they don't pay any attention and this

139
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:43,440
is like somebody who lives without is always falling into great hatred and

140
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:50,158
delusion always suffering the consequences of those kinds of mind states in their life

141
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,760
and then the second herd of deer sees what happened with the first herd so

142
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:02,320
they're they're learning by watching the others and this second herd decides to

143
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:08,720
ignore the bait uh shun the bait they just try to avoid it but then it happens

144
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:14,480
that uh near the it says near the end of the hot season so dear this is a time

145
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:20,880
when there isn't much water available they lose their resolve and they eat the

146
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,320
paint anyway so they also get trapped and so this is a little bit like trying

147
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:33,359
to avoid hindrances or difficulties by bypassing or ignoring them you know

148
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:40,480
we close our eyes or we plug our ears and say la we don't associate with any irritating

149
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,960
people we just try to restrict our life so that we don't have things that bring

150
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:53,520
up the challenge you know or hindrances in some way that kind of works but it's

151
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,800
artificial we're trying to control the outside to prevent uh in order not to

152
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,000
have those things come up in us and eventually that will break down so

153
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,000
that's not actually the path to freedom is just avoiding things that um we find

154
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,480
difficult in some way so then the third bird of deer is trying

155
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:23,040
to learn both of the other ones so they don't want to do those things and they decide to be clever and they do live

156
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:32,320
within the range of the trapper but they're very cautious about what they eat and they hide at night so um they

157
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:38,320
but the trapper is able to add extra surveillance and see where they are

158
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:44,720
hiding the trapper notices that they're being very careful about what they eat and don't eat even though they're right

159
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:51,280
there among the bait so the trapper adjusts and adds in extra

160
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,960
surveillance this is a way in which Mara is actually adaptable you know when we

161
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,320
try to avoid Mara in some way Mara might change his tactics too the mind is

162
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:08,000
subtle and clever he finds ways to be distracted even when we think we've

163
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,720
solved one issue way and so the trapper is still able to

164
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:21,480
this third herd of deer into eating the bait anyway

165
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:31,040
so the Buddha likens people like this to like this to want to adopt certain views

166
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:36,400
so they live their life seemingly peacefully because they're adhering to

167
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:43,200
some kind of a fixed view but they're not really responding authentically they're living more in an idealized

168
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:51,119
world in some way so this is a little bit more subtle kind of way of being caught to avoid seeing comments about

169
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:58,160
the um sound issues i'll check into that

170
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:06,160
hang in there please and then the um the fourth bird also

171
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:11,200
and so they make their home outside the range of

172
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:20,000
in this case the described as Jas or samadei practice in

173
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,320
the person so when the mind is deeply in the present moment and practicing

174
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:32,240
meditation like concentration hindrances cannot take hold in the mind and it's

175
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:38,560
said that mara is temporarily blindfolded when the mind is practicing

176
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:43,640
especially so

177
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,119
at the beginning of this Here

178
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,839
we become free of free of creatorally

179
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:04,640
we can use that samade insight and suta then goes on to say that if somebody is

180
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,920
used for insight completely can become free

181
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:16,560
so here are smart first of all they can learn by watching others and smart

182
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:22,160
meditators can outsmart mara in certain ways and the you know translating to a

183
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,680
dharma lesson it's through the training of our mind and especially by practicing

184
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:34,079
samati and even janna that uh this is all part of the path of the

185
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:40,000
forces of harm in our mind and hence in the world isn't really a way that we can

186
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,160
just fiddle with things externally and become completely free doesn't work that

187
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:52,400
way we have to train through the inside particularly through these um deep

188
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:58,160
mental trainings of orienting the mind around a concentration object in some

189
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:05,680
way so this is a an extended analogy let's say

190
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:12,560
for the path where we do what we can externally to try to avoid the bait of mara but all of that is for the purpose

191
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:18,640
of getting the mind into a concentrated state from which we can do insight

192
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:26,000
practice and really see down to the roots of suffering now the deer analogy goes on into many

193
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,200
other sutas they talk about how deer live confidently because of this

194
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:37,040
adaptability and intelligence so for example in the one of the sutas where

195
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:42,079
the Buddha talks about his own awakening he gives an analogy to a deer and he

196
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:49,280
says suppose a forest deer is wandering in the forest wilds he walks confidently

197
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:56,000
stands confidently sits confidently and lies down confidently why is that

198
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:02,640
because he is out of the hunter's range so there's something about the deer you

199
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:07,680
know when practice becomes clear in us and we're understanding what we're doing

200
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:14,720
we're not free yet completely but we kind of know how to walk the path there's a confidence that comes with

201
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:20,319
confidence that comes from our own stability inside

202
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:25,440
and this is where the gentle you know ongoing practice of the cow that we

203
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,800
talked about yesterday trusting in the instructions just continuing to follow

204
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:36,800
them it bears fruit into the deer of the confidence of yeah this really does work

205
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:43,280
i'm not free yet but I I can see the path and there's a lovely story of a monk

206
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:50,079
named who was a former king so he used to live a royal life with a lot of guards

207
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:55,359
protecting him but he became much happier when he gave all that up and

208
00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:01,599
became a monk lived openly in the forest and it says uh he has a quote that he

209
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:08,400
says formerly was a lay person in the land my guard was well organized within

210
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:15,520
and without the royal compound within and without the city and within and without the country although I was

211
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:20,960
guarded and defended in this way I remained fearful scared suspicious and

212
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:27,280
nervous these days even when alone in the wilderness at the foot of a tree or in

213
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,720
an empty dwelling I am not fearful scared suspicious or nervous i live

214
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:40,319
relaxed unwled surviving on alms my heart free as a wild deer

215
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:47,720
so in this you know we have this you can do what you can externally to protect yourself

216
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:53,839
of meditative development of developing the mind in some way is what really

217
00:42:53,839 --> 00:43:02,480
frees the heart wild deer we start to see the deer in us maybe the

218
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:08,000
the essence of the deer in us as we practice longer as we have more insights

219
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,520
we start to see clearly and start to understand something about how

220
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:19,040
suffering comes about how the mind gets drawn into it and how it gets free of it

221
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:27,680
and it all starts to feel like a process we don't yet but we see the path so is

222
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:33,040
about healthy humility in a certain way tear is about healthy dignity and

223
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:38,800
confidence going as far as overconfidence or conceit dear can still

224
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:44,079
be trapped they can still take the pain they can still be hunted but starting to

225
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:50,920
trust in our heart of sense of confidence and dignity

226
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,880
by vitality and confidence in a certain way

227
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:04,839
may we discover the dear within us as we continue to walk the path of its states

228
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:13,160
tomorrow thank you so much for hanging in there
