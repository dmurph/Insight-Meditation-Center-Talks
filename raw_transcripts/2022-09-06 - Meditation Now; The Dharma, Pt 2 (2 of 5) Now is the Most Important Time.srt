1
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:10,460
so good morning again

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,440
and a good day

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,720
and today I will continue with the mostly sitting meditation and not going

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:29,119
to do any guided meditation with the idea that it's valuable to

5
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,280
to just sit with oneself as we are

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,280
guided meditations can kind of change the context of sitting and

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:49,520
which is often valuable but it's also valuable to spend some time just sitting quietly without any input

8
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:56,579
but I would like to read um quote a couple of things from the Buddha

9
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:02,660
that pertain to what the topic is for today and

10
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:05,780
for the Dharma talk

11
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:14,540
someone comes to the Buddha the man named udaya and

12
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:20,880
kind of a refers to how somehow refers to the idea of

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,159
remembering past lives and knowing future lives or something like

14
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,860
that and that other teachers somehow this relates to other teachers in India at

15
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:38,179
that time and the Buddha responds to him this way

16
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,560
let the past be

17
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:49,320
let let be the past let be the future

18
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,680
I shall teach you the dhamma this is an important

19
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,759
very important Federal phrase you know put aside concerns about the past about the future if you want the dhamma the

20
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,920
Dharma here listen to this

21
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:16,080
when this exists that comes to be with the arising of this that arises

22
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,200
when this does not exist it does not come to be with the cessation of this

23
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,720
that sees us this is considered to be the teaching of the pendant arising

24
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:34,019
and rather than explaining it the important point of this is that um

25
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:39,360
in the present now put aside the past and the future

26
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,480
sit you see the Dharma if you see

27
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:52,019
the river of time the flow of change Here and Now how one thing leads to

28
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:58,379
another one thing sets the stage for something else to occur one way or the other things are arising

29
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:03,959
and they're passing they appear and they disappear and some of that is that the thing

30
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:10,640
itself a sound comes and goes and some of it has to do with how we experience something

31
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,800
so if I'm holding this book and I was just holding it the book

32
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,819
doesn't disappear just like that but my awareness my attention to the book shifts and changes as it goes to my

33
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:29,640
words that I'm speaking to holding the book to thinking about you know other things

34
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:35,640
here in the room and and uh all kinds of things that can happen

35
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:41,580
and so this idea of staying in the place of arising and passing coming and going

36
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:48,599
here now now a fascinating teaching the Buddha gave

37
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:54,620
is he said um um

38
00:03:54,659 --> 00:04:01,739
it's basically to have uh he said you know to avoid the idea didn't say it doesn't it's not true but

39
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:08,879
it's just to avoid the idea that things exist and that things do not exist

40
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:17,040
for someone who sees that that things appear they can't say that things don't exist

41
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:24,600
for those who see that things disappear cannot say that they exist

42
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:31,740
if you live in this world of the alternative to positing existence and non-existence is again this world that

43
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:38,160
we live in the world of experience the world of how we perceive this world

44
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,360
comes and goes so now

45
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:52,020
so one of the things you might do in this sitting is very gently lovingly to yourself as

46
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,720
you may be at the every exhale or every inhale whichever you like

47
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:05,599
say the word now but say it word now

48
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:15,360
so that it becomes a time for to know now know now

49
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,360
this that comes and goes now

50
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,419
so with that we'll sit quietly thank you

51
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:38,240
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

52
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:47,220
I'd like to evoke the wisdom of three questions and

53
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:54,259
answers that one form or the other repeated many wisdom traditions

54
00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:02,960
and the first question is when is the most important time

55
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,900
and the answer is now

56
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,600
who is the most important person

57
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:22,140
whoever is present so if you're with someone else might be

58
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:26,840
them if you're alone it's yourself

59
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:34,940
and what's the most important thing

60
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,520
to not obstruct obstruct

61
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,320
the openness of your heart

62
00:27:52,919 --> 00:28:01,580
to keep your heart open and not have it dim or obscured

63
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,899
by thoughts stories opinions

64
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:14,419
and so we come to the end of the sitting

65
00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:27,720
and the important time is now the most important person is

66
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:34,039
each of us individually and as a as a collective

67
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:43,740
and the important thing is to keep the heart open and may it be that as we move out into

68
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:50,059
the world and end this meditation that the meditation

69
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:55,980
reminds us reinforces for us the possibility

70
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:01,940
of keeping and staying with an open heart a loving heart

71
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:09,539
that's ready to Delight in others

72
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:16,398
to love others to care for others

73
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:25,760
and may it be that as we go forth Miss meditation they can we carry with us

74
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:30,980
an attitude expressed in these words

75
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:37,679
may all beings be happy

76
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:43,278
may all beings be safe

77
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:52,580
may all beings be peaceful may all beings be free

78
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:07,020
[Music] foreign

79
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,299
thank you

80
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:15,899
so this week we're reviewing again or going

81
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:21,019
through again these five qualities of the Dharma

82
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:28,500
it's in part the teachings of the Buddha the this famous saying that we're kind

83
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:35,159
of relying on is the Dharma is well spoken by the Buddha

84
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:42,960
so something well spoken beneficial helpful and the Dharma as a teaching points to

85
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:50,640
something here and now and the the teaching and what we awaken

86
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:57,419
to are inseparable what we enter into in this practice is in separate inseparable

87
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:03,179
and uh kind of a simplistic way of saying these five qualities

88
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:10,799
is the first is about the Dharma is here unequivocally here

89
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:16,340
it isn't and today the second one eight is now

90
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:22,700
the third one is that it's Dharma instructs us to look

91
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:28,100
the fourth one is flow along

92
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:35,519
and the third one is the fifth one is feel

93
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,919
the flowing along feel the freedom know the freedom and this

94
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:49,380
being of blowing along with here and now in the presence so here now look

95
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:54,840
flow flow along feel freedom

96
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:01,440
so today is now a Kaliko and it's a

97
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,380
what's immediate what's present for us in this present moment

98
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:14,039
forever long it lasts for us than now that we can live in

99
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:19,860
and uh one of the ways to appreciate the value

100
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:27,120
of it is how easy it is to lose touch with it and meditation is one of the place one

101
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:32,220
of the benefits and one of the things to celebrate about meditation is how it

102
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:39,179
shows us how we don't meditate very well rather than seeing our ability to not be

103
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:46,679
present as a problem for meditation meditation is to highlight for us how

104
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:53,940
the mind works and we get to see how much the Mind departs the present moment

105
00:33:53,940 --> 00:34:01,200
one of the ways to do it to see is what you know the thinking mind so for example there's a retrospective

106
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,200
thinking it's hard to think about the past there's

107
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:13,079
um anticipatory thinking thinking about the future

108
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:18,240
and you can feel ourselves leaning into those or being Ling I like think of them

109
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:25,020
as we're lingering in our thoughts and as we linger in these thoughts there's a way in which we no longer

110
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:30,179
linger in the present we no longer present for now

111
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:36,658
as it unfolds as it's present and so something as simple as being with your breathing breathing in and

112
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:43,020
breathing out breathing is always in the present and then you can find yourself thinking about something and no longer in touch

113
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:48,179
with the breathing or hardly in touch with it and you can actually feel the quality of

114
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:54,000
losing Touch of lingering in those thoughts and those thoughts might feel rich and

115
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:02,040
valuable and important and substantial but they aren't they are ephemeral impermanent changing

116
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:09,480
fickle and it's possible to be so centered in the present together with our thought thinking that

117
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:15,720
we don't linger in them they just feel like loose and light and soft and kind

118
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:24,540
of coterminous with space just thoughts of floating through now

119
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:31,680
here and now we're now tricked into them we know them as present moment things

120
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,780
and one of the really wonderful aspects of meditation is well mindfulness meditation

121
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:42,300
is when there's a really a clear grounding clear sense

122
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:48,599
that when I'm thinking about the past the thinking is happening in the present

123
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:54,900
when I'm thinking about the future the thinking is a present moment phenomenon

124
00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:00,540
when I'm involved in fantasy the fantasy is a present moment phenomena

125
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:06,420
so the repetition of the word now in meditation just now

126
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:15,240
or the sense of now here now not to dismiss or deny anything but to

127
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:20,280
wake up to oh this is what the present moment experience is

128
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:26,339
we don't have to be at war with our thoughts we don't have to be of the war we're thinking about the past and the future

129
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:31,680
but at least in meditation to discover how

130
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:38,400
uh much that's thinking about thinking takes us away from the flow the

131
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,940
connection to Here and Now and so and then and then learning to

132
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:50,220
wake up to oh this is this is the flavor of now

133
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:58,020
there's this thinking and the thinking in seeing it this way is now we're not tricked into the living

134
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:03,359
in the past living in the future in our thoughts we just see oh I'm thinking about it

135
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:10,859
and maybe we begin to feeling the insubstantial nature of thoughts the lightness of thoughts

136
00:37:10,859 --> 00:37:17,960
um thoughts can feel very heavy and they can feel very light but they're not heavy by themselves

137
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:23,280
they're heavy by our involvement with them are lingering in them are are

138
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:29,280
leaning into them by themselves

139
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:37,260
thoughts are very light thoughts are coterminous with space

140
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:43,560
they have as much substance as the sky

141
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:50,900
-like thinking so to come here and be now

142
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:58,500
and Here and Now this is where then we can start loan

143
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:03,720
recognizing how we obscure or dim or narrow

144
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:10,440
the open system sensitivity of our love of our Delight our appreciation

145
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:15,560
our friendliness our love our care

146
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:25,640
and um we have such potential

147
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:34,619
now for the beautiful qualities to come out and as I said last night in a talk

148
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:42,000
we have we get caught up in so many different things in our life that seems so important

149
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,740
and we lose touch so easily with what is most important

150
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:56,420
to be present here for this life with a full attention

151
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:01,980
it might not seem important it might seem dull and boring from the point of view of the mind

152
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:09,480
that's spinning and chasing and wanting things and not wanting things and protecting the self it might seem that

153
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:17,420
way that just being present is not much of Interest but to do the thought experiment

154
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:22,980
that if you know that you have only one hour to live

155
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:30,540
you're dying and maybe you'll be fortunate to die consciously and without any pain

156
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:35,940
but clearly you know you're dying there's no this is this is the time

157
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:41,520
and at during that time would you suddenly realize how important

158
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:47,400
it is to go back to your 2009 tax returns because you think you pay too

159
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:52,440
much and you need to fill out paperwork in order to get

160
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:58,380
350 dollars back that uh you're you know is yours after all

161
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:05,280
the last hour of your life you probably won't that's not what's the most important thing

162
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,380
the last hour of your life probably not the most important thing is to start

163
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:16,619
planning vacations planning for the future in some way and anticipating things

164
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:20,720
you realize it's not happening it's no point

165
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,980
to uh would that last hour what's important

166
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:34,319
and I would like to propose that to really find the wealth of life that

167
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:41,339
the potential beauty of life to at that time to really know how to be

168
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:48,060
present to be here and now the there's a way in which that hour becomes

169
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:54,180
Timeless that hour is not part of time the idea that an hour away you will be

170
00:40:54,180 --> 00:41:00,300
dead doesn't have to have any relevance in the fullness

171
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:07,140
of just now this moment where love can flow or Delight where

172
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:13,800
Freedom can be where the heart is not dimmed where the heart is not obscured

173
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:21,660
where these thoughts that are heavy don't get in the way don't interfere

174
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:27,599
but we're simply looking out the window and seeing the leaves and the trees blow

175
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:33,960
and blow in the Wind can seem like looking at Paradise the

176
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:40,500
jewels not because it is you've seen it many times before but the quality of now when

177
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:45,599
presence is so rich and so unobscured and so

178
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:50,940
unencumbered by the things that dim it that

179
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:54,680
keep it from seeing the sparkle

180
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:01,578
so um now

181
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:07,039
a Kaliko immediate here

182
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:13,220
to be seen in this life to be seen here

183
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:20,040
to be seen now this is the Dharma of the Buddha

184
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:26,760
and so I'd like to recommend that um for this day that you carry with you

185
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,460
the English word now

186
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:39,900
and um and um and if you want to do some little I like

187
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:45,540
to play word games letter games um and if the you take the first two

188
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:55,319
words of now no and think of the W as being the first letter of a another word

189
00:42:55,319 --> 00:43:01,140
it's so now it's then for no waiting

190
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:05,960
no waiting just now

191
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:10,579
and um no wishing

192
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,400
just now now so to carry that with you

193
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:23,940
and not that you're able to stay in the now but as I said at the beginning of this

194
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:31,200
little talk made it this mindfulness meditation is not so much about being successful and

195
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:38,040
being mindful and the way we might think of being now but in saying now

196
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:45,300
seeing more clearly what you are doing now we're so much an automatic pilot so much

197
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:51,780
Carried Away by our thoughts and involved in things we don't really see in some higher quality way what is what

198
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:59,119
we're actually doing now so this word now

199
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:05,160
show up for yourself see what's happening here don't be an automatic pilot

200
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:10,940
and when you're now what is the most important thing

201
00:44:11,339 --> 00:44:17,359
what would be the most important thing if you had only one more hour to live

202
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:26,400
and I hope you can do this exercise for many hours so thank you very much and um

203
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:33,180
I want to make one announcement and I'll make it again but I wanted to

204
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:41,420
make sure that you a number of you can hear it if in case you don't come you're not here when I announce it again

205
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:47,880
um so for the next three weeks after this week starting on Sunday I will be

206
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:58,260
on Retreat teaching every three week retreat and so I won't be able to do these seven AMS the last week that uh I'm away uh

207
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:04,440
Matthew Brent silver will come back and teach uh I wasn't able to find someone for the

208
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:11,400
next two weeks the people are on Retreat doing doing all kinds of things that I normally would invite

209
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:18,300
and um so what we're going to do is to replay

210
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:26,040
the uh two weeks of these sittings and Dharma talks that I did in December of

211
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:32,579
2020. a week on loving kindness in a week on compassion and I think these are quite important

212
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:38,579
topics and so I think that the topics are still fresh even though the talks

213
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:45,060
are almost two years old and so that's the plan and so you want uh some of you

214
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:51,180
might not even notice that I'm not here because I think it'll be played in a way

215
00:45:51,180 --> 00:46:01,160
that looks like it's fresh though you'll see that I'm younger maybe in maybe longer hair or something so um

216
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,799
so thank you and I look forward to tomorrow
