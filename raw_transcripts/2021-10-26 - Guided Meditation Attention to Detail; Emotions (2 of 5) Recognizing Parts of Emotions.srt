1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:09,919
hello everyone and uh thank you for being here

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:16,240
and as we begin this meditation

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,520
i would like to mention that one

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:28,160
i think useful slogan for insight meditation

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:35,520
is attention to detail sometimes if we

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,760
take in our lives in generalities it's hard to understand where we are

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:49,520
attached or where we could benefit from what's happening but as we begin distinguishing

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,039
some of the details of what's happening we can see and recognize what is useful

9
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:01,280
and and beneficial to rest their attention in

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,920
and what it's uh most useful to not avoid like not have it

11
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:15,600
but avoid giving it a ten a lot of attention avoid giving it our interest

12
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:23,200
interest can be a little bit like food for some of the ways in which we are

13
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,200
and so if that food is a precious commodity you want to be careful what you give it

14
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,000
to and so attention to detail

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,560
and so sometimes we'll say that you know we say we feel a certain way i

16
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,799
feel great i feel lousy that might be definitely the case

17
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:55,840
but it's a very general the details are missing and what are the details of feeling

18
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,280
great what are the details of feeling lousy and what are the different component

19
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,719
parts and where is it useful to place the attention

20
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:12,879
and where is it useful to not place our interest so much

21
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:19,280
so for example if um if i feel lousy or i feel great

22
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,480
and and my interest is somehow evaluating myself because of that

23
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,560
i'm feeling great therefore i am great i'm feeling lousy therefore i am lousy

24
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,720
and then to put interest in this eye that's feeling this way

25
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,080
it might feed a kind of self concern which

26
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:51,440
is not in the long term very helpful and maybe not even very accurate

27
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,280
and um and but if instead we give our attention

28
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,519
to the details of how it feels to be feeling great or lousy

29
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:10,480
what it feels like in the body where in the body does that felt in expressed

30
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,599
and if you feel it in the body the body knows how to deal with it

31
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,640
the body knows the process by which it goes if we make room for the

32
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:27,440
body to feel it we might find it more interesting to be with the breathing

33
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:34,239
to breathe through how we're feeling to breathe with it so that we don't add or fall into

34
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,640
evaluating ourselves because of it and it can be quite a relief to just be

35
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,040
present for what's here without relating it to me myself and mine

36
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:54,400
just it's here and i don't have to be either interested or disinterested

37
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,159
i just have to kind of let it be and just breathe with it recognize it breathe through it and it's useful to

38
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:08,239
stay with the breath the breath is a balancer is a mediator is a

39
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:14,720
is a harmonizing force within us

40
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,959
and see what where the breathing takes you so i'll talk more about this in the talk

41
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,479
but attention to detail so assuming a

42
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,840
meditative posture

43
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,560
relaxing the eyes

44
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,199
and gently closing the eyes

45
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:09,280
and then in a calm way as if you have all the time in the world

46
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,960
take some deeper breaths

47
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:26,720
as if the you're getting a massage from the inside feel the expansion of the torso

48
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,000
in the in-breath and the settling back of the torso on

49
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,560
the exhale

50
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,520
breathing in and breathing out

51
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,840
and then letting your breathing return to normal

52
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:15,680
and again calmly as if you have all the time in the world as you exhale

53
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,720
relax your face

54
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,960
if there's pressure against the eyelids maybe that can soften a bit

55
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:41,039
against the teeth maybe the teeth can part a little bit

56
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:51,520
and if there's pressure against the lips maybe soften it

57
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,680
if there's tightness in your shoulders perhaps you can

58
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,880
release the tightness

59
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:23,520
if the belly is pulled in perhaps you can let it fall out

60
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,400
soft belly

61
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,039
and then noticing how you're feeling now what's your

62
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,400
general mood or state of mind emotional state

63
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,360
and is there any way in which you're experiencing that through your body

64
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,640
with your body any parts of your body that are

65
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,320
activated because of how you're feeling

66
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,240
is there any way in which you're

67
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:09,200
putting your interest in how you're feeling beyond just

68
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:16,080
recognizing it are you investing anything in it

69
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,600
being for it or against it

70
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:32,120
how simple can you be with how you're feeling

71
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:44,240
and then to return to your breathing

72
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,160
and either just stay with your breath as it is

73
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,200
or you might try breathing with how you're feeling

74
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,240
breathing through it

75
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:09,680
where your primary interest is in breathing but allowing the breathing to accompany

76
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,120
how you feel as if you have all the time in the world

77
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,839
you can do it calmly

78
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:58,519
where's your interest going if it's going into your thoughts

79
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,680
what is the emotion underneath those thoughts

80
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,240
how are they how do those emotions feel in your body

81
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,000
and then return to breathing breathing through that place in your

82
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
body

83
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,760
so

84
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,399
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

85
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:59,600
a gentle attention to detail is also helpful when with other people

86
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:06,240
sometimes we can get tripped up for anxious

87
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:15,799
irritated by the generalities or the big picture

88
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,000
but to slow down and take in another person the people you're with attention to

89
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:29,120
detail may be ascertaining how they feel and

90
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,240
what's happening for them

91
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:40,640
and to use your ability to be present mindful

92
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,240
to offer that mindful presence to someone else

93
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:53,120
you don't have to notice you're doing it that could be awkward

94
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:01,840
but you're taking in the people taking time to

95
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:08,200
feel them reflect about them consider them

96
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:20,880
so that you're in a better position to be friendly to be kind

97
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,279
to be generous

98
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:34,080
and kindness and generosity and friendliness which is not so much an addition

99
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:42,559
but is an expression of the simplicity of being present and aware

100
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,639
to consider how you can bring this practice into your daily

101
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:59,200
life to be present for others in a way that supports them

102
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:07,039
cares for them is friendly may this practice that we do

103
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:13,760
may it support us in promoting

104
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,200
goodwill friendliness and kindness

105
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,679
through our communities

106
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,520
may we do this practice for the welfare and happiness of

107
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:39,600
ourselves and for all beings

108
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:48,320
may all beings be happy may all beings be safe

109
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,279
may all beings be peaceful

110
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,080
and may all beings be free

111
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:03,789
[Music]

112
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:35,200
so this is the second taught talk on mindfulness of emotions

113
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:40,240
and the focus of today's

114
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:47,840
approach to mindfulness is recognition to recognize what's happening is really

115
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,960
a central feature of mindfulness of the kind of careful attention that

116
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,320
we're providing to the world to ourselves

117
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:03,120
and um the um

118
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,760
um so recognition and uh maybe some of you had the experience

119
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:16,720
of something being named like uh and then things just get relaxed

120
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,960
or let go or settled when they're named so for example someone might notice

121
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:30,720
you're running around kind of frantic to doing something and someone just mentions to you oh you're tense

122
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:37,039
and you say oh yes oh yes i am tense and then only then do you stop and relax

123
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:44,559
and shake it off a little bit or you're in a difficult uh social situation with a number of people

124
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:51,279
and um and everyone's kind of in the full swing of the social storm

125
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:58,640
and and then someone says you know there's a lot of tension in the room right now

126
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:04,399
and somehow naming that tension something makes everyone makes space everyone stops everyone oh yes that's

127
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:10,880
what's going on and there's a chance to take that in and adjust accordingly

128
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:17,200
the naming of something the recognizing of something is can be phenomenally useful

129
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:23,200
and uh mindfulness practice builds on the power of recognition

130
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:30,080
oh that's what's happening even something so simple as recognizing the inhale and the exhale

131
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,200
or recognizing the mind is drifting off into thought oh thinking

132
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:43,039
and there's something happen just oh that's what's happening i'm thinking i'm no longer with my breath oh now i am with my breath this is good

133
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:47,518
so the recognition of our experience

134
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:54,640
the so in terms of emotions it's helpful to think of emotions as

135
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:00,960
not single unitary things but rather as composites as made up of

136
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:07,440
different elements because if we just have a general overview of you know how we're feeling

137
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:13,520
what the emotion is it's hard to see where it is that we

138
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:19,040
attention the recognition is most useful to be to be placed or it's hard to see if there's

139
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:27,280
attachment or clinging or resistance some complication in how we're relating to it the emotion it's hard to see

140
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:34,320
if we just see the general state but if we notice some of the detailed aspects of the emotion they say oh

141
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:40,320
that's the part i'm attached to that's the where the the resistance might be

142
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:47,839
and so what are some of the different uh com components of

143
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:53,118
emotions one of the things is that i find

144
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:59,280
particularly useful to notice is the physical aspect of it

145
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,960
that emotions pretty much always are expressed or felt

146
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:11,760
somewhere energetically emotionally sensation-wise in the body someplace

147
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:18,079
some some of those sensations are agitated ones some of them are peaceful subtle depends on the nature of the

148
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:24,800
emotion and if you don't feel it in your body

149
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:31,280
someday you will as the mindfulness gets more and more settled and you become more more sensitive and

150
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,400
embodied then you start noticing oh look there it is

151
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:43,200
the there's tension in my hands whenever i get anxious oh that's where the tension is in my hands my fingers are

152
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:50,160
ever so slightly pulled in you know it could be all kinds of places in the body

153
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:56,560
so a physical manifestation is one the second one is there might be

154
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:02,079
a story connected to it and the story might be what's fueling it

155
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:08,880
we're telling ourselves reviewing what happened in the past and as we keep repeating it um

156
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,079
we're triggering and fueling the emotion so if it's a

157
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:19,680
history in the past that you're you're angry about something that happened

158
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,880
you might be sitting peacefully and very peacefully and meditating or something and then you

159
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:32,079
remember this anger evoking experience long time ago and you can feel now you get angry

160
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:37,520
and and you weren't angry a few moments ago and now there is anger and the anger

161
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:43,760
arose with the story there's something about the story that triggers the anger so the story is a

162
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,920
part of it and even in the moment when it's not a story but a living experience of the moment

163
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,839
the mind is little bit making stories about it is interpreting in ways often

164
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:01,680
for us to have the emotions we have so the interpretation the signing of

165
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:07,200
meaning the story that goes along with it is um is goes a long ways part of the

166
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,640
emotion and part of the value of feeling the physicality of the emotion

167
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:19,200
is the body is not a story and and so it's a way of stepping out of the story

168
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,240
which is fueling the emotion keeps it going into a place where the emotion

169
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:30,960
can be processed in the body can't be processed so well by just repeating the story

170
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:37,200
some emotions have motivation as part of it something that we want we want something to be

171
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,320
different we want something to have more of something we want to have something we want to

172
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,760
push something away there's approach motivations and there's

173
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,440
pushing away emotions or pulling away pulling away so is it um

174
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:59,680
is it a what's the motivation what's the relationship that we have

175
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,920
that is being expressed to this emotion so again if it's angry it's something

176
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:11,520
like we want to push something away or we want to you know

177
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:17,599
assert something and make our point to some someone so as a motivation as part of it

178
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:24,320
if there is something seemingly quite beautiful it could be love and but the love maybe has a desire it's

179
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:30,000
a longing a wish and that's the motivation that's part of it

180
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,440
the um and then there's the something a little bit more amorphous maybe the

181
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:41,280
emotion itself which is a little bit the overall feeling tone of the emotion

182
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:47,280
and that has different details as well uh some of it just might be is it pleasant or unpleasant

183
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:53,520
some emotions are pleasant and some are unpleasant and sometimes the hook

184
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:58,839
to how we get attached or involved or resisting or entangled with the

185
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:05,440
emotion sometimes it's nothing more or less than that we're reacting to it being pleasant or

186
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:12,320
unpleasant comfortable or uncomfortable so um

187
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:19,520
so there and then the other thing you know part of the kind of the

188
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:25,520
elements of emotion that to be interested to look at is what is

189
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:32,000
the relationship of you to the emotion what relationship are you having

190
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:38,320
and one of them is are you defining yourself through the emotion somewhere evaluating yourself

191
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:44,480
so if you're angry are you now consider yourself a kind of a bad person because you're angry you

192
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:51,359
shouldn't be angry or and you should be different you should be loving and all these reference back to how i

193
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:57,359
should be and how i shouldn't be or we justify why we're feeling some way

194
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:03,440
because we want to be justified we want to be someone who's right or doing the right thing or know we're

195
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,800
doing the right thing so all this me and myself concerned in relationship to it

196
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:15,359
and um you know if someone is if he's walking down the street and crosses across the street another

197
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:20,400
sidewalk you see someone who's um clearly angry maybe they're talking into

198
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:27,280
their phone and they're angry uh you know you might look at it and wonder what it's about or

199
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:33,680
find it interesting and um in a little bit that person's angry and talking loudly and

200
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:41,359
but you don't uh it's across the street and a person doesn't see you and it has no bearing on you

201
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:48,240
and you're still there that's interesting a person's angry can you do the same thing with yourself

202
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:54,640
can you allow there to be anger without relating it to yourself almost as if

203
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:00,480
it's someone else's of course it's yours but we add this extra component part

204
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:06,560
so all these things come together the physicality of it the energy the sensations of it

205
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,920
the stories and the thoughts the judgments the interpretations that we have

206
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:18,079
around it the ideas we have around it ideas of what should and shouldn't be

207
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:24,240
our values there's also um the motivation that's connected to it what we want to see

208
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:32,079
happen and there's the way that we uh define ourselves by it or get hooked by it or

209
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:38,560
want more of it our preferences and there's also the pleasant and unpleasant aspect of it so these are

210
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:44,880
some of the component parts that all get rolled up together into one big ball of the emotion

211
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:51,680
and so if you say you know that you're feeling grief

212
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:57,440
that it could be a very accurate statement to make but then attention to detail

213
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,359
what are the different component parts to it and you go through the list of everything

214
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:09,440
and you find out that partly why it's so difficult is the discomfort that comes

215
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:16,400
and the discomfort seems to be as you seem to interpret is that something is wrong if i'm uncomfortable

216
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:23,119
it's not okay to be uncomfortable and that's where the complication is so the grief is not just kind of simple

217
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:29,040
clean grief but now it's complicated with this judgment it should be different i should be uncomfortable

218
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:34,560
or perhaps uh the grief is you know genuine in many ways but uh there's a

219
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:41,280
story connected to it and the story might be now i'll never and you fill in the blank now i'll never

220
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:47,200
x y z and um and maybe it's accurate enough sometimes

221
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:54,240
when something will never happen again that's why we grieve but um but when we recognize oh that's what i'm

222
00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:00,000
grieving i'm grieving um um

223
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:07,440
futures that will never come and you know so you know and then what that's what it is so that's kind of a

224
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:13,680
fascinating kind of perspective on grief that's grieving future futures that will never

225
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:19,680
come so uh or it could be that um

226
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:24,839
we're telling ourselves a lot of stories and it's the repetitive stories

227
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:32,000
rumination that is somehow driving the emotion we have and keeping it going and keeping us entangled with it

228
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,160
so maybe what i'm saying this today is not so you know as articulate as i wish i could

229
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:44,800
be it's such an important topic and something to respect a lot for each of us our relationship to our emotional life

230
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:50,640
but i hope the principle that i'm pointing out is useful that the principle is emotions are not

231
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:56,400
unitary events they're made up of uh of different elements

232
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:02,720
they're composites there's components to them and as we settle into our mindfulness

233
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:08,400
it's helpful to look around and see what are these different elements

234
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:13,520
how is it in the body how is it in the feeling tones pleasant unpleasant

235
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,880
what's the quality and mood of the mind as i have this emotion is it contracted

236
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:25,920
or is it more spacious are there hindrances in relationship to it

237
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:33,440
is there identification in relationship to it what's the motivation connected to it

238
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:39,040
and as you kind of begin kind of looking around then you might ask yourself

239
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:44,800
is there one of those places that i'm caught where i'm entangled

240
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,920
and if it is maybe it doesn't not denying the emotion or

241
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:55,040
getting rid of it but it might make it a lot easier to be with an emotion

242
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:00,480
if that one place where we're caught up and entangled is no longer entangled

243
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:07,599
then there can be a cleaner relationship and there can be a clean emotion clean anger clean grief

244
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:15,680
clean clean joy clean even desire in a certain way

245
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,480
so um

246
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:27,440
so so you might look do that over the next

247
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,640
uh before we meet again tomorrow you might spend some time

248
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:39,119
and maybe with even paper and pencil trying to map out or understand

249
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:44,880
the different component parts of your emotions what are all the different streams that come into play

250
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:51,680
that build to this singular thing of emotion that you have and you might even do it with a friend

251
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:58,640
it might be interesting to brainstorm together what are all the different pieces and elements of your

252
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:04,960
emotional life that contribute to the whole and then

253
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:13,200
to see where where do you get tripped up the most which of those components is a place where you most often get caught

254
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:20,160
recognition through recognizing our emotions carefully attention to detail

255
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,200
thank you very much
