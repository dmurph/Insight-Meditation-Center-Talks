1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,160
hello everyone and aware that for some people it's good

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,920
morning some afternoon some good

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,560
evening hello around the globe that are

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:29,560
listening and to continue now with this kind of

5
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,960
series is on samadi I want to mention that often when

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,160
we sit down to meditate a very common maybe almost

7
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,760
daily uh guidance in meditation is to relax the body to settle the

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,800
body and it is a kind of bring the body into kind of a

9
00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:01,359
homeostasis the kind of balance for it to relax today I'd like to do the same for

10
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,960
the mind it's possible to bring the mind to

11
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,280
a kind of homeostasis that kind of

12
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:20,360
balance and more important that it's possible to uh for the thinking mind the Mind

13
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:26,479
itself to uh not be tense not be contracted and

14
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:33,000
there's no pressure in it the Mind itself becomes settled in a very nice

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,320
way and um and in becoming settled uh becoming a healthy mind becoming a

16
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,159
stable mind becoming a a unified

17
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:53,479
mind so to assume a meditation

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,360
posture and to think of the medit

19
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,039
assuming the posture is a ritual of becoming

20
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:13,480
present a ritual of connecting to your

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,800
body and grounding yourself in the

22
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,599
body so that if you lower your gaze or close your

23
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:34,239
eyes you you're ready to sense and feel

24
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,360
the body not from the control tower in terms of thinking about

25
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,440
it but more feeling it from the

26
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:54,480
inside the sensations of the body taking some moments to become more

27
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,840
familiar what it feels like the sensations of your legs your feet and your legs

28
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,440
legs what are the sensations associated with your sitting bones

29
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,120
or the contact against some surface that's holding you

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,599
up what are the sensations dancing

31
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,400
in your lower

32
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:50,319
torso and what are the sensations alive for you in your upper

33
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:59,280
torso the area of the chest the back rib cage

34
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,280
and what are the sensations in your hands and

35
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,959
arms is there any way to adjust the positioning of your hands so it's more comfortable and

36
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,240
balanced less tension

37
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:47,400
what are the sensations of your shoulders and if there is tension in the

38
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:54,000
shoulders as you exhale to relax and soften

39
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,000
what are Sensations in the

40
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,680
neck and where the spine joins the

41
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,600
skull and is there any small little adjustments of the positioning of the

42
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:35,160
head that feel good for you feel relieving or

43
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,800
opening or perhaps give you a little confidence as you sit

44
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,880
here and what are the sensations in your face

45
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:08,520
and if there is tension in your face as you exhale to let there be a

46
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:15,800
softening softening without ambition expectation that things actually

47
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:22,000
soften maybe it's more of an opening to it an allowing

48
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:50,479
and what are the sensations in your thinking mind the mind that thinks or

49
00:06:51,360 --> 00:07:00,680
visualizes is there any pressure contraction tightness

50
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,520
is there any

51
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:14,280
agitation are there the sensations of any emotions

52
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,160
underlying your thinking

53
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:35,680
process and take a few couple of minutes now to

54
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:43,759
discover without needing to change or relax the mind to become more familiar with how

55
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:50,039
this thinking mind is for you almost like you're giving yourself a

56
00:07:50,039 --> 00:08:00,960
guided tour of the thinking mind just to get to know it not to change it not to judge it

57
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:09,759
and in particular the sensations the

58
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,639
feelings the direct experience associated with the thinking mind what

59
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:19,400
is it like for you

60
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,399
a calm process of

61
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:02,760
discovery and the Mind as a whole is more more than just a thinking

62
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,440
mind is there some way that you can feel or

63
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:16,959
sense the larger process of mentality that's more than just

64
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:28,920
thinking a larger process which within which thinking is one component part

65
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:47,079
maybe part of this larger process of

66
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:54,880
mentality is some sense of Silent awareness itself

67
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:20,600
maybe there's a sense of the Mind in its

68
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:30,720
fullness has no edges to it awareness has no edges

69
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:41,639
it spreads out into the space all around the

70
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:46,759
mind all beyond the head

71
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:08,920
and now as you exhale to relax the thinking

72
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:13,519
mind letting the thinking

73
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:24,920
mind settle settle into this wider space of mind

74
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:51,440
as you exhale a gentle calming of the thinking

75
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:58,079
mind so that any pressure tightness agitation

76
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:12,519
quiets settles moves to a Stillness

77
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:43,320
and to stay connected to the present moment you

78
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,440
might feel the rhythm of the body

79
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,480
breathing with the sense that you're breathing with the

80
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:04,680
Mind breathing with with any calmness or settling in the

81
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,120
mind for

82
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,920
and as we

83
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,720
continue please see if you can

84
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:48,880
discover what happens to the quality of your

85
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,440
mind when you get absorbed in

86
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,800
thinking sometimes there's a disconnect you're no longer aware of of the Mind as

87
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:05,399
a whole maybe not even aware of the

88
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,120
body sometimes we're thinking the

89
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:19,519
mind kind of goes out like a light going

90
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,800
out things get

91
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:36,000
darker or there's a contraction or a narrowing the mind gets

92
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:45,720
small the stronger the thinking the more there's a physical

93
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,959
location from where thinking

94
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:01,480
occurs notice what it's like how the quality of the Mind changes if you get

95
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:08,000
caught in thinking and after exploring that a

96
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:16,279
bit return to breathing with the breathing

97
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:30,519
accompanying a connection to the mind

98
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:35,680
companying the best quality of mind that's

99
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
available

100
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
for

101
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
for

102
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

103
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

104
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
for

105
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
for

106
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

107
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
for

108
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,559
for for

109
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,480
for e

110
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:37,480
to breathe with the Mind breathe feeling and sensing the

111
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:43,760
thinking mind to breathe and feel the tensions in

112
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,278
the mind and as you

113
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:56,960
exhale to relax the Mind soften

114
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:07,760
calming the mind so the Mind

115
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:19,799
settles maybe any sense of the weight of the Mind feels a gentle tug of

116
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:27,039
gravity so it settles comes to

117
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
rest

118
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
for

119
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
for

120
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

121
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,278
for e

122
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:16,720
and then as we come to the end of this

123
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:29,440
sitting to appreciate our capacity to know the

124
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,320
mind to know what we're thinking what we're wanting what we don't

125
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:42,399
want to know our motivations and impulses before we

126
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:50,279
act and then how learning about ourselves learning about the mind the

127
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:59,919
heart through this practice can show us that we have choice

128
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:08,320
of what we say and do choice about what we refrain from doing and refrain from

129
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,640
saying and this choice is

130
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:19,799
invaluable because it allow us to to choose that which is beneficial for

131
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:26,519
ourselves and for others to avoid causing

132
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:34,000
harm to avoid void making situations worse and may it be that

133
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,399
the that our capacity for

134
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:49,120
mindfulness is used to for to use for the sake of benefiting ourselves and

135
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,360
others for the sake of the common

136
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:01,640
good for the sake of support supporting and caring for

137
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:07,679
others may this practice we're doing be for the welfare and happiness

138
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:15,279
of everyone may all beings be happy may all

139
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:20,880
beings be safe may all

140
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:29,919
beings be peaceful and may all beings be free

141
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:42,630
[Music]

142
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:50,359
thank [Music]

143
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,039
you

144
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,960
e e

145
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:14,480
so hello and welcome to this now this seventh talk on this samade

146
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:22,240
series and um a lot of uh our success in being able

147
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:28,480
to cultivate somebody the unified state of being

148
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:35,720
has a a lot to do with how well we know ourselves that if we know ourselves

149
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:41,600
well entering into these states of concentration absorption don't have to

150
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:48,000
doesn't have to be an act of will doesn't have something that we force oursel into

151
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:56,240
or uh strain to enter into but rather it's a profound settling in it's a

152
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:04,360
profound kind of entering into to a new mode of being but the the the it really requires

153
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:10,080
understanding ourselves well and one of the things to understand is what happens

154
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:16,000
to our mind our me our thinking mind or mind when we get

155
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:23,480
distracted when we get pulled into obsessive thinking and I began this uh week with

156
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:28,720
the discussion about the first two hindrances desire and aversion

157
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,840
and today I'll continue with that with the second uh the the third and fourth

158
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:39,279
hindrances which is U usually called sloth and toror as the third and

159
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:45,159
restlessness and remorse or restlessness and agitation

160
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:51,159
worry as the fourth and um and what all

161
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:58,919
these hindrances have in common and and partly why they they're so hindering for us is they they

162
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:05,120
involve uh mental preoccupation they involve this thinking

163
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:12,639
which may be borders on a being obsessive that we get pulled into the world of rumination of daydreaming of

164
00:33:12,639 --> 00:33:18,840
commentary of story making and and it's the in the and that

165
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:26,159
in the strength of this thinking we get absorbed in the content of the thought and we don't see we don't even see

166
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:32,000
what's happening we don't even know we're thinking and uh but one of the

167
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,880
consequences is that we're thinking about things which are not that wholesome or healthy for us to be

168
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:44,679
thinking if we there are certainly healthy ways of having desire and thinking about what we want but as a

169
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:49,960
hindrance there's an obsessive quality and often times we're thinking in ways

170
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:56,559
and With Attitudes that are not healthy that are full of of maybe greed or

171
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:02,679
strain or conceit or aversion or hatred and it's

172
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:07,840
the power of these UNH wholesome ways that gives uh strength through our

173
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:15,158
preoccupation to be lost in thought or keep getting pulled into it and even if we're not lost in it we know we're doing

174
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:20,760
it it's they're compulsive and we can't quite know how to stop them and it can

175
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:29,079
be quite discouraging the force of these kinds of uh thinking is um

176
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:34,398
uh very significant because they have a conditioning effect they there's a

177
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:39,560
feedback loop with when we're thinking in ways that are UNH wholesome uh that

178
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:47,158
creates uh more UNH wholesomeness within us it makes us feel kind of lousy or not so good and this is particularly true

179
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:54,118
with the third and fourth hindrances the third um is anything that

180
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:59,960
that kind of drains us that depletes us so the energy is not there in a full way

181
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:06,640
sometimes there's a numbing effect that goes on uh by how we think or what we're concerned with sometimes there's a

182
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,839
shutting down sometimes there's a freezing like a flight or freeze there's

183
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:17,440
a freezing because we things are so difficult for us sometimes there's a profound

184
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:24,599
discouragement or a or a shutting down going to sleep because we're resisting something or we're

185
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:29,720
overwhelmed but those can come with some kind of attitude udes or thinking or

186
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:36,200
beliefs that are operating maybe even subliminally that we're pulled into and we don't even know how much we don't

187
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:42,400
even realize how much they've affected us and with agitation and remorse and

188
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:48,920
worry regrets um there too uh there is um

189
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:55,319
something we're thinking about uh we're thinking about something that agitates us and we're energized we're activated

190
00:35:55,319 --> 00:36:02,880
in a way that it doesn't really feel Pleasant it feels like you know agitation Restless or uh so we're

191
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:09,319
thinking about something it's a or or remorse or regrets or worry all have to

192
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:18,119
do with things we're thinking about and so what the the thinking mind is activated so in in both of these

193
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:24,800
third and fourth hindrances it's certainly possible to feel the effect that those being and those hindrances

194
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:31,440
have on the body but more important for this what I'm going to talk about today the effect

195
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,839
it has on the mind the effect it has on being

196
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:44,280
aware um and um when we're caught in thoughts uh there's usually physical

197
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:51,240
Sensations think a lot there are physical s Sensations that come along with the thinking there can be a

198
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:56,880
location for thinking that is contracted or tight or as pressure there is a

199
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:03,400
narrowing of attention to a small little domain of the mind there is

200
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:08,800
um uh tightness there is uh maybe uh maybe I

201
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,880
said pressure and um maybe some people have reported when they get caught in

202
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:20,200
the world that uh it's almost like the light went out things got dark and when they wake up it's like the light comes

203
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:26,520
back on and so what effect does it have on the mind what does effect it have on the

204
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:31,800
awareness can you feel how there's a compulsion in it maybe even a sense that

205
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:39,079
the we're wearing blinders and we only see what we're concerned with we don't see the bigger picture we don't see the

206
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:44,760
fullness the wholeness of what's going on and um like like if we have a verion

207
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:50,880
with someone else we don't see their goodness if um we

208
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:58,000
are discouraged by something we're not in the and we shut down we get depleted

209
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:05,480
then we don't feel that uh we don't have the wherewithal to see where is the choice

210
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:12,119
where is the inspiration where can we make a difference in a way that does make it better uh even if we can't get

211
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:18,079
what we want or something is limiting us dramatically um we don't have to be defined by

212
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:25,160
it and so um so how is it affecting the mind and the reason why this is

213
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:30,200
important for somat is that samade is a

214
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:36,960
healing of the mind so it's not fragmented so it's not uh uh so we're

215
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:44,240
not uh it's not limited we're not caught in a small little domain the hindrances have a way of

216
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:51,000
limiting the Mind narrowing the mind uh blocking the mind not allowing the

217
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:57,520
fullness of the mind to be there and uh and for somebody to occur there's a the

218
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:06,119
mind gets reorganized so it's not fragmented or it's not narrow it's not uh limited and

219
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:14,800
so first we have to see the effect that our thinking the hindrances have on the mind to appreciate that it's how how

220
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,839
limited has become how fragmented it's become how small it's become or

221
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:27,440
contracted it's become or or um uh or maybe a sense of weight and

222
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:34,200
heaviness that feels like a burden on the mind and um and so it might be

223
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:40,440
discouraging to feel these qualities of the mind that can be there when we're caught in the hindrances OR caught in

224
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:47,880
thought but the um what we're doing here is seeing getting discovering how the

225
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:55,160
mind is like so that the the the ways in which awareness can support us to heal

226
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:00,680
it to knit it back together again to bring us back into the wholeness of the

227
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:09,079
Mind where all the capacities of the mind can work in a kind of homeostasis or work together for the same

228
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:15,359
purpose so um so part of the task for

229
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:22,280
somebody is become a mind Whisperer to become someone who begins to sense and

230
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:28,560
feel and know and recognize the quality of the Mind not just what you're

231
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,960
thinking about in fact what you're thinking about might be important but

232
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:39,720
for you what's more important is the quality

233
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:45,760
of the mind is the is the uh aliveness of the

234
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:52,040
Mind the goodness of the mind and with Sloth and torper the quality of the mind

235
00:40:52,040 --> 00:41:02,720
kind of becomes deflated with agitation and worry the quality of the mind gets agitated and gets uh uh um you know um

236
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:10,480
gets overactivated and um both of them are not so useful for us but we if we can

237
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:17,440
see that and know how the mind has shifted under the force of these two states that's the beginning of being

238
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:23,160
able to open up or to allow something to settle the settling of the mind or the

239
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:30,119
calming of the mind or the opening of the mind or the expanding of the Mind

240
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:35,359
Over time for meditators there's all this Rich world of the mind that we

241
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:42,000
begin to sense and feel that's so much greater than what we are thinking about

242
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:49,800
and we begin to appreciate that um is um that there's

243
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:55,640
more the mind is bigger awareness is bigger than any of the particular things

244
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:01,440
we're focusing on so if we're agitated chances are there's something it might

245
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:07,760
be subconscious something that worries us or concerns us or or uh we're we're

246
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,599
troubled by and um and can we feel that sense of

247
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:21,160
agitation troubling of the mind can we care for it can we hold it in the simple

248
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:30,000
rhythm of breathing um a lot of what samadi is about and mindfulness itself is not

249
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:37,559
about fixing things it's not about judging things and but rather it's about

250
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:44,640
healing things settling things in meditation we don't solve

251
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:50,280
anything we dissolve our problems problems are not solved they're

252
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:58,200
dissolved in the in the larger uh scope of intelligence

253
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:04,520
that is not even personal when the mind is full and the mind is Unified and

254
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:10,640
whole so the part that I'm hoping that you'll understand from this talk the

255
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:17,559
most is uh the value of becoming familiar with the quality of your mind

256
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:24,680
the characteristics of your mind in different situations that you're in a different during different mental

257
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:32,359
activities and particular how some mental activi some forms of thinking some some forms of wanting and

258
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:40,079
not wanting some forms of discouragement and some forms of worry that they create

259
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:46,280
a particular kind of mind that is much more limited the full capacity of the

260
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:54,119
mind is not really available and to start feeling and sensing what this is like uh in in

261
00:43:54,119 --> 00:44:03,800
preparation for how some will help this to settle help this to quiet to calm and

262
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:10,400
the mind becomes whole or unified so to the degree to which you

263
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,640
might understand what I've said today i' encourage you so during this next period

264
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:23,440
until for the next 24 hours when you're awake that you might um uh take time

265
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:30,119
through the day maybe even put a timer on that goes off every 15 minutes or 30

266
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:35,760
minutes or something and then to remind you what's the quality of the Mind how

267
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:41,760
is the thinking I'm involved in the activity I'm doing how has this affected the quality of the

268
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:49,079
mind and in what way is the mind now become limited and narrow and tight and

269
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:57,839
and um and is it possible to open it again so um

270
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:04,680
thank you very much and um and as I've said now a few times we're going to go

271
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:10,319
through we're laying down a slow foundation for somat and we're going to

272
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:16,119
go over these weeks uh into some of the deeper states of Som but it's really

273
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:21,960
important to lay the foundation for it in a slow maybe systematic way so that

274
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:27,079
you're getting more more and more familiar with the territory

275
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:37,520
and um so may you study your mind today thank you
