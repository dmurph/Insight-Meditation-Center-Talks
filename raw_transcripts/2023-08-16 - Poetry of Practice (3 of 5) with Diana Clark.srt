1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:07,620
okay I think I'll begin now welcome

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:14,700
it's uh such a pleasure to be practicing together these mornings or as I said

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:20,000
it's maybe it's not morning for you or maybe you're watching these later

4
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:27,480
it's uh meaningful to practice together and today is the third day of the series

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,758
of poetry of practice and as I mentioned a little bit on the

6
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,239
first date there's a way in which we can practice where there's a lot of

7
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:44,100
specificity of directions like we're following the instructions as precisely

8
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:51,719
as we can maybe we hear the echo of a Derma teacher or some reading and a Dorma book

9
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:59,219
maybe even a podcast that we heard and we're really trying to follow the instructions with a certain

10
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:06,000
amount of maybe striving or maybe even some straining with some directionality like I'm gonna

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,420
go this direction and I'm going to do this and that can be tremendously helpful and

12
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,298
valuable in a support for practice foreign

13
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:24,540
that type of practice there's also another way

14
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,880
practice that is maybe a little bit more diffuse

15
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:36,010
and softer so it's a more of a Feeling

16
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:41,700
[Music] sensing our way maybe tuning into and

17
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:48,960
becoming sensitive to what's happening and feeling into where the next moment

18
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,860
of Freedom or ease well-being can be found

19
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,899
so rather than going one particular direction feeling into what's needed in

20
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,420
the next moment to help support this opening softening

21
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,060
sense of well-being and contentment Peace and Freedom to arise

22
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:18,959
so we're still practicing with the same intentionality but in a different way

23
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:27,500
and in this series The Poetry of practice I'm pointing to the second way there's more this sense of sensitivity

24
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:34,800
Attunement and feeling into what needs to be next maybe with less of

25
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,020
a sense of following instructions

26
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:49,459
and more just feeling our way to the next moment

27
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:56,700
and maybe I'll just add this before we begin this guided meditation the Buddha spoke about right before his Awakening

28
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:02,580
that his mind was malleable so I'd like to think of this word

29
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,920
malleable as a way in which there's this sense of feeling into becoming sensitive

30
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:15,379
to as well as the sense of directionality and intentionality

31
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:21,780
so that is an introduction well I'll guide us a little bit during

32
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:28,379
this guided meditation and then I'll drop in a poem a short poem

33
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:34,159
and I'll talk about a little bit after the guided meditation

34
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:42,260
so we'll take a moment to settle in

35
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:53,540
feeling the experience of taking a meditation posture

36
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:02,900
and feel and feel body in this meditation posture

37
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,260
like to sit or whatever posture you're in and to know that you are in that posture

38
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:28,800
what does it feel like becoming sensitive tuned to

39
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,199
the body in this particular configuration

40
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:46,699
in particular we might tune into the sensations have been connected

41
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:52,160
grounded to that which is supporting us

42
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:15,080
might be the sensations of the feet on the ground

43
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:22,259
the legs in connection with the chair the mat the

44
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:29,840
couch bed wherever we are whatever we're doing

45
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,720
on the buttocks being in connection with the seat cushion chair feeling the

46
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,180
pressure against the body feeling this connection

47
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,400
with that which is supporting us

48
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,780
opening the uprightness of the body

49
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,919
the spine

50
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:21,600
and if you're using the back rest feeling the pressure

51
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,400
of the chair against the back

52
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:43,860
and bringing some attention to the face this is a place where

53
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:51,360
so many nerve endings and the phase has so many different ways it can be expressive

54
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:59,060
but there's also a way in which the face can hold attention or tightness

55
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:09,240
check in with the sensations around the mouth the jaw

56
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,380
and the eyes

57
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:38,539
tuning in to any tension or tightness

58
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:47,240
and allowing any softening that might occur with this attention

59
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:55,139
it's okay if it doesn't soften but if it does just allowing that opening that

60
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:59,419
softening to arise

61
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:39,300
oh and then tuning in

62
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,279
to the sensations of breathing

63
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,060
the experience of the body breathing

64
00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:00,959
feeling the sensations at the nose the chest

65
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:07,560
the belly whatever feels comfortable and

66
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:13,459
accessible for you right now

67
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:41,420
what does it feel like could have an in-breath

68
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,040
or that what are the experiences

69
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:10,819
what does it feel like to have an out breath what are those experiences

70
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:44,579
and of course the transitions between in-breaths and out breaths

71
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:48,860
what is that like

72
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:55,019
and setting the intention for the remainder of this meditation to be one

73
00:11:55,019 --> 00:12:02,519
of openness softness sensitivity to what's happening

74
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:07,940
as best we can as best we can

75
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,579
foreign

76
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,100
foreign

77
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,100
[Music] as it's apt to do we just very simply

78
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:49,700
gently Begin Again tuning into the sensations of breathing

79
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,019
foreign

80
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:50,180
foreign

81
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,920
so now I'm going to drop in a poem

82
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:48,360
absolutely no need to do anything with this poem

83
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:54,180
just allow it to enter and

84
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,139
that's all

85
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:11,579
the poem goes like this it is foolish

86
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:17,760
to let a young Redwood grow next to a house

87
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:24,140
even in this one lifetime you will have to choose

88
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:34,020
that great calm being this clutter of soup pots and bunks

89
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:40,500
already the first Branch tips brush at the window

90
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,679
Softly calmly immensely

91
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,580
TAPS at your life

92
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:02,360
Softly calmly immensity

93
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,440
TAPS at your life

94
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:21,419
foreign

95
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,039
foreign

96
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,080
thank you

97
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,880
foreign

98
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,559
foreign

99
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:47,240
foreign foreign

100
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,340
foreign

101
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,179
foreign

102
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:47,658
foreign

103
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:23,630
[Music]

104
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,760
[Music]

105
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,700
so again welcome welcome for everybody

106
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:09,260
it's lovely to practice together

107
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:18,179
so this idea of poetry of practice

108
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:23,460
and there's poems prose do does as well but poems there's

109
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:29,580
a way in which they often use metaphor and I really evocative way and this is

110
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:36,200
part of what can make poetry be so powerful maybe speaking directly to the heart

111
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:43,380
because it's using metaphor so maybe not the usual Concepts or labels or language

112
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:52,320
that we would use to describe something but instead sometimes in poetry there's a way in which there's a pointing to

113
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:58,440
something rather than saying it or labeling it directly

114
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:04,100
so maybe there's a way in which the heart and the mind have to like look in a particular direction

115
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:10,340
in order to understand what the poem what the poet is pointing towards

116
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:16,860
and we might say in some ways all we're ever doing when we speak about

117
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:23,880
something is to point towards it when it reads there's a difference between the labels and the words that we

118
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:29,220
use then the actual objects or experiences

119
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:35,720
and there's something about poetry that doesn't try to pretend that it's not doing that whereas in our usual language

120
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:43,320
we might think that the map it's the territory for example that the concept that the word is the

121
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:50,220
actual thing that's important so in some ways we might even say that

122
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:56,760
practice this meditation practice this Buddhist practice is so much about highlighting the difference

123
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:04,500
between the words the labels that we assign to something

124
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:10,940
and the actual experience of that something

125
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:18,720
so here's the poem that I read during the guided meditation

126
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:25,140
I'll name the name of the poem and the poet at the end here this morning

127
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:30,380
but for now just feel into this poem

128
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,899
it is foolish to let a young Redwood grow next to a house

129
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:44,120
even in this one lifetime you will have to choose that great calm being

130
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:50,220
this clutter of super pots and books

131
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:56,539
already the first Branch tips brush at the window Softly

132
00:32:56,539 --> 00:33:03,200
calmly immensity TAPS at your life

133
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:10,740
so this poem begins with it is foolish to let a young Redwood grow next to a

134
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:16,260
house this poet grew up in the bay actually I don't know if they grew up in the area

135
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:22,260
but certainly lived in the Bay Area and practiced with the San Francisco's end Center

136
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:27,600
and this roll of trees and for the body sorry for the Buddha it

137
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:33,500
was the booty tree but uh for this part it's a redwood tree

138
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:38,700
and ancient India these Bodhi trees were Majestic

139
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:45,120
and certainly here in California redwood trees have this same sense of majesty or

140
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,580
Mighty or dignity there's a way in which being in a Grove of redwood trees any of

141
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:58,860
you have been there no there's a sense of it being in a cathedral so this poet is pointing to trees the

142
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:07,280
powerfulness of trees as well as maybe the the specialness the dignity

143
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:15,060
powerfulness of trees and we could say in this poem it's represented practice

144
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:21,419
so it's foolish to let a young redwood tree grow next to a house and we could

145
00:34:21,419 --> 00:34:27,240
say that a house represents the self is that we that which we build and

146
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:32,460
create and feel like we have to support and hide behind or hide within or get

147
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:39,780
lost within and and the Buddha certainly use this in some other poems that he's used that we

148
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:45,000
can find in the domapara about talking about the house Builder being you know

149
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:51,599
the self and the house itself being itself but a house can also represent like our

150
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:57,138
attachments those things that we are tangled up with

151
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:04,440
and so I was can literally be a house but maybe not necessarily

152
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:11,640
and then in this line it is foolish to let a young Redwood grow next to a house

153
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:18,300
foolish and Paulie this word is foolish is the same word as child

154
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:25,560
so it's a way of just not knowing better yet and the Buddha called people fools who

155
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:30,920
didn't recognize that what they were doing was a source of suffering

156
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:36,180
so this idea of planting a redwood tree

157
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:42,000
brightness next to a house a sense of self

158
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,540
then the poem continues even in this one lifetime you will have to choose

159
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:54,180
this notion of maybe I'll just say some of you might know that IMC inside

160
00:35:54,180 --> 00:36:00,660
Meditation Center is in Redwood City there's a reason why it's called a Redwood City there's a number of reasons

161
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:08,579
but one is um this redwood trees there and in the front of IMC is this really

162
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:15,900
big redwood tree maybe I don't know what the diameter is maybe eight feet something it's really big

163
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:23,040
and this red Retreat over the years has been growing and growing and the sidewalk around it was like buckling and

164
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:28,859
it's really getting distorted and was you know creating a tripping Hazard for people

165
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:36,000
so IMC worked to level out the sidewalk and I had to call them the city to help

166
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,480
with this uh I love this so much the city came in looked at this redwood tree

167
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:51,720
looked at the sidewalk and they just decided to reroute the sidewalk around the tree

168
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:58,560
just recognizing that trees are powerful and they grow and there's no stopping

169
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:06,540
them because no matter how much concrete you put down on a sidewalk so you'll be in the same way maybe this

170
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:13,920
poet knew this had this experience for themselves and it was the same way in which practice

171
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,619
grows it's the nature to grow and it disrupts

172
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:25,380
our sense of self disrupts our attachments

173
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:30,839
so this idea of that if you don't want anything in your life to change if you

174
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:37,740
don't want any disruptions then don't plant your practice next to

175
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:43,920
it so this poem continues by saying you'll

176
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:51,480
have to choose between that create a great calm being and this

177
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:59,700
clutter of soup pots and books that great calm being

178
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:07,440
you could say his Awakening we could say it's practice you could say it's just regular meditation

179
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:13,579
and then this clutter of soup pots and books maybe this poem is a little bit

180
00:38:13,579 --> 00:38:19,380
autobiographical maybe the poet has a lot of books and likes to cook

181
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:26,520
but clutter is the opposite of calm maybe there's a sense of things not

182
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:32,760
being cared for or being neglected and we might ask ourselves

183
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:39,140
what in our life is the opposite of calm

184
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:48,320
what is what do we have what have we filled our life with our sense of self with that's the opposite of calm

185
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:55,440
so this problem is not asking us to let go of our soup pots and books

186
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,800
necessarily but I would say it's asking us to let go of our grasping to them our

187
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:07,260
clinging or craving our compulsion to like shift our relationship to the

188
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:14,720
objects of the world and allow that relationship to be disrupted by this growing practice

189
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:21,900
Palace growing tree and maybe it's asking us to soften and

190
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:27,420
let go of all the ways that we limit and Define ourselves

191
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:35,310
and to let go of those objects and experiences that we're using to bolster and protect

192
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:41,579
[Music] maybe even inflate sense of self that we have

193
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:47,000
so this disruption of course it doesn't have to be violent it doesn't have to be

194
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:54,200
some big giant painful things it's the way it might just be this simple

195
00:39:54,200 --> 00:40:02,880
gentle dismantling of this house this sense of self

196
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:09,960
that we're so trying to hold on to so maybe it's something as simple of

197
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:17,640
softening of resentment or a grudge and starting to feel and see more

198
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:23,579
clearly how this leads to suffering or maybe it's about softening our

199
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:29,640
preferences for how we think other people should behave or how we should behave

200
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:35,520
this way is in which we're dismantling a little bit to this

201
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:42,000
sense of self then this poem continues

202
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,420
already the first Branch tips brush at the window

203
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:54,000
I love this you know the branch tips right this is what's uh visible above

204
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,579
the ground it's maybe obvious when there's the roots of the trees or what disrupts the

205
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:06,839
sidewalks off often and they're not so visible but there's a way that just brushing at

206
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:12,000
the window maybe there's this way that sometimes we can just really feel

207
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,880
practice leading our life it's not necessarily always Pleasant and

208
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:24,660
maybe it only happens under certain conditions just like the brush tip the tips brush only when it's windy for

209
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:30,599
example but is there a way that we can become

210
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:37,800
sensitive to and notice or maybe we've already noticed the way that practice is affecting our

211
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:42,839
life or maybe this is a question

212
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:49,440
in what ways has practice brushed up against your life

213
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:56,339
maybe you're not cursing at the driver that's going to slow in the lane in

214
00:41:56,339 --> 00:42:02,180
front of you or Cuts you off or doesn't use their blink or whatever it might be

215
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:08,240
and then this poem ends with softly calmly

216
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:13,460
immensity TAPS at your life

217
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:19,560
immensity Without Limits vastness without a sense

218
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:27,859
of how things should be maybe without a sense of self like with no limits

219
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:36,480
and first the practice is brushing against the window and then it's tapping a little bit more insistent and the way

220
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,500
that we can't really maybe ignore it

221
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:51,980
so maybe there's this shift in emphasis and maybe we're starting to choose oh that

222
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:59,700
calm beam the tree practice or versus this clutter of soup pots and

223
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:07,740
books so I'll read this poem

224
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:13,680
one more time here it is foolish to let a young Redwood

225
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:19,920
grow next to a house even in this one lifetime you will have to choose

226
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:26,819
that great calm being this clutter of soup pots and books

227
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:36,119
already the first Branch tips brush at the window softly calmly immensity TAPS at your

228
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:43,260
life this poem is called tree and it's by

229
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:48,599
Jane hirschfield I'll say this again and the poem is called tree

230
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:55,200
and it's by Jane hirschfield and I offered my interpretation of this

231
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:01,380
poem but what's your interpretation I offered one way we can look at this but

232
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:07,619
part of the beauty of I would say practice and poetry is that we each find

233
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:13,440
our own way nobody's way is exactly the same

234
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:20,880
nobody's interpretation of this poem will be exactly the same what is your interpretation

235
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:27,440
how does this poem relevant to your life today

236
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:33,920
so thank you thank you for your practice and I'll see you tomorrow
