1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:08,720
for today's topic for practice together um

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:15,120
let's continue let's continue one more session with the practice of mudita with the

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,240
practice of vicarious joy

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,320
um sympathetic joy empathetic choice many different ways is translated

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:33,120
because it's such a profound and beautiful practice to feel happy for

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:40,559
happiness for good fortune for goodness in the world this way we notice goodness more

7
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,680
and of course this time of the pandemic especially there might be lots of

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:53,600
challenges both for us personally and people we care about and it's wholesome it's wholesome to

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,640
intend to train our mind to also notice the good

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:06,400
notice the blessings notice what's good in the world and feel happy for it um

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,480
and um and as i was saying last night

12
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:18,640
[Music] us human beings we have the genes of the human beings who were more

13
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:26,080
anxious and worried and as they were walking on the savannah

14
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,520
they were more concerned about the dangers about the african mammoth not the woolly mammoth one of you

15
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,119
you've pointed out there was no holy mamas on on the savannah yes the african mammoth

16
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:43,920
they were more concerned about dangers in the environment instead of instead of the positive the

17
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,399
positive in the environment so that the ones who are more tuned to

18
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,799
more positiveness in the environment they they were hunted out they didn't live

19
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,079
long enough to pass down their genes the the ancestors who passed out their

20
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:08,080
genes were the ones who were anxious who were looking out for all all the negative and

21
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,840
difficulty in the environment so so what we feel if you've noticed that oh

22
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,000
when somebody gives you a compliment it just rolls off but if somebody gives you a challenging

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,440
feedback ah you think about it over and over and over and over again

24
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,519
so you can just see this this um tendency in yourself and everybody else

25
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,560
you know we're it's it's also said that our minds are

26
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:45,040
like teflon for good experiences they don't stick good experiences just roll off whereas

27
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,720
their our minds are like velcro for challenging and difficult experiences it

28
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,040
just sticks so different ways to think about this natural tendency

29
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:04,239
that us human beings happen to have evolutionarily so this practice

30
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:10,159
of turning our minds to um intentionally to notice the good to

31
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,200
notice the blessings to notice what's good both for in our lives and other

32
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,480
people's lives and celebrating feeling happy for happiness

33
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:29,280
um is a wholesome way to train ourselves in gladness to train ourselves our heart

34
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,280
in in happiness which is wholesome it's not avoidant

35
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:43,040
it's not avoidant in that we build more capacity more resilience

36
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,959
to be what is difficult it's not about avoiding the difficulty but to build

37
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,480
more capacity through joy have you noticed if

38
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,280
you're in a good mood if somebody gives you bad news ah it's easier to be with it

39
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:09,200
then if you're already depressed somebody gives you bad news and oh you're just shattered so in the first

40
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,720
scenario you're more resilient so in this way we're building more

41
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,320
resilience to be able to support ourselves and others so so many different ways to

42
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:28,320
think about this beautiful practice of modita so without further ado let's do it

54
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:27,919

55
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,840

in their life something they are happy about

113
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:20,159
they celebrate could be something as simple as they were sick and now they're

114
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,158
healthy and they're happy about that

115

may your good fortune continue made increase may it never

128
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:19,200
end if we choose to recite the sentence full

129
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:26,799
fully well knowing there is impermanence and yet we share

130
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:33,520
the sentiment as a generosity as a statement of

131
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:39,520
generosity of our heart not attached to outcome that this will

132
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:47,279
continue forever it may not but we wish we wish it with generosity

133
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:54,480
celebrating their happiness without attachment

134
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,919
i'm happy for your happiness or maybe simply war wordless with data

135
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:19,840
celebrating their good fortune

136
00:24:52,880 --> 00:25:01,840
and now bringing to mind someone you don't know very well

137
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:10,320
maybe a neighbor whom you have met but don't really know or someone

138
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:18,240
working at a store you've interacted briefly with or a delivery person

139
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:28,000
somewhat of a neutral somewhat of a neutral person

140
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:36,799
as a stand-in for all of humanity to bring this person this human being to

141
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,640
mind that just like you

143
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,840

148
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:39,840

bringing bringing them to mind and noticing that just like you

169
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:23,760

would love to hear your reflections what worked what didn't what did you notice

206
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:41,119
we had some lovely reflections last night and i forgot to say since diana is off for

207
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:46,240
this month i'm for the first two weeks of march i'm teaching

208
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:53,839
every night i'm teaching happier every night so tomorrow it's me again

209
00:37:53,839 --> 00:38:00,320
surprise so so based on some feedback last night

210
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:06,400
um i think you remember jamie talk asking about how to connect how to better connect more easily

211
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:12,640
connect with the neutral being so i changed tonight's meditation guidance to

212
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:18,400
to support that and i hope that was supportive for you jamie and others i see you're nodding giving thumbs up

213
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:25,119
great so other questions comments it's all welcome it all helps supports everyone

214
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:33,838
in the community so

215
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:48,480
fred are you trying to raise your hand to speak i am yes okay yeah the the race hand

216
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,680
button is right underneath that um this is the clap but it's good

217
00:38:53,680 --> 00:39:00,640
so i can i can hear you yes please um i i found your suggestion

218
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:07,119
to use our imagination uh very effective and i was having the same trouble as was

219
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:15,040
being discussed last night of trying to grasp the happiness of someone i knew

220
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,960
almost nothing about but knowing that my imagining of the

221
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,480
person's details of their life and their inner life were probably

222
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,760
invariably wrong uh you know i'm i'm mostly wrong about people i know

223
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:38,240
well so why would i get you know a stranger right and that was just fine it felt like

224
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:46,160
we could move closer in a way that was very gratifying great lovely thank you for sharing that

225
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:52,400
reflection i'm delighted to hear that that that imagination surprisingly it

226
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:58,720
does work with this practice yay especially with the neutral person with creating the sense of connection

227
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,880
because this practice of metta mudita these brahmaviharas are skillful means

228
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:11,839
our ways that we use imagination we use different um abilities different

229
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:19,200
tools to conjure up a connection to create a connection with people um so lovely thank you for

230
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,599
sharing that fred nice

231
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:32,400
other reflections any questions comments complaints what worked what didn't what

232
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:39,838
surprised you

233
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:57,440
and please know whatever you choose to share of your practice with the community is helpful for the community

234
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:07,839
something was surprising if you noticed yeah i'll pause

235
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:19,760
yeah so i have a question maybe before we go into practice into small groups together and

236
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:27,359
using the reactions the reactions button um they're the green the yes

237
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:33,359
if you notice you feel or at any point you felt happier this really tuning connecting

238
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:39,200
with goodness in the world give a check mark give a yes i'm curious this is

239
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:49,200
an informal survey and i'm going to count the yeses

240
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:57,119
yeah so i see it a dozen yeses

241
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:03,838
roughly the number keeps changing i think it it times out after a while

242
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,640
and if it's a no do the x so which is fine too great i think it keeps timing out i

243
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:21,280
think the number is yeah it keeps increasing decreasing that's so funny all right i'm getting about 15 or so

244
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:28,000
right now something like that okay great nice well thank you for voting it's it's

245
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,040
nice to get a sense so

246
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:41,200
so thank you all for i'm getting thumbs up on youtube too that's sweet um so

247
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:46,880
so for our practicing community as again yesterday we did an informal

248
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:54,480
survey it will start with 30 seconds of silence silent modita gladness for other

249
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:01,280
people's glams and if at this point you usually hop off notice what happens if you stay in order

250
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:08,160
to support others as a gift of generosity to others to see it that way if if you have to go

251
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:14,640
it's all good but if you can stay see what happens if you stay out of generosity to others

252
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:22,240
for the practice so i will create the practice groups the small groups

253
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:29,920
and oh yes and after um the uh after 30 seconds of silent mudita for

254
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:36,960
each other happiness for each other's happiness then um let's go one round and

255
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:43,040
sharing something you're happy about something you're grateful for in your life and you can practice real

256
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:49,440
time with detail for each other and then you can share anything you want to share

of sila before i left and just practicing um some some

279

280
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:49,920
stuff yeah nice thank you for sharing that what a beautiful intention

281
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:56,318
um to stay intentionally to practice

282
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:04,560
wholeheartedness virtue kindness you know ethical

283
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:11,839
wise speech right speech so many different names just to relate from from a place of

284
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:19,440
integrity and kindness and wisdom through wise speech in in this little sandbox of interaction

285
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:25,760
what a beautiful intention to bring in i love it yay and i'm highlighting it because i

286
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:31,520
think that's a lovely intention for all of us i see hot net heads nodding it's it's a

287
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:37,359
beautiful intention for all of us in this way to um practice and in the past when i

288
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:43,599
used to the first year i would say a lot setting up the groups about intention when you

289
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:50,559
go into small groups and now i don't do that anymore and your your share is a beautiful reminder trevor

290
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:56,960
that i think every time it's important as we enter this sacred space of a small group to really show up in

291
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:02,960
this way oh this is a sandbox how can i show up with integrity kindness wisdom for myself and

292
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:09,040
for others how can i show up differently and model this for myself and others

293
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:15,599
to take it into my daily life so thank you for that trevor so we have

294
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:23,280
