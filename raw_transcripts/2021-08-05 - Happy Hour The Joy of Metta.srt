00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,640
so a warm welcome everyone wherever you are in the world

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:16,720
in this moment of time coming together to practice so today's practice the

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:23,600
the title i want to give it um is the joy of metta the joy of

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:29,840
metta it's this practice of metta wishing well

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,399
cultivating cultivating goodness

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:42,160
kindness for ourselves for other beings for all beings is a happy making

7
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:49,200
it's a happy making endeavor it's not a grim like okay may you be well very happy very well

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,879
you know that'll be kind of antithetical to the whole idea of cultivating good will

9
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:02,399
it brings up joy it brings up joy um and a couple of ideas i want to bring

10
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:11,119
in tonight um as we explore one is no matter how grumpy

11
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:17,050
you might be given the cause and conditions of something happening in your day your body um

12
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:22,320
[Music] or or challenging the day might be um

13
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,960
and i've tried this that the days that the mind and heart have been challenged and just if i

14
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,640
went for a walk for example just wishing well just wishing well for

15
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,880
all the passerbys or if i couldn't go for a walk i would be just wishing well as if i'm giving gifts

16
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:48,399
to others just giving gifts of kindness give gifts of kindness gifts of kindness to myself and to

17
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:55,200
others and sure enough i find that oh i become happier there is the joy there's a happiness of

18
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,960
gift-giving it's like christmas but you don't have to go shopping for gifts you're just giving all these

19
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,399
gifts from your heart gifts of goodness gift so may you be safe may you be happy may you

20
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:13,599
be well me it's just there's a sense of abundance and the heart really wakes up to

21
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:19,599
to the joy to the to the abundance of itself and it nourishes us it supports

22
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:25,760
especially if we're going through a hard time if we're not going through hard times we're already happy yay becomes a party

23
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,040
of of happiness and especially if we're going through a hard time if there is a challenge

24
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:38,640
it supports well-being supports goodness so that we can be be be with what is difficult support

25
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,959
ourselves and support others so that's one thing i wanted to bring in for exploration

26
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:53,120
today with this thing and also the joy of meta another inspiration for tonight is

27
00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:01,280
there are some emails on the google groups the past few days past couple of days

28
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,800
some folks sharing um how the practice of the brahmavihara's

29
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:14,000
metta has transformed them how they have been changed and this i think was based on inspired by an

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,680
invitation that diana gave maybe it was yesterday so maybe it wasn't two days ago maybe it's just been

31
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:27,120
a day time is elastic anyway so so for me reading reading those a few of you had

32
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:34,239
shared how um stories of how this practice of meta has has

33
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,480
transformed you has shifted the way you feel you show up in the world the way you feel about

34
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:47,280
others the way you feel safer happier and it made me so happy it made me so

35
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,799
happy the joy of metta it brought me so much joy to read uh those accounts i i'm

36
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:02,319
actually getting goosebumps remembering what i've read and also feeling into what i know of

37
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:09,120
many practitioners that i have worked with over the years myself included i've worked with myself

38
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,159
knowing how transformative these practices can be

39
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:20,160
um and i'll just offer one thing to you i was thinking there's so many

40
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,560
ways that i have changed the way i feel it will be a long drama talk which i don't want to give

41
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,400
right now but just one thing that came up for me is i noticed the way i talk to myself

42
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,759
has changed i think when i was younger before i started this practice i don't know how i referred to myself but i

43
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:44,880
certainly didn't call myself sweetie and darling and that's how i talk to myself now which is quite sweet like how

44
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,880
you doing darling what do you need sweetie it's just it's become a part of the way i relate to myself

45
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,800
so and i didn't relate to myself that that way years ago so i just wanted to

46
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,400
share that with you as as one of the ways one of the very very many ways

47
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,479
that this practice has transformed me and my life and the way i show up for myself and

48
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:15,919
and others so so with that dear ones let's practice together

49
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:25,840
let's land ah let's land let's land in our bodies

50
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:40,800
let's land in this moment letting go of all the words

51
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,759
that came before

52
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,360
and just landing feeling our feet our legs

53
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,478
our sit bones

54
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:07,840
connected to the earth

55
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:21,120
and landing landing landing

56
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:35,840
each out breath letting go some more of what is not needed right now

57
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:15,039
as if your mind your body is a snow globe

58
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:22,479
and perhaps up to this moment was shaken [Music] lots of flurry of bright

59
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,759
little thoughts agitations in the body and mind

60
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,280
ah setting down

61
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,120
the snow globe letting all the little shiny objects of the mind the body

62
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:59,840
settle with the breath with the sensations of the body

63
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,519
connecting connecting with each breath

64
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:01,519
calming soothing breath the entirety of the breath

65
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,040

chest throughout the body

67
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:31,360

68
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:47,839
just here just right now

69
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,720
the peace the joy of seclusion of the mind

70
00:12:51,360 --> 00:13:07,839
just this breath within the sensations of the body

71
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,680
what a gift

72
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:35,839
to be able to sit and practice

73
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,160
turning the gaze of awareness

74
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,839
internally to connect with ourselves

75
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,680

76
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:07,040

with each being you bring to your hearts and mind's eye

111
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:49,840
same way that when you give someone a gift you look into their eyes

112

123
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,000

and expand this well-wishing to some people who are a little

154
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:05,279
challenging not the most challenging perhaps just a little challenging

155
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:11,039
if you wish and don't push it you're welcome to stay with the easy

185
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:11,760
of passing kindness onto others and we were doing that through the whole fan we were all the

195
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,760
your tip about mitta and how you talk to yourself nikki i will try it i think inner speech is

196
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,800
related to right speech oh yes yes you are so welcome

197
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:22,319
and so happy to to share that with you and inspire you to try it out it's i think for me it just happened

198
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:28,720
kind of naturally i became dearer to myself and everybody has become dear

199
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,920
so it's yeah i encourage you to try it on for size and

200
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:39,680
see actually what happens it's this um you know the expression

201
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:46,160
fake it till you make it but actually i think more appropriately is fake it or do it

202
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:53,040
until you become it so you keep doing it you call yourself by sweet names and one day it's like yeah actually

203
00:41:53,040 --> 00:42:03,200
sweetheart yeah darling what do you need are you okay oh so thank you for that reflection

anything you discovered from this practice yes please carol

207
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:34,720
hi nikki hi i i just love how there's different things

208
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:40,079
we say we say them a lot like may may you be healthy

209
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:46,720
um you know may you be at ease and it's like it's so interesting how how those things

210
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:53,359
mean different things on different days in some in some ways like sometimes it's almost like a mantra

211
00:42:53,359 --> 00:43:00,319
you're just repeating and then some days it just really sort of pierces down to a deeper place

212
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:06,400
where you i don't i don't know it's just for me today when you said at one point like maybe

213
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:12,000
healthy i had to go to the doctor today and it was it was not that eventful but i was i went through

214
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,480
a period of several years where i was chronically ill so it's like i just still have these like

215
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:25,280
just remnants of like ptsd from that i feel like where i'm just like it's like everything there's part of me

216
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:32,240
that goes into this like oh no what if i lose everything again in my life and so just that like you saying like

217
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:40,079
maybe be healthy maybe at ease it was just like really like helped me connect to this

218
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:46,560
uh different part of myself that has developed since then in you know the 10 years since then that

219
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:53,200
is uh more loving and and is at ease so i just wanted to say thanks for that and

220
00:43:53,200 --> 00:44:00,078
also just love our beautiful practice and how it is always different every day

221
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:07,280
thank you thank you carol for your practice and and it is isn't it always

222
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:14,160
different every day it's this gift of impermanence keeps it interesting every day and just

223
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:19,359
as you said these different um wishes they land differently oh yes

224
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:25,200
may you be happy oh sweetheart may you have ease oh yes yes lance differently

225
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:30,640
the different level layer practice is like an onion i like to

226
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:36,800
think it's sweet on you know different layers being peeled absolutely

227
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,480
what a beautiful insight yeah yeah thank you carol thanks thanks for being

228
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,838
here thank you

229
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:53,920
sweet so oh yes one more reflection i've been

230
00:44:53,920 --> 00:45:00,319
trying to observe more closely how i speak with myself as an extension to right speech practice

231
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:06,960
and the way you nikki speak has been very inspiring thank you ah thank you for that reflection thank

232
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:14,640
you so much and it's inspiring to me that you're inspired we inspire each other it's it's we keep giving these gifts to

233
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:20,240
each other and yes the way we speak to ourselves definitely our inner speech

234
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:27,359
as um as an extension of right speech sometimes we we may speak to ourselves the way we

235
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:34,720
will never speak to others good heavens you know it so what if we treated ourselves as a

236
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:40,240
beloved other as this being whom we are entrusted

237
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:47,839
whose care we are entrusted with it was a complicated construction this beloved other whom we are entrusted

238
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:55,119
with his or her or their care okay maybe that made more sense anyway so dear ones

239
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:01,440
let's turn our practic our our attention um into practicing in small groups and

240
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:08,319
here's the invitation for tonight um you're welcome to well let's start with 15 seconds of silent meta

241
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:15,280
as as always for ourselves and each other and then um

242
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:21,920
let's if if you like to you can share a story of how your how you have changed something

243
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:27,119
about you the way you show up for yourself or others something something has

244
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:33,440
shifted and changed into some situation that was really difficult or people were difficult perhaps now

245
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:41,040
through a practice of meta something has shifted for you so um inspired by these

246
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:47,440
sharings on the on the um google groups the notes you can share that if you wish

258
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:01,520
anthony please thank you nikki um yeah just something

259
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:08,079
that came up in the small groups is we were talking about how we uh noticed our

260
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:14,319
progress you know through the practice and uh one thing that i noticed about myself

261
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:21,040
and it's similar to what the other two were saying is that uh it's hard to pinpoint you know the

262
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:26,720
actual we just see the growth and i kind of thought came into my mind it's kind of

263
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:32,640
like uh you know getting doing a goal for weight loss or

264
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:39,359
maybe a musical instrument you know you don't see the actual the growth you know it's because it's such a long process

265
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:47,359
but uh you you do feel it you know you do feel it yeah yeah exactly it's it's

266
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:54,400
like any other practice you know practicing musical instrument it's like yes over time it doesn't

267
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:00,240
happen overnight but over time definitely progress progress happens and

268
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:05,760
in some ways you don't evaluate your practice like the stock market like one day okay you

269
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,960
might you know might not be feeling well or grumpy it's like oh i'm a failure i can't practice there are

270
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:17,440
always you know yeah months years of menta no no no look at it over the long term

271
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:23,920
over the long term so yes that's very wise exactly

272
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:30,319
um thank you anthony thank you for that reflection

273
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:39,119
[Laughter] one reflection comes in and we need a before and after picture

274
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:45,040
after pictures yes before and after pictures i love that that's exactly right

275
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:52,400
before meta after method i love it so dear ones it is

276
00:49:52,400 --> 00:50:01,200
7 p.m pacific time we've come to the end of our time together and i thank you all for showing up for

277
