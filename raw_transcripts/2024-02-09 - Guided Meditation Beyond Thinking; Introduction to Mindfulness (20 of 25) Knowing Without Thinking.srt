1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,480
hello and

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,719
welcome so this week

3
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,920
the instructions have been offered on mindfulness of

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:26,519
thinking and uh hopefully it hasn't been too complicated the idea always is to try to

5
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:33,239
keep the instruction simple and that's the intention today as

6
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:39,719
well but it might what I'm what instructions I give might not be

7
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:46,920
understandable so then don't worry yourself about it don't try to force yourself to do it or think that you're

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,199
supposed to do it

9
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:58,920
and the mindfulness of thinking is

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,720
valuable and what can be also helpful is not to

11
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:13,520
be too involved or too focus on thinking there are people who identify

12
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,680
them with their themselves with their thinking they are their thinking their thinking is them there's no distinction

13
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,560
between the two and so and some people being aware

14
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:33,360
and be and thinking are also indistinguishable and uh there's a big overlap between

15
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,920
mindfulness and thinking but it doesn't have to be exactly the

16
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:45,159
same and so today I'd like to emphasize that which is not

17
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:51,640
thinking and uh and uh of course of many things which are not thinking but in

18
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,759
relationship to thinking there are two areas that I'd

19
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:03,079
like to point out and and that is that um beyond the

20
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:10,200
edges of thinking or outside the domain of thinking we can sense and feel and

21
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,519
experiences we can hear but we don't have to think we don't have to have

22
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:22,959
discursive thinking we don't have to have words or images in response we can have Body

23
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,480
Sensations and we don't have to be involved in it and be thinking about it

24
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,800
and we don't don't have to be identifying what it is with thoughts or

25
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,080
images the sensations you just be there maybe

26
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,959
unidentified just uh something in the field of awareness that doesn't get any more attention than

27
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,720
that and the question is how do we how do we experience things

28
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,120
directly without centering ourselves in the world

29
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:04,200
of thinking without it being the only lens by which

30
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:10,879
we're aware so what is it what in our experience is not

31
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:17,080
thinking and so even when we're thinking what is it that's not thinking here and

32
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:23,159
some of the things I've taught this week um The Body Sensations connected to

33
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:28,439
thinking they're not the thinking in terms of the words or their images or the

34
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:34,599
ideas it's Sensations the emotions themselves in

35
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:41,920
some ways don't have to be wetted to stories and thoughts and Analysis and

36
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,560
judgment and all kinds of ways which we think they can be there without the

37
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,680
thoughts or we can know them without thinking thinking might still occur but

38
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,680
they're known free of thinking just kind of in and of

39
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:07,239
themselves so this idea of being able to change lenses or shift gears or Orient

40
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:13,079
ourselves to our experience so we're not experiencing it through the lens of thinking through

41
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:21,400
the and um thinking might Reed to the background it might be there as a gentle support it might be there sometimes

42
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,960
helpful in a helpful way sometimes not but we're not oriented to it we're not

43
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:33,000
identified with it so that's that's one thing the other

44
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,960
thing is um there is knowing we can know we can know a lot of

45
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,560
things without words without uh words or

46
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:55,039
images that inform us what we know so there's I call it sub vo

47
00:04:55,039 --> 00:05:02,479
subvocal knowing knowing that's below the level of of words Concepts usual

48
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,440
Concepts and in some ways that operates all the time because there's so much that we

49
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:16,479
take in in the world just to navigate the world walk around in the world that we know without it being actively known

50
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,960
without being a vocalized knowing or without an act of identification it

51
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,000
still known in some deeper place in the mind so for

52
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,199
example many of you go through a door or throughout the day open and closed

53
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:40,479
doors and you might be thinking about other things you might be involved you might be busy with things and there's

54
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,199
no thinking oh that's a door that's the handle I have to touch it all that

55
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:52,639
happens uh little bit on automatic pilot there's a knowing of the door knowing where the door is where the door handle

56
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,120
is but it's it's uh I like to call it

57
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,880
preverbal so there's preverbal knowing that's enough to navigate and open the

58
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,080
door it doesn't have to rise up into the verbal place in the

59
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:17,599
mind so sometimes when we do mindfulness practice we can rest in that preverbal

60
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,599
knowing and then finally this is where maybe gets

61
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:31,800
complicated is there can be preverbal knowing of that which

62
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,039
is not thinking the experiences we have that

63
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:44,080
are not in their origination their

64
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:50,160
arising involve thinking preverbal

65
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,759
knowing and this is a place of quiet of Silence that allows for some deeper

66
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:04,199
knowing a source from deep within that will always keep us in the present

67
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:09,240
moment that's where this

68
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,199
lives so assuming a meditation

69
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,879
posture and gently closing your

70
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:32,919
eyes and Orient yourself Orient yourself now to whatever it might be within

71
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:37,960
you where there's a quiet or a

72
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,560
silence other parts of you might be busy and loud with

73
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:50,440
thoughts there might be agitation in the body but see if you can find where

74
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:58,319
somewhere deep within somewhere within where there's a sense of stability and

75
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,720
Stillness maybe even a

76
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:16,720
silence and as you exhale to relax your body your

77
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,639
mind relax into that place of

78
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:32,959
silence as you inhale perhaps the inhale

79
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:40,518
begins in that place of quiet or calm or Stillness

80
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:45,519
within relaxing back to it on the

81
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
exhale

82
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:36,160
for and then seeing

83
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,040
if the awareness of the present

84
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:53,160
moment maybe a preverbal knowing can arise from this place of

85
00:09:53,160 --> 00:10:01,120
quiet Within

86
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,519
maybe as the inhale arises from that place and exhale returns to

87
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:21,839
it so the knowing the awareness the preverbal and quiet

88
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,040
knowing that might be there side by side with verbal

89
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,519
knowing but Orient yourself to the preverbal the silent

90
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,079
knowing knowing without words or

91
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,680
images and let that knowing arise with the

92
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:52,160
inhale return with the exhale to that place of

93
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
quiet

94
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
for

95
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
for

96
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
for

97
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
for

98
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
for

99
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
for

100
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
for

101
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
for

102
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
for

103
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
for

104
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:22,120
what is the nature of awareness in between your

105
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:29,320
thoughts when you don't use thoughts to answer the question

106
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:34,559
the question how are you aware between your

107
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,840
thoughts between the end of one and the beginning of the

108
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
next

109
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,320
how are you aware be beyond the edges of thoughts

110
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
for

111
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
for

112
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
for

113
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
for

114
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
for

115
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:30,039
and how do you know

116
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,278
when your knowing is without

117
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:47,600
thoughts without

118
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
thinking

119
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,600
The preverbal

120
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:29,720
Knowing arising from a silent peace peaceful

121
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,360
silence

122
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
Within

123
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
for

124
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
for

125
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
for

126
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
for

127
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,200
and then as we come to the end of this

128
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:16,880
sitting maybe you can appreciate that the full range of how we

129
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:24,840
can know full spectrum of being aware and both with thoughts

130
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:31,398
without thoughts with our body and our

131
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,640
motions the ability to be

132
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:43,278
present and receptive for all of it present

133
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:49,320
in with all of it suffusing

134
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:55,398
us for that to happen it helps to feel

135
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,720
safe if we don't feel safe the mind will

136
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:08,200
naturally Orient itself in such a way to focus on how to be

137
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,278
safe what to be concerned

138
00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:21,600
about and for a few moments in meditation maybe we can

139
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:32,080
trust feeling safe enough to not focus on anything in

140
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:38,520
particular but rather to have the full capacity for

141
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:47,120
awareness to flow through US Open receptive to

142
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
everything

143
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:10,360
and even if we don't feel fully safe just feeling somewhat safe to

144
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:17,840
appreciate the value of it value of feeling safe and

145
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:26,039
safety to come to the end of this sitting and become interested in being

146
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:32,840
safe for others to support others so they can be them

147
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:41,520
fully themselves by being a safe

148
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:51,679
person What a Wonderful World it would be if more people felt

149
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:58,640
safe in their homes in their communities their work

150
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:07,279
in this world may we contribute to

151
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:13,200
safety may we support it and create and make

152
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:19,519
the spreading of safety be

153
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:29,440
contagious May our way of being safe Inspire others

154
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:39,120
may all beings be happy may all beings be

155
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:48,880
safe may all beings be peaceful and may all beings be

156
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,399
free

157
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:06,670
[Music]

158
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:17,729
[Music]

159
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:20,760
thank

160
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
you

161
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,919
so hello for this fifth uh talk on mindfulness of

162
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:28,240
thinking and um one of the benefits that I've received from my

163
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:35,440
meditation practice and especially from mindfulness practice and

164
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:42,279
um is that I have a friendly relationship with my thinking my thinking and I get along

165
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:47,320
just fine and sometimes I will I will often

166
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:54,519
know what I'm thinking about and if that doesn't seem to be the

167
00:30:54,519 --> 00:31:02,159
important thing or the valuable thing or the beneficial thing to be thinking about uh it's relatively easy for me to

168
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:08,080
change how I think and um so I've so in that way it's

169
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:14,840
easier to be friends with my thinking because um I'm not obsessed oppressed by

170
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:20,919
them I'm not they're not forcing themselves on me or I don't live under their

171
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:26,600
weight and I'm friendly with them and I respect them and give time for my

172
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:33,399
thoughts sometimes I when I when I exercise or go for walks in the Hills I give my

173
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:38,679
thoughts free reign just completely let them think whatever they want to think

174
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:44,240
and in a way that I don't in meditation because then I'm kind of just sitting and being present and and that full

175
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:52,159
presence to experience means I'm not kind of traveling along with the thoughts and being the thoughts but to

176
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:58,039
give freedom to thinking in when I exercise or or when I go for

177
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:03,159
hikes uh it's fascinating because it shows me sometimes you know something

178
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:08,440
what's going on for me or what's what I'm really concerned about or it it

179
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:13,960
shows me some some deeper place of some deeper kind of unfolding that might be

180
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:20,200
going on and thinking about something reflecting on something so so I give

181
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:26,639
myself time in my days to give kind of unfettered freedom to my thinking to

182
00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:33,159
think as wishes and uh and then I practice with that whatever that might be or try to

183
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:39,960
become wise about it or if necessary and then other times where I

184
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:45,799
don't do that not because I'm aversive to thinking but because there's a better

185
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:52,720
game in town there's more interesting things to do than to be thinking a lot and that's to be aware to be present and

186
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,559
centered in the present moment and to just be aware of what's happening at has things

187
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:04,320
unfold and um now if thinking about things is what

188
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:10,559
awareness is and uh some people confuse mindfulness with thoughtfulness where

189
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:16,960
we're kind of tracking and thinking about what's happening as it's happening where thinking is a verbal commentary

190
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:23,440
verbal recognition or through images and all that then uh that certainly can be

191
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:30,600
valuable but we might be limiting ourselves from the deep deeper satisfaction of being centered not in

192
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:37,240
the head not in the usual place where discursive thoughts happen the usual place where reactivity to the world

193
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:42,519
happens the usual place where fear arises from but we're centered from some

194
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:50,799
deeper source of knowing which is has a quiet to it has a peacefulness to it and

195
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:55,960
sometimes it can feel like it's a knowing without thoughts or maybe it's

196
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:02,840
knowing which is accompanied by very simple thoughts thoughts of recognition thoughts of knowing thoughts of

197
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:09,919
questions you know what is this I feel you know a ache someplace in my body and

198
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:15,240
there's a very simple thought what is this let's bring attention to it what

199
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:21,200
would be like to be aware of it really close and intimate what would be like to

200
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:27,760
not be so close into it but kind of observe it from a distance so very simple kind of

201
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:35,240
that uh kind of questioning contemplating that comes from some place that's deep within or a place that's a

202
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:40,638
little bit feels more at home from within than where reactivity comes

203
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:46,480
from and um and part of the advantage of this is that we learn not to identify

204
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:53,158
with our thoughts we learn not to be our thinking and for many people as I said

205
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:58,760
um they who who they think they are is inseparable from their thought thoughts if they weren't thinking they would feel

206
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:04,160
they didn't exist and uh but actually we can exist

207
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:10,440
brilliantly without being centered in our thoughts and um and

208
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:16,079
thinking so part of mindfulness of thinking is not just to be mindful of

209
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,640
thinking itself but to be mindful of the absence of thinking and that could be

210
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:27,720
when the thinking mind gets like the discursive thinking mind the storytelling mind gets really quiet the

211
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:34,839
mind that goes on and on that's in loops and spins around gets really quiet you can feel the quiet the silence and the

212
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:41,640
that part of the mind while there still might be some rudimentary thoughts of recognition of questioning what is this

213
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:47,000
and how should I be with this but those thoughts are very

214
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:55,520
gentle and uh so that there's a quieting of mind and um and so what is that quieting

215
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:01,839
the Mind feel like what is it that's not thinking and what is it the awareness

216
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:07,160
which arises that is not centered on thinking and this is where mindfulness

217
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:13,319
of the body and mindful Sensations is so helpful because uh the sensations in and

218
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:18,480
of themselves are not a thought and but they do belong to a kind

219
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:24,000
of a deeper uh process of feeling sensing

220
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:30,760
knowing that's not centered in thinking so part of mindfulness of

221
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:37,800
thinking is being aware of that which is not thinking um to come to the end of a

222
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:43,880
thought and then what is it that's there before the next thought

223
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:53,119
arises when you uh so I'll ask a question of you and how would you answer

224
00:36:53,119 --> 00:37:00,800
this question if you didn't use words or thoughts to explain it to describe it to answer

225
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,960
it and the question is who are

226
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:12,119
you who are you if you don't use thoughts to answer the

227
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:19,839
question so there might be many responses to this but but uh sometimes we realize

228
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:26,960
that something different way of being being alive if we don't use the usual

229
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:34,359
Concepts ideas you know I'm such this person I'm this kind of person I'm this kind of person uh as the

230
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:41,240
answer those kinds of that if that drops away how do we experience ourselves how

231
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:46,319
we experience life uh that is in a fuller

232
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:51,400
somatic uh experiential way that is not

233
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:57,760
um uh always through the filter of thoughts and I like in this

234
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:05,119
to um uh being finished with the

235
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:12,240
menu and no longer studying the menu but actually eating the

236
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:18,359
food if we're always living in the menu or living in the instruction manual or

237
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:24,400
living in the screenplay then uh we're not really

238
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,400
living Our Lives and too much time living in our thoughts is more like reading the

239
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:37,480
menu and so to not to learn how to be mindful of thinking in such a way that

240
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:43,079
we start becoming free from being stuck in thoughts we become free from

241
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:50,480
identifying ourselves strongly with what thinking says to us that we learn to be

242
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:57,319
very respectful of thoughts we can become friends of our thinking we don't have to be opposed to it but we're not

243
00:38:57,319 --> 00:39:04,720
caught in its web we're not caught in its up in it so then I'll end with

244
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:13,800
a uh an image metaphor that I like to use when I teach this mindfulness of

245
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:21,440
thinking so imagine that you've gone for a nice walk it's a nice day you're walking in a park it's a safe and

246
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:28,800
comfortable place and you stop uh By The River and you lean against a tree of beautiful

247
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,520
shade it's a pece very peaceful and pastoral and you're very content and you

248
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:40,200
have a nice little snack maybe lunch and you're sitting there and you're just

249
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:45,880
enjoying the water flowing down and some people can be almost pulled into the

250
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,960
endless streaming of water as keeps something very relaxing and just

251
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:58,319
watching the water flow and flow and gentle little waves in the river coming and going and it's all nice and it's

252
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:04,680
nice to be alive it's not to be present the hikes been good you feel here

253
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:10,960
content and then lo and behold coming down the river is a

254
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:21,319
Showboat with music and dancing and games and casino and great food and and

255
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:26,839
attractive people and the next thing you know you've been you're on that boat

256
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:32,920
you've been on that boat for a few days and and you kind of wa how did I

257
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:38,720
get here I was having such a nice contented time on the riverbank and how did how did this

258
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:45,760
happen well you get off the boat and you finally make your way to back up to where the tree is and once again you're

259
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,640
there very content and happy watching the river nothing's needed no one to be

260
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:57,640
no one to become no one to get no one to understand nothing to understand just

261
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:03,280
there and then down comes another boat this time it's a war

262
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:10,079
booat fighting the battle fighting the good war and you see it but then the next

263
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:16,680
thing you know you're on the boat for hours fighting the war you don't even know what war you're fighting but you're

264
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:23,160
there Manning the guns and directing the show and and then you kind of kind of

265
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:30,200
come to and say wait a minute what am I do how did I get get there what's going on you get off the war booat you come

266
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:35,720
back up to your tree you sit there next thing you know there's a

267
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:42,800
decrepit old raft that's barely alive barely floating just limping along

268
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:48,680
floating down the river all half drowned it just seems so poor and pathetic and

269
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:54,079
and you feel sorry for it and as soon as you feel sorry for it you find yourself

270
00:41:54,079 --> 00:42:00,720
some hours later the kind kind of somehow managing to sit on top of

271
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:06,720
that raft and navigating down the river and you wonder how did I get on this

272
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:12,040
raft and then you make your way back to the to the

273
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:18,839
tree and the next boat that comes down the river you lean against the tree take

274
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:24,440
a deep breath relax and you just watch it go down and

275
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:30,480
pass and other boats come you watch them go past you don't have to get

276
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,680
on so this is the analogy for thinking all kinds of thoughts can come along all

277
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:41,160
kinds of boats do you get on the boat and even don't even know you're on it fighting

278
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:47,359
the good War having the great fantasy um maybe feeling very sorry for

279
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:55,760
yourself in some way and all those things might be needed sometimes in life but

280
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:01,079
chances are they're not needed as much as all the boats we get on so

281
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:07,200
mindfulness is teaching us to stay present on the shore the solid safe

282
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,720
Shore and just watch the stream the flow of life in

283
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,720
a in a freeing way without getting

284
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:26,359
on so um thank you so I hope this week on thinking has been useful so next next

285
00:43:26,359 --> 00:43:31,680
week I'm going to the retreat center IRC Insight retreat center for a week to

286
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:38,839
teach Retreat and uh don Neal will come and um teach here on YouTube next for

287
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:45,200
the next weeks and she's aware of what I've been teaching these weeks on the instructions in mindfulness so she'll

288
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:51,280
follow up in some way this this mindfulness world is a wide world so she'll follow up with maybe further

289
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:59,839
instructions or that uh you know can build on what I'm what I did these time times and then I'll come back in a week

290
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:06,599
and a week from Monday and then um uh I will I'll do the same I'm thinking well

291
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:11,800
I was going to have this be a five-week series but maybe there's more instructions to give and more way of

292
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:17,200
staying close to the basics that would be useful for for all of

293
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:22,280
us so um thank you very much and

294
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:28,040
um and um I'm sure you'll enjoy Dawn and I look

295
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:36,000
forward to coming back in a week
