3
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,699
um yeah welcome to the the folks uh out there and

4
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:34,200
we'll have the the usual form I'll lightly guide us uh until the top of the

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,960
hour and then offer a talk and maybe we have time for some dialogue we'll see

6
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:48,300
and um yeah so please uh settle settle into a

7
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,520
posture that feels sustainable

8
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,939
foreign

9
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,660
just making your mind a welcoming environment for

10
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:31,940
foreign people trickling in

11
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:46,819
welcoming environment for the intensity of having a body

12
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,220
maybe exploring ways of breathing

13
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,959
that help you arrive

14
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,799
maybe it's a deeper Fuller breath that reaches into the

15
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,220
belly

16
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:30,020
and just ever so gently Smooths out the the energy of body mind

17
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:49,100
there's also often a sense

18
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:58,220
as the Winds of phenomena blow through the sensations of our body of affect

19
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,579
of sound thought

20
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:12,959
it's almost as if our bracing against phenomena

21
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:20,959
is it an attempt to protect some kernel of our being the center point

22
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,279
of self

23
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:38,959
sense that something inside of us needs protection

24
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,279
from phenomena

25
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,339
but our practice

26
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:03,440
to let the Winds of experience blow

27
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:16,399
and trusting that there's nothing inside that will be blown over

28
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:35,779
it's nothing more than Pleasant and unpleasant

29
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,879
oh

30
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:17,180
no Winds of grasping and aversion

31
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,600
an opportunity we Sense on the horizon

32
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,759
the unpleasantness of sound or sensation

33
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,360
we let those winds blow too

34
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:54,620
uh held in the the openness of awareness

35
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,459
foreign

36
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:40,940
the Dharma never asked us to pretend

37
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:50,720
to pretend we like what we dislike or a neutral about what we like

38
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,540
asked us simply

39
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:16,260
foreign s and

40
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,298
the openness of awareness

41
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,039
thank you

42
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:36,320
foreign

43
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,440
foreign

44
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:06,659
almost a sense of our heart being massaged

45
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:14,960
by the collacers forces of suffering

46
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,000
greed and aversion

47
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:34,080
in the sense that something is being softened in the the openness of

48
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,860
this awareness

49
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,720
foreign

50
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,920
foreign

51
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:16,039
so uh so welcome

52
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:19,460
um

53
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:30,960
so I I don't usually do talks on lists

54
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:37,400
um sort of because I I like how the lists

55
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:44,339
interact with each other or the facets of the list interact with each other

56
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:50,820
but um today a talk on a list yeah

57
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:56,220
and um it's almost like we we can get

58
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:04,380
um we almost get too familiar with the list over time I mean when we're new it's

59
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:11,520
different but as we practice over years we sometimes get so familiar with

60
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:20,780
Buddhist list that we almost lose track of their Brilliance and um

61
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:26,820
and I was was uh talking to a friend a colleague of mine

62
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:34,680
who said something like that she she just basically assiduously followed

63
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:41,820
the Eightfold Path deep into her practice you know the

64
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:47,700
years into practice just assiduously followed that it tried

65
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:54,000
to implement that in all spheres of her life and it changed everything yeah and

66
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:02,099
it's like not that shouldn't have shocked me kind of right but there was something about

67
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:09,960
um understanding her mind the potency of her mind and then just to say like yeah these kind of

68
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:15,839
um this this list yeah meant everything

69
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:23,000
and so uh in our own practice we apply these uh we we pick up these these

70
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,960
themes these teachings at greater depth and nuance and

71
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:36,900
they come to me and more and more to us over time and what we hear in a list the

72
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:43,680
first time we hear it is so different from the 100th time we here at

73
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,780
there's really a different list

74
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:56,700
the the Dharma generally revolves around what's to be let go what's to be

75
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:04,800
released and the basic architecture of the the view is that in a sense suffering is our

76
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:12,660
only problem yeah that to relinquish suffering

77
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:21,300
is not a trivial thing and in its wake leaves just many species of goodness

78
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:27,060
it's not that we let go of suffering and then we have to create some other kind

79
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:34,440
of positivity yeah um and so quite naturally the the

80
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:42,119
attention goes to the untangling deconstruction of the the

81
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:49,380
sources of suffering um but then what what is actively

82
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:55,460
cultivated what species of wholesomeness are actively cultivated

83
00:40:55,460 --> 00:41:00,720
and one of those those

84
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:09,240
lists what's actively cultivated the the goodness that helps us keep going

85
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:15,119
the sometimes celebrate as a kind of like the anti-hindrances

86
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:24,119
the seven factors of Awakening and so the Buddha says I do not even see

87
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:31,200
even one thing that when developed and cultivated leads to the abandoning of things that

88
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:37,640
Fetter so effectively as this the seven factors of enlightenment

89
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:47,700
the seven factors are both a kind of um the path and the fruit

90
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:56,420
it's often how these teachings are they are both the path and the fruit the practice and the culmination

91
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:01,859
the um the work that we do

92
00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:09,540
and the fruit that is Harvest there's a story of the Buddha somewhere

93
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:16,140
in the sutas being sick at night and asking

94
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:21,540
one of his disciples to almost like as a

95
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:27,839
kind of the feeling that I had of like a kind of bedtime story yeah

96
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:34,140
of um o o kunda

97
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:39,780
bring to mind the seven factors of Enlightenment bring you know speak them

98
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:47,420
to me in that state of sickness at night

99
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:56,640
in you know our practice um in meetings practice discussions

100
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:02,160
interviews on Retreat for example um

101
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:07,859
so much of the time there's some form of suffering that's being some people are

102
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:13,140
seeking consultation on one way or another but what happens when they're not

103
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:18,660
yeah what does the teacher do when there's

104
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:24,900
no report of of uh active course suffering

105
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:36,119
mostly we just say keep going yeah um but sometimes sometimes we say uh

106
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:43,380
let us examine you know like uh the these seven factors to see the relative

107
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:48,420
balance of the energizing side of practice and the tranquilizing side of

108
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:54,720
practice uh because a lot of this path is the kind of uh

109
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:03,420
it's a kind of dialectic between um between different forces a lot of this

110
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:08,760
practice is a dialectic between the absence of suffering and the emergence

111
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:17,420
of new currents of suffering sometimes deeper layers currents of suffering

112
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:24,420
and so um this these um

113
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:31,859
states are the as we get more and more free the

114
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:40,079
Mind states are increasingly characterized by a kind of some balance of these seven factors of

115
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:46,220
of uh mindfulness as a kind of balancing point

116
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:51,540
of the energizing and tranquilizing factors

117
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:59,000
of investigation energy effort

118
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:06,079
intense Joy rapture on the energizing side and Tranquility

119
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:15,839
samadhi the unification of mind and and Equanimity on the the tranquilizing side

120
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:23,460
and um said something like the the first the

121
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:29,400
first it said something like um mindfulness

122
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:35,520
investigation energetic Vigor effort

123
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:41,280
these are the causes and every the others are the the effects yeah which is

124
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:48,000
an interesting formulation they have complex relationships with each other

125
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,900
and so um in a way

126
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:58,940
we uh even though

127
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:08,060
the the characterization of the Tranquility fact decide as being the effects yeah not something we do

128
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:16,079
we sort of have to begin you know with a little bit of Tranquility otherwise

129
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:22,260
um there's no room to digest the impermanent the the impermanence and the

130
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:27,540
imperfection of experience if there's no tranquility

131
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:35,400
yet to try to let go to try to open to try to soften all of these things uh are

132
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:41,660
very difficult to do in the absence of some modicum of Tranquility

133
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:47,760
and so there there's um a lot of relations between these

134
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,700
different facets in our in our practice

135
00:46:53,819 --> 00:47:02,339
um so mindfulness mindfulness is uh

136
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:09,780
it's a word that's been used in so many ways one of my mentors said we just have to throw it out you know

137
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:16,099
it's just been so it's like a pocket into which so many things have been put

138
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:22,619
that the word has sort of lost all meaning Integrity something like this

139
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:27,780
and sometimes in fact the way mindfulness is used

140
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:34,740
is a kind of umbrella term for the seven factors yeah if you actually hear the

141
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:42,240
way it's used in popular culture it's actually it's not Sati in the narrow kind of

142
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:48,359
sense a lot of other beautiful qualities are smuggled under in the back door kind

143
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:57,000
of to this this umbrella term of mindfulness and I'm not blaming the wonderful John

144
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,720
cab it's in for this but John cabotzin did say this yeah

145
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:09,420
yeah this is 2000 2011.

146
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:14,520
um said mindfulness-based stress reduction which which uh he is the

147
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:19,619
developed this eight week program that's been a tremendous blessing to many

148
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:26,760
people and my life no doubt is a function of the kind of efforts uh his

149
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:34,500
efforts and many others um said mindfulness-based stress reduction was developed as one of POS of

150
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:40,619
a possibly infinite number of skillful means for bringing the Dharma into mainstream settings

151
00:48:40,619 --> 00:48:48,839
it has never been about mbsr for its own sake it's always been about the m and the m is a very big m

152
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:54,780
we use the word mindfulness intentionally as an umbrella term to describe our work and to link it

153
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:59,880
explicitly with what I've always considered to be a universal Dharma that

154
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:06,660
is co-extensive if not identical with the teachings of the Buddha the Buddha

155
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:12,318
Dharma um

156
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:20,400
that we do need a word we do need a word to

157
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:26,040
try to convey the depth and the beauty the richness of the Dharma

158
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:31,859
and in this case mindfulness was chosen yeah

159
00:49:31,859 --> 00:49:37,319
and um and there are consequences there are

160
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:44,280
definitional consequences to that decision yeah and so what do we mean when we say

161
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:51,720
mindfulness we can talk about it in these sort of

162
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:58,560
more pared down ways or more Grand ways um and

163
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:03,720
in a sense to for mindfulness to

164
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:08,760
to really it's never been described as

165
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:15,240
a single it's always conjoined with other factors yeah in the way that a big

166
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:22,140
umbrella term kind of implies and so I

167
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:27,300
do actually link mindfulness with with uh

168
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:35,579
the kind of um an awareness that lets go

169
00:50:35,579 --> 00:50:41,819
an awareness that is just already conjoined with other factors

170
00:50:41,819 --> 00:50:47,420
an awareness that um is

171
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:56,400
aware of the movements of suffering of the movement of greed of an aversion

172
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:03,480
um but is uncompelled by them that sense of like I was alluding to

173
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:12,000
this in the sit sense that the the awareness is a little bit bigger

174
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,119
than the forces of suffering and that when awareness is present no

175
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:24,200
matter what suffering is there something else is also true

176
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:31,760
and it's a subtle move this gesture of awareness but it's radical

177
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:39,119
and sometimes it just just uh just that that sense of knowing

178
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:44,220
suffering in the clarity and the openness of

179
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:49,680
awareness does not erase all of the unpleasantness

180
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:55,319
or something but it's enough that our life all of a sudden feels quite

181
00:51:55,319 --> 00:52:02,660
different than it did one moment ago when we were fully identified with the

182
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:06,619
phenomena of suffering

183
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:17,240
and so we usually talk about mindfulness as a kind of

184
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:22,920
what rescues us from our habits particularly the bad habits yeah the

185
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:33,300
sense of that there's without some metacognitive awareness we are just living in obedience to our

186
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:39,420
habits and um that's fair enough

187
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:44,660
but um mindfulness also

188
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:50,099
becomes a habit and helps us develop good habits

189
00:52:50,099 --> 00:52:58,440
and this sense of that we have often early in practice of like okay I'm gonna leave here and I'm gonna go have my day

190
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:03,720
and I've got to be mindful I gotta remember

191
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:09,960
that's not that's not how it feels I don't think as we continue practicing

192
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:18,000
it's not this sense of mindfulness is this this um this kind of thing we like the on the

193
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:25,099
grocery list like I have to remember carrots you know

194
00:53:25,099 --> 00:53:31,460
and you know when you kind of do a bad shop you sort of like

195
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:37,500
get discombobulated or whatever I can kind of feel it at the register like I

196
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:42,900
just I messed up you know I'm forgetting a

197
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:48,000
lot you know like and and we're gonna have this sense of like oh yeah I could just keep forgetting the mindfulness or

198
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:54,540
something like this and it's okay to try to motivate like explicit cognitive

199
00:53:54,540 --> 00:54:00,900
control or something but to some extent what we are actually training in is the

200
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:07,440
elevating the trait level of mindfulness the mindfulness that exists in the way a

201
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:14,220
habit exists yeah that we actually don't have to remember

202
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:20,819
in the same way that we're more mindful when we're not trying to be mindful

203
00:54:20,819 --> 00:54:30,540
and that's important because we'll never be able to remember enough consciously

204
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:42,500
[Music] um

205
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:51,480
investigation which is of course enabled by

206
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:57,559
mindfulness and investigation

207
00:54:57,559 --> 00:55:02,819
investigation to me not not about um

208
00:55:02,819 --> 00:55:09,240
some X kind of um top-down cognitively trying to figure

209
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:15,420
something out trying to figure out like sometimes investigation and rumination

210
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:21,660
the line is thin you know like how did I get here

211
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:27,180
why do I feel this way where am I going and those questions can kind of like

212
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:33,079
masquerade as deep existential inquiries but there actually have a kind of

213
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:39,420
ruminative obsessive feel to them and um

214
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:45,359
an investigation is not kind of loosely looking for some

215
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:52,680
answer out of The Ether or something it's a kind of sustained attention to

216
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:59,280
the the unfolding of experience the connection between moments

217
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:04,319
and um I Associated a lot with curiosity which

218
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:10,680
is really kind of the lifeblood of this practice I don't know where that where if it's in

219
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:18,119
a list somewhere and you know but I you know investigation is like very

220
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:23,280
closely linked to curiosity and the truth is there's no cure for a lack of

221
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:31,079
curiosity and there's nothing a teacher can say to keep you engaged unless you find

222
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:38,400
something that you get interested in like I want to understand this

223
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:45,660
I want to know why I keep doing this I want to know

224
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:53,460
um some facet of my mind

225
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:58,559
I want to understand something and

226
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:04,200
in a sense when there's curiosity present because it's so agendaless it's

227
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:12,020
not like I want to get happier even it's like a very deeply trustworthy

228
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:20,400
intention for animating practice I want to understand more and there's a

229
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,900
kind of patience in it

230
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:31,500
and there's um a sense of

231
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:38,040
it's not even the point to get to some answer there's like no Final Answer

232
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:44,220
there's just deepening and refining and nuance and and more

233
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:52,020
curiosity and we find Our Kind of cruising altitude in our autobiographical story

234
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:59,540
of who we are of what we are of what the path is of where we're going of What happiness is

235
00:57:59,579 --> 00:58:06,720
and then that rug will be pulled out before too long hopefully

236
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:14,460
yeah and that ignites a kind of new sense of curiosity a new round where

237
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:20,220
we're no longer satisfied with the stories we've been

238
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:23,359
feeding ourselves

239
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:32,040
the somewhere the Buddha says that we have four options when in pain

240
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:38,640
blame self blame others despair or investigate

241
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:46,160
yeah that's not a hard multiple choice question you know

242
00:58:48,299 --> 00:58:55,319
it's like okay what is happening here and we do develop a kind of

243
00:58:55,319 --> 00:59:01,319
uh Faith really in the looking of faith

244
00:59:01,319 --> 00:59:08,540
not that everything's okay or anything like that but a faith that

245
00:59:08,819 --> 00:59:15,420
uh maybe we just say a faith in wisdom

246
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:20,640
faith in love a faith that the more deeply we look

247
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:25,920
the more Dharma we will find the more the more the Deep more deeply we look

248
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:32,180
the more reason there will be to uh to love

249
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:39,180
and so we're not so afraid of what we'll find yeah

250
00:59:45,059 --> 00:59:47,780
hmm

251
00:59:51,720 --> 01:00:00,299
energy very uh this is among the most emphasized

252
01:00:00,299 --> 01:00:07,559
themes in the suttas and um I think because this path is against the

253
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:12,839
stream uh genuinely against the street in some ways it's with the stream in

254
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:20,640
other ways it's against the stream and it's against the stream in the sense that Neurosis is

255
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:27,359
often the path of least resistance yeah like my neurosis

256
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:34,980
is just like so happily floating down a stream you know strong current at my

257
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:40,020
back you know like Gill has the in some of the way he talks about Satya batana I

258
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:45,980
think I picked I remember slides from Gill where it's somebody coasting down

259
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:51,599
the water just relax the effortless of mindfulness that's not what I'm talking

260
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:59,059
about I'm talking about the the stream of neurosis where it takes zero energy

261
01:00:59,059 --> 01:01:05,940
for me to act it out right and we all know those moments where it's like

262
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:13,859
for sure like the easiest thing to do right now the absolute easiest thing to

263
01:01:13,859 --> 01:01:21,299
do is to express the forces of suffering and my own bad habits you know

264
01:01:21,299 --> 01:01:23,960
right

265
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:36,299
so what are we gonna do yeah um what are we gonna do we're going to

266
01:01:36,299 --> 01:01:42,000
mobilize energy effort

267
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:48,240
sometimes not always sometimes we really are in the Stream of goodness and the

268
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:56,160
goodness and the awareness and everything feels effortless but that's often a function of Prior

269
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:03,559
effort yeah and so we Marshal our energy because

270
01:02:03,559 --> 01:02:08,640
growth is hard it takes energy you know it's like

271
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:15,260
when kids going through a growth spurt and they have to like really rest or something it's like that

272
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:18,558
and um

273
01:02:22,859 --> 01:02:29,280
so we're we Marshal some effort in order not to

274
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:35,059
obey the dictates of greed hatred and delusion

275
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:43,079
and um this path is a

276
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:50,640
it's a renunciate path in the sense that it is not a something for nothing path

277
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:56,540
and sometimes we get the sense that just because

278
01:02:56,780 --> 01:03:04,680
the awareness is is so powerful and that the this most simple gesture of it can

279
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:10,940
sometimes bring incredible relief we get the sense that maybe maybe

280
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:17,640
if I'm making effort I must be doing it wrong it is we have some sense that the

281
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:23,819
lure of something for nothing you know is deep in US

282
01:03:23,819 --> 01:03:30,780
but um but it's not we are we're not giving up things for no reason

283
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:39,440
we're giving up it's lesser forms of pleasure for deeper forms of satiation

284
01:03:45,059 --> 01:03:50,720
um and uh and

285
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:57,540
uh Rapture Rapture a Rapture born of letting go

286
01:03:57,540 --> 01:04:02,180
doing really badly on time here

287
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:21,660
yeah sometimes sometimes this is this is translated as

288
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:26,940
um as Joy but it's sort of more and we want

289
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:35,160
to make the definition accessible but it's more energetic than the more effervescent than that more compelling a

290
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:41,839
kind of like just the the attention just sucked into the flow of this

291
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:46,980
and um because it's so normally our thoughts are the most prominent thing

292
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:54,000
and experience by far by far but

293
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,940
that can change and a sense of um of

294
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:05,819
um PT of rapture that becomes

295
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:12,359
more compelling than anything else and this usually experience usually

296
01:05:12,359 --> 01:05:19,079
pleasant but sometimes not pleasant and at some point even that you know as

297
01:05:19,079 --> 01:05:24,900
unimaginable as that might be Rapture as pleasure isn't that why I'm here isn't that what I'm

298
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:31,799
in you know why I'm doing all this letting go and whatever you know for Raptor's pleasure even that gets old

299
01:05:31,799 --> 01:05:36,900
yeah even that gets old but it is significant

300
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:46,140
in so far as it does confirm that this path is not a con

301
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:51,839
yeah it's not another shell game and when we start to see like I didn't

302
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:57,000
know that I could feel this way

303
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:03,180
I didn't know that I could settle into the moment in this kind of rapturous way

304
01:06:03,180 --> 01:06:11,280
you're like okay this induces faith and it's a sense of like

305
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:18,000
um there's something here for me and the power we actually sometimes for

306
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:24,539
some people it's the first deep glimpse of the power of our mind

307
01:06:24,539 --> 01:06:30,780
which we have underestimated forever

308
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:45,660
[Applause] this kind of delight is said to give way

309
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:51,780
to come yeah which is a little bit the reverse

310
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:59,760
of what we think about we think we get calm in order to then become happier but here

311
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:07,920
is kind of reverse it's happiness and then we get calm we get settled we get focused we get you know

312
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:16,079
um but uh but come um this pivot to the tranquilizing side of

313
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:23,760
uh the path and the ways in which our nervous system is

314
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:31,920
just Longing To Be unstimulated just Longing To Be unstimulated

315
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:37,260
we think we're always looking for pleasure or something

316
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:42,599
but we're usually looking for pleasure to balance out the intensity of

317
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:49,980
something else and peace this Tranquility maybe the beginning of

318
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:56,819
that is um in a sense our deepest longing I almost

319
01:07:56,819 --> 01:08:05,099
think of it as the nervous system longing for the Dharma to be at peace it is

320
01:08:05,099 --> 01:08:12,180
as far as I can tell the only thing that does not fatigue the heart

321
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:14,780
peace

322
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:25,738
and so to begin to settle to begin to settle to

323
01:08:25,739 --> 01:08:31,560
find ways of breathing to find signs anchors ways of attending that bring

324
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:38,699
some measure of Tranquility in is necessary in order

325
01:08:38,699 --> 01:08:44,460
um in order to do the work of Letting Go you know

326
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:52,380
it's like if we're trying to uh trying to to let go and open to

327
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:58,859
experience from a very untranquil state it just feels like it makes our mind

328
01:08:58,859 --> 01:09:07,140
more brittle there's no more space it's filling a cup that's already overflowing

329
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:13,140
so we learn ways of of bringing in some calm and over all the years of practice

330
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:19,738
now it it's almost like even no matter what's happening in my mind my there's

331
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:26,160
like such deep associations with the posture and with the sense of the the

332
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:32,460
breath and the sense of gravity that something you know it's like this kind

333
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:40,500
of cue that just induces a measure of Tranquility and then there's more room to bear with

334
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:45,020
the imperfection of samsara

335
01:09:54,420 --> 01:10:00,780
when there is um Tranquility less agitation there's less

336
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:09,780
of a a kind of um searching and foraging for for food for

337
01:10:09,780 --> 01:10:16,580
the mind to medicate our agitation yeah that sense of like

338
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:24,179
we're we're often kind of just scanning the realm of our own thought world as a

339
01:10:24,179 --> 01:10:30,900
way to um to medicate to medicate the

340
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:39,020
the sense of of um threat and the sense that of of un

341
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:45,780
acquired opportunity and so

342
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:51,300
this Tranquility when that begins to settle when there are not alarm Bells

343
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:58,199
going off in our system Moment by moment what else is there to do other than just

344
01:10:58,199 --> 01:11:06,600
pay some attention and so we settle into to somebody to the

345
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:13,320
kind of unification of the Mind and um

346
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:19,040
and samadhi linked of course with

347
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:27,179
Rapture rapturous Joy samadhi is what um

348
01:11:27,179 --> 01:11:32,460
what turns the Dharma into something more than a philosophy

349
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:40,140
yeah the Dharma is really it's a good philosophy but it won't save us as a

350
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:46,199
philosophy you know we have to it has to become real yeah

351
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:53,040
has to become real uh it has to be be realized yeah

352
01:11:53,040 --> 01:12:00,659
which which yeah one uh credit literary critic you know Eve

353
01:12:00,659 --> 01:12:06,060
Cedric said like oh yeah to the difference between knowledge and realization is in realization something

354
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:12,659
becomes real as real as this very room and for the Dharma to become real it it

355
01:12:12,659 --> 01:12:20,580
requires some measure of samadhi otherwise it's just kind of a appealing

356
01:12:20,580 --> 01:12:28,080
set of ideas that we sort of clumsily try to apply to our life but until we actually

357
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:34,020
start to hear the Dharma from a place of

358
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:42,380
unification of steadiness it's um it's not so useful

359
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:54,679
and so we we come into alignment it feels like all the all the

360
01:12:54,679 --> 01:13:01,920
pieces and parts of us all of a sudden start moving in the same direction

361
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:08,340
and the kind of ambivalence and the sense of Being for the fragmentation of

362
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:15,300
the self um just recedes and we are all all of us

363
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:20,699
is moving in One Direction it feels more and more natural just to

364
01:13:20,699 --> 01:13:26,119
rest the attention with what we decide is relevant

365
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:32,540
and um we get so um

366
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:40,679
so um [Music] we kind of use uh

367
01:13:40,679 --> 01:13:46,080
the level of discursive thinking as the barometer for our samadhi and for our

368
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:51,300
practice generally we sort of take the surface layer of the Mind very seriously

369
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:56,820
and we use that to measure how still we are but the truth is there are processes of

370
01:13:56,820 --> 01:14:02,580
Stillness that happen outside of the the realm of discursive thought

371
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:10,800
and that's why when people have been sitting in retreat for example for a few days or a couple

372
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:17,280
weeks as have people have been at Insight retreat center now yeah

373
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:22,440
um even if their minds are

374
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:30,540
still florid with thought there's a deepening that's happening as

375
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:36,179
some kind of silence is setting in and I associate samadhi with the unification

376
01:14:36,179 --> 01:14:44,100
of mine but also with the plasticity of mind the its sense of depth and this

377
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:49,260
it's it's How Deeply impressionable it becomes

378
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:56,760
yeah and so the mind the the mind that is stabilized is a very is a deeply

379
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:02,840
impressionable mind and whatever we learn under the conditions of samadhi

380
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:09,420
has legs yeah the insights That We Gather the

381
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:15,420
understandings that we cultivate the realizations that we have under

382
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:22,500
conditions of samadhi that has legs it stays with us we all know the sense of

383
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:29,840
the the light of some insight or some understanding fading over time

384
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:36,659
oops Insight developed under under conditions

385
01:15:36,659 --> 01:15:45,140
of the unification under conditions of samadhi have legs yeah stays

386
01:15:52,080 --> 01:16:00,659
and um in in the experience of samadhi of Piti

387
01:16:00,659 --> 01:16:08,239
of of the kind of delight of every part of us moving in the same direction

388
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:13,679
um uh we

389
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:16,219
we

390
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:24,420
have a kind of the the movement of the heart is not towards the intensity of

391
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:29,460
pleasure but towards the neutrality of

392
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:37,579
uh of of equanimity of a kind of

393
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:44,360
the the heart mind like utterly

394
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:49,380
unstimulated by The Winds of phenomena

395
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:54,420
a sense of something in US is a Longing To Be

396
01:16:54,420 --> 01:17:01,560
unstimulated by The Winds of phenomena and we say we

397
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:07,020
this is as as OPEC uh Equanimity deep ends

398
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:11,659
there's a sense of um

399
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:17,280
at least first it's a sense not of the absence of preferences but the absence

400
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:24,659
of the compulsion to enact our preferences that distinction makes sense the so it's

401
01:17:24,659 --> 01:17:30,900
not that that there isn't preference but the sense of like the compulsion to

402
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:37,020
bring our preferences into being to make something happen and all of the

403
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:45,000
agitation and strategizing requiring to bring clinging to fruition that starts

404
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:50,119
to fade huh

405
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:56,580
and um but in that process

406
01:17:56,580 --> 01:18:02,159
um something in US is being softened it's like I think I said something like the

407
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:08,900
chalesas or softening or hard or something like that which is a weird

408
01:18:09,179 --> 01:18:16,080
formulation and I'm not even sure it makes sense but that's how it kind of

409
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:22,980
feels to me it's like the forces of clinging when they're met in the the kind of

410
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:28,860
openness of equanimity it feels like something is being softened

411
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:35,100
foreign called Equanimity the primary cathartic

412
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:40,980
factor of mindfulness yeah of the path the primary cathartic

413
01:18:40,980 --> 01:18:48,300
Factor this being alluding to the sense of

414
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:54,360
um of release that happens the softening that happened when when the when the

415
01:18:54,360 --> 01:19:00,800
forces of clinging actually soften rather than Harden our heart

416
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:06,500
um

417
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:25,320
I think it's said that Equanimity when it really ripens is the

418
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:32,000
the closest approximation of Awakening

419
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:46,020
but the amidst this like radical okayness

420
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:53,040
in this non-interference with all phenomena with the Winds of samsara

421
01:19:53,040 --> 01:20:00,360
we don't actually lose the poignancy of our life of life itself the poignancy of

422
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:05,360
of suffering the suffering world

423
01:20:06,179 --> 01:20:12,060
um love is only a kind of stone's throw

424
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:19,980
away from peace and the mind that is that is stable that

425
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:25,219
is tranquilized that is gathered that is equanimous

426
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:32,719
um just just one kind of drop of love

427
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:36,260
flavors everything

428
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:48,840
so I offer this for uh your consideration yeah

429
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:55,199
and um seven factors yeah

430
01:20:55,199 --> 01:21:01,500
so may they uh may they be the practice may they be the fruit yeah

431
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:06,840
and um yeah please pick up whatever is uh

432
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:15,120
useful here and ignore the rest yeah like for real you know you this has your

433
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:20,460
path and you have to be the the kind of Judge of what is what is

434
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:26,280
useful and you sort of test things out and um uh you see yeah you're patient

435
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:33,960
patient but you test them out and um and this is the way our path unfolds in

436
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:41,340
our very idiosyncratic way yeah so uh so thank you thank you for your

437
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:48,719
attention and uh thank you to uh the crew on YouTube and to to you Martha
