1
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,880
so good morning good day hello everyone

2
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:34,079
and uh thank you for being part of this

3
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,200
so um one of the

4
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,399
important things to study or to be learn about in doing meditation practice

5
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,840
is uh desires how our desires work

6
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:59,199
and uh how we get pulled into them the allure of them the the um

7
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,880
the propensity we have to get caught in them and to believe them and

8
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:14,720
follow them and uh how not to and not to be involved in desires

9
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,159
or to be involved in the desires that are healthy for us and appropriate for us

10
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,680
to be able to choose a healthy desire for meditation and then be able to stay

11
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,240
with it have a commitment to it or engagement with it and there is a kind of desire

12
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:39,119
in meditation to meditate to be present

13
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:46,000
and it's a maybe a very simple one some people it's not simple and there can be a lot of greed and

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,439
and attachment involved in that desire to attain certain states or have something happen prove something

15
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:59,280
but it also there can be a very simple desire to be present to be with one's breathing

16
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:07,280
as an antidote to being caught up in green antidote to be caught up swept away by other desires

17
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,200
it's a desire to become free of compulsive desires

18
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,080
so we sit no so if we sit

19
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,360
um with um

20
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,959
we said to meditate if you use the breathing as your primary anchor for your attention in the present

21
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,160
moment there can be a very simple desire to do so

22
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,239
without that desire of you know there can be a kind of like instructions to do it than one thinks that one's supposed

23
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:50,640
to do it and we'll try to do it but uh maybe the desire is not there

24
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,160
and maybe never thought about having a desire it's like okay i have to follow the instructions

25
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:04,480
in a sense the desire is to follow the instructions but it helps a lot if you have a simple

26
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,760
relaxed but clear desire

27
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:17,120
like a this decision desire that leads to a decision that this is what i want to do so no no

28
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,720
question about it it still might be difficult but there's a big difference between a

29
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,560
decisiveness and a desire to be present versus um kind of

30
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,200
not really having decided and and kind of like it sounds like a good idea i'll try it but you know

31
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,239
easy come easy go or something and it can be the desire to stay with

32
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,280
the breathing it then has to be monitored a little bit to make sure that it's not greed or

33
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,920
it isn't with expectation

34
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:59,280
as you meditate i teach here to do so with the anchored in the in the

35
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,760
breathing as you do so the mind will wander off

36
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:14,720
and when it does before you return to your breathing see if you can see this recognize

37
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,959
if that wandering of mind involves any kind of desire

38
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:27,680
if you start thinking about a meal there's maybe a desire for food if you

39
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,919
start thinking about you know planning the day there's a kind of desire for

40
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:40,639
the planning there's a wanting something there's engaging in something and don't make it a big complicated

41
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,320
project is very simple kind of obvious and if you don't see a desire that's okay just let go and come back to your

42
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,080
breathing but notice how often you're thinking involves uh

43
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,440
maybe he's fueled by a desire for something

44
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,759
for something or desire for something not to be and

45
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,400
and then and then reestablish your desire for being with breathing

46
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,600
and letting go of those thoughts

47
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:22,479
so this brings a kind of more clarity more wisdom understanding about the mechanism

48
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:29,440
by which we wander off that often the wandering off is is aided

49
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,280
by the desire that goes along with it and you might discover the desire for a

50
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:43,360
meal or whatever you're thinking about has some kind of greater psychological strength and desire to meditate

51
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:50,960
and then maybe relax relax deeply remember that now is the time to meditate

52
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,280
there's always time for other desires so

53
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,360
assuming a meditation posture

54
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,319
with the desire for a posture that will allow you to meditate for the

55
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,000
duration but also a posture that

56
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,360
since there's a desire for clarity and certain relaxed alertness

57
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,560
what posture supports relaxed alertness

58
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,440
and then lowering your gaze

59
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,680
you might close your eyes

60
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,280
and with a desire to settle in and relax

61
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,440
taking a few long slow deep breaths and relaxing into your body as you

62
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:24,880
exhale a clear desire wish

63
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:31,800
to let the whole system soften relax

64
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:19,039
letting your breathing return to normal and now before centering yourself on the

65
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:27,840
breathing check in with yourself and see if how you feel

66
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,399
what your mind is concerned with really and also what you might be feeling

67
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:40,399
emotionally or in terms of a mood is there any way which those represent

68
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,440
or come along with an active desire

69
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:53,360
is there a subtle desire behind the background or in the foreground around your thought streams

70
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,839
how you feel

71
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,720
um

72
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,360
and then with a see if you can establish a desire

73
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:52,880
to be present for the ongoing rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

74
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,360
a desire to be present for your breathing

75
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,600
experience or breathing in the body

76
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,079
it doesn't have to be any tension or expectation of success

77
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:19,040
but there can be a decisiveness in the decision the desire okay

78
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,959
this is in fact what i'd like to do now

79
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,319
settling into your breathing

80
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,800
maybe relaxing a bit with the exhale

81
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:05,360
and if you mind wonders away from breathing notice

82
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,839
if any desire is involved in that or can be is representative of that

83
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,079
movement of mind or movement of feelings

84
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:27,279
acknowledge the desire and then return to wanting to be with your breathing

85
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,640
and settle in again one breath at a time

86
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:41,079
letting your thinking mind become quieter as you exhale

87
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,519
mind moves towards stillness quiet

88
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,399
so you're just breathing in breathing out

89
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:57,360
most thinking involves desire of some kind or other

90
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,240
even if it's just the the desire to think

91
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,918
but often it's the desire for something

92
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:16,360
for what we're thinking about or something in relationship to it

93
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,678
desire is the fuel for thinking

94
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:39,039
can you recognize the desire and let go of it or put it aside

95
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:48,840
and return to the desire to be with your breathing the desire to be here meditating

96
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,559
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

97
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,840
turning your attention outward into the world

98
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:06,399
world of other people and animals and creatures of all kinds

99
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,120
and do you have can you find in yourself a simple

100
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:21,679
maybe almost like the simplest kind of uncomplicated desire

101
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:28,679
for the well-being of all living beings

102
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:36,600
a simple wish uncomplicated by

103
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:42,440
expectations and obligations and

104
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:52,158
even uncomplicated by the need to act on it at least for now

105
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:59,240
and to wish for the welfare and happiness of others

106
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:06,639
what a good idea would be how great that would be if everyone could be happy

107
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:16,080
and then to give voice

108
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:21,840
to this desire even if the desire is

109
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:29,279
the desire to have the desire maybe you could silently repeat after me

110
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:38,360
these words may all beings be happy

111
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,440
may all beings be safe

112
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:59,120
may all beings be peaceful

113
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,840
may all beings be free

114
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,520
and then if you would like you can add a desire to that

115
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:25,679
and that is the desire that for this day next 24 hours

116
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:33,679
may you contribute to that in some way no matter how small

117
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:40,440
may all beings benefit from our community

118
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,760
thank you

119
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:46,960
so hello and for this monday for this week

120
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:53,919
i would like to discuss the fourth foundation of mindfulness

121
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:59,679
the kind of the foundational teachings on mindfulness

122
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,960
practice comes from a text by the buddha that's sometimes called the four foundations of

123
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,880
mindfulness and and it has these four different areas in

124
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,960
which to cultivate this clear awareness of mindfulness

125
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,159
and uh over this last four months or so i've given weeks on each of the first

126
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:28,399
three maybe starting in june maybe one june one july or august and um

127
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:35,039
and so in this today i would like to do the fourth foundation and uh if uh some of you have been there

128
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:40,880
for the others and and uh if you're interested in this topic you could always go back and

129
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:47,840
listen to those the fourth foundation of mindfulness is

130
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:54,880
is called the foundation of the dhammas the

131
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:01,360
dharmas and it's commonly said that the word dharma has many meanings and

132
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,640
in relationship to this fourth foundation people have struggled to figure out what the proper

133
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,080
meaning is here my proposal is to call it um the

134
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:18,960
action or activities one of the meanings of dharma among the many is it mean it can mean actions

135
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:26,000
and um and but not just actions of uh that we do actively but just activities

136
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,320
but actions of the activities of the mind here and um

137
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:38,559
and we're and here what we're doing in the fourth foundation is building on the foundation of the

138
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:45,039
previous three we're now taking an interest in the activities of the mind

139
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:50,159
that either keep us in bondage or which set us free

140
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:58,080
either those that keep us in the karmic stream or those that lead us into the dharm extreme following the

141
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,760
topic for last week's talks and um

142
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,878
and these five layout are laid out as many things are

143
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:15,040
in the suttos progressively almost like a little map of practice as we go along

144
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,720
and it begins with the five hindrances the five hindrances are something that

145
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:28,638
uh used to be i don't know still the case but uh used to be uh standard talk to be given at week-long

146
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:34,878
or 10-day long insight meditation retreats usually the second day or so there's a talk given on

147
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:42,240
the hindrances and um and uh it's really invaluable

148
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,520
to understand how these work these are five forces in the mind

149
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:55,520
that act as kind of like like black holes like a black hole star that

150
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:01,920
is so gravitational force is so strong that light doesn't come out of it in our

151
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,359
case as a pull is so strong that awareness doesn't come out our awareness

152
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:13,920
gets sucked in and we get involved in this sort of lost in this in a way that's unproductive for clear

153
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,680
awareness and uh these five are uh

154
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,799
sensual desire ill will

155
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:33,760
sloth and resistance sloth and torpor restlessness and remorse regrets

156
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,280
and then doubt or uncertainty and

157
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,880
so it begins with central desires and uh and then one of the reasons it's taught

158
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:51,520
that these to be possible retreats it's like the uh the coarsest or the often the first line

159
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:57,119
of mental activity that gets in the way of getting settled in meditation

160
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:03,119
and it has a lot to do with desire for things uh in fact

161
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:09,520
the whole first three parts of this fourth foundation can be seen as expressions of desire or

162
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,640
manifestations of desire but in particular for these hindrances

163
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:22,880
the desire for sensual pleasures the desire for getting rid of something pushing it away

164
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:30,320
there is sloth intorpur sloth and resistance especially when you call the resistance is the kind of a desire to

165
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,760
not participate or shut down or or

166
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:42,960
you know kind of go numb and and so sloth and torpor isn't just innocent being tired it's kind of like

167
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,880
uh wanting not to pay attention not to be here in some way and being deflated

168
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:55,440
and um maybe deflated because our desires we can't fulfill them and we're not being satisfied

169
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:02,720
with our desires and then uh the fourth one is um this uh restlessness

170
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:10,160
and kind of regrets and agitation restlessness can often come because

171
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:16,960
unfulfilled desires and we don't know how to fulfill our desires and regrets can often come when

172
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,160
when we had a desire that we that was not fulfilled or we didn't do

173
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:27,599
what we had hoped to do or we did something that we in retrospect realized we wish we

174
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:34,480
hadn't done and because our desires were a little bit askew a little bit off

175
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,160
and then doubt is you're not sure what to do in relationship to all this so we get pulled into the world of

176
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:47,280
objects the world of things of experiences of people and these five can be the fuel for getting lost in that

177
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:53,440
world sometimes for decades and um and so mindfulness practice is to

178
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,480
so if we settle that down then we go then we are

179
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,839
then we're ready to take and take on something more subtle that keeps us distracted or keeps us

180
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:10,240
from getting really settled and that has to do with uh various kinds of attachments or

181
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:18,320
identifications uh as self and so we're working through this kind of ideas and and deeper ideas of self

182
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:24,960
and this is called the five aggregates the third one when that's settled uh

183
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:32,000
there's a simpler kind of desire that goes on that's left when attachment to self is no longer there and that's just

184
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,079
simple uh desires for anything and everything just us simple

185
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:44,640
experiences in the moment we hear a sound and there's a movement for against it or a taste or whatever it

186
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,720
might be and this is called the mindfulness of the sense fears of how we

187
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,760
experience in the moment uh is the sense experience at all the different

188
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,920
scent stores and once we kind of quiet that down

189
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:09,440
then the dharma extreme has a chance to surface and then there can be the arising of

190
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:15,119
seven factors of awakening seven uh wonderful qualities of this darm extreme

191
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:22,079
that begin coursing through us like a stream almost when it gets strong and when and those uh and this is kind

192
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,560
of like it's a core um

193
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:33,280
states of meditation that are setting the foundation for a quiet calm steady mind

194
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:39,839
that then can see the fifth part of the fourth foundation which is um

195
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:47,520
um the four noble truths the inside having the insights that lead to liberation

196
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:53,680
and uh so these are kind of progressive and we can go through them um and so today we'll talk a little bit

197
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:59,760
briefly about the hindrances and then we'll go through the other four so it's kind of a whirlwind tour of

198
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,440
these big topics and and you know in these few minutes i'm going

199
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:12,079
to talk about the hindrances i could also say that i have given classes on the hindrances that are on

200
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:17,440
audiodharma and um and uh i've covered this before so you

201
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:24,480
could go and look it up and if you want to catch up more and more more depth around them which i strongly

202
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:30,079
encourage i'd like to think that uh the pasta students should become experts

203
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:36,400
on the hindrances and think of the pasta practice especially in the early period of one's practice

204
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:43,440
as kind of a de facto study um to get a phd in the hindrances to

205
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:51,359
really understand them to see them coming to be able to recognize them to know how to work with them

206
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:57,680
the um in the way that uh the buddha discusses in this text the four foundations of

207
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:03,280
mindfulness he says very simply uh when there is one of these hindrances

208
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:10,000
when that it's there when recognized it's it's there when it's not there when recognized it's

209
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:17,200
not there when it when before one has arisen

210
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:23,119
if something hasn't come occurred yet hindrance when is there present enough

211
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:30,079
and bright and clear enough to recognize its arising and this idea of seeing the beginning of

212
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:37,119
something the arising of something is we'll talk more about this as we go along but is phenomenally important it's

213
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:45,599
only possible if the mind is steady and stable so that we can see the arising of things

214
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:51,520
and and then we see we recognize that we've abandoned it we recognize that it's gone

215
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:58,000
away um and uh and then we recognize yeah it's really gone it's not coming back

216
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,880
wow so as the mindfulness and concentration gets stronger one has the ability to let go easily

217
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:11,599
and seeing it go is um is a meant to envir inspire faith and

218
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:17,920
confidence in this practice that we don't have to we're not stuck in these hindrances we have some agency

219
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:24,000
around them and and we should exercise that there is this healthy desire

220
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,880
to let go of the hindrances it's not easy to do and that's why i say we want to do a big study you know get

221
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:37,359
it the equivalent of a phd and the hindrances so we really understand well how to do this

222
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:43,440
and how to prepare the grounds so that we can avoid getting caught in the hindrances

223
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:49,040
so one learns to let go of it and then one recognizes there comes a time when

224
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:54,800
the mind is so stable and so beginning to have a feeling of freedom

225
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:01,040
that one recognizes that hindrance is not going to arise again i mean in the short term at least in in this state

226
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:07,680
that we're in it might later come back but uh it's such a nice feeling so good oh

227
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:14,000
especially if someone's been caught in the entrances for a long time and struggling with them

228
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,680
it's such a relief to have them you know

229
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:25,359
go away and then feel confident that for now they're not here

230
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:31,119
the word that we're translating as hindrances nivarana is

231
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:37,760
is literally means a covering so the hindrances of what covers over

232
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:43,119
uh the depth of who of what goes on for us covers over our freedom covers over

233
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:48,720
um like clarity and covers over wisdom and part of the

234
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,640
function of reason to practice with hindrances and and have them quiet down

235
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:01,359
is so that we can see clearly and wisdom can begin operating in relationship to what goes on

236
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:08,720
and part of that wisdom is to begin to understand the nature of desires

237
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:14,319
and know which desires are healthy to have and

238
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:20,319
and how to have healthy desires in a healthy way and

239
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:25,359
and so i no longer get pulled into the world of desires of the hindrances

240
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:31,280
then we can start uh have more freedom more ability to have this healthy desire

241
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:38,240
to yes what i'm going to do is to practice mindfulness what i want to do is to be present here

242
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:44,160
yes recognizing what's happening at present moment is better than not recognizing

243
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:49,280
and wandering off in the highways and byways of my mind

244
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:55,760
so um so the five hindrances the fourth

245
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:02,079
foundation of mindfulness a journey from our

246
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:08,240
contracted difficult states to liberation

247
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,200
so thank you
