9
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:57,600
for the meditation the invitations are to notice our internal speech

10
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,779
because speech isn't just what we engage in externally but also how we address

11
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:12,720
ourselves how we do the narration all the internal speeches also speech so

12

so arriving arriving in this body

16
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,120
it feels comfortable to close your eyes or maybe have the slit open that's

17
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,899
perfectly fine too that's what's more comfortable

18
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:08,220

21
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:28,279
is awareness attention whatever it is

22
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,779
The Power Of Consciousness directing

23
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:47,480
inviting it to pay attention to rest on the body

24
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,220
sensations of the body

25
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:25,399
inviting the body to soften and relax might be helpful to

26
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:33,320
start say from the top and go the bottom of the body

27
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,300

28
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,420

38
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,620
releasing the legs upper legs knees

39
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,760
lower legs

40
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:15,800
and feet

41
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:37,399
let the breath be received the relaxed Body Solid

42
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:40,699

43
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:51,480
the body is tight the mind gets tight letters away here and there let the body

44
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:59,060
be relaxed heart can soften

45
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:10,880
and this spacious miraculous Moment In Time

46
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,800
receiving receiving the breath receiving the mystery

47
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,938
and those thoughts arise as they will inevitably do

48
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:23,780
notice kindly gently with meta notice their quality

49
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,179
thoughts of our inner speech if it's directed to ourselves

50
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:40,880
or about others is it even true as a different factual

51
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:58,380
politeness about it if the thought arises oh you can't do

52
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:04,140
this you're hopeless at meditation or whatever judgmental thought

53
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:09,179
might be kindly gently laugh

54
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:15,120
is it is it even true it's a different factual don't have to believe it

55
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,520
it's not even true it's just an opinion

56
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:38,059
and then can you release can it be released with a smile with friendliness

57
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:25,380
men giving our hearts to the breath presence in this moment

58
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:31,080
I have another thought that arises again noticing

59
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,419
perhaps we can notice if there is greed or wanting

60
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:43,700
in the speech or or ill will resentment if it's about others

61
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:02,220
smilingly after noticing we let go

62
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:07,100
after knowing in this way we let go and we come back

63
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:15,500
our anchor and we stay with the anchor

64
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,380
it's nourishing calming soothing

65
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,840
Gathering collecting

66
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:33,019
life-giving anchor of the breath

67
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:41,460
if you notice any greed or hatred or confusion in your

68
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:46,799
speech let there not be

69
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:52,380
aversion because we're adding more hatred on top of it

70
00:22:52,380 --> 00:23:00,919
Let There Be kindness oh my inner speech I just noticed

71
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:08,000
aversive oh sweetheart oh sweetheart it's okay

72
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:18,860
they let that go let there be kindness instead

73
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:55,760
those are inner speech have blindness generosity and wisdom

74
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:08,898
that way you've noticed let go let go just here

75
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,740
with the breath in the body

76
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:40,160
foreign

77
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,420
sitting to a close together

78
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:29,640
letting go of any judgment for how must have been should

79
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:37,760

96
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:57,420
thank you all for your practice and hello again greetings

97
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:07,940
so the theme for this week is um

98
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:13,560
wise speech and it's both external speech what we

99
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:17,540
say in words what we write

100
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:25,020
for example even writing what we write in chat and just small the Nuggets of

101
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:30,060
writing or are also considered speech and

102
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:38,480
these days with social media you know the the one little comment or with a little tweet

103
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,119
our speech can have so much impact externally on the world

104
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:50,880
with the spread with its reach with the speed of dissemination

105
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,940
so speech is quite powerful both externally and also how it shapes our

106
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:04,200
world internally our words spoken or written they shape us they

107
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:11,760
it's the scaffold of shaping who we are how we think how we perceive

108
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:18,660
um fascinating researcher also about the impact of language on our perception how we actually perceive reality

109
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:25,220
quote-unquote reality based on the words we use based on our speech

110
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:33,660
so the power really appreciating the power of speech both externally the

111
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:39,119
impact it has on others we can hurt others we can

112
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:44,640
um great factions Wars yes Wars have started

113
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,680
based on words um and also our words can bring sucker

114
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:59,000
they can bring Comfort they can bring Unity they can support people heal people so words are so powerful

115
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:07,380
both externally and how they impact us they form and shape uh us and they shape

116
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:14,579
and form our Karma and karma in the way of of our conditionality

117
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:20,220
person we are the person we become we keep becoming in every moment that's our

118
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:27,320
Karma our words shape our Karma very important

119
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:38,339
so yesterday we began with the first guideline

120
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:45,300
not the Buddha gives which is is it true and factual and I added the Nuance of

121
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:52,980
factual if you missed yesterday please listen to it I uh I do want to add a couple of things

122
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:58,319
to to the true and factual because this is such an important

123
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:05,960
um such an important one before we um move on to the next one today

124
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:12,180
and um first one thing I wanted to add was uh I was not a good academic yesterday I

125
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:20,400
was so excited about the research that I forgot to give you the the references to where you could find it and the work I

126
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:26,940
talked about yesterday the Neuroscience research can be found in Nature Neuroscience 2016. it's the work that

127
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:34,200
was done in the lab of Tali charot and colleagues foreign

128
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:41,280
and today I wanted to add one more teaching about truthfulness and this is so beautiful

129
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,680
this is um from nikaya 61. it's where um the

130
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:53,400
Buddha is is teaching rahula um his son

131
00:43:53,400 --> 00:44:01,079
and uh and this is what uh what the Buddha says so one day the Buddha came to rahula

132
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:07,160
pointed to a bull with a little bit of water in it

133
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:13,859
and asked rahula do you see this bit of water left in the bowl rahula answered

134
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:22,680
yes sir so little rahula is the spiritual achievement of one who is not afraid to

135
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:28,859
speak a deliberate lie it's profound okay but but then the Buddha continues

136
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:35,359
so little water is so little is the spiritual achievement of someone who's not afraid to speak a deliberate life

137
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:42,720
then the Buddha threw the water away put the bull down and said do you see rahula

138
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:48,839
how the water has been discarded in the same way one who tells a

139
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:56,160
deliberate lie discards whatever spiritual achievement one has made

140
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:03,119
wow they and continues again he asked do you see

141
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:09,660
how this bowl is now empty in the same way one who has no shame in speaking

142
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:16,380
lives is empty of spiritual achievement he's really driving the point home you

143
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:21,839
get this right he's just driving you know home and and in beautiful different

144
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:26,119
ways um

145
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:32,220
then the Buddha this is this is the last straw then the Buddha turned the ball

146
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:37,859
upside down and said do you see rahula how this bowl has been turned upside

147
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:43,740
down in the same way one who tells a deliberate lie

148
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:51,720
turns one's spiritual achievements upside down and becomes incapable of

149
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:58,020
progress therefore the Buddha concluded one should not speak at deliberate lie even

150
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:03,500
image even just so turning the ball upside down

151
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:10,440
incapable of progress incapable of progress as I mentioned yesterday commitment to

152
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:16,920
the truth is so fundamental so important to truthfulness to speaking the truth uh

153
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:23,280
internally externally that is is is the only precept that a bodhisattva

154
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:31,440
cannot break so it's and the Buddha basically says if you can't if you tell a deliberate lie if you don't have if

155
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,660
you have no shame just you cannot make progress you throw it away you just you're incapable

156
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:44,280
and and many of us perhaps were here that's like oh yeah I tell the truth yeah I tell the truth and yes yes for

157
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:50,579
most part for the most part telling the truth might be easy but those Nuance to

158
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:56,700
those particular instances where it's not easy where it's hard to tell the

159
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:03,240
truth those are the times to to inquire to settle in with our bodies with our

160
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:10,020
hearts like what is happening am I am I afraid of being judged this is my

161
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:17,160
self-sense in danger um do I want to show up in a particular way do I want to be perceived in a

162
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:22,260
particular like what what is the rub on those moments on those moments that's

163
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:29,660
telling you we just wanna you know a little bit not quite shade the truth

164
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:36,240
for our benefit or for all one another person's benefit or that or detriment

165
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:41,760
perhaps those are the times that that it becomes kind of sticky and those are and

166
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:48,780
in general maybe 98 of the time or 99 oh yeah it's easy we tell the truth yeah it's raining now so I would put those

167
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:55,560
tiny bits of time and and can be uh bring bring

168
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:01,020
um uh a brightness so I I remember actually years ago I

169
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:06,720
remember I noticed that when I got somewhere late for example I I would have

170
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:12,180
um um uh and and I had so there would be traffic and then I had left later than I

171
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:18,240
intended but then I would be ashamed to say actually I left later then and I would just say oh there was traffic that's why I'm late then I thought wait

172
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:24,240
that's not quite true I left later so I made it I made it the choice to say I

173
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:30,780
left I'm I left later than I intended I'm sorry and there was traffic so there was just a sense of truthfulness or a

174
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:35,819
sense of a brightness it just felt cleaner even though it was small but but

175
00:48:35,819 --> 00:48:43,140
still it felt uh more upright yes I'm not just like and and then the question

176
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:49,440
really was oh am I like not feeling comfortable saying that yes I left later because I don't want to be judged I

177
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:56,339
don't want to be seen as someone who doesn't have it together or whatever runs late like no I I ran late and

178
00:48:56,339 --> 00:49:03,119
there's a brightness to actually say that to to to not be um to not have that

179
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:08,819
shame or whatever it is so so having that that uh that inquiry

180
00:49:08,819 --> 00:49:15,540
so I've spoken a lot again about uh the previous topic which is so important so

181
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:23,040
important um maybe I would just add one more thing uh

182
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:28,579
now actually I'll save this for for later okay I want to move on to the next um

183
00:49:28,579 --> 00:49:35,838
uh question that we ask so the next question to ask ourselves is um

184
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:42,060
is my speech divisive is it divisive or does it create Harmony

185
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:49,140
so the Buddha teaches about why speech they're always things to avoid and

186
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:56,940
things to cultivate so this is what what the Buddha says abandoning divisive

187
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:04,200
speech one abstains from divisive speech what one has heard here one does not

188
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:12,240
tell there to break those people apart from these people what one has heard there one does not

189
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:17,520
tell here to break these people apart from those people so this sense of

190
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:24,540
breaking people apart one does not do that and and to and yeah this is kind of

191
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:30,119
maybe a old language but how often do we kind of you know speak behind people's

192
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:37,020
back or divisive speech and slanderous speech and um slanderous and divisive

193
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:42,780
speech is is based on hatred and ill will it has that as its root and it's

194
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:48,660
enmeshed with resentment Envy intention to hurt another wind respect and support

195
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:53,940
for ourselves and it actually carries doubly heavy

196
00:50:53,940 --> 00:51:01,319
Karma because it involves forethought it's not only does it have the root of hatred and

197
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:07,079
ill will but also since it has forethought you thought about it ahead of time like oh yeah I'm gonna say that

198
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:12,660
thing about that friend the third friend to this friend of mine so that you know they're getting very close and I'm

199
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:18,059
feeling threatened they're getting very close and well they didn't invite me they went out to lunch on their own oh

200
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:24,480
I'm gonna just say you know you know they this person said something you know just that this it involves forethought

201
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:31,339
it involves some planning so it has doubly heavy Karma foreign

202
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:40,069
[Music]

203
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:46,500
he says thus reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are

204
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:54,059
united he one loves Concord Delights in Concord enjoys Concord speaks things

205
00:51:54,059 --> 00:52:01,260
that create Concord basically creating Harmony speaking what

206
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:08,460
creates Harmony um that's what the Buddha is recommending so so instead if you see oh

207
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:15,780
your friend you know your other two friends are now getting closer oh yes yes great Concord I'm so glad you're

208
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:21,440
you're becoming more friends you know she they they're wonderful this is great

209
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:28,380
so it's Concord creating Concord Harmony between people instead of breaking

210
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:31,880
people apart um

211
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:39,420
so so notice so today as you go about your day

212
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:46,500
um please bring in this this inquiry both about is it truthful is it

213
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:51,720
factual internally externally especially in those like maybe one percent or maybe

214
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:58,380
fewer uh percentage of the time when it's a little difficult to be completely honest

215
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:04,099
and then [Music] um and then with is is my speech divisive

216
00:53:04,099 --> 00:53:11,880
is it um or is it creating Harmony and and and in all these cases really inquiring with

217
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:18,780
the body what's going on inquiring with the body inquiring with the intention with motivation what's going on what's

218
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:25,260
going on sweetheart well if if I'm tempted not to to speak aligned with my
