1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,520
okay so why don't we go ahead and get

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,680
started this evening

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,280
it's nice to see at least uh

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,960
on the screen a couple of comments there

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,320
know that you're out there and um

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,439
welcome to our monday evening sit

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,880
uh diana is away so i'm very happy to

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,000
be here some of you uh know me

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,320
i've taught a number of times at imc for

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,119
a while

11
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,439
and it's a delight to share this time

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,840
with you

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,239
so let's go ahead and get started with

14
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,480
our meditation

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,760
so finding a posture that's

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,280
upright also relaxed

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,840
and something where you'll be able to

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,440
sit for a little while

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,000
just feeling a sense of settling in

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,039
so knowing that you've arrived

21
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,079
for the sitting

22
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,880
and if you're comfortable doing so you

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,840
can

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,479
close your eyes just let your eyes

25
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:11,680
gently

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,080
close if you're more comfortable with

27
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,560
them open that's okay

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,400
but usually in our practice we would

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,439
keep them closed

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,680
maybe taking a couple of long slow deep

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,040
breaths

32
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,759
to really bring the air into the body

33
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,799
and then on the exhale

34
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,920
encouraging the shoulders to drop

35
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,920
the body to soften up the

36
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,439
spine to still remain upright

37
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,560
so we're settling into

38
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,240
a posture that is at ease

39
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,840
and also alert

40
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,799
and then you may begin to bring the

41
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,439
attention

42
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,640
inward and just

43
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,680
encourage some ease

44
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,080
in parts of the body that we often hold

45
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,959
tense

46
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,920
so softening the muscles of the face

47
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,680
the forehead around the eyes

48
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,079
jaw

49
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,080
softening the eyes and the eye sockets

50
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,840
especially if we've been looking at the

51
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,640
screen often the eyes get a little tense

52
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,800
and down through the shoulder area

53
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,920
letting the shoulders drop

54
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,560
maybe thinking of the shoulder blades

55
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,760
sliding down the back

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,840
so we don't slump as we

57
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,840
soften the shoulders

58
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,879
down the arms into the hands

59
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,319
releasing any tension in fingers from

60
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:20,990
typing

61
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:24,110
[Music]

62
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,239
and down into the torso area softening

63
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,879
the chest

64
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,239
maybe deliberately feeling the front

65
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,000
back and sides of the ribcage

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,239
also when we look at the screen a lot of

67
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,840
our energy tends to go

68
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,799
forward in the body so it's so helpful

69
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:53,920
to

70
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,439
bring the attention to the back

71
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,840
the back of the ribcage

72
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,879
down through the belly letting the belly

73
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:15,439
be soft

74
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,120
all the way down into the hip joints

75
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,160
feeling the seat against the chair or

76
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,120
the cushion

77
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,040
or the bench wherever you're sitting

78
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,320
letting that support you

79
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,840
and softening down through the legs

80
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,680
[Music]

81
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,160
releasing any bracing or

82
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,280
tension in the knees or the ankles

83
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,040
and if you can feeling all the way into

84
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,840
the feet

85
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,479
so then having invited ease through the

86
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:21,759
body

87
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,440
just returning attention to the full

88
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,000
sense of the body sitting general

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,639
overall

90
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,039
sense

91
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,280
and just being at ease mentally with how

92
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,000
the body is right now

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:53,840
it's fine just as it is

94
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,680
gently allowing the attention to settle

95
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:07,840
onto the sensations of breathing

96
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,560
these sensations are very simple

97
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,680
almost elemental

98
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,880
touch of the air on the nostrils or the

99
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,120
upper lip

100
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,160
sense of coolness and nasal passages

101
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,400
some sense of expansion

102
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,840
maybe the shift of clothing against the

103
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,840
skin

104
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,919
maybe even a sense of tension near the

105
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,360
top of the

106
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,360
in-breath and then that stops and

107
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,080
we begin the out breath there's a

108
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,680
different kind of movement

109
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,000
maybe warmth as the air exits

110
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,440
it's a whole kaleidoscope of

111
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,520
simple sensations in sequence

112
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:31,840
and we can just flow along with that

113
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,080
just as we invited ease through the body

114
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,720
we can begin to encourage ease of the

115
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,280
mind

116
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,960
perhaps using the body is a simple way

117
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,599
to

118
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:35,839
stabilize the mind body is sitting still

119
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,000
relatively

120
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,360
so we encourage the mind to become

121
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:55,839
simpler stiller

122
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,959
certainly the goal is not to end our

123
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:01,680
thinking

124
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,200
or eliminate any emotions

125
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,120
present but more to have a simple

126
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,839
presence

127
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,360
with whatever is here

128
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,959
just as we can be simple with the

129
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,399
movement of the

130
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,600
breath in the body we can be simple with

131
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,600
the movement of thoughts emotions

132
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,839
the normal activity of the mind

133
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,720
let me just try not to get so caught up

134
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,080
in it

135
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,560
but instead just to hold it in simple

136
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,839
awareness

137
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,240
and if the mind has gotten caught up in

138
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,880
thought some concern

139
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,079
it's no problem as soon as you notice

140
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,600
just returning to the simple

141
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,040
presence of the body simple awareness

142
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,839
can anchor in the breath or the body

143
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,880
in fact we may even notice that

144
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,040
the moment that we come back when

145
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,079
there's

146
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,639
presence again there's a little bit of

147
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,680
joy it's actually

148
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,800
slightly pleasant to be

149
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,279
present

150
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,639
so i encourage you in this sitting to

151
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,920
notice

152
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,160
the simple joy that accompanies

153
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,399
mindfulness

154
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,920
even if what we're mindful of is some

155
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,880
discomfort in the body

156
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,240
or in the mind the mindfulness

157
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,320
itself has a certain

158
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,839
quality of joy to it

159
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,160
i'm just seeing if you can notice that

160
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,360
from time to time

161
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:53,839
as you continue with regular practice

162
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
oh

163
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:36,639
in this meditation continuing on

164
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,839
if you begin to feel

165
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,720
some degree of ease in the body

166
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,800
or the mind just from

167
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,600
having settled even a little bit

168
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,480
you're encouraged to tune into that

169
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,199
feeling that pleasant feeling of

170
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,399
well-being

171
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,480
or a little bit of peace or

172
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,920
softness in the body

173
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,360
or a mild kind of joy

174
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,160
in the mind

175
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,639
we don't need to only be

176
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,680
neutrally mindful about our experience

177
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,800
it's actually fine if we're feeling

178
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,399
meditative feelings of well-being

179
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,880
to open to those

180
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,720
include them explicitly

181
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,480
bring our mindfulness to those also

182
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,079
so that they are supported and nourished

183
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,160
in a natural way and if you don't feel

184
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,839
so much of that that's okay

185
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,880
too

186
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,240
but just to be aware when such

187
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,798
sense of ease arises and allow it to

188
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:19,839
to be nourished

189
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,919
you

190
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,919
you

191
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,280
the monk tanissero bagu

192
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,799
says that sometimes as he practices with

193
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,280
the breath

194
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,320
he just has the simple idea

195
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,000
of not adding any new tension

196
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,360
on the in-breath and

197
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,360
releasing a little bit more tension

198
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,480
on each out breath

199
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,240
that could be physical or mental

200
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,640
tension

201
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,280
and practicing in that way it's very

202
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,600
easy to tune into the ease that's

203
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,159
present

204
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,840
so that we're not adding anything on the

205
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,000
in-breath

206
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,400
and we're deepening into the ease on the

207
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
out breath

208
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:59,840
whatever use is available

209
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,799
and in the last few minutes of this

210
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:25,670
meditation

211
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,840
[Music]

212
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,880
i'm going to invite

213
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,400
just a brief reflection

214
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,480
if it's of interest

215
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,240
as you continue to sit in meditation

216
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,840
with the breath with body

217
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,840
bringing the mind into the present

218
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,760
moment

219
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,799
just reflect

220
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,960
on any sense of delight

221
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,679
or joy or gratitude

222
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,799
for the dharma for

223
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,120
your practice for

224
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,960
having a path to walk however it is that

225
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,320
you

226
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,279
think about this role of dharma in your

227
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,960
life

228
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,399
consider the appreciation or positive

229
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,600
feelings from that

230
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,080
just keeping the mind simple maybe even

231
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,000
feeling in the body that feeling

232
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,399
simple sense of joy and the dharma

233
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:49,840
however that is for you

234
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,760
i'm just resting and breathing with that

235
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,840
that feeling

236
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:37,719
