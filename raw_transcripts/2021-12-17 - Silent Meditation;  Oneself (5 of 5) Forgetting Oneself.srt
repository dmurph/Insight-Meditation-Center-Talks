1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,560
so

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,799
we come then to the end of this week's

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,120
theme which is ourselves

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,920
and um

5
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:13,840
i'd like to

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,119
tell you of a somewhat famous

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:19,359
quote by a japanese zen master named

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,840
dogen

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,279
and

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,279
it has these i want to quote two

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,119
sentences that have this dual nature of

12
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,840
buddhist practice

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,040
dual processes

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,559
so he says

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,879
to study buddhism

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,239
is to study the self

17
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,200
to study the self

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,000
is to forget the self

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,600
so those are the two i want to emphasize

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,079
he continues to say

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,399
something like to forget the self

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,320
is to be awakened by all beings to be

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,000
confirmed by all beings

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,960
and now but this idea that we can still

25
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,200
study oneself and in the process forget

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,799
oneself one can

27
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,520
practice with oneself what can we

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,880
observe and be present for oneself

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,119
and at the same time the process is out

30
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,960
of forgetting ourselves

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,040
and this dual nature might sound

32
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,840
paradoxical or contradictory

33
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,759
but as i've been saying lately there are

34
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,680
a number of

35
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,439
things that humans do

36
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,680
that have that dual nature

37
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,159
and one of them is hospitality

38
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,200
that

39
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,119
we both

40
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,840
act we energetically and fully engage in

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,840
the process of being host while

42
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,600
simultaneously

43
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,280
putting some of our own desires for

44
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,119
ourselves aside so we can be the good

45
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,799
host for and care for someone else

46
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,840
that same movement is present with

47
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,920
respect with generosity and perhaps with

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,680
a healthy love

49
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,600
that when we love someone

50
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,119
that

51
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,119
you know if we want to express it and

52
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,200
act on it in some healthy appropriate

53
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,280
ways

54
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,200
there's also kind of a letting go of

55
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,440
self in the process hopefully it's not

56
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,160
about just my own

57
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,920
needs desires pleasures uh feelings but

58
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,599
it's also about the other person and

59
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,440
caring for that person so kind of little

60
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,840
bit putting oneself aside

61
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,560
and this dual nature of uh

62
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,840
engaging in practice

63
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,680
in a practice that is

64
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,519
uh to some degree

65
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,440
studying ourselves

66
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,120
and then in the process forgetting

67
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,720
ourselves

68
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,080
i think it's a beautiful kind of

69
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,599
expression of

70
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,360
of um

71
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,160
of the movement of practice

72
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,440
and there's a number of ways that this

73
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,480
can work

74
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,760
and um

75
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,360
one is that

76
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,360
uh first i want to say that sometimes

77
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,480
because

78
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,800
meditation practice mindfulness practice

79
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,640
has a kind of self-reference you know

80
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,319
like we're paying attention to our own

81
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,760
breathing or paying attention to our

82
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,239
body sensations our thoughts we're and

83
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,280
um

84
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,800
meditation we often close our eyes and

85
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,280
just with our own experience

86
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,599
it's very easy

87
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,959
for that to be confused with

88
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:16,080
self-consciousness and in extreme

89
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,879
situations even narcissism

90
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,360
that an excessive preoccupation with

91
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,959
oneself but

92
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,879
putting oneself as every little detail

93
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,480
of ourselves is so

94
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,720
impactful and meaningful and important

95
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,040
and says always says something about

96
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,959
ourselves so something about

97
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,519
defining ourselves or judging ourselves

98
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,920
or proving ourselves or we need to be

99
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,159
someone comparing ourselves to others

100
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,920
so it can so there's a little bit

101
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,840
dangerous this mindfulness practice if

102
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,640
we bring a lot of self along

103
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,720
but to turn the attention to do the

104
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,159
practice of mindfulness moment by moment

105
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,840
in a meditation maybe just being with

106
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,000
the inner experience the breathing the

107
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,280
body

108
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,439
the thoughts the it's all settling at

109
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,760
everything focusing on it

110
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,560
to do it well to really well means to

111
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,599
really give yourself over to it

112
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,799
so there's not much room for

113
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,560
distractions

114
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,200
if we kind of sit down laxadaisically

115
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,880
a lot of distractions a lot of our

116
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,199
concerns can come pouring in

117
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,120
but if we sit down to practice in a

118
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,040
really

119
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,080
in a relaxed way but in a dedicated way

120
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,919
like this is important this is and

121
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,000
clearly what i'm going to do

122
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,600
in the beginning of meditation to kind

123
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,800
of actually

124
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,120
affirm that oh this is what i'm doing

125
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,919
now

126
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,680
not don't sit down casually and just let

127
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,000
the mind continue to think

128
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,600
but this clarity of really giving

129
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,600
oneself over to

130
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,440
uh the meditation practice to the

131
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,840
present moment

132
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,199
what that does

133
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,800
is it takes some of the energy of

134
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,759
attention away from our

135
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,040
self-preoccupations self-concern

136
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,280
self-ruminations that we have

137
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,880
and it's amazing how much

138
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,720
self-preoccupation a human being can

139
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,759
have and

140
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,039
i think many meditators

141
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,840
will

142
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,400
um

143
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,919
will um be surprised how self-centered

144
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,600
many of the thinking is

145
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,360
distracted thoughts being caught up in

146
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,039
thoughts where we're the central

147
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,639
character in our thoughts in one way or

148
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,600
the other

149
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,600
we have some role it's a lot of thoughts

150
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,320
are in relationship to ourselves

151
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,039
and

152
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,280
but as we kind of give ourselves over to

153
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,759
some like mindfulness or breathing

154
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,680
there's less energy and attention going

155
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,759
into that self-concern

156
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,360
and if we really give ourselves over

157
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,039
well to it to get a

158
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,800
there's a forgetting of self forgetting

159
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,600
of uh everyday concerns just like what

160
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,440
we do if you're reading a really good

161
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,759
book or if you're involved in some

162
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,560
delightful craft or art project or music

163
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,280
playing or something that

164
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,639
you're really absorbed in it there's a

165
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,160
forgetting of yourself forgetting of

166
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,080
your daily concerns even though there

167
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,840
might be a lot of attention

168
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,759
to some parts aspects of yourself to do

169
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,759
the task well

170
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,039
the mental activity of

171
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,199
self-preoccupation concern is not there

172
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,720
so just simply kind of being able to

173
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,639
give ourselves over to the practice

174
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,639
there's a forgetting of self in it

175
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,199
hopefully in a healthy way

176
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,120
as a practice deepens

177
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,520
we start seeing a deeper

178
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,080
forms of attachment stress clinging

179
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,600
contractions that are there around self

180
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,080
and one of them can be just simply in

181
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,000
the nature of how we're doing the

182
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,360
practice

183
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,919
practice itself brings a long baggage of

184
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,120
self

185
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,080
of

186
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,919
association with what it means to be the

187
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,160
practitioner the doer

188
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,400
and there's a simplification process

189
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,639
that goes on in meditation practice

190
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,759
where

191
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,280
everything that's extra that's not

192
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,880
needed it would start seeing as extra as

193
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,319
actually not only extra but often a

194
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,199
little bit

195
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,039
stressful compared to the deeper and

196
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,400
deeper calm

197
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,319
that's being experienced

198
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,599
and so we start kind of uh relaxing the

199
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,160
grip of self relaxing the the

200
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,000
preoccupation with self that can be

201
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,360
quite deep

202
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,160
um even subconscious sometimes

203
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,000
and um and there's a deeper and deeper

204
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,400
forgetting of self and

205
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,199
and that goes deeper and deeper until

206
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,000
uh at some point whatever ex whatever

207
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,360
happens in

208
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,520
meditation in our experience

209
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,039
there's no orientation no inclination

210
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,840
to define ourselves by any of it

211
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,080
to appropriate any of it to

212
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,240
to

213
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,680
to

214
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,120
either

215
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,680
have us be against it or for it just to

216
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,720
kind of see it clearly in the freedom of

217
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,240
the mind

218
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,160
in the mind that in the heart that is

219
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,840
untroubled by it

220
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,440
but also it doesn't

221
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,720
attribute a self to it doesn't project

222
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,599
ideas of me myself and mine on it

223
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,840
and this uh kind of forgetting or

224
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,160
putting down or relaxing

225
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,960
me myself and mine thinking me and

226
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,520
myself and mine preoccupations me myself

227
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,479
and mine

228
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,800
tightness and contraction and

229
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,639
the fear that sometimes comes with that

230
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,479
or the push and the

231
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,960
the resistance the

232
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,120
the ambition that comes with it

233
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,039
are all kind of this forgetting of all

234
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,039
that

235
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,879
so there's a movement of studying the

236
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,080
self

237
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,399
in order to forget the self

238
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,240
where forgetting the self here is one of

239
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,320
the most it's like it's like taking a

240
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,640
delightful vacation

241
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,479
everyone should have a vacation

242
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,560
and uh it's nice to have a vacation for

243
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,919
himself

244
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,080
it doesn't mean that uh

245
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,600
you're not going to pick it up again or

246
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,800
you're not going to take care of

247
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,720
yourself or you don't it's not that

248
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,880
doesn't mean you have to have a big

249
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,360
debate about the philosophical nature of

250
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,279
what the self is and isn't

251
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,279
it just means that you've radically kind

252
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,080
of given yourself a vacation a break a

253
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,640
pause a sacred pause

254
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,360
where self-concern self-preoccupation is

255
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,519
no longer present

256
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,720
and

257
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,839
and and it has been discovered simply by

258
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,080
settling into the present moment

259
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,320
and practicing simple attention and

260
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,440
concentration just this just this just

261
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,360
this breath just as in breath just as

262
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,200
out breath

263
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,839
just this sound just this

264
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,680
just thought just a thought just a

265
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,640
simplicity more and more simple

266
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,360
to be with each moment as it arises as

267
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,440
it passes as it occurs

268
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,920
be in the flow of the present moment the

269
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,640
flow of the occurrence right now

270
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,920
with no

271
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,640
retrospective thinking even two seconds

272
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,399
before what was that that just happened

273
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,880
well that was great even that can fall

274
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,519
away and no anticipatory thinking

275
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,880
it just the flow of this moment absorbed

276
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,720
in it delighted it like you're playing

277
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,560
music and just absorbed in the music of

278
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,800
the moment or

279
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
doing a craft or an art or reading a

280
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,839
book or

281
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,680
or maybe playing with a child that's

282
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,000
just you know so delightful just to be

283
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,959
there and

284
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,720
in the moment with the child no before

285
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,800
and after

286
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,040
a forgetting of self

287
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,320
and this is one of the great

288
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,079
pleasures of life

289
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,720
and it's one of the great of sources of

290
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,000
wisdom and freedom as well

291
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,880
so

292
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,959
we started this week with respecting the

293
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,320
self

294
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,160
and uh

295
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,760
this whole movement that we're talking

296
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,880
about here

297
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,760
is a form of profound respect

298
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,760
of freeing ourselves from suffering

299
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,440
respecting ourselves enough not to

300
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,640
suffer

301
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,440
not to contribute to our suffering by a

302
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,920
healthy kind of forgetting

303
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,320
of self-preoccupation

304
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,480
so

305
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,440
thank you

306
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,680
very much
