greetings sangha greetings lovely to be with you in this

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,240
moment in time and to practice together

3
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,119
so we will continue our explorations of tools

4
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:37,840
that are supportive and helpful in developing samadhi

5
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,879
concentration often translated some ideas settling

6
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:52,320
unifying collecting the mind calm abiding is another translation that

7
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,840
i favor over concentration

8
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,400
one supportive tool one supportive consideration

9
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:16,479
for collecting and settling the mind is collecting and settling and relaxing

10
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,039
the body

11
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,799
often one um invitation that i like people to drop

12
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,479
in if they're practicing if they're trying to cultivate the settling

13
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:41,520
mind is is um relax

14
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,320
and receive relax and receive

15
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,680
so in terms of wise engagement wise

16
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:01,439
engagement in which we'll talk about today and also partially tomorrow with respect to

17
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:08,000
to samadhi and i don't like to use the word effort wise effort i

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,520
like to translate in and use engagement another e-word because effort naturally brings up the sense of effort

19
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,280
tightening tightening of the brow i'm trying to get concentrated that's not really the idea

20
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:28,800
that's not how it works it's more i relax the body to be relaxed

21
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,000
and to receive to receive the breath to be with the breath yesterday we

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:43,120
talked about the joy of the present moment tuning into the simplicity of the joy of

23
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,480
the present moment while relinquishing what is not helpful we talked about that

24
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,840
the first day on monday so the relinquishing and tuning into the

25
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:05,840
joy especially of the present moment becomes possible when the body

26
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:13,760
is relaxed when the body is in a receptive mode hence the mind becomes more relaxed the

27
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,840
mind becomes in the more receptive mode

28
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:28,400
so let's begin let's practice together

29
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,640

35
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,960

36
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:43,840

37
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,960

38
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:57,840
inviting them

39
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,080

internally sensing feeling the sensations

43
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,280

44
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,400

50
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:06,560
they're being breathed and with each out breath

51
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,840
these areas of the body settle on their own

52
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,360

so continuing with the theme of samadhi

129
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,559
and just to say that the themes we are exploring this week

130
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:46,080
um there are not so much from a list as you know there are so

131
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:52,080
many lists in buddhism the buddha loved lists

132
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:59,120
love lists my mind thinks in lists it creates lists um

133
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,720
but what we're exploring these different supporting conditions what i like to

134
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,240
call supporting conditions aren't necessary earned from one set

135
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:16,960
list um of seven of these five of that these are more collected these tools

136
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:25,280
from from the different lists and from my own practice over the years um some of you may know

137
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:33,520
that the practice of samadhi samatha and and the jhanas have been a a primary

138
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,960
part of my practice over the years having practiced with uh

139
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:48,480
pa aksayada who's a burmese master of concentration

140
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:55,200
my primary teacher so these are many supporting conditions that i have

141
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,960
figured out in my own practice and also supporting many others in their practice

142
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,880
of developing samadhi concentration calm settling the mind

143
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:14,320
and i've collected them into a into a list for myself so so if you look there may not be a

144
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:21,839
canonical list that you'll find all of these numbered together so just as a footnote to bring

145
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:27,359
that in so exploring today

146
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:33,200
exploring today as a continuation of what we explored the last couple of days

147
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,800
the first day relinquishment renunciation of what is not helpful what's not

148
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:46,240
necessary one side of the coin the other one being turning to tuning to the joy of the present

149
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:53,920
moment the simplicity that it's lovely here no need to go out and and think and be distracted oh it can be

150
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,640
so softly cocooned in the in the delicious simplicity of the present

151
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,800
moment the joy of the present moment this other supportive condition today

152
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:13,040
that supports them all and they all interact with one another actually

153
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:20,960
is relaxing and receiving relaxing and

154
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,320
receiving this relaxed awareness

155
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:33,359
and i've found that to be very very important compared to

156
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:40,640
a an awareness that is is um it's like um

157
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,960
it's like a fork trying to to stab a piece of broccoli like okay where's

158
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:52,800
the broccoli okay where's where's the breath where's where is okay where's the thought okay okay okay

159
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,800
instead of that kind of an awareness which can which can tighten the body can tighten

160
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:06,079
the mind and the body cannot be in a receptive way to to relax and actually experience the

161
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:12,480
peace the settling of of calm of unification

162
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:18,480
instead to imagine awareness i guess continuing it with that simile

163
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,839
as a spoon as a spoon that is gathering collecting

164
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,880
soup oh it's receiving the soup it's kind of concave oh

165
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:35,440
yes it's not going out to stab okay bad breath this oh okay got it it's like i receiving

166
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:42,240
receiving receiving so this receptive quality

167
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:50,160
this receptive quality and the buddha talks about this receptive

168
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:57,599
quality of mindfulness of awareness of sati there are different modes to awareness

169
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:06,240
and satay in majima nikaya 19 um

170
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:13,280
the buddha talks about the cow herder the the uh when the cow

171
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:20,720
herders sitting on the top of the hill before the harvest and the cows are in

172
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:27,280
the field the cow herder needs to be really really vigilant and make sure the cows do not go and

173
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,960
trample uh what hasn't been harvested yet that's one mode that's one mode and then

174
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,000
there's another mode where the harvest has happened and

175
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,920
the cow herder on the top of the hill is is aware of the cows yeah they're there

176
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:51,280
that yup yup and yet that same sense of vigilance is not needed there is is a different

177
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,720
mode of sati of mindfulness

178
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:03,440
when the fields have already been plowed so the cows can can go into the

179
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,599
fields it's okay so as long as they don't go too far afield but there's a sense of

180
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,960
relaxing under the tree watching the the cows

181
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,320
there's a relaxed relaxing and receiving

182
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:26,400
uh mode to samadhi which can be to to to sati to awareness in this way which

183
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,920
can be very helpful for developing concentration developing

184
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:39,520
somebody and and i'll talk tomorrow

185
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,640
more about atapi about coming back about persistence which

186
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,720
together with this relaxed awareness can can support the cultivation of somebody

187
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:56,960
because if he's just relaxed and there is not no persistence then you know the cows can go and

188
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,160
trample anywhere and maybe the fields haven't been plowed so there needs to be a level of persistence

189
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:10,160
that we talk about tomorrow so these are kind of connected discourses um two

190
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:15,520
other points i wanted to bring in for your consideration

191
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:22,240
um another one actually is is from

192
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:27,839
the sutta from manchester nikaya 3631

193
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:37,279
where the buddha when he is sitting under the bodhi tree

194
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:43,680
and um he and there is this wanting to

195
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:49,040
to become free this desire is for desire to be free

196
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:56,079
and he remembers he has a memory of when he was

197
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:03,359
a child under a rose apple tree it's a beautiful memory and he realized and he remembers that

198
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:08,960
actually i'll read you the passage because it's so beautiful this paragraph he says i

199
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,720
thought i recall once when my father the sakyan

200
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:21,839
was working and i was sitting in the cool shade of a rose apple tree

201
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:28,319
then quite secluded from sensuality secluded from unskillful

202
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:34,480
mental qualities i entered and remained in the first jhana

203
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:41,680
rapture and pleasure born from seclusion accompanied by directed thought

204
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:50,160
and evaluation could this could that be the path to awakening and then

205
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:56,880
yes he realizes this is the path to awakening this delight this pleasure born from

206
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:03,040
seclusion not the oh the heart charging the

207
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:08,079
um well i mean there's a lot of intentionality too but not

208
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:14,240
the tightness there's a lot of relaxation of the body that can support here and i

209
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:20,480
want to bring your attention to sitting in the cool shade of a rose apple tree that's such a beautiful

210
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:27,440
image when we sit it's a hot day sitting under the cool shade of a rose

211
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:33,040
apple tree ah the body relaxes there is a sense of ease

212
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:39,280
peace um of of enjoyment and that's when the buddha

213
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:46,800
had fallen into the first jhana the the the pleasure

214
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:53,839
the the and with the seclusion of the mind with from unwholesome qualities that's when

215
00:42:53,839 --> 00:43:02,000
uh the mind had settled was abiding in the first jhana so and he wonders is

216
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,440
this the path to awakening and yes and that's how it it opened up

217
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:14,720
so i offered that for your consideration um of noticing

218
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:20,800
is the body relaxed is the body relaxed is the bodiness a receptive motor is it

219
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:26,160
tight one last thing to mention for you to

220
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:33,520
notice is there is a strong connection when the mind is tight or when the

221
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:39,200
thoughts and entanglements come up it always shows up in the body

222
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:46,400
and in meditation we can see that especially when the mind is very very

223
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:52,319
settled and quiet and settled each and every thought even if it's not

224
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:59,200
an entangled thought any thought we can see the reverberation in the body it's quite

225
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:06,079
amazing to see that therefore it is skillful

226
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:13,040
as we cultivate especially at the beginning as it's a little the settling of the mind might be choppy

227
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:18,240
to check in with the body oh is there any tightness in the body is my forehead

228
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:26,800
tight is is my neck getting shoulder getting tired ah if so relaxing relaxing

229
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:33,920
softening letting go allowing the relaxed mind a relaxed body

230
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:40,960
to support a relaxed mind if the body is tight the mind will be tight if the body is

231
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:46,000
relaxed the mind can relax also

232
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:53,440
so experiment explore for yourself you don't have to take my word for it or the buddhist explore for

233
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,960
yourself be a scientist of your own mind of your own heart

234
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:05,680
of your own body so thank you for the gift of your practice

235
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:11,119
in this sangha and look forward to practicing together

236
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:18,160
tomorrow be well
