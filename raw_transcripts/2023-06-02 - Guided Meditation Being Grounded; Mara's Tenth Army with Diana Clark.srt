00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,240
good morning good morning everybody

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,760
and as I say every day maybe it's not morning where you are so just a warm

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,940
welcome greetings

4
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:40,739
Okay so today is the last day of my stories of

5
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:47,700
Mara these letters that Mara is sending to the leaders of his army

6
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,480
but of course we're going to begin with a guided meditation today

7
00:00:54,140 --> 00:01:00,899
so be like feeling this transition to a sitting practice like taking a few

8
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,119
moments to find a comfortable posture and

9
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,400
take your time to notice how you're sitting and

10
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,438
like feel your way like what does it feel like to be sitting right now

11
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:27,259
and to do that in such a way that your awareness is light and open and spacious

12
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:33,859
adjusting your posture anyway and that feels like it would be helpful

13
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:46,380
and with the awareness being light just noticing sometimes we have a tendency to want to

14
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:52,619
really hold on to whatever the object is that we're noticing

15
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:58,619
can we just be soft and gentle still connected

16
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,920
but with some ease some spaciousness

17
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:09,619
and we're just sitting here

18
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:19,860
and in this moment you don't have to be anything for anybody you don't have to

19
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:26,060
be any particular way we're just sitting here

20
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,840
allowing yourself to arrive to land

21
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,480
In This Moment take in your seat

22
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,360
whether that's a literal or figurative seat

23
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:08,940
but noticing if there's this really subtle pressure we might say that there's a

24
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:15,480
right way to do this and you have to get it right or

25
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,780
see if you can let go of any Nuance or subtle idea like that if

26
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:28,800
it's there and instead just tuning into

27
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:35,900
how things are at this moment

28
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,840
is there a way you can allow

29
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,920
what's here

30
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:14,060
maybe receiving or allowing that chair the cushion

31
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:22,440
matte sees a bench couch whatever it is allowing that to receive

32
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,918
the weight of the body

33
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,960
while also maintaining uprightness

34
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:44,240
this can be a subtle shift

35
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:56,940
the movement of the pressure against the body

36
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,940
it's in contact with the seating support

37
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,860
allowing the weight to the body

38
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:16,638
to be received by whatever it is in contact with

39
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,060
and having this uprightness

40
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:55,020
and just noticing allowing any patterns of tension

41
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,520
that may be in your body

42
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:07,380
sometimes when we notice tension then there's this plethora of thoughts

43
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:14,100
to get rid of it it needs to be different can we just

44
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:21,000
allow both that thought pattern

45
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,180
and any tension in the body

46
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,220
just for now

47
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,680
can we let it be how it is

48
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,099
and then naturally

49
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,419
noticing the body breathing

50
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:34,039
the experience of breathing

51
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:49,520
and noticing with the quality of kindness and allowing

52
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,780
however the breath is

53
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:01,099
can we just notice

54
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:45,539
what would it be like to just abide

55
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,560
with the flowing sensations of breathing

56
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,839
without anything to do

57
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:18,000
we're just abiding noticing

58
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
allowing

59
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,940
being sensitive

60
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:04,399
to any Notions that it has to be different

61
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,120
it should be different

62
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:17,160
can we soften those Notions as best we can

63
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,660
as best we can

64
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,800
okay

noticing that we're lost in thought

72
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:56,699
just very simply gently Begin Again

73
00:15:56,699 --> 00:16:00,500
that the sensations of breathing

74
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:09,000
or begin again with the sensations in the whole body

75
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,500
the bodily experience

76
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:30,720
with the attitude of kindness and allowing

77
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:38,060
yet with a commitment to this meditation practice for this session

78
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:53,839
so softness allowing isn't the same as casual

79
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,820

00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:34,500
good day hello I love you

93
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:41,039
joining us on the fifth and the last day of this series that I'm doing on these

94
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:49,039
um letters from Mara to the leaders of his ten armies

95
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:54,240
Mara as many of you know is this character that we find in the Buddhist

96
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:02,340
teachings and I'm not concerning myself with exactly what Mara is or how he works I'm

97
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:07,860
just uh inspired Maybe by some of the things that are getting pointed out in

98
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:14,460
these letters from Mara to his uh armies are often topics that we don't talk

99
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:20,340
about so much in Buddhist teachings and Derma talks and yet

100
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:25,799
these things that are Mara that get personified as Mara are things that get

101
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:31,080
in the way things that might hinder us or obstruct us in our ways towards

102
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:37,620
freedom and then to be sure these letters from Mara are nowhere in the poly Canon these

103
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:44,640
were written by ajan punadamo in the arrow River Forest Hermitage up in

104
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:50,399
Northern Ontario and so in the public Canon we do find

105
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:56,460
just a mention that Mara has these 10 armies and then who's in the ajanta

106
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:01,799
lineage uh kind of set in contemporary times these letters which I think are

107
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:07,320
delightful and a little bit cutting just in the way that they're pointing to in a

108
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,840
way that feels a little bit uncomfortable sometimes this Human Experience

109
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:18,539
so I've been excerpting portions of these letters and I will be especially

110
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:24,600
be doing that for this last one that I'm doing today which is a long letter and has a number

111
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:33,480
of different uh sub-categories to it but I'll just be pointing to one and the art that that's being pointed to

112
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:41,220
today in this letter from Mara is the 10th Army which often gets a translated as self

113
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:49,500
praise and denigration of others I'll just be looking at a little portion of that so here's this letter excerpt

114
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,399
that's written by

115
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:02,940
to my bold and Powerful 10th Army greetings your task is crucial yet fortunately for

116
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:08,700
us it is also easy generally humans have a most

117
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:14,099
unreasonable attitude of taking themselves quite seriously

118
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:20,460
they seem quite unable to mentally disengage from the eagle ego perspective

119
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:28,858
let them think of themselves as truly wonderful and righteous fill them up with pride this is the task of you

120
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:37,500
the first division of the tenth Army self-praise fuels all the defilements it

121
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:43,260
is a Masterwork of delusion humans look into the mirror with rose colored

122
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:48,658
glasses they become quite unable to see their own faults and bristle with

123
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:54,240
indignation whenever these are pointed out to them and self-praise of course

124
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:59,339
also fuels attachment and sensuality after all because if someone as

125
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:03,980
wonderful as me deserve a little fun

126
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:10,680
self-praise also fires up anger the fierce anger of the self-righteous who

127
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:17,940
knows their views and opinions are correct and everyone else is an idiot

128
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:24,680
it's also it's so amusing to watch two humans egos Clash

129
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:31,260
the forces of the tenth Army have a special role to play in these difficult cases where an individual shows signs of

130
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:37,380
spiritual progress if they begin to free themselves of the

131
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:44,820
coarser snares of my other armies we can often use their own victories against

132
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:50,579
them by encouraging a spiritual Pride

133
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:57,839
and arrogance whisper in their ear about what wonderful Spiritual Beings they are

134
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:05,940
look at me the great holy person this is a trap that has caught many fish

135
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:12,180
however you should be aware that there's also a large number of humans that have

136
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:18,960
a very negative self-image both the positive and the negative

137
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,180
version suit our purposes quite well so if you cannot convince them that they

138
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:31,740
are wonderful then encourage them to kick themselves for being such losers

139
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:38,160
remember there are three kinds of conceit I am better than you

140
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:44,280
I am worse than you and I am equal to you

141
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:51,300
any one of these is still a conceit I'm still reinforces duality in fact there

142
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:57,300
are signs that in the modern culture the negative form has become predominant and

143
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:03,000
a great many humans don't like themselves very much

144
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:10,200
encourage them in the opinion that they are as individuals inadequate

145
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:18,359
wow ouch this is like so painful to hear like this idea that there's this Mara

146
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:23,460
creature quote unquote out there who is encouraging humans to feel like they're

147
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:29,460
inadequate as a way to obstruct their spiritual progress as a way to get in

148
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:34,760
the way of having greater Freedom greater ease and greater peace

149
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:42,540
and we don't need to imagine this Mythic Mara Mara character

150
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:51,839
to recognize the role of the inner critic that it might have in our lives not everybody has this as a dominant or

151
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:57,359
obvious feature but many of us do so this inner critic this almost like a

152
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:02,760
sub personality that's inside of us that's constantly putting us down or

153
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:08,339
ability belittling us and with self-judgment or blaming ourselves

154
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:14,099
nagging at ourselves having this sense of Shame for who we are and how we do

155
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:19,640
things with this quality of harshness

156
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:28,619
and when this inner critic is up and running it's not always there but when it is there's this feeling of inadequacy

157
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:34,020
this sense of not being enough I'm not worthy

158
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:41,160
who I am or how I am is not enough somehow and there's so much pain

159
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:46,820
so much duka that is caught up in this structure

160
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:53,880
for some people it's such a prevalent and ongoing part of their inner experience it might even be difficult to

161
00:38:53,880 --> 00:39:01,619
conceive that it might be otherwise and some people feel like it's just them

162
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:07,079
they feel like everybody else must have it together everybody except me

163
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:13,440
but I assure you this is such a prevalent form of

164
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:20,640
one's inner life and it's important to know that we're not alone in this right it's even

165
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,920
written by ajan punadamo which I think his letters were written number of

166
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:33,000
decades ago so it's understandable that people have this inner critic we learn it from

167
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:40,500
society from family from school but it's important to not blame ourselves

168
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:45,599
for having this dynamic as part of our inner life

169
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:51,119
right that's just the inner critic trying to pretend that it's not the

170
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:57,920
inner critic because the inner critic always shows up using the first person pronouns

171
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:04,619
I'm not good enough I need to do more so it's difficult to recognize you might

172
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:10,200
think like oh this is just the way it is but it's just the inner critic

173
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:15,839
and you might even ask yourself right now what is the picture

174
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:21,720
you hold in your mind about how your supposed to be

175
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:27,119
do you have this sense of how you're supposed to quote unquote supposed to be

176
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:34,680
is there like this unnoticed image propelling you towards this idea that you must have a

177
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:40,560
certain appearance or status or livelihood or you have to be Charming or

178
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,660
funny or Lively or intelligent like all these things

179
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:51,420
you might even say with regarding to meditation is there a picture in your mind of how you should be when you're

180
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:58,980
meditated or because you're a meditator you might have this idea oh yeah I should always be peaceful and calm and

181
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:05,220
wise never having more anger or sadness or

182
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:11,579
anything like this so without any judgment without any

183
00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:19,320
Judgment at all can we notice what are some of these ideas or pictures in our minds

184
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:26,280
because we want to step out of this tendency for the inner critic to judge

185
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:31,560
and evaluate us and instead to like step into

186
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:39,359
curiosity noticing allowing

187
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:45,740
and this is the way that we can work with this inner critic

188
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:52,079
is with this openness this curiosity this allowing this warmth

189
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:58,079
so some ways might be do do some loving kindness practice so bring in some

190
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:04,380
kindness into our mindfulness practice and to give the inner critics some space

191
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:10,380
right because if we're trying to get rid of it or make it be different then that's just the inner critic showing up

192
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:15,540
to trying to pretend it's something else working on the inner critic

193
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:22,320
so it might do some loving kindness practice some of the deep friendliness

194
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:28,619
towards ourselves we might imbue our meditation practice

195
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:33,900
and to be sure when the scenery of the inner critic is up and running it might

196
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:42,119
feel like there's like loving kindness is ridiculous I can't even do that that's not what's going to help

197
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:47,339
but just this recognition that when the inner critic is up and running and we

198
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:55,619
believe it when it has this certain authority to it to recognize that that is just the one

199
00:42:55,619 --> 00:43:01,619
perception at that moment that's like the mood at that moment it's

200
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:08,420
not truth even though it's trying to be very persuasive

201
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:15,780
instead it's the thoughts of the inner critic is just this tight habitual way

202
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:20,940
thinking about things and some loving kindness practice allows us to set up

203
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:26,940
these different habits of thinking different orbits of thinking

204
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:34,859
and when these alternative different constellations of thoughts and experiences arise the inner critic just

205
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:40,740
runs out of energy it just loses its power

206
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:47,280
so it's not that we have to get rid of that inner critic it's more that we're just fueling

207
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:53,040
cultivating developing alternative but then the inner critic just kind of

208
00:43:53,040 --> 00:44:01,380
drains itself of its Authority so one way to work with the inner critics with loving kindness practice

209
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:06,660
in any way that feels appropriate and nourishing be careful sometimes the

210
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:13,800
inner critic gets in there with love and kindness so it might be just loving kindness only rare it's easy

211
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:20,760
only where it's easy the second thing we can do with living I'm sorry with working with them inner

212
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:29,339
critic is to bring mindfulness with some kindness and in particular I

213
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:36,359
would say mindfulness of the body bringing into the tangible felt

214
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:42,599
experience of this moment with some kindness some openness some

215
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:48,119
spaciousness allowing but again will drain some of the

216
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:56,520
Authority or momentum behind this inner critic so can we just let the inner critic be

217
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:03,900
there recognize it's there and cultivate love and kindness and

218
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:10,819
cultivate mindfulness of the body with some warmth and spaciousness

219
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:16,319
so with that we end our series on letters from Mara

220
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:23,460
where I looked at a subset of the letters and excerpted some of these letters from ajan pundamo

221
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:28,700
I wish you all a wonderful weekend thank you
