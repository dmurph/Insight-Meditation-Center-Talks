1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:08,679
so welcome everyone to IMC and for those of you online who are also attending

2
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:15,200
welcome and um so uh I think I think it's my

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,640
pleasure to uh talk about mindful speaking

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,439
one of the one of the joys of this work that I

5
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:34,320
do is when people come to me and say "Well this mindfulness meditation is good but how do we apply it to life how

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,480
do I integrate into the rest of my life not just in meditation?" And one of the really

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:48,320
significant ways is to practice mindful speaking and uh in fact uh I think that

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:55,520
mindful speaking is um just mindfulness out loud now if you practice mindful

9
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,760
mindfulness by yourself internally you're just recognizing what's really happening there in a truthful way and

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,439
learn and learning to tell yourself or recognize it what's happening not only

11
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,720
truthfully what's happening internally but also beginning to recognize it in a

12
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,799
way that's useful beneficial it benefits you to recognize it in a way that's kind

13
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:26,080
that's supportive of you it's certainly possible to know what's going on inside and treat it as bad bad and unwelcome

14
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,600
news and one more reason to be critical of yourself mindfulness is turning that

15
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,439
around and using mindfulness as a way to start having a positive relationship

16
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,680
with oneself so that something different can happen than that couldn't happen if

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,200
we're critical angry upset we're caught in greed and all kinds of things

18
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,880
so the same thing in our external world we're learning how to be mindful mindful

19
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:02,799
out loud one of the reasons why mindfulness of speaking is so useful is uh it's

20
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,920
useful to understand yourself better uh it's a way of looking and understanding

21
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:16,360
tracking what you're saying and why you say it uh many people speak uh without

22
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:22,480
really much care to what they say uh there's a kind of a little quote that

23
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,720
goes around sometimes that says that uh many people take more care in how they

24
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,879
dress than what they say but uh what we say has a much bigger impact on our life

25
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:43,040
and our so communal life than how we dress and um and so to start seeing what

26
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,640
am I doing here when I speak what motivates it uh why am I saying what I'm

27
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,920
about to say this it creates a tremendous useful

28
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:00,959
window into your inner life why am I saying this really is that the reason um

29
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,560
you know you might say well the person asked me a question so I'm just going to you know I'm just answering the question

30
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,480
that's why but then if you look more deeply well I want the person to like me i want the

31
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,480
person to see that I knowledgeable and I know how to you know and there's all these different motivations that are

32
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,800
operating at the same time and so to stop and take it have the ability to take a deeper look to track what's going

33
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:31,000
on as it's going on another another area that mindful speaking is

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,640
useful is that uh uh if you pace your day and so that your day you'd go about

35
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,680
the day at the speed of mindful speaking

36
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,920
how fast would you do things uh how fast would you speak uh

37
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,760
maybe maybe you want to speak fast and furiously but if you want to bring

38
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,959
mindfulness into your life then you might want to consider the speed in which you speak

39
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:10,720
and and you know any speed is fine for mindfulness practice provided you can track it while you're saying it you can

40
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:17,280
track it before you say it you're kind of tracking you know the impulses you know what's inside of you and you can

41
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,639
kind of then live more wisely so there's a lot of self-standing

42
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:29,600
a lot of development and growth of mindfulness that's uh that happens if we begin practicing it in our social life

43
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,840
communal life around mindfulness of speaking another reason for mindfulness uh of

44
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:44,479
speech is so that we can create good relationships with people around us with the world so that we can create a better

45
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:51,520
world um because speech is uh uh has a big impact on uh on other people and

46
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,240
ourselves the world we live in and uh rather than creating more animosity more

47
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:03,680
hurt more uh conflict can we speak in a way that does the opposite that uh

48
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:12,680
creates more concord that creates more friendship that creates uh more healing in this world more unity rather than

49
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:19,360
divisiveness and so if you're able to track your speech then you can kind of begin seeing is this really what I want

50
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:27,720
to say is this the best way of saying it is there a better way of saying it so in the Buddhist tradition there are

51
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,800
guidelines or signposts maybe that um

52
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,520
are presented offered to track what you're saying and the questions to ask

53
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:45,600
yourself and um and this could be as you're speaking but um maybe a place

54
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,360
where it can be even harder to do this and in speaking is in emails or texting

55
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,199
or something where it doesn't have to be as quick socially you know s long

56
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:03,120
periods of silence are kind of awkward but uh you know to be silent for 10

57
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,400
minutes not respond right away it's not such a big deal to take it a little bit

58
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,160
while maybe even to compose something and not send it and say come back five minutes later and you is this what I

59
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:22,479
want to do what's the impact is this what does this express here and then you can ask yourself these questions

60
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:28,280
uh uh is it the right time to communicate it is it

61
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:38,800
timely is it uh truthful does it express the truth uh is it uh uh uh beneficial

62
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,120
to say what I'm about to say to write what I'm about to write and is it uh is

63
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,600
it kind does it come from a place of goodwill there's sometimes a fifth one that's

64
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,800
offered and that is um I don't know if I really know what the poly word means but

65
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,240
some translators translated as gentle uh it's possible it means

66
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:09,840
beautiful it's possible it means polite but you know so uh most common

67
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,800
translations is it gentle gentle speech is it polite speech is it

68
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:21,319
um but there so the first one is it timely is it the time right time for

69
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:26,960
something and uh that goes for me very closely connected to this idea of is it

70
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:34,400
effective is it is it useful to say what I'm going to do because some things are important to say but the timing of when

71
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:41,199
you say it is really important people might not be ready to hear it they might not be able to process it and respond to

72
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:48,560
it um if you say it you know uh turning your head as you leave as you leave hey

73
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,080
by the way you and then you off you're running to catch the bus or something uh

74
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:02,160
there's no processing there's no chance to kind of work with it and interact with it and clarify it or hear their

75
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,479
response or see what the response is so is it the right time to say something

76
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:16,319
uh I receive emails sometimes that uh maybe it was in some ways maybe um it

77
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:22,000
was not the right time because email is not a good way to communicate the nuance

78
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,960
of attitude and emotions that's behind what's being said and I've kind of uh

79
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:34,479
misread an emotion either didn't see the emotion in it or saw emotions that

80
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:41,518
weren't there so is it this the right time to communicate what I want want to communicate maybe a phone call is better

81
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,640
maybe there's another way maybe a wait there are sometimes that I have waited a

82
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:53,360
long time to have an important conversation with someone because I felt that they were closed to having it and

83
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,399
it was it didn't make any sense to it's I had every right to say something you

84
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:04,080
would think but being right doesn't mean it's going to work

85
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,959
and so uh is it the right time so to to ask yourself that question and that's a

86
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,560
difficult question to ask for some of us because the impulse to speech is can be

87
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:23,519
quite strong and where I see it is uh when I'm ready to speak before a person

88
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:30,000
has stopped speaking i don't know if any of you have that issue you know I'm just sometimes you

89
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,120
know I'm not just like you know just can't wait sometimes I I you know don't in a social conversation or something I

90
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,399
I don't really hear the second half of what they're saying because I'm in my

91
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:51,720
mind I'm telling them what I feel is important to say and so uh so um

92
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,399
um so to take time

93
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:03,040
listen so then uh and um so that's one question slows you down is ask ask the

94
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:10,279
question is this the right time the second is is it the truth and that has a

95
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:15,399
multi-layered kind of analysis consideration

96
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:24,000
um what is the truth uh is how you feel the truth

97
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,839
uh maybe it's true as a feeling but maybe it's not true as a judgment

98
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:38,800
And that that line between an emotion or feeling we have and it being the truth

99
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:46,160
about a situation out there the lens through which we see it is a kind of ambiguous world and sometimes what we

100
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:54,800
say we're saying what's true um um you know I feel that you're

101
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:02,839
awful and that was true statement right i had this feeling but actually it's a

102
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:08,079
judgment and uh and maybe it's welling up quite powerfully as a powerful

103
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:13,440
impulse inside something's really uncomfortable or strong inside but you

104
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:20,480
know you know you have to be very careful what we say is that really true what might be more true is say uh

105
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,720
hearing what you have to say I'm feeling quite uncomfortable I feel unsettled now

106
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,640
I wonder if we can talk about it um that's getting closer to the truth

107
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:38,240
but then you ask the question is it timely to say that if you uh maybe not

108
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:45,279
maybe some people just they hear that you're uncomfortable makes them so uncomfortable they shut down or so

109
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,360
uncomfortable they leave they don't want to you know want to bother or they

110
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,760
can't is it is it true

111
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,760
um is all truth right to say some people feel that

112
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,360
they justified to say something if it's true but that's the uh next guideline is

113
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,200
that um uh is it beneficial does it benefit is it useful

114
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:19,279
is it strategic is it effective and so um I

115
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:26,480
mean I I've thought about this sometimes in political discourse people can be right maybe they they believe they're

116
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:33,279
right the people they have a right to say what they're going to say they have justice on their side so of course they

117
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,399
should speak up but is it effective what's the impact

118
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,920
it's going to have is it is it beneficial the impact and a lot of

119
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:50,079
political discourse uh in all kinds of directions uh people feel it's true they

120
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:55,399
feel it's just to say it but it's received in a way that actually is

121
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:01,839
counterproductive and you might you know be yelling and screaming and because feeling you have every right to say

122
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:08,839
something and maybe you do but the question is is it effective is it

123
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:14,959
beneficial and then you can ask yourself your question and beneficial in what way

124
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:20,720
how are you trying to benefit from the situation if it's simply to make yourself safe

125
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:28,160
that's certainly sometimes important to do but is that the only thing that's necessary to do or important to do what

126
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:35,760
about the relationship you have with the other person how about c can you create a a friendly relationship a mutually

127
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:42,959
supportive rel relationship and so then the other guideline is is that is there meta is

128
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:49,760
there goodwill in the communication we have and um and goodwill means that we

129
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,120
also care about the other person's welfare we want them to be happy and

130
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,000
that's a high bar to because they don't deserve it

131
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:09,040
they've you know they've they've disrespected me they they're in the wrong they really messed up and caused a

132
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:15,199
lot of tr trouble and you know they were mean so of course they don't they were so mean they don't deserve any goodness

133
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:20,320
for me uh they've they've now forfeited all rights to receive anything good for

134
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:27,240
me and I'm going to give them peace of my mind people don't think that way I don't

135
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:33,199
think but sometimes they operate that way because we don't stop to look at and

136
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:41,440
think what are we doing here what's going on here the impulse to speak sometimes is so strong and unexamined

137
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,720
so the Buddha keeps emphasizing examine what's going on when you speak look at

138
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:55,040
it and so can you can you have goodwill can you aim to create a healthy

139
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,160
relationship here can you somehow break break through the meanness or the

140
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:09,279
closeness or the hostility that might be here it's not an easy thing to do but um but

141
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,320
maybe it's better than making the situation worse sometimes the best way

142
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:22,680
to deal with all these criteria uh somehow to cope with them is is not

143
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:28,639
speak just be silent and one of the guidelines is if if speaking is going to

144
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:35,519
make it worse maybe don't say anything some people will protest but but but you have

145
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:42,720
to speak you know you have to fight for the good cause you have to set things right you have to have to you know but

146
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,560
maybe if you're making situation worse maybe you don't speak maybe wait and

147
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,839
this is where mindfulness of speaking comes into into play in big time the

148
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:59,959
mindful speaking also means knowing how to speak at the right time the first

149
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:05,519
criteria which might mean after After you've paused for a while after you've

150
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,639
been silent for a while after you say "Can can I take a breath or two can we

151
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:17,199
pause that was a big impact on me before I speak can can we just take three breaths together?" Or "Can I take three

152
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:22,480
breaths?" And then I'll try to respond just some kind of pause and I've done

153
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:28,800
that in difficult conversations with people where I was triggered and um and

154
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:36,880
I thought to myself you know Gil uh right now you're not going to say good things you're not capable of it and I I

155
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,120
asked and I asked permission i say to the person I'm having this very difficult conversation with "This is

156
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:50,680
difficult and uh could we pause for a while can we just sit here and breathe for a little bit?" And um and

157
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:57,759
um last time this happened the person was very gracious and said yes i think the person trusted me with that maybe

158
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:03,600
thought they were they were going to be treated better and so I took about two minutes

159
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:11,199
three minutes to get my breath back get my senses back and then I could continue in the conversation but instead I was in

160
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,438
you know it was not going to work so sometimes not

161
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:24,240
speaking and then can we speak with goodwill can we care about the other person's welfare as well and one one

162
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,960
reflection I do sometimes is that uh when someone is

163
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,679
hostile mean they're hurting chances are that their meanness

164
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:43,039
and hostility represents some suffering they have does that justify that they're

165
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:48,679
mean or hostile no but to know that means

166
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:54,080
oh they're hurting of course I want to care for them they're hurting i don't

167
00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:02,799
want to make it worse can we find another way to have this conversation can we talk in a way that uh uh uh

168
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:09,120
fosters some kind of mutual understanding some kind of mutual care for each other some kind of friendliness

169
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,160
friendship for each other and then the last criteria is to

170
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:20,160
be gentle or to be have beautiful speech kind speech and I've said it already but

171
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:26,760
beautiful speech polite speech um some people say this is the opposite of harsh

172
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:34,480
speech uh and um so I don't know what you think the opposite of harsh speech is but uh harsh speech is speech which

173
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:41,320
uh just a tone of it is harmful so can you do a tone of voice which

174
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:49,760
is makes space for people that uh is not doineering not not filling the space but

175
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:58,279
makes room for a dialogue to go on so um

176
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,679
um so of course you don't have to do any of this if you don't want but if you

177
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:12,720
have the question how do I bring my mindfulness practice into my social life my community life this is a really

178
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,760
effective way it's not easy for most people some people for some people it

179
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:25,919
seems like mindfulness of speaking is the most difficult area of life to be mindful in because uh when we're talking

180
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:32,240
we get pulled into our concerns our emotional life our impulses our desires

181
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,840
there's so such a complex world that we get pulled into that um in relationship

182
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,160
to other people that sometimes we we're not really tracking ourselves very

183
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:50,480
well but the benefits of doing it are immense huge uh we learn about ourselves we

184
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:57,000
learn how to stay balanced in ourselves stay healthy in ourselves to stay closer to a place of

185
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,640
well-being we don't give oursel we don't give up on ourselves when you're mindful of speaking tracking

186
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:09,480
it and you uh we um create better relationships in the

187
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:17,200
world relationships then which are um that uh have a feedback loop where they

188
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:27,600
come back to benefit us the more we can develop friendly relationship other people the more that we can um

189
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:34,559
um I had a conversation recently with this person who many years ago I had that difficult conversation where I had

190
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:41,080
to ask can we pause and um and

191
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:47,360
uh and I was pretty angry so you know it was kind of difficult time and uh she

192
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:54,880
said "Gil you've always been so supportive of me and so accepting of me and I just feel your love for me." And I

193
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,720
said "But but but we had that time." And uh and she said "Yeah yeah

194
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:09,840
that you know that didn't matter you know your your your good intent was there." Um so anyway so so somehow you

195
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,200
know that relationship continued and is now a warm friendly relationship in a

196
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:23,640
nice way so um so mindfulness of

197
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:30,480
speaking so that's the topic and so now you get to practice it so for those of

198
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:39,600
you who want to stay and those of you who don't want to be want to stay and don't want to be part of this can just sit quietly and uh or you know get some

199
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:45,760
water and just hang out until we come back but the invitation is for you to of

200
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,360
go into small groups of maybe three people uh and uh just look around you

201
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,679
and you make your groups and no one's end up left alone because sometimes everyone goes to the you know to their

202
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:03,520
left and their right and then you know they're just sitting there and like so everyone you know look for the make sure

203
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:11,080
everyone's included and um and then maybe you could offer some words uh of your own

204
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:18,480
experience or inspiration for mindful speaking what have you learned so far or

205
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,480
in what way are you inspired by these words today or other ways to uh find a

206
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,520
way to be attentive to you more carefully attentive more deeply

207
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:36,559
attentive to speaking as you speak okay so we'll do that for about 10 minutes

208
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:43,200
and then we'll ring a bell and we'll come back as a group as a whole and have a few more words and in here and then

209
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,880
we'll stop in time for the potluck so thank you

210
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:56,039
please so how much mindfulness mindfulness was

211
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:02,400
there of speech you can it's possible to talk about

212
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:09,600
mindful speaking and not be mindful while you're talk while you're doing it but it was very nice it felt like a

213
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:16,880
nice happy set of conversations to witness from here this place any uh

214
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,440
questions or comments about this topic yes so if you could uh use the

215
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:28,600
mic just that people online can't hear

216
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:38,960
um I I have a question we were talking about um feeling the need to feel the the

217
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:46,240
silence in conversations um because I I feel the need to do that like I'm doing a little

218
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,280
closer um but so I I feel like I can Oh yeah

219
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:57,360
yeah i can be mindful but um it like those awkward silences and pauses in

220
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:04,520
conversations are where I have trouble like taking a step back yeah yeah yeah

221
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:11,279
so some people are not com a lot of people are not comfortable with silences and uh so you might have to

222
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:16,559
contextualize it for people you say you know uh uh you know we've been talking

223
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:23,360
for a while now and I need to get my bearings i wonder can we be quiet for a little bit or can I can I excuse myself

224
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:30,159
for a moment or the the the really sly thing to do is to is to say uh excuse me

225
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:37,520
I need to go to the bathroom and uh and no one's going to ask you what

226
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,960
you're doing there and what you're the reason you need to go to the bathroom is you want

227
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,720
to pause in the conversation and then you've gotten the free pass to have you know two three minutes five minutes

228
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,960
alone to process so so no it is hard to in these

229
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:03,360
conversations yeah okay and also it depends where you do the conversations also um sometimes

230
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,400
if you invite the person to go for a walk with you sometimes in walking it's

231
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:15,200
easier to be have longer pauses than if you're sitting kind of facing each other or something um yeah i'm thinking like

232
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:22,640
the context of like a new social environment where you feel pressure to speak to somebody you don't know and

233
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:29,919
could you hold up oh sorry i'm gonna I'm doing it again i'm feeling in in the context of that

234
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,440
environment I will go into those situations and be like anxious and then

235
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:41,159
say probably say too much or like overshare because I'm filling the space

236
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:46,559
yeah yeah yeah so yeah i mean I don't know what to

237
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:52,880
suggest i mean it's a social world is difficult world to be in so you it's not an easy to say this is what you can do

238
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:59,799
and the expectations and the cultures can be so different and people are anxious people are everyone's nervous so

239
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:05,840
everyone's trying to cope so it's hard to know but there's a few things that

240
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:12,240
sometimes are helpful and that is um show an interest in them and uh and so

241
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,520
so you can be quiet because you you've asked them questions and they're talking

242
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:23,760
and uh and people appreciate that your interest and then you don't you're kind of off the hook for a little while so

243
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:29,760
you can kind of process and and maybe as you're listening to them perhaps and um

244
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:37,279
and uh and then there's also active listening where you not only ask them questions but you also um affirm what

245
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:46,640
they're saying or you kind of uh just say something like oh so you you're new here you know they

246
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:53,279
something or you so so you know there's there's things you can say that might slow the conversation down uh so that

247
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:58,799
you you're you're not on the on the center stage like you feel

248
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:03,919
like you have to say something that uh about yourself or something wise just

249
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:12,039
ask them that can help yeah that that did help thank you

250
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:24,480
okay thanks Kil um it's great and smooth when you talk it's easy that it it it

251
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:30,200
will work but in reality when it comes to family it never works

252
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:38,240
so right um I think um for me uh what somebody's working is

253
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:45,279
um just accepting them and just accepting the way they are right um with

254
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:51,360
family friends and everything else is so easy yeah uh just accepting and then not

255
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,480
thinking about myself too much it's like oh my god Gil said this and you know I

256
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:02,000
think that helps but the relationship does change there's nothing I can do about it so I don't know if you have to

257
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,760
say something sounds like you're finding your way with your family how to be with them the the

258
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:13,200
relationship changes you know even if I'm quiet right so yeah yeah yeah i don't I don't feel like I can really say

259
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:21,159
anything because every family is going to have very different dynamics and and and uh and different capacities

260
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:28,559
and so you've been you're working with it for a while so you know it sounds like you're finding your way but uh but

261
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:34,080
you might for yourself internally ask yourself those questions is this the time to bring something up because

262
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,760
imagine sometimes you bring it up and um is this the time you know is this is

263
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,120
this uh effective or is this going to be useful to say this now and is there a

264
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:52,120
better more useful time or more useful way of saying it so you might have more agency around when you speak and how you

265
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:57,679
speak than uh what other people contribute and and expect so and

266
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,720
sometimes you know sometimes uh you can plan what you're going to say and you

267
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:09,679
know it's usually not best not try to memorize it but you can think it out ahead of time so if you have kids maybe

268
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:16,559
when they're at school think about what you know how you know you need to talk to them about cleaning their room and so

269
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:21,760
you know when do you do that and what's a good time to do it and when when do you when do you think you can get their

270
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:28,640
attention in a way that they really can take it in and uh oh you know if I make

271
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,640
their favorite cookie and uh and lay it out on the

272
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,399
kitchen table in a nice way so they have to come and sit to the kitchen table to eat their cookie and it might be there

273
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:46,000
there's a little bit space to say something here by the way you know I want to I know I've been brought brought

274
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,200
up this issue of the room your room but I want to let you know that um uh it

275
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:57,200
kind of it kind of hurts me to have this never taken care of so you kind of

276
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:04,240
create the conditions for the conversation that maybe is u so there's there's a lot of uh thinking ahead

277
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:11,080
sometimes thank you

278
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:20,600
i mean don't ask me these questions as if I'm the expert probably no one

279
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:26,919
is it's a work in progress for all of us

280
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:33,520
uh my question is um how to not have a checklist approach you know it's it's a

281
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,559
lot of work to constantly ask these five questions to myself like in every single

282
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:43,760
conversation cuz I've been trying to practice it for a while and is is there

283
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:51,760
a simpler way like just being with the body or being with the breath or I don't know like something

284
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:59,360
practical i I think that's a very good question and the idea that this being

285
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:04,880
more centered in your body mindful of your body uh usually creates more space

286
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:12,559
to see what's happening in the mind see what the impulses are and so you can be wiser about it and uh and just your your

287
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:17,760
innate wisdom might operate just fine take care of the situation it might

288
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,960
might also be though if you give some time reflecting and thinking about these five categories maybe one at a

289
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:30,000
time that after a while they become second nature and so they operate just

290
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,120
kind of they're not part of now you don't have to go through the list it's just that as as you give yourself more

291
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:41,039
space to be present they're kind of there in the background and it's kind of obvious after a while that you're

292
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:46,880
oriented that way makes sense

293
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:55,120
thank you so so one more in the back

294
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:01,279
this is kind of a follow on on on on that but uh I mean I obviously not

295
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:07,240
obviously I see the you know I can resonate with the value of right speech

296
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:13,679
and thinking about these things but it also when I think about doing it in the

297
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,960
midst of a conversation it feels terribly artificial like it am I going

298
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,320
to Yeah yeah yeah yeah you I mean to slow

299
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:30,440
down the conversation said wait wait wait I have to go through my five lists my

300
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:36,399
criteria yeah that that's kind of artificial uh but as I said these things

301
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:41,760
can become second nature after a while and so you don't have to think about them it's just like they waft up it's

302
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:47,120
like you can see oh this is not kind you know and and it must be probably I

303
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,640
should be quiet until I can a kinder thing comes up to say um or this is not

304
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:58,360
true you know so it becomes second nature after a while hopefully and then

305
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:05,200
um as as was just said um just just uh being grounded in your body being

306
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:11,600
centered and being present here for your own experience goes a long way to create

307
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:18,559
uh the kind of natural the kind of space for kind of a natural wisdom to operate that uh if we uh if we're losing oursel

308
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:24,880
in a conversation chances are you've lost touch with your body

309
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,919
thank you yeah and the body gives us a lot of information about what goes on

310
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:38,799
interpersonally the tensions in the body the postures of the body the agitations in the body the warmth in the body the

311
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:46,080
the softness that comes in so a lot of different things a lot of information there that informs us about what our

312
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:53,679
relationship to what's going on and the more we can take that in the wiser we'll be in the in the

313
00:33:55,159 --> 00:34:00,480
conversation okay well uh I'm very confident that you'll have lots of

314
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,799
opportunities to practice and so just doing a little bit

315
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:12,878
of it can go a long way don't don't you know don't tie yourself in knots uh by

316
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:20,000
all these all these criteria but just just starting starting to open up this door of mindfulness of speaking is a

317
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:27,040
powerful door it's invaluable and in the process you'll learn a lot about yourself and as you learn about yourself

318
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:32,878
you'll be wiser about the things you say how you say it so everyone's welcome to

319
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:38,398
stay for the potluck and uh whether you're brought anything for it or not it

320
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:46,320
it's just an excuse for us to get together and and be friendly and get to know each other so uh so uh I don't know

321
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,520
it'll take a few minutes to do the final setup and then there'll be some

322
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:58,960
indication that we can start to serve each other and serve ourselves and then uh please please um I think there's a

323
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,640
circle that's formed yeah the fo's formed and there's some blessing or the food or something that goes on so um

324
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:10,000
probably in about 5 minutes or so so uh in the meantime you can talk and hang

325
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,680
out and thank you
