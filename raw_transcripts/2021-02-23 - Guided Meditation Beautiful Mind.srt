1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,399
so the warm hello from redwood city here at

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:13,599
the imc and um welcome to our morning meditation

3
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:20,320
here and other times around the world and thank you for the

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,519
people who are greeting on chat it's lovely to see your names

5
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:32,320
and see your location and and to receive the greetings

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,440
when i was practicing in burma i practiced with a teacher named upandita

7
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,280
and his series of his talks were translated and published in english

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:56,000
with a book titled the state of mind called beautiful

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,280
a state of mind called beautiful and of course we can be in many

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,520
different states of mind but the idea that we can also have a state of mind that's beautiful

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,240
i think is quite inspiring and in fact this is what this anapanasati

12
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:22,640
is working towards and buddhist practice in general is for us to discover

13
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:30,320
or cultivate um a state of mind which is quite luminous beautiful

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,119
inspiring in and of itself and one of the i've been fortunate to

15
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:43,600
see many beautiful places in the world and inspiring sunsets over the sea

16
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:51,520
and all kinds of things and the thing that i've that seems that i

17
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,360
have for me has been the most beautiful thing to see is the beautiful mind

18
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,280
and why that's incomparable with the beauty of nature or beauty

19
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,479
other kinds of beauty i can't quite explain but maybe because

20
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,080
it's so subjective or so intimate while the same time as not being

21
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,920
personal something quite wondrous and uh

22
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:28,560
so with the ninth step of anapanasati the direction is to experience the mind

23
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:35,680
and so it's shifting from what it's kind of

24
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,720
like shifting from what to how and if i really want something if

25
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,319
i go to the supermarket and i really need something quickly

26
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:52,239
maybe we're having a big family dinner and everything's dependent

27
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,400
upon getting you know having salt and there's no salt at home and so

28
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,840
everything's gonna we need to get salt so i'm sent to the store to get salt and

29
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,319
i've never bought salt in the store i bought many things but somehow i can't remember ever having bought salt

30
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:18,000
and but i'm in a hurry and guests are coming and and and so all i'm focused on

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,040
is getting the salt and i'm searching the aisles searching the

32
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,720
names of things on the aisles to see where they have the salt and and i don't notice anything else in the

33
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,519
store but looking for the salt and and then when i finally get the salt i just focus on getting to the checkout

34
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,920
counter and the shortest line and my mind is completely consumed

35
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,040
with the thing that i want and nothing i don't really notice too

36
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:56,080
much anything else because it's so important to get that salt so it's all about the what the mind has

37
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,760
and um but maybe the end of the day if all this busyness of something i sit

38
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,799
down and then i realize how i am

39
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,239
and i realize that i'm tired and maybe tense from searching for salt and

40
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,079
and the residue is still in me and all that and so i can feel a little bit how i am

41
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:24,880
but the initial how i am has to do with why i feel kind of tight in my shoulders and my belly i'm

42
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,240
weary in my face and and i feel a little bit discouraged that i should

43
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,639
pitch a big thing that got caught up in salt and so it's still about a what even i'm

44
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:44,160
feeling conventionally how i am but as i settle in and step back i notice something

45
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:51,759
that's very different and then as i notice how i am how the mind is

46
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:58,320
how the mind is that's processing all this how the mind is that knows

47
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,800
how the mind is as it knows searching for salt how the mind is when it knows how it

48
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:12,000
knows i'm tired and weary how the mind is and it's kind of like

49
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,840
the mind is the container or the reference point for receiving experience

50
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,919
and it's the state of mind it's not a thing but it's still a state that we can

51
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,280
feel and uh and that is when we that's where

52
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,880
the beauty begins to show itself and something very special about that shift

53
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:45,440
to the how rather than the what's of our experience the the how which is the how we're aware

54
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,880
how the mind is as it operates

55
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:58,240
so with that we'll do a meditation and we'll maybe at some point shift me

56
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:06,000
more to this how and so taking

57
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,759
a assuming a meditative posture

58
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,800
and of course how you are can begin right away how are you in this body

59
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,319
how are you in your posture

60
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:35,039
and to answer that question there is the mind is involved in a what

61
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,039
the particular sensations of the body

62
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:49,840
the position of the body

63
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,000
and then how is your breathing

64
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:04,800
and how are you with noticing your breathing

65
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:12,080
do you have a reaction to how you're breathing a response

66
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:22,160
is there a for and against something or wishing it to be different or want to make it different

67
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:32,160
what happens if you simply just know you're breathing know how you're

68
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,639
breathing

69
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,840
closing your eyes

70
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:54,720
and if it makes sense go inward into your body and feel the places where there might be

71
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,840
tension and holding

72
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:13,840
perhaps you can relax the shoulders release the shoulders

73
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:27,840
relax release the belly

74
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,080
if there's some way to relax or adjust your hands so they're more relaxed

75
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,440
release your hands adjust your hands so

76
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:55,839
there's no tightness in your hands

77
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,320
and is there can there be a softening in the face

78
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,920
in the easing up of all that we hold in the face

79
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,800
around the eyes and the forehead the

80
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,720
cheeks perhaps imagining there's lots of space

81
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,360
in front of the face behind the face

82
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,080
for the muscles of the face to release to relax

83
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:50,160
for the face to rest

84
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,800
then how's your mental activity

85
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:07,360
do you feel is there a lot of energy and thinking or

86
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,600
is the mind sluggish

87
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,200
is there any tension pressure

88
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:33,839
and if there is tension or pressure can you release the mind

89
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,720
release relax the thinking mind

90
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:47,839
quieting your thinking

91
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:28,160
and how is your mind what how is it what's your mental state

92
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:42,959
or the state of your heart heart mind

93
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:51,200
which is very closely related to how is your how are you aware

94
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,839
how are you receiving experience

95
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:26,000
oftentimes what the mind is focused on is the objects of our desires

96
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:34,240
objects of our aversions or the vague

97
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,839
kind of objects of our confusions

98
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:57,760
can you feel the part of the mind that is free of desire

99
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,120
that is not leaning forward or stretching forward

100
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:12,560
focused on having or getting the mind that's free of desire

101
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:22,959
maybe it's a back corner of the mind or a deeper layer of the mind

102
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,199
or something at the center

103
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:39,600
maybe it's something that doesn't have a lot of distinguishing characteristics

104
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:49,839
a feeling of absence

105
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:03,839
is there a part of the mind which is free of aversion

106
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:13,199
part of the mind is not about something not focusing on

107
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,839
something that's not liked

108
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:29,600
a place where there is no aversion and because of that maybe the mind is

109
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,639
not so concerned with what

110
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:45,839
a place where the mind can rest in a peaceful place

111
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:00,800
and can you become aware of a place where the there is no confusion

112
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:11,680
even if there is confusion as well someplace where there is no confusion

113
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,959
because the mind is not

114
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:24,240
focused fixated on a subject something it wants doesn't want

115
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,839
something is trying to understand

116
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:41,839
the part of the mind that can be at rest with itself

117
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:09,839
and then becoming aware now of your overall state of mind

118
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:17,120
the state of mind within which everything you know is known

119
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,639
but a state which is always more than what is known

120
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,680
so it's not something that we know as much as something we feel

121
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,839
a wide open expansive

122
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:51,839
feeling of the state of mind

123
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,360
and so that you don't get too involved in this state of mind looking for it

124
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,839
wanting it

125
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:15,199
fixating on it as you feel your state of mind

126
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:21,199
also be aware of yourself breathing in and breathing out

127
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:30,840
maybe as if breathing in and out you're breathing through the state of

128
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:37,919
mind we're breathing at the very center of the state of mind

129
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:47,840
with a state of mind so wide and broad that it includes breathing within it

130
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,039
breathing in experiencing the mind

131
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:01,840
breathing out experiencing the mind

132
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,200
and perhaps as you shift

133
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,960
from focusing on what you're thinking about

134
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,240
to experiencing the mind experiencing being aware

135
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,480
that this mind this maybe this awareness

136
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:09,200
maybe begins to have no sharp boundaries no edges

137
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:21,120
somehow it's related to the spaciousness around

138
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:28,639
to space not the same but

139
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:38,480
it has qualities of clarity like space or spaciousness like space

140
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:49,840
perhaps stillness like space around you

141
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:59,039
breathing in experiencing this

142
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:17,840
the mind breathing out experiencing the mind

143
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:53,200
as you exhale letting go of all the things you're thinking about

144
00:23:53,200 --> 00:24:04,640
all the what's of life all the objects of thought

145
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,640
and then on the inhale experience

146
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:19,840
your overall state of mind

147
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:29,279
through a role state within which thinking occurs

148
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:35,679
but as a state that's broader than our thoughts and ideas the whats

149
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:46,240
exhaling letting go whatever you're thinking all the what's

150
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,600
inhaling and feeling the

151
00:24:52,880 --> 00:25:00,080
broadness the peacefulness

152
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:15,840
of the state of mind that contains all things within it

153
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:29,840
like a room contains all things within the room

154
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:37,360
and then as we come to the end of this sitting bring to mind some person who

155
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:43,440
you have an uncomplicated relatively uncomplicated relationship

156
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:50,320
and bring them to mind so there's some image of them or sense of them

157
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:58,159
idea of them but rather than your thoughts and

158
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:05,840
memories and desires concerns about about the person

159
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,480
allow the person to just to sense the idea the image of the person whatever

160
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,320
sense you have to just rest

161
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:27,200
in the openness of mind within this general state of how you

162
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:35,679
are there's nothing you have to do about the

163
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:41,200
person but just let them be

164
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:48,720
included in your state of mind through your image your idea your sense of them

165
00:28:52,799 --> 00:29:01,440
so you're not actively relating to them rather just being with them

166
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:13,840
in your mind with your mind

167
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:22,399
if we're relating to them with our desires and our concerns then we're involved with what

168
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:32,480
but if we just allow them to be included in the how we are resting there

169
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,399
not actively relating or wanting or not wanting

170
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:55,840
just allowing the person to be in the peacefulness of the state of mind

171
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:13,919
and now maybe you can with some tenderness or care

172
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:22,000
can you now evoke a mood of good will of kindness for

173
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,600
this person of generosity

174
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:37,440
maybe wishing them well is almost too much

175
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,960
but imagining them well

176
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:52,880
feeling the goodness of their well-being

177
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:07,120
you know gently keeping them in your open spacious attention

178
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:14,960
now wish them well may you be happy

179
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,720
may you be safe

180
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:32,320
may you be peaceful

181
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,440
may you be

182
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,840
free

183
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:56,720
and is there some way that you can learn from how to

184
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:05,679
include someone in your state of mind in this kind of way it is in fact

185
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:11,120
a way to be close to your good will for others

186
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:20,559
rather than rushing into the whats and the shoulds and the doings

187
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,039
as you meet people today in your life

188
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,960
take your time to let them be known

189
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:36,399
to receive and listen and sense them

190
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,360
in a generous state of mind

191
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:50,240
and then perhaps other things can happen and those other things might be related

192
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:57,840
to your good will may this practice of ours support us

193
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:11,840
to meet the people of the world with our good will may all beings be happy

194
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,840
so
