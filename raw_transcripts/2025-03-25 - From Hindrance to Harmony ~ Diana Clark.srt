1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:06,160
so welcome it's an interesting thing that

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,280
if we uh come and have a meditation practice and we have this intention that

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,880
maybe there'll be some calmness that shows up maybe some well-being maybe

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,960
some mindfulness maybe some settledness whatever it might be

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,400
it's interesting that if we come to meditate and we kind of have this orientation or this direction we're

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:37,160
going it requires that we go through the territory of non-comm

7
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:43,079
nonmindfulness nonettlness nonwell-being it's part of the

8
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,879
practice and yet so often kind when we sit down and close our eyes perhaps for

9
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:56,320
meditation we kind of have this idea like well where is it you know where is this uh calmness or well-being that I'm

10
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:03,280
looking for and forgetting or at least I certainly in the early parts of my practice really kind of forgot that no

11
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:10,080
it requires it's part of the practice it's inherent in it that we work with

12
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,799
everything that's not what we're uh or oriented

13
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:21,240
towards so it's not a failing it's not that we're doing something

14
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:30,400
wrong when there's a lot of agitation or a lot of unease or something like

15
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,799
this there's this u analogy that the Buddha speaks about and I'm going to

16
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,119
tweak it a little bit here that and it's analogy that I like a lot it's this idea

17
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:50,200
of when it rains up on the mountain and then there's a rivullet that gets

18
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:57,759
uh made that gets created as the water's going down the mountain and it turns into streams and then it turns into wait

19
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,840
creek and then a streams or you know bigger and bigger whatever words we want to use as it uh goes down eventually to

20
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,160
the ocean but it never just goes straight down boom you know there into the ocean

21
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:17,360
of course not of course not instead there are boulders there are banks there are trees

22
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,760
there's like all these what we might call obstacles maybe but it's not a

23
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,520
problem i mean the water just comes up against it and goes around it goes over

24
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,840
it or or goes a different direction it's not like there's aren't

25
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,640
ever any of these big boulders or obstructions and it's the same way with

26
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,360
practice and part of the reason why I like this uh analogy there's a few one

27
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:54,879
is the stream as it coming down this uh water as it's coming down it has

28
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,560
intimate contact with the boulder the tree the bank the river whatever it is

29
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,480
it's not like it sees oh there's a boulder okay I'm going to go around it no it like runs right into it

30
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,800
experiences it in the same way our practices too we experience these

31
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,000
boulders that's how practice is this is a part of

32
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:26,959
practice the second thing that I like about this idea of this uh analogy metaphor simile whatever way

33
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:33,200
we want to describe it is that it's not a straight line it's meandering right

34
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,480
and even if we see um streams that are in like in deserts or something they're

35
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:45,159
never straight right they there's some way in which the hydrodnamics make it uh curve around a

36
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:51,760
bit that's the way practice is too it's never you know the most uh what we think

37
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:58,159
might be the most efficient or straightforward way or but it has this quality sometimes of meandering or maybe

38
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,599
sometimes there's rapids and going fast and sometimes it's going slow

39
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,519
think about so much this is how kind of like practice unfolds this could be when I say practice unfolds this could be

40
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,360
over a lifetime or maybe just one meditation sit as well or maybe there's

41
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:22,000
a lot of boulders and restlessness and and the mind is kind of going all over the place but maybe eventually kind of

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:30,759
like settles down and kind of like uh has some momentum and starts to go towards more and more settling

43
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:38,720
so there's these ways that uh I mentioned them briefly last week that the Buddha identified thousands of years

44
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,840
ago about what we might call like these there's different ways we could

45
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:51,600
describe them mind states or maybe just energies or patterns or phenomena

46
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,639
there's like all these kind of like vague words we could use to point to

47
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,800
these five types of experiences that sometimes might be considered boulders

48
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,440
but are really are an integral part of practice and it's actually not possible

49
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,720
to practice without them if you're not experiencing these you're not meditating

50
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,160
or you're not alive I would say probably or you're a completely awakened Buddha

51
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:27,120
so one or the other so there's something about them

52
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,759
there these are like very human experiences every human has them whether

53
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:40,320
they are a meditator or not so these uh and I'll describe them in a moment here

54
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,600
but these I'm using this language energies mind states patterns they

55
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,240
affect everybody pretty much almost all the

56
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,600
time like anytime there's been any when you haven't any occasion in which you

57
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:04,600
haven't just gone straight to do precisely what you wanted there's one of these that are at play so with

58
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:11,120
meditation we see them because maybe in a more clear way we have this intention

59
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:17,000
maybe to get settled or calm and then we can notice all the ways in which we are not

60
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,639
calm maybe we don't see them so clearly in our lives but they are there they're

61
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:28,080
showing up in all aspects of our lives and these are often called these

62
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,440
uh hindrances it's often that neva and how it gets translated as

63
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:40,960
hindrances we could say they in meditation they hinder some calmness

64
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,639
maybe they hinder some brightness in the mind or maybe they hinder a sense of

65
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:54,479
well-being in the mind or maybe whatever your uh ex objectives

66
00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,160
are for a sitting for a sitting meditation there's a way right which we don't meditation doesn't always turn out

67
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,240
the way we would like and it's because one of these five is showing

68
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:12,080
up so this list is um there's in a particular order in which they're often

69
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:19,919
given and one is this uh sensual desire this craving for pleasant experiences in

70
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:28,400
such a way that it distracts us from our life from our experience

71
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:35,520
and uh I heard this expression recently that I thought oh maybe this is a modernday way to write about this this

72
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,560
addiction to comfort this way in which like we don't want any discomfort we

73
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:47,120
don't want to be bored we don't want to wait we don't want any discomfort and uh when I look at my life

74
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,360
like all the things objects I have in my living space you know just to be

75
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,400
comfortable soft blankets things to cook food that I like

76
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,599
in the way that I like refrigerators you know but it's just fascinating how we

77
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:10,639
just surround ourselves just to try to um assure that we could have comfort but

78
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,759
life is not always comfortable and if we're always chasing

79
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:22,080
after comfort then we're not uh looking maybe deeply at our life or experiencing

80
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,680
our life deeply instead we're just chasing after the next pleasant experience

81
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,039
so that's the first one it's a commonly said is sensual desire i kind of like

82
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:39,360
this idea addiction to comfort the second is aversion or ill

83
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,600
will this feeling of hostility or maybe some

84
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:51,440
resentment or maybe anger but it also can be really subtle it can be like no

85
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,560
thank you nope nope nope no no no and this also can be related to this

86
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:03,519
addiction to comfort too like no no no i don't want this i don't want this person that's driving in front of me going less

87
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,959
than the speed limit and I'm stuck behind them you know there's this way in which we kind of feel like don't they

88
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:15,120
know I want to get somewhere or do something so this aversion can be

89
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:23,959
towards other people it could be towards a situation can be towards oneself you know this inner critic often has this

90
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:29,920
uh flavor of aversion it's uh it's amazing the types

91
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:37,040
of things that we say to ourselves that we would never say to anybody else but we say to ourselves so

92
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:44,080
ill will or aversion is the second one sloth and torper is the common uh translation this was these words were

93
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,440
not in my vocabulary until I started studying this Buddhist practice so this

94
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:57,040
is a sense of tiredness and we could say the reason why there's two words here sloth and torper is one is kind of like

95
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:04,160
a dullness or a foggess in the mind kind of like a uh and one is with the body

96
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,320
just feeling just doesn't have energy and in traditional way that we

97
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,360
understand sloth and torper it's not that there isn't any energy it's that

98
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:22,079
you don't have access to the energy Because when there's sle sloth and torper often what happens is that you

99
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:28,240
know after the bell rings for example when you're meditating and you maybe during the meditation you're doing a lot

100
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,720
of this you know this kind of thing falling asleep the bell rings you're like oh okay great I made it through now

101
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:42,959
I got to go do the shopping and I'm going to go pick up this or I'm going to do that I'm going to do this you know then all a sudden the energy just uh shows up again so sloth and torper is

102
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:49,959
this uh kind of just the energy draining out while meditating this turns out to be really

103
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:55,600
common and it's one sometimes it's just physical tiredness that wouldn't be

104
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,160
sloth and troper that would just be physical tiredness from lack of sleep but a second is often because uh people

105
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,880
are want to want to avoid something they're trying they're not not ready to experience something and this is a way

106
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,000
in which the mind and the body are avoiding just kind of like tuning out

107
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,040
just shutting down the fourth one is restlessness and

108
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:26,240
worry it's kind of the opposite it's this oh my gosh when is that bell going to ring i can't wait sometimes when I

109
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:34,640
have restlessness I feel it in my legs or my arms there's like this feeling like I just want to go and do something

110
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:42,399
but it also can be uh having this a lot of worry and worry like uh this rumination and um getting stuck going

111
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,839
around and around it again is a part of restlessness and worry as well and then

112
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:54,000
doubt it's this hesitation uncertainty i'm not sure is this the

113
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,200
right practice should I be doing this do those teachers really know what they're

114
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:07,800
talking about what is this Buddha guy does he know what he was talking about so just kind of this uncertainty about

115
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:15,040
it so these five hindrances and as I was pointing to before part of practice is

116
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,480
to actually practice with the hindrances to work with them sometimes when we're

117
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,760
doing mindfulness just uh maybe some in-depth mindfulness we will just be

118
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:31,360
mindful of the hindrance but there's a way in which that also itself is a way

119
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:40,480
with working with it thank you Jim so there's this way that meditation

120
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,760
kind of like highlights these hindrances and it can make such a big

121
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:52,399
difference in our lives so even if we feel like our meditation is just a hindrance attack and it's nothing but

122
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,800
one hindrance after the other but somehow we're gaining some facility or

123
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:04,519
some a little bit more ease or familiarity with them so that they're not as

124
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:10,680
problematic we shouldn't underestimate how this trans can transform our

125
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:18,880
lives really to be able to work with some of these subtle small obstacles as

126
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,040
well as really big obstacles because of course these happen in our lives as

127
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:30,480
well so there's this way that we don't sometimes uh we might think like okay I

128
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,560
just have to sit it out we just have to wait for it to end but we don't have to

129
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,680
just possibly experience them or maybe even

130
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:47,760
possibly observe them or witness them there are some ways in which we can work

131
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,120
with them then this I would say is part of the art of practice if you're in

132
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,839
meditating or in daily life and you and I'll talk a little bit more about this in a moment but when you notice like oh

133
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:05,279
for example like here's restlessness i am so restless sitting in the car can't

134
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:11,240
wait to get to where you're going and the other cars are driving too slowly or something like

135
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:18,879
this there's this way in which you know what i just lost my train of

136
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:26,040
thought that's interesting well I'll say the next thing

137
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,959
so some of you that are familiar with uh Buddhist teachings you'll be familiar

138
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:39,079
with this idea of these four right efforts right being most helpful not uh

139
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:45,079
moralistically right but just the most helpful and part of these are

140
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:53,600
to cultivate what is helpful cultivate what is beautiful cultivate calmness and

141
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,199
mindfulness and loving kindness or whatever your practice is but these

142
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:05,480
right efforts I'm using the word right that's how I learned them we could think of them maybe as wise

143
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:12,160
effort also is about abandoning what's not helpful

144
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,440
so we could say working with the hindrances is part of the wise way part

145
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:23,959
of to apply our energy with a practice is to help abandon these

146
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:29,920
unhelpful experiences so here's an overview of uh

147
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,720
how we can work with them and then I'll talk about a few in

148
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,480
particular one thing about the hindrances and part of the way why they hinder they're part of their

149
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,959
effectiveness is we don't see them we just think like oh this is just I don't

150
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:53,199
know it's just how it is and we're just like bouncing off of them or we're getting pushed around by them or

151
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:59,199
something like this using restlessness again as an example it can be enormously

152
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:04,560
helpful to just name it oh this is just restlessness

153
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:12,560
and there's a way to just name it it feels it has less of this compulsion that we have to do something and get up

154
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:20,720
and make things go faster or run away or whatever it is the restlessness is asking us to do just to name it oh this

155
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:29,079
is it's just restlessness i've had restlessness before i've felt like this before it's

156
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:34,120
uncomfortable that's okay i can be with discomfort this kind of

157
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:40,480
discomfort so one thing that we can do just in general is to just recognize

158
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,759
what's happening we might imagine there's a way like if you're in a maze let's say that

159
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:52,639
the hedges right are like really tall and you can't see where you're going and you're just trying going here trying to

160
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,320
find your way out of a maze there's a way in which recognizing oh it's just

161
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,319
sloth and torper here just the energy is drained out this feels uncomfortable

162
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:09,438
it's not the end of the world to just name it is kind of like you know being

163
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:16,160
up high and looking down on the maze instead of being in the maze where you're trying to just find your way when

164
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,839
we name it it kind of helps us to see big overview doesn't necessarily make it go away that you're no longer in the

165
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:28,079
maze but now you can see like oh yeah there is there's I can see there's a way

166
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:36,320
out it's possible instead of just frantically trying to find your way through the doubt or sensual desire

167
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:43,679
aversion whatever it might be and there actually there's uh when we

168
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:49,960
do say "Oh this is restlessness this is doubt." There can be

169
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,280
um a a small little like blip of delight

170
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:01,600
of this recognition because there can be a way in which um there's a certain amount of

171
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,960
frustration or irritation or something building up as we're trying to like find

172
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:13,919
our way through and then we recognize uh it's just restlessness there can be a little

173
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:19,120
like oh okay it's just restlessness and there's this little bit

174
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,880
of uplift with this recognition there's a these moment of clarity that can

175
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:31,120
really uh support us in our practice even though it's subtle and perhaps short-lived we shouldn't uh

176
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,320
underestimate because it interrupts the momentum of I got to figure this out i

177
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,720
got to make this go away it interrupts the momentum

178
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:48,240
so the first thing recognize what it's happening if you can sensual desire

179
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,280
aversion restlessness and worry sloth and torper and doubt these uh five

180
00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:01,720
hindrances and then can we allow it to be there as best we

181
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:07,240
can this sometimes is the hardest can we just allow it to be

182
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:13,400
there don't have to fix it don't have to make it go away it is

183
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:19,840
uncomfortable but we don't have to all of a sudden you know try to do some I

184
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:26,080
don't know big giant uh changes to make it go away not only do we not have to make it

185
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:32,559
go away we don't have to create a story oh my gosh I'm always restless i'm just

186
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:39,679
a restless person i'll never be able to meditate not like those other people over there that are that I saw on the

187
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:46,640
internet or here in the room or whatever it is there's amazing how like the stories start getting made and often

188
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:53,600
there's some comparing mind we compare ourselves to how we were before or how we want to be or how other people and uh

189
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:59,919
it just lends to more and more dooka more and more suffering more and more discomfort

190
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:06,480
so can we just recognize it and then just allow it to be there as best we can

191
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,919
i'm saying as best we can because it's not easy this is this isn't easy but is

192
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,240
there a way that we can have can we like dial down some of the story

193
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:23,280
making some of the self- evvaluation and it's like yeah this shows that I'm human

194
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,880
and that I'm alive and that I'm having this experience it doesn't have to make

195
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:35,280
a story about your value as a meditator or your aptitude for meditation or your

196
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:42,760
likelihood for freedom or anything like this it doesn't have to mean that it doesn't mean that at

197
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,760
all

198
00:20:53,799 --> 00:21:01,159
and recognize allow and then how to be with it so

199
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:06,799
allowing it's not so easy so how can we be with it to um in a way that's more

200
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:13,120
comfortable and diminishes the discomfort or diminishes the

201
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:21,840
intensity and allows this hindrance to kind of fade away one is to we could say widen the

202
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:27,919
field of mindfulness and what one way to think about this is

203
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:34,159
uh if uh it's an experience of I'm I'm

204
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,679
using this expression of restlessness because I had this uh not too long ago being stuck behind a driver that was

205
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:46,240
going really slow and I noticed how I had this little like flare up of come on

206
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,440
come on you know this like the speed limit is quite higher than what you're

207
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:59,200
doing here and you know and I thought oh look at So there's a um there's a way that what

208
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,360
I mean by widen our mindfulness that if you're experiencing it primarily in the

209
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:11,280
mind thoughts and thinking widen your mindfulness to the body to the bodily

210
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,640
experience if you're experiencing it primarily in the body like this restlessness sometimes like I said I

211
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:24,240
feel it in my arms and legs this feeling like I really want to move then maybe to uh include the mind

212
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:31,280
and notice what the mind is doing so to widen the mindfulness to include more

213
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:38,400
than what you're experiencing because one of the ways that the hindrances how they hinder I would say probably all

214
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,520
difficulties do this is they kind of like collapse our awareness we kind of

215
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:49,360
like collapse into the whatever is being uncomfortable or difficult there's a way

216
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,960
in which we kind of like forget about everything else as we're trying to find our way out

217
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:02,520
of the maze or something so this idea to broaden to widen to include more of our

218
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:08,679
experience is really kind like takes some of the

219
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:15,919
the compelling nature out of that uh hindrance

220
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:24,840
so maybe there's a a way that um I'll continue here and say and

221
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:33,559
then the last thing and sometimes this might not happen during meditation but might happen outside of meditation is to

222
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:40,640
investigate and so what are there some some of the things to investigate what underlying beliefs do

223
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:46,840
you have that are supporting this what underlying

224
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:55,120
beliefs i should be comfortable at all times or if things if I feel discomfort

225
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:02,559
I'm failing or I will never be happy unless I have perfect meditation sessions or

226
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:09,520
you know these are exaggerations um but often these underlying beliefs are buried pretty

227
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:16,799
deep these aren't something that you would hear yourself saying out loud but it can be really fruitful to have some

228
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:24,640
curiosity like what's driving this what's fueling this what is allowing this hindrance to

229
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:30,080
persist here like what is the why is it here because there's one way we can

230
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:36,559
consider them is kind of like seeds that humans have and then when the seeds like

231
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:42,159
germinate there's a way in which there's hooks on them and the hooks like grab

232
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:48,559
onto something and I've told this story a number of times it's for me it's a good

233
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:55,200
example of uh I was uh sitting in a retreat this was some time ago and uh I

234
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:02,720
noticed how much desire I was having during the meditation just all these things like I was going to buy things

235
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,960
you know and I was just imagining things I was going to buy or that I was I don't remember all the details now exactly but

236
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:15,840
just a lot of like all these things I wanted I this was a long retreat and I just wanted to be done with it also with

237
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:23,039
this feeling like I just want to go outside and all this stuff but I felt like okay I could work with that and the

238
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:29,760
desire kind of uh calmed down and then uh It came up

239
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:37,120
again for something else i'm like "Oh okay okay i can work with this be mindful experience it in the body and

240
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:44,360
calm down." And then this was the meditation session uh before lunch so that bell

241
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:51,279
rang the end i'm like "Oh okay i made it through." Phew and they're like "Okay I did all

242
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:59,520
right." You know I had all that desire i worked with it and then I went to the lunch line which is a buffet on on

243
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:06,640
retreats i put so much food on my plate way more than anybody could eat it was

244
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,400
just kind of like showing up like "Oh I want this oh I want that oh wow i should have some of this oh this would be good

245
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,480
for me." You know just put all this stuff on and this is how the hindrances

246
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:24,320
work is there's kind of like this hook and they attach to things so in this

247
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:31,760
little story and this was my experience and I'm sure if you look you'll see this experience as well that it's just desire

248
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,200
and then it starts to oh I want this and then this and then this so often with

249
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,919
desire we're focused on the objects and not noticing how there's just this desire that's getting placed on all

250
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:49,200
kinds of things there's a reason like when you're searching for the internet

251
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:56,480
when you're like click on this then you click on that and then click on this and click on that often there's a sense of like I want to eat something or I want

252
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:02,400
something more or there's or you end up buying something is because this uh the

253
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,520
internet often like surfing the internet feeds this sense of a desire and then

254
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:14,480
the desire just gets placed on different things so there's this way in which can we just

255
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:22,640
be with the experience can we be with the experience rather than um trying to solve it or

256
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:28,320
make it go away can we be with it and then investigate what's what's

257
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:34,440
underneath this what are some of the underlying beliefs or we could also

258
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:40,520
investigate if I weren't experiencing this hindrance what would I be

259
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:45,799
experiencing because there's a way in which these things arise to distract us

260
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:51,760
also there's a way in which the mind and the body don't want to experience

261
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:57,600
something that there's been a glimpse of and so they make big giant problems as a

262
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,720
something to solve and to kind of like pull our attention away so this could be

263
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:11,559
a second thing to be curious about to investigate is if I weren't experiencing this what would I be experiencing

264
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:19,519
so maybe I'll give a little bit of a an example for um working with

265
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:28,000
aversion if there's a little bit of hostility in the mix we would say aversion is uh ill will and it has this

266
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:35,120
huge spectrum right just mild irritation to boiling anger

267
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:43,279
and there's this way in which if there's this boiling anger and maybe it's like some hatred and hostility in there there

268
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:50,799
can be this way is just this swirl of the story of I can't believe they said this don't they know who I am you know

269
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:59,200
kind of like the hands on the hips this righteous indignation like it shows up when we're so angry how dare they treat

270
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:06,159
me that way with so disrespectfully or wait until I I'm going to you know this

271
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:12,960
type of thing so there's a lot of stuff happening in the mind and it might be when we kind of like this type of anger

272
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,360
it's probably the whole constellation of emotions some hurt maybe some

273
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:25,520
embarrassment or some frustration or there like there's a whole bunch of things kind of there together that are

274
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:32,000
like fueling this uh aversion so maybe that's one way we

275
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,240
might experience it just a lot of anger towards

276
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:45,840
institutions individuals oneself maybe and then there can often just be

277
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:51,000
this mild aversion to other people some of our

278
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,039
co-workers some of the people that we encounter that we don't really know

279
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:04,480
there's can be this way in which we're projecting onto them like why are they doing that they're so inconsiderate or

280
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:11,080
something like this some version of this maybe we're complaining about

281
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:18,960
uh a coworker that's like just too noisy or talking all the time or uh stealing

282
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:26,880
your ideas or what whatever it might be whatever it might be but there's this way in which we have

283
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,520
this idea about that person and I don't like that person because of X Y and

284
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:38,039
Z but the truth is we know so

285
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:45,440
little about other people in general we don't know what's happening

286
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:54,000
in their home life for a lot of people some people we do know we live with them we do have a better sense but there's we

287
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,840
don't know some individuals maybe they've gotten some news recently they

288
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,039
have or they have some diagnosis or something or maybe they have a a history

289
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:12,159
of some terrible awful things happening to them when they were younger and they are still trying to work through it or

290
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:18,640
find their way or there's all these ways in which people maybe they didn't have an

291
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:26,360
upbringing in which they felt like they were loved and cared for and they're trying to find their away with

292
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:31,760
that and so there's all this way that we're maybe like we're quick to jump to

293
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:37,200
conclusions and to maybe just have this uh ill towards other people thinking

294
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:44,240
that they're inconsiderate or inadequate in some kind of way

295
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:49,760
then I will also say this uh aversion also shows up boiling anger towards

296
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:58,159
other people and I'll just give another example is to our experience it's amazing if you really

297
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:04,399
wanted to look at it how often there's this slight little no thank you I don't

298
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:10,320
want that to whatever is arising like can it be better yeah it it should be

299
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,880
more like that we're so long living our life with this really [Music]

300
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:23,960
subtle this is what that Buddha was pointing to called a dooka the sense of yeah it's just not quite

301
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:31,200
right and I would say working with this is lifech changing

302
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:37,320
if we can work with the way that we start we're saying no in so many different

303
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:43,519
ways and can we say yes to our experience I'm not saying we have to

304
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,640
like it I am not saying we have to be passive I am not saying that there isn't

305
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:57,240
a lot of awfulness happening there is a lot of awfulness happening but there's a way that if we

306
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:05,600
can like settle into our experience and maybe tune into or be

307
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:11,600
attuned to the way in which we're saying no then the no can soften and then there

308
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:18,279
can be some wisdom or some clarity or some

309
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:24,640
openness that becomes available that's not available if there's this quiet no

310
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,840
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no going on and when there's this openness and clarity

311
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:37,679
and wisdom that arises then we can meet the awfulness in a way that

312
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:46,278
um is powerful instead of just fueling this uh aversion that we have

313
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:54,640
so to practice with it with these different types of aversion is maybe to

314
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:01,320
I'll say specifically recognize oh this is

315
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:09,280
aversion maybe to like a widen the mindfulness experience is to what does

316
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:15,358
aversion feel like i notice that when I'm talking about it I'm like doing this with my hands and I'm going forward a

317
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:21,118
little bit kind of like pushing so there can be a way that's kind of like mentally or even physically there's a

318
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:26,560
clenching the teeth or like maybe your stance is is uh with your feet planted

319
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:32,638
and you know that kind of a stance or something like this so just get familiar

320
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:39,280
what does this aversion not wanting feel like in the mind and in the body and

321
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:46,079
maybe notice all these different things anger just aversion annoyance frustration with people or just the way

322
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:53,720
in which we're in a subtle way so often saying no thank you to our

323
00:34:53,720 --> 00:35:00,320
experience and then how does that feel in the body because there's a way in which we are projecting all the problem

324
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:06,280
on something out there the person the situation

325
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:14,440
have you tried changing everything in the world have you tried changing everybody doesn't work right it doesn't

326
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:21,560
work but to be to kind of like bring the attention back here and to be with the

327
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:30,200
experience there's this way just repeatedly redirecting the experience to the body and mind feeling the

328
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:35,440
aversion just this repeatedly doing it because the mind you you will not want

329
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:41,359
to do this i'll just say you will have aversion to aversion and then aversion to the aversion to the aversion but you

330
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:48,480
will not want to do this but if you can there's this way in which the mind and

331
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:55,440
the body just start to relax and become a little bit more supple and a little bit

332
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:02,560
more easeful and there's not the there instead of like this big no there starts

333
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:07,720
to open up a sense of yes that allows or maybe

334
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:15,359
um allows understanding things in a new way or a new idea or creativity comes

335
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:21,359
from this place from this kind of like this place of yes that allows us to solve problems and to show up in the

336
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:26,920
world in a different way and people notice of course right if we're showing up with

337
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:32,040
a from a place of no versus a place of

338
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:38,079
yes and then you can do this a little bit of investigation is that it will

339
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:43,520
covering something is there frustrated desire is

340
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,640
there boredom is there embarrassment is there like is there

341
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:54,160
something underneath it that's fueling it and maybe it's serving another

342
00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:00,880
purpose maybe this ill will is serving a purpose is well it's uh um holding up an

343
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:07,119
identity you have yeah I'm a member of this group and because I'm a member of this group we hate that group over there

344
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:12,160
so I just have a will i just because you're that group I'm in this group you're in that group and that's why we

345
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:19,920
just kind of fall into this so there might be a way in which we are doing it because uh we want to be part of an

346
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:25,119
identity or something or part of a group and or there's so many different ways

347
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:30,400
that gets uh played out it doesn't have to it doesn't have to get played out

348
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:37,839
this way so I talked about hindrances all humans have them they

349
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:43,119
show up in our meditation as well as they show up in our daily life

350
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:50,079
to work with them and to work with them I would say is such a big part of practice of course it is if we're going

351
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:55,960
to work towards something we work with whatever is getting in the way whether this is meditation or whether it's our

352
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:03,119
life and one is to recognize it and I'm using this word like widen or broaden

353
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:08,160
the mindfulness the awareness of it if it was primarily in the mind bring the

354
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:15,560
awareness into the body that's usually how entrances show up they're usually a mind thing and then bring them into the

355
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:21,280
body and then oh I um and to allow them

356
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:28,200
sorry I missed one and then investigate and maybe investigation happens during meditation or maybe it happens

357
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:33,599
later is this covering something is there an underlying belief is there a

358
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:40,560
purpose that this hindrance is serving right now so with that I've talked about one

359
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:46,079
out of five life hindrances i've talked about other ones in other settings i'll

360
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:53,040
see if I'll talk about some of the other ones perhaps in later talks but the hindrances are such a integral part of

361
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:58,720
practice and and maybe I'll just say that for me it was very personally when

362
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:07,040
it was very helpful personally when um I discovered these like oh these are just

363
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:12,839
what it means to be a human that's all that's all just what it means to be a

364
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:20,480
human so thank you thank you and with that I'd like to open it up

365
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,640
and see if there's some questions or comments

366
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:58,760
yeah we don't have to we don't have to talk

367
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,599
i feel like if I let you out early it's like you get to go you know when you were a kid and you get to go recess

368
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:13,079
early or something like this why don't we just end a few minutes

369
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:18,720
early thank you thank you wishing you a wonderful uh rest of

370
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:25,200
the evening if you'd like to come talk to me here uh afterwards you're welcome to but otherwise uh safe travels home

371
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,200
