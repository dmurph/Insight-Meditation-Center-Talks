1
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,599
so

2
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:35,280
warm greetings and welcome to our meditation session

3
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,520
together and

4
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:52,239
the basic practice we're doing here is mindfulness mindfulness practice and um

5
00:00:52,480 --> 00:01:00,320
yeah i think i've said this recently it's a common enough expression or cliche that

6
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,920
mindfulness is easy what is difficult is remembering to do

7
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,320
it and the idea of staying in the flow

8
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,640
of present moment experience by being aware of it is at the heart of

9
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:25,040
mindfulness practice and and being aware means many things

10
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:32,799
maybe people are aware in different ways but there's different different aspects of awareness

11
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:41,040
and one of the aspects of awareness one quality characteristic

12
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:48,560
way of being aware is to know is to recognize what is happening in the

13
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,920
moment and the art of mindfulness is to keep

14
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,399
that recognition simple to have to recognize what is obvious

15
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,240
or observable in the moment so it's not a matter of digging and

16
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,239
looking for something special or the underlying cause of something

17
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:19,280
but when we practice mindfulness practice it's just staying with the obvious what's what appears to us what's

18
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:27,840
observable in any of our senses perceivable in the moment but then to know it

19
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,519
to recognize it and one of the things you might try on this meditation session

20
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,760
is to emphasize the recognition part and it's often done with this single

21
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:47,280
word uh if you're breathing in you recognize you recognize it as in so it's not like automatic pilot

22
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:55,280
it's not like that um you're directing yourself to inhale by saying in it's almost as if

23
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:02,720
the inhale begins and then because it's perceivable we recognize it inhale or just in

24
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,920
as a shorthand if there's an itch then

25
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:16,080
don't have to analyze the itch and why it's there and you know and wonder if you have poison

26
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,120
oak it's just to notice itch the simplicity

27
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,400
of recognition so it can be

28
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,840
easy to overlook how powerful it is this simple act of recognition

29
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,400
and it is

30
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:49,680
hence but in this meditation you might try to see if you can discover how simple an act of recognition can be

31
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,879
and how it supports you in being rooted in the present moment

32
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:03,120
so if there's a thought not just know your thinking but have a

33
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,360
clear maybe maybe crisp or clear or definitive

34
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:17,359
recognition oh that almost like you use a sentence that is thinking there is thinking now

35
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:24,560
it doesn't have to be that long it could just be thinking but the equivalent of that you know like oh i really see

36
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,759
this oh that's what's happening even if it's completely mundane you hear

37
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:38,800
a sound that's a sound and it's the the fullness or the clarity or the or the

38
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,600
uh all okay how to say that we really give ourselves over

39
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,440
to that recognition something frees up something becomes more spacious

40
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:58,880
something we're less preoccupied and caught in our concerns we're less in the stream of thinking

41
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:05,360
again and again and it's like it's like almost like we take a pause to recognize this

42
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,440
we take a pause to recognize the next thing there's no hurry to recognize as many

43
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,720
things as you need to it's more the quality of clear recognition

44
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,880
how does that work for you and how can you do it so it doesn't feel like work it doesn't

45
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,080
feel like it's um a strain to do it it's actually kind of

46
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:35,199
you feel the benefits of it you feel how it puts you in the present moment more fully uh that's the

47
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:44,479
task of this meditation and if you find that that doing the exercise is

48
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,680
agitating then you clearly recognize oh that is agitation

49
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,360
and but you recognize it there's a calming in their recognition

50
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,479
there's a spaciousness there's a even a freedom in the clear recognition

51
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,759
it's kind of like oh that's what it is and we make room

52
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:14,160
and then the next thing that's what it is then it might be the same thing over and over again but clear recognition

53
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:22,720
so to set the ground for that to assume a meditation posture

54
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,520
may be one that's familiar with you for you

55
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:35,840
so that the familiarity supports

56
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,918
a welcoming feeling of being here and present

57
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,840
and you might close your eyes

58
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:02,639
and to take a few of those long deep relaxed breaths

59
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:09,919
breathing in and relaxing as you exhale

60
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:21,520
breathing in and settling in to your body as you exhale

61
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,120
letting your breathing return to normal

62
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,240
and relax the shoulders soften

63
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,840
on the exhale softening the shoulder blades

64
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,479
maybe if letting relaxing so the shoulder blades

65
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:13,840
can roll down the back slide down

66
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:41,839
relaxing and softening the belly

67
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,399
and then to begin the practice of clear recognition

68
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:56,880
recognize in the simplest way you can the most direct and obvious way

69
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,160
how you are right now

70
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:12,000
and recognize it a few times and see if there's something about how you recognize

71
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,519
that's not a duty it's not forced or work

72
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:25,600
it's simply a very simple act of recognizing pausing

73
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:33,680
pausing and recognizing almost as an act of generosity

74
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:51,839
it allows each thing that's recognized to be itself

75
00:09:52,880 --> 00:10:05,839
recognizing how you are in your body

76
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:16,639
recognizing the predominant sensations of your body as you're here

77
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
now

78
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,199
and recognizing the sensations of breathing

79
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,079
and if you use a single word for that recognition

80
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:58,560
it's a recognition that if you do it kind of clearly and fully

81
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,360
hopefully is a quieting of the thinking mind

82
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:15,839
not triggering of more thoughts

83
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:29,839
and continue with your breathing and if something else becomes predominant

84
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:38,079
recognize it recognizing how it's obvious

85
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:49,519
observable and in a way that recognition

86
00:11:51,120 --> 00:12:11,839
is beneficial for your meditation one observation after another

87
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,880
if you are involved with the flow of thoughts

88
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:27,039
you probably are not recognizing the moment

89
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:43,840
clear recognition

90
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,869
[Music]

91
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:35,520
and then as we come to the end of the setting

92
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,320
perhaps there can be a clear recognition

93
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:51,440
of goodwill a clear recognition of a place inside of

94
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,679
you

95
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:04,799
that's the location for or the source for kindness

96
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:12,320
friendliness care love compassion

97
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:20,399
and even if you don't feel it at the moment perhaps you can clearly recognize

98
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:26,960
the place the location within

99
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:35,840
a tenderness a gentleness a warmth

100
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:45,840
and openness

101
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:53,360
that if you open if you direct that openness and tenderness to the world

102
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:03,120
perhaps you can see the world with kind eyes

103
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:13,200
to look upon the world

104
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,799
with a kind regard

105
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:25,279
generous in your eyesight and considering that we're coming to the

106
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,480
end of the meditation

107
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:37,279
to aspire to in some way small maybe small maybe

108
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:43,360
spig some way that on this day

109
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:51,679
you contribute to the simple welfare and well-being and happiness of

110
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:57,520
others not in big dramatic ways but maybe just with

111
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:08,080
simple gestures a smile greeting

112
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:15,840
an inquiry into how they are into your ability to listen

113
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:23,279
listen well as they answer may it be that this meditation practice

114
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:31,360
we do spreads from our meditation community

115
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:37,200
out into the communities around us in the form of welfare and goodwill for

116
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:43,600
all beings may all beings be happy

117
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:52,559
may all beings be safe may all beings be peaceful

118
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:59,600
may all beings be free and may we contribute to the welfare and

119
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:05,840
happiness of this world

120
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,919
you

121
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:34,398
so good day on this monday end of june and

122
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:44,799
the theme that i want to discussed this week is

123
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:51,919
clear comprehension the pali word is sam pajana ajana

124
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:59,760
in this context means to know and uh and the paw of

125
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:05,840
pajana it's kind of an emphatic prefix so it's kind of like to really

126
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,880
know and some my belief means here means something like

127
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,880
with so with clear knowing with really knowing

128
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,200
and the

129
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,720
and so uh it's an important quality of mindfulness practice

130
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:37,840
sometimes it's translated as clear comprehension sometimes clear knowing clear recognition

131
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:45,600
the clear being the emphatic kind of idea behind it and um but to really know and

132
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:53,120
uh it's part of the art of mindfulness is to learn the power of recognition

133
00:33:53,120 --> 00:34:00,240
in some cultures i've been to that people won't talk tell each other

134
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:06,320
tell other people strangers their birth name they have another name kind of like a nickname that they go by

135
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:12,079
because it said that their their birth name is has some there's some power to it and if you give

136
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:17,679
it too easily to other people then somehow they can have power of you or something it's something you want to

137
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:24,800
be very careful for the and sometimes many of us can have

138
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:32,240
the experience of the english expression is um to name something i'd like to name

139
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:37,760
something or you know it's just naming what's

140
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:44,320
naming what's happening is to very simply describe or characterize what's

141
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:50,560
happening the moment other people aren't noticing and ah maybe oh that's what's happening oh i see

142
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:56,320
that's how it is and uh sometimes we do that for ourselves i've kind of felt

143
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:02,400
off sometimes and i didn't know quite why i felt off or something was quite not quite right

144
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,400
and then i recognized at some point i recognized that i was

145
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:16,480
sad about something and in recognizing the sadness oh that's what's happening i'm sad and with

146
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,480
this with their clear recognitions like the clouds parted and something becomes obvious and clear and

147
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:30,400
the kind of the way in which things are cloudy or murky uh clears up oh that's what's happening

148
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:38,400
and so mindfulness practice involves two primary attentional faculties

149
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:47,680
and and others as well but the two primary ones is sati and sampajana

150
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:53,359
and sati which is often translated as mindfulness i think it's maybe more useful to

151
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:59,760
translate it as awareness and some pajama as clear recognition

152
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:06,320
and that mindfulness practice is the combination of those two to be really present have a sense of

153
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:14,160
really a present moment awareness present moment attunement uh to being aware of what's

154
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:22,079
happening here and now so ability to receive to perceive for the senses sense doors to

155
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:28,160
be open so the senses the eyes the ears the nose the tongue the tactile senses

156
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:36,560
and also the mind door is all open so that we can receive

157
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:42,800
what's going on or perceive what's going on in a way that is not so thoughtful it

158
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:51,040
doesn't necessarily involve recognition it's almost like pre-recognition just the experience being with the experience

159
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:58,480
that's sati and uh and then the clear recognition is the

160
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,599
clear knowing of what that is and now the combination of those two is

161
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:10,400
what didn't i think often in the modern definitions of mindfulness are presented

162
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,680
um you know so that sometimes what's called clear recognition knowing

163
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:21,119
what's happening in a non-reactive way is often called mindfulness sati but

164
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:26,160
it's closer to this thing called sampajana clear recognition

165
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:33,200
and as i said in the guided meditation it's a really or implied at least a very invaluable

166
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:39,920
art to learn how to uh call forth our capacity to clearly

167
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:46,000
recognize uh even what is most obvious and and sometimes it can be dismissed

168
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:53,040
it's easy to be dismissive of what's obvious like that in-breath that out breath that we feel tingling or warm in our

169
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:59,040
body these are little details that seem like they don't warrant much attention

170
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:06,000
but what's warrants that warren's attention and engagement is this capacity we have

171
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,200
to clearly recognize where the clear recognition

172
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,839
is closely related to freedom freedom from preoccupation freedom from

173
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:23,280
reactivity freedom from closing down around something because we that recognition is kind of a bias a

174
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:31,200
judgment but rather the recognition is opening um to possibility opening to being

175
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:36,480
present and so this is the art of figuring out the art of recognition

176
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:43,359
so it's very very simple so uh to recognize that i feel

177
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:49,440
i feel warm and tingly and just to to recognize it not with a lot of

178
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:56,079
baggage and association of what it means but to recognize it as a kind of like pausing to open to

179
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:01,760
experience it more oh warm and tingly what's that like ah

180
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:08,960
it's like that um seeing like right now i'm seeing the camera

181
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:16,000
that you're all behind and and so there's a moment of seeing of

182
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:22,000
recognition that i've been here now for you know over half an hour kind of looking in the direction at

183
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,599
times with the camera but until this moment i hadn't really clearly recognized it it's like

184
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:33,680
oh so it stands out a little bit in highlight and it's more like oh look at that as

185
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:40,720
opposed to oh no the camera or something so oh it's a camera and then i have a

186
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:47,040
monitor in front of underneath it so i can see what's happening here on the chats and stuff so so you know i see the

187
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:53,760
light and the color and and things and um and now i feel thirsty so to clearly

188
00:39:53,760 --> 00:40:00,880
recognize the thirst and and then maybe do something about it

189
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:10,960
and so there's a story in my book the book of

190
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,520
stories called the monastery within and it's a story about a very famous

191
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:24,640
sage who lives deep deep in the mountains and there's no roads that take you there

192
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:30,640
and just some trails mountain trails and the person seems to ha has a reputation

193
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:37,200
of having just the right thing for everybody if you go tell this person your troubles and

194
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:43,839
your challenges and uh he seems to always have the right everyone leaves satisfied like that was

195
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:49,119
perfect for me and and um this you know you must have great

196
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:56,319
intuition great understanding and so people would do the trick it sometimes would take three days of hiking into the mountains

197
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:03,040
and three days out and because people some people were really desperate to find out you know support help for their challenges in

198
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:08,400
their life they made that trek and when they found him the the sage

199
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:14,240
would sit and listen sometimes they'd listen for 15 minutes sometimes an hour or

200
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:21,760
something hours as people kind of unloaded and told the stories that they were concerned with and the sage didn't say

201
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:28,240
much but uh just took it all in and then at some point the sage

202
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,839
the person would stop talking and then sage would nod and okay indicated this age now really

203
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:41,920
wanted to think deeply about this and really reflect and come come up with some really wise thing

204
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:48,960
but before before uh he would say his words there was always a requirement that the

205
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,560
person who was asking for support guidance whatever he said

206
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:59,680
would not be told to anyone else so just very personal for that person

207
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,880
and it turns out the person always said the same thing to everyone

208
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,640
it's the same thing and that's the thing that he said we always said

209
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:17,200
what are you not paying attention to what are you not recognizing and then

210
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:23,200
people some people are often disappointed that's what he has to say but okay gave him the benefit of the doubt and

211
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:30,960
then they leave but they had to spend three days hiking out of the mountain and it would echo in their mind

212
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:37,920
what are you not recognizing and over those three days all kinds of

213
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:43,280
possibility all kinds of things they hadn't been noticing came up and came up and by the time they

214
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:49,280
came out of the mountains they were transformed they had received something powerful that had changed them

215
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,480
for the better so this power of recognition

216
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:02,240
to really when we sit and meditate to clearly not only be present

217
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:08,960
for the experience but to recognize it um and to do it in a way that's relaxing

218
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:16,720
that's calming as opposed to agitating but do it in a way that is so clear that we're

219
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:25,839
no longer being swept along in the mind stream of thoughts or we're no longer admired or absorbed

220
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:31,359
in the world of emotions it's almost like taking a step back out of the

221
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:38,319
mud out of the mire out of the preoccupation stepping

222
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:45,520
out of it and looking back at it and saying oh preoccupation thinking oh this

223
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:52,960
is thinking or anger sadness this is anger this is sadness

224
00:43:52,960 --> 00:44:00,240
and and the art of is is to kind of explore and use the word the recognition until you really feel

225
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:07,040
the kind of freedom the kind of separation not aloofness not kind of distance

226
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:14,800
but separations were not caught in something the release and then and then

227
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,560
then mindfulness uh the awareness that being present has a whole different quality of

228
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:26,560
of of of movement and then mindfulness can do its work it

229
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:33,040
can unfold best when we're not kind of lost in the stream of thought or stream

230
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:39,680
of emotion so clear recognition that's the theme for this week and i'll talk about different aspects of

231
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:45,920
clear recognition and for these next 24 hours you might experiment

232
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:53,040
with uh seeing if you can discover some of the power of recognition of how it's supportive

233
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:59,680
and helpful and look how you can recognize what's happening even what's obvious even what you already know

234
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:06,960
but you haven't really recognized it what it's like to really stop pause and recognize

235
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:13,599
and if you care too you could also explore carry with you the sages

236
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,880
question what are you not recognizing and see if

237
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:25,599
that's interesting for you so thank you all very much

238
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:33,359
and i look forward to this week together with you

239
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:35,440
you
