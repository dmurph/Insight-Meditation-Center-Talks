1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,200
morning I say good morning it's morning for me but I recognize it's not morning

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,719
for everybody and as you can see by the title that uh for this week these five

3
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:19,320
days I want to talk about the inner critic and I'll start by just doing a

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,840
definition of the inner critic and maybe I'll start by saying not everybody has

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,080
this inner critic so many people do but not everybody does so I don't want to

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:39,040
you know universalize it and feel like oh if you don't really know what I'm talking about then uh you're not uh

7
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:47,399
somehow with the program or something like this no no no just some people have it and some people don't and it's kind of like a um maybe

8
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,760
we might even say like a sub personality inside of us if I could use that type of

9
00:00:52,760 --> 00:01:00,320
a language this way which it's constantly putting us down and belittling us and this voice of negativ

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:07,640
that's blaming ourselves and nagging at us and has this uh maybe a pervasive

11
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:17,159
sense of Shame Shame for what we are how we are who we are or maybe there's also

12
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:23,119
a uh climate or an attitude of harshness kind of creates this environment this

13
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:31,040
internal environment where we're really harsh with ourselves and when this inoc is up and

14
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,880
running there's a feeling of in advocacy like somehow I'm just whoever who I am

15
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:45,759
is not enough or how I am is not enough or somehow I'm not worthy or in some

16
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:52,040
kind of way this feeling of inadequacy that can result from this uh inner

17
00:01:52,040 --> 00:02:00,479
critic and wow there's so much pain so much Dua associated with this structure

18
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,039
that uh this constellation this Dynamic that uh many people

19
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:13,520
have and so today I want to start with um a guided meditation that's uh

20
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,840
designed to kind of like disarm the inner critic and part of how we're going

21
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,959
to do this is maybe with a meditation that's not the usual

22
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,120
meditation partly because uh the usual meditation probably the inner critic if

23
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:36,519
there is one has already co-opted it and is already like oh you can't do this right or it's your it's hard for you and

24
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:41,720
it's easy for everybody else or you're not doing it good enough or it's

25
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:48,319
something like this there's a way in which uh this might even be so familiar to us we don't even recognize

26
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:56,239
it so I want to introduce uh an meditation practice that uh can be

27
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,360
incredibly powerful and transformative and not in the way that we're expecting

28
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:08,480
it and maybe part of its power is because we're not expecting

29
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:15,720
it so I learned this uh meditation practice from Sharon solsburg and she said that she learned

30
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:24,280
it from a 94 year-old Sri Lankan monk 94 years old who had an incredible amount

31
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:31,080
of energy and was enormously happy this sounds fantastic right somebody who's 94

32
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,280
years old with lots of energy and happiness this is what we all want for our lives

33
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,799
right and this person did this meditation which um i' like to share

34
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:47,439
with you and I want to say maybe before we launch into this maybe you're a

35
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,480
little bit curious like okay well what is this Diana but um before we launch

36
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,799
into it I want to say that it's

37
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:06,680
um an opportunity where we can put the maybe this logical or this reasoning

38
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:14,200
or this thinking mind it can allow it to observe and be present but maybe I kind

39
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:21,519
like maybe diminish or dampen some of the way it protests and

40
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:32,360
criticizes and um so allow the thinking mind maybe to relax or soften here

41
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:38,280
because if you were to think about it too much you would think like what this is such a weird meditation why are we

42
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:44,960
doing this but don't you know that's okay if that feeling comes up but um

43
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,919
we'll just uh engage in this anyway and why not just run a little

44
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:56,000
experiment discover for yourself come and see how is it for yourself uh to do

45
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,520
this so I feel like I have to before I launch into this I have to like put some

46
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:08,560
um I don't know what's the word uh I I can't think of what the word is but uh

47
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,720
like this really long preface before really just jumping into this meditation

48
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:21,720
so with all those uh caveats uh before Let's uh let's start we'll meditate

49
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:28,319
so so taking a meditation posture a posture that

50
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:34,600
has some uprightness and some

51
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:42,000
ease and this uprightness can be literally or

52
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:53,880
figuratively I'm just taking a moment to feel into the bodily experience at

53
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:01,639
this moment

54
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:12,240
does it feel to be in this body at this

55
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,080
time just in

56
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:35,039
general and we allow however the body is to be how it is

57
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,960
because it is how it

58
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:47,080
is and I'm going to guide us some meditation and you

59
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,319
can repeat silently after

60
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,840
me as I lead us in a type of body

61
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:06,240
scan a body scan that incorporates some well-wishing some

62
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,800
warmth May the head be

63
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,560
happy May the hge be

64
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:34,759
peaceful may my eyes be

65
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,160
happy may my eyes be

66
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,479
peaceful May the shoulders be

67
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:07,280
happy May the shoulders be

68
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,000

happy May the upper back be

74

peaceful

75
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,640
May the lower back be

76
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,720
happy May the lower back be

77
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:01,240
peaceful I'm using this expression May the body

78
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:07,720
part as an [Music] invitation maybe less a supplication and

79
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,320
more an invitation for that body part to be

80
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,160
happy without thinking about this too

81
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:26,680
much may the chest be

82
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320

83
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:39,600

happy May the Bell be

86
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:14,200
peaceful so it's a little bit less thinking and more well-wishing

87
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,240
warm-heartedness May the hips be

88
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,720

body I could use some care some good will some

115
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
warm-heartedness

116
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

117
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,319
and then to continue at your own

118
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:18,079
pace maybe modifying the words if you'd like but keeping it very

119
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,678
simple to do a gentle body [Music]

120
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:30,160
scan up and down the body

121
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:36,760
with well wishing warm-heartedness towards different parts of the

122
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840

[Music]

146

[Music]

147
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,080
[Music]

148
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:42,920
for [Music]

149
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,480
good morning good

150
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:13,000
morning today we'll start this um Journey on looking

151
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,480
at the uh inner critic and in this guided meditation I

152
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:24,640
used a way in which we can maybe like a subvert uh the critic because maybe it's

153
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:30,480
such a integral part of our meditation practice like oh you're you're no longer

154
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,640
on the object you're lost in thought or you know there could be this way in which these little pervasive thoughts

155
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:43,000
just show up in our regular meditation so I thought it'd be helpful to do a little bit of a different meditation

156
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,120
that keeps the mind busy gives it something to do so this uh inner critic

157
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:53,679
isn't busily uh chattering and not only that can provide a sense of spaciousness

158
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,840
and warmth which is what's needed if we're going to work with this inner

159
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:04,279
critic so again I'll describe this inner critic a little bit as maybe it's

160
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:09,840
something like a sub personality inside of us this way in which it's like

161
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:16,120
constantly putting us down and belittling us it's a voice of negativity

162
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:22,080
that's blaming ourselves and nagging at us and maybe it has a sense of

163
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:28,080
Shame Shame for what we are or how we are or who we are or maybe there isn't n

164
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:33,679
a sense of Shame with it maybe it's just a bunch of criticizing but one thing that this

165
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:39,639
inner critic has is a sense of harshness like it's not warm and

166
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:46,399
friendly it's a sense of uh you know you're not good enough you have to do

167
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:52,840
more there's this feeling of a inadequacy of I'm not enough who I am is

168
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:59,559
not enough or I'm not worthy and maybe those words aren't so explicit but it's

169
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:04,880
this attitude that's often like Just Happening kind of like as this running

170
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,679
narrative in the back of the mind or accompanying our daily life what

171
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:16,480
whatever it is that we're doing and wow G be so much duka

172
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:23,120
associated with this and and for some people it's so prevalent and such an

173
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,679
ongoing part of their inner world that it's even hard to imagine that it can't be there or it's even hard to imagine

174
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,880
that it can diminish or maybe there's a way in which they have a certain loyalty

175
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:41,679
to it and their real hesitation to even put it down or to look at it and we can

176
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:47,440
honor this and respect that we're not trying to critique the critic we're not

177
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:55,279
trying to say like oh I shouldn't be there right that's just more of the same but today I want to emphasize that

178
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:01,360
it's understandable that people have have this this inner critic this

179
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,600
self-critic I think uh I wouldn't be remiss in saying that it's a cultural

180
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:12,360
phenomena something that we've learned that we've conditioned from our family

181
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:18,080
from our education from society from culture and I think it's can be

182
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:25,679
enormously helpful to not blame oneself that we have this inner Dynamic that we have this type of a tone in what's our

183
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:31,000
inner life and to be sure some people feel like it's just them that they are

184
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:38,039
the only ones that have this inner critic and when I just started um to

185
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:43,480
train to be a retreat teacher and to be a meditation teacher and I was sitting

186
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:50,679
in on practice discussions that other teachers were doing this was quite a big uh Revelation

187
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:58,440
for me was to recognize oh this is such a common theme when people come to talk

188
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:05,000
about uh their practice with teachers they're under they don't use this language necessarily explicitly but

189
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,760
underneath is this sense of like I'm not doing it right there's something wrong

190
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:17,760
with me everybody else seems to have it okay but there's something that's uh

191
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:25,280
inadequate with me I have a problem this is so prevalent and we have this idea

192
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:32,280
that we're unusual we have this we think that we're the only ones that were unusual to have this persuasive inner

193
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:39,638
critic and we mistakenly believe that we're the only ones that have this naging negative

194
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:47,599
stories but it's not true it turns out that so many of us are

195
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:53,800
walking around trying to convince everybody like okay I got it together I know what I'm doing I'm not really

196
00:34:53,800 --> 00:35:01,240
messed up as sometimes I think that I am not everybody has that I a but there's often this sense of like okay I got it

197
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:06,720
together when inside we don't feel like we have it together and in fact one of

198
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:12,320
the most healing outcomes is When people's realize oh they're not the only

199
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,440
ones with this inner critic in fact it's so common I don't

200
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,480
want to say everybody has it because not everybody has it but uh it's so common

201
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:29,079
it is so common and I think as part of the pandemic we started to have more

202
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:35,760
group practice discussions on these uh online Retreats and um I Heard and saw

203
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,240
either explicit or kind of like you know implicit people recognizing like oh

204
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:47,000
other people have these thoughts too and they start to hear what other people were saying in these practice

205
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:54,760
discussions and there's a certain amount of healing that happened like oh I'm not the only one and I can say it's

206
00:35:54,760 --> 00:36:01,480
important to know that we're not the only one because right there's this way there can be the critic of the

207
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:06,720
critic this inner critic kind of co-ops even looking at the inner critic and

208
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:14,400
there's the inner critic of the inner critic and then right there's the inner critic of the inner critic of the inner critic and off it

209
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:20,359
goes but today I'd like to just mention or point to that we can let ourselves

210
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:27,000
off the hook for the conditioning we received for the conditioning we

211
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,680
received or the cultural conditioning societal biological familial like all the

212
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:39,720
different forces that were present from when we were born until an adult but

213
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:48,119
certainly in our early years like we didn't ask for this particular body

214
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:56,359
shape color size we didn't request this particular mind that has these habits

215
00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:03,920
that are unhelpful these UNH helpful patterns or we didn't select from a catalog okay I like this

216
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:10,880
emotional style and this way of thinking and this certain appearance and these

217
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:16,880
challenges in our lives none of us did that we didn't ask for all these things

218
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,599
that uh had such a giant impact on the way that we are as adults now it's kind

219
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:28,599
of this uh cultural conditions just the things that uh for formed and shaped who

220
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:35,839
we are so we don't have to blame ourselves for all these unhelpful

221
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:41,000
patterns and idiosyncrasies and ways that we show up in the world we don't

222
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,160
have to blame ourselves it's due to conditioning with uh Buddhist teachings

223
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:53,280
we know that everything's due to conditioning but so often there's a way in which we kind of not intentionally

224
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:00,319
but think like oh yeah there's all this conditioned stuff but somehow I'm responsible for the way that I am that's

225
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:07,480
not conditioned it's my fault no we have this conditioning and

226
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:12,640
it doesn't mean we don't have responsibility we have

227
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:20,240
responsibility for working with the cards that we were dealt we didn't deal them to ourselves but that's the hand

228
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:27,000
that we got and it's our responsibility to work with them and this is part of where this uh meditation practice and

229
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,040
Buddhist practice can help with is help us to take responsibility and to

230
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:38,160
recognize that change is possible of course it is like otherwise

231
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:43,240
we wouldn't have a meditation practice if we didn't think that it would be of any benefit and that anything could ever

232
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:50,359
change of course we can so we don't need to believe these

233
00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:56,720
thoughts of the inner critic we don't need to give them the attention they're demanding we don't need to hold them in

234
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:02,200
a really high by Authority and think that there the truth and all other um

235
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:07,720
data or experiences that we have somehow don't count because we have this inner critic we think that must be the

236
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:15,000
absolute truth instead we can offer kindness to

237
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:22,480
ourselves we can offer warmth to ourselves we can offer care to

238
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,880
ourselves and for some this will be a radical idea and for some it will be a journey

239
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:35,960
it's not something that we're going to just you know have this inner critic go away but it starts with recognizing that

240
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:44,280
it's here in a lawful way because there is this conditioning and in fact we could just

241
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:50,280
notice how often there is this subtle message that comes from outside of us

242
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,640
comes from our environment saying that oh we should be different somehow and

243
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:01,480
I'm not saying that we're absolutely perfect we shouldn't change anything but it can be enormously helpful to just

244
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:09,280
notice how prevalent this message is how many books are there trying to

245
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:15,760
help us improve something how many podcasts are there

246
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,880
soing that you should improve something how many

247
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,319
conversations do we have in which one person is putting themselves

248
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:35,400
down how many movies are there how many television programs how many fictional

249
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:40,839
stories include somebody who's putting themselves down who thinks that they're

250
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:48,400
not worthy or isn't good enough in some kind of way it's so

251
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:54,240
common this idea this oh let alone talk about the whole advertising industry

252
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:59,359
that's its whole intention is to you know some give you a sense of inadequacy

253
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:05,680
so that you feel like you need more more more and of course whatever it is that they're trying to sell so part of you

254
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:14,400
know their whole message is the sense of inadequacy and lack so I want to say there's nothing

255
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:20,680
wrong with wanting to change there's nothing wrong with wanting to improve

256
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:28,400
there's nothing wrong with saying yeah you know I have some unhelpful patterns I have some unhelpful h habits which

257
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:35,960
causes harm to myself and causes harm to others and I'd like them to be different that's healthy and perfectly

258
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:42,119
normal but what a difference it would be if we have this wanting to change that

259
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:48,040
comes out of care and comes out of warmth I care

260
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:54,560
about myself I care about others therefore I strive or I Endeavor or I

261
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:01,240
have a wish to modify something some of my behaviors because I care out of

262
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:08,720
respect for myself and respect for others as opposed to this loam I loathe

263
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:16,359
myself therefore I better be different oh so painful it's so

264
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:25,599
exhausting so I don't want to say that we're absolutely perfect but can we do do this um way of

265
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:32,000
um try of encouraging ourselves to modify ourselves a little bit or change

266
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,160
out of care and out of warmth and not giving into the inner critic that wants

267
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:42,520
to convince us that uh all kinds of terrible things it wants to convince us

268
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:50,200
but one is that somehow we're inadequate and have to change so two things I'd like to suggest

269
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:59,160
for today one just notice how prevalent this message is I'm not good enough that

270
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:04,240
comes from outside that we just hear from you know our society in whatever

271
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:11,720
ways or family members or books or movies or you know any media that uh we are consuming just notice like oh yeah

272
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:17,920
wow it's all over the place and maybe we hadn't noticed it before because it's so

273
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,240
normalized so that's one and the second thing that i' encourage that you might

274
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:30,720
like to explore and play around with today is when you not notice the inner critic inside like really ramping up and

275
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,800
getting really loud that you can hear it maybe you can just say I'm doing the

276
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:42,880
best I can right now I'm doing the best I can right

277
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:48,079
now I'm doing the best I can right now it's doesn't mean that in the next

278
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:53,920
moment you can do something different and it doesn't mean in the previous moment you did something different at

279
00:43:53,920 --> 00:44:01,520
this moment right now this precise moment we're doing the best we can and there's a way in which that can

280
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,599
kind of like soften the inner critic and and as these days go long as this weeks

281
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:14,440
go on I'll work I'll explore and um share some different ideas that we can do but maybe we'll start with this today

282
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:22,240
otherwise we'll really activate the critic of the critic and that's not the direction we want to go so this moment

283
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:32,400
I'm doing the best I can right now and just notice how many messages there are are about you should be better H it's

284
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:38,559
awful so I'll end there and wishing you all a wonderful rest of the day or if

285
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:46,440
it's evening for you or what however what portion of the day Still Remains for you and tomorrow and I'll be back

286
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:54,558
here tomorrow and we'll talk about more about this inner critic thank

287
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,040
you

288
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:30,200

289
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:36,800

290
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:42,280
didn't so this not an April Fool's Day message

291
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:03,799
here yes I'm doing the best I can right

292
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:30,280
now thank you all it's so lovely to practice together it's quite something

293

294
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,000
great thing I think it's a great

295
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:51,960
thing thank you thank you all
