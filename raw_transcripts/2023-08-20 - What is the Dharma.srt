1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,740
so I'll Echo what Hillary said it's such a practice such a joy to practice

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:14,940
together maybe it's a practice to be together too right as some of you know I'm Diana Clark and

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,640
I teach here on Monday nights and uh it's a pleasure to be here on a Sunday morning

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,380
well I think Gill is teaching a retreat I think that that's uh where he is

5
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,399
so today I thought I'd talk a little bit about this idea sometimes we use this

6
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,520
word Dharma what is Dharma like what is it what is a Dharma talk

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,800
and what is like to follow the Dharma or be with the Dharma or like what what is that really

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,140
and we have so many different ideas about it maybe each of us have our own

9
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,539
idea there's lots of room for maybe interpretation

10
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:04,559
and part of the reason why there's room for interpretation is because this word in poly means so many different things

11
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,600
and it gets used in so many different ways

12
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:18,000
and one way that isn't so common but it's kind of meaningful for me this

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,680
idea that Dharma and Paulie this word comes from the root der which means to hold

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,200
to support so the Dharma is something that can hold

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,540
us and support us and prevent us from falling

16
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,820
and what does that mean to fall well maybe for each of us we have our own

17
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,460
idea what that means to fall fall into despair fall into hopelessness

18
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:54,000
or just fall into not caring or maybe for whatever it might mean for us

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,399
so the Dharma is something that is support and can hold

20
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,640
and also of course the Dharma is so often understood as the Buddha's teachings

21
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,459
so something that he shared with everybody this was his life's work is to

22
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:20,120
share the teachings and people who sit in this seat right we kind of like are wanting to share the Dharma also

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,360
but also there's also a meaning of the Dharma is kind of like the nature of

24
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,580
reality that's the way things are

25
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:38,160
and part of Dharma teachings under my practice is to help us become sensitive

26
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,700
to or tuned into this way things are instead of the way that we often think

27
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:54,120
they are or the concepts or the ideas that we might have or the wishes we might have or but how they actually are

28
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:01,080
might say is the Dharma and there's this uh quote from the suit

29
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,440
does that includes this word tatakata I like even to say this word

30
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,200
it's a word that how the Buddha refers to himself it's a name that he calls

31
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:20,040
himself it won't go into exactly what it means but to talkata

32
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:25,860
so this is the Buddha speaking about the Dharma and he says

33
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:32,159
whether there is an arising of a titogata or no arising if it's a dog so

34
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:39,480
whether there's a Buddha or not that law of nature still persists

35
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:45,120
the stableness of the Dharma the fixed course of the Dharma

36
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,720
a tatakata awakens to this and breaks through to it

37
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:58,019
and having done so he explains it teaches it proclaims it establishes it

38
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:03,060
discloses it analyzes it and elucidates it

39
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:09,599
that's why there's like 40 years of the Buddha talking right he has a lot of other things to do here

40
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,000
but this idea this uh concept that the Dharma is something

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,840
that's already there and the Buddha just notices it so it's not something like he

42
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:29,180
made up it's like part of this law of nature that he discovered and then shares

43
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:38,040
so in my mind it's kind of like that something like a gravity like gravity is

44
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,440
there but maybe it took somebody like Sir Isaac Newton to get a little bit curious

45
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,740
or to discover you know we have the story of the Apple falling and Sir Isaac Newton getting curious like wait why

46
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:57,360
does it do that and his understanding in his teaching so gravity was always there

47
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,800
maybe in the same way that Dharma is already there but it takes a Buddha to first break through to it is kind of

48
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,500
the language and then to share it maybe to highlight something that we

49
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,680
already know that we've already noticed

50
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,979
and yet maybe to to Spring our attention to it or to analyze elucidate you know

51
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:28,440
all these different words to point it out in a way that we can go oh yeah

52
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:35,820
right right yeah and I'll say for me

53
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:42,539
the first time I heard the Dharma was entirely by accident that I was trained as a research

54
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:47,820
scientist I spent years in a laboratory with a white lab coat test tubes the

55
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:56,460
whole thing right so that was thought what I was going to do and I got interested in yoga which alone was

56
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:03,120
seemed to be like I didn't dare tell my friends I was doing yoga my science friends would not have thought that was

57
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:11,880
okay you know this was back you know a few decades ago and I was a yoga Workshop that was over

58
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:18,600
a weekend and I remember it was called oh so now that it just slips my mind the exact uh

59
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:26,639
language but it was something about uh oh Tibetan heart yoga and I thought wow

60
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:34,199
to bed that's like seems pretty exotic and harsh okay this is gonna be great I'm gonna sign up for this

61
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:40,199
my life was a little bit of a mess then and I was just looking for something that would be hopeful

62
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,660
and so this uh this Workshop we did a lot of you know

63
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,880
the postures Asana practiced what we typically think of when we think of yoga

64
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,940
and in the description there said there'd be some philosophy and I thought oh okay philosophy is kind of interesting

65
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:03,900
so after we had done all these uh postures then uh we were right a little

66
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:12,539
break and then we're supposed to come back for the philosophy part so we're all sitting in you know on our

67
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:17,759
yoga mats and our cute little yoga outfits you know right

68
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:24,720
and in walks this person which I now know was a in tibetan monastic robes you

69
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,919
know red and gold and this kind of shiny stuff I'm like oh my goodness

70
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:36,840
no no thank you I did not sign up for this I don't want

71
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:43,680
any religion thank you no no no no but I was sitting as far as possible

72
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,440
from the door and it would have been really awkward for me to get up and walk out otherwise honestly I probably would

73
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,660
have that was just where I was in my life I wasn't looking for answers and

74
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:59,539
religion and by some dude wearing these odd clothes

75
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:06,319
but my stage

76
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,460
and he started to talk about the Four Noble Truths

77
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:19,620
and this was the first time I'd ever heard anything like this the truth of suffering

78
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:26,580
the truth of a cause of suffering truth of obsessation the ending of

79
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:32,719
suffering and a way to the ending of suffering

80
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:39,240
something in me don't know resonated and I found myself

81
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:45,660
sitting there with tears going down my face this recognition oh yeah there's

82
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:51,019
something here something here

83
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:58,440
you know never did I imagine that uh a few decades later I'd be sitting here

84
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:04,440
right to giving a Derma talk but that was how it started for me so maybe this

85
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:10,920
recognition oh yeah there's something there maybe some of you have had some of this

86
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:19,620
similar experience maybe some of you haven't and that's okay right we all find our own way here

87
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:26,399
but today I'd like to share a story that comes from a poly Canon about somebody

88
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:32,360
who also heard the Dharma and felt really touched by it

89
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,880
and does something really unprecedented maybe or unheard of or

90
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:46,980
radical and everybody gets curious about it and asks wow why did you do that

91
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:54,779
and then he gives his reasons so this is the story of ratapala

92
00:09:54,779 --> 00:10:01,800
and this Story begins with as most stories do with that are in the poly

93
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:10,080
Canon with a description of where the Buddha is so the Buddha is in this town Tula kotita with a whole bunch of

94
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,720
monastics this usually what happened like that Buddha would travel around and give talks

95
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:23,339
so he arrives in this town to Lakota and many people were excited or wanted to

96
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:29,459
hear he had his reputation was a good reputation and so people like oh okay this

97
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:35,160
go to ma is here let's go listen to him talk

98
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:41,640
see what all the above is about and so retipolla went to go hear the

99
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,800
Buddha talk so retipolla was the son of a very

100
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,800
wealthy and influential family in this town chulakotita

101
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,899
his family was maybe one of the most well-known and influential and they had

102
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:03,839
a relationship with the King you know this kind of a family

103
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:13,320
so the Sun goes to hear the Buddha speak and he was so inspired by what he heard

104
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:20,160
the Buddha say he decides this is going to be my life

105
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:27,300
calling this is what I'm going to do so after the end of the speaking he goes

106
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:34,740
up to the Buddha and says I want to ordain I want to become a monastic and devote my life to this I was so touched

107
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:41,760
by your teachings there's something inside me that knows this is what I want to do

108
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,160
and the Buddha said well do you have your parents permission

109
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,860
and he says no but don't worry I'll go by get their permission I'll come back

110
00:11:52,860 --> 00:12:01,260
and then all ordain and the Buddha says okay so retipolla goes back to his family

111
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:09,120
and says I just heard this talk and I'd like to ordain

112
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,680
and his parents are like nope no no

113
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:22,079
and they gave him a number of reasons for this and the first one is

114
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:28,560
you have been raised in Comfort brought up in comfort you know nothing

115
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,500
of suffering in my mind maybe red De Paula had told

116
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,959
them about the four noble truths and how it really spoke to him you know we don't actually know what the teaching was that

117
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:46,560
the Buddha gave but we can imagine his parents saying you can't handle it you don't even know

118
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:54,899
what suffering is you've been sequestered in this simple life with a family so wealthy

119
00:12:54,899 --> 00:13:01,079
and then they also said to him you can be happy pursuing sensual Pleasures just

120
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:07,519
stay here anything you want we can give to you

121
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:13,620
maybe retipolla probably had been growing up with nothing but sensual pleasures and

122
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:21,180
didn't think that that was going to be the answer so they give him a third reason and say

123
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:26,639
you are our only child dear and beloved

124
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,860
when you die we will lose you against our wishes so how can we allow you to go

125
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:37,320
forth while you're still alive to go forth is an expression to ordain

126
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:44,880
so to ordain it means that he would go and follow the Buddha or be with the Buddhist he would leave his family

127
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:51,720
he would have like a completely different relationship with his family once you become a monastic and they're like you're our own only son

128
00:13:51,720 --> 00:14:00,019
how can you do that no something inside of him felt like nope

129
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:08,279
this is what I want to do that's what I want to do with my life it's it's meaningful for me

130
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:14,040
his parents said no but he really wanted to

131
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:22,040
so he just said he went on a hunger strike I'm not going to eat until you let me ordain

132
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:28,380
and in my mind the Buddhism the parents are going like okay we'll just wait them out where he's so used to having

133
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:35,639
fantastic food and anything he wants he's not gonna like we'll see give him a little taste of this suffering

134
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:40,860
but of course it doesn't work and he's getting weaker and weaker

135
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:49,699
so rhetor Paula's parents go to retipolla's friends say can you talk some sense into him

136
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:55,560
so the right to Paula's friends go to talk to him I'd say well you don't need

137
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:01,800
to ordain why just stay with your family with this life that you have

138
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:07,920
right deposit nope this is what I want to do this is what's meaningful for my life

139
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,199
this just makes sense for me so I write to Paula's friends go back to

140
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:19,980
his parents and say well maybe you can let him ordain

141
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:25,380
and he can come back and he can still see you it's not like you'll lose him completely

142
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:31,800
but if he continues not eating he's going to die and you will lose him completely

143
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:38,579
and maybe he won't enjoy being a monastic maybe he'll ordain and discover

144
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:44,480
how difficult it is does Robin come back and just get it out of his system

145
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,860
or maybe he won't maybe those are the two main

146
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:56,279
reasons you can see him afterwards and he might not enjoy it so just let him ordain

147
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:01,500
so retapala ordains and he follows the Buddha and he does the Buddha's

148
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,199
teachings and not long after he becomes awakened

149
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:14,120
believe Ever After right but that's not the end of the story

150
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:20,040
because at one time the Buddha and his monasticity come back to this town Tula

151
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:27,360
kotita and there's a number of things have happened but I'm going to focus on one portion of

152
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,660
this so the king hears that the Buddha is back in town

153
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:40,980
and that retapula is there is now is one of the monastics and the King had heard

154
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:48,000
this story that the Sun the only son of one of the most prominent people in town had chosen to ordain and the King was

155
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,259
kind of curious why why would this young man who had

156
00:16:55,259 --> 00:17:03,019
everything ordained the king wants to know

157
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,660
so the the king gets notified that retapula is

158
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:16,079
out meditating in a park and this was common at that time like you know under a tree or something like this in a

159
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:21,720
protected area so the king

160
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:28,438
goes up to him and uh the king offers Tourette here's a

161
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:35,039
sitting mat would you like to sit on this I went to Paul says no I'm actually comfortable would you like to join me

162
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:42,200
you can sit with me this is pretty unheard of like the king is like is teaching or

163
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:49,500
showing respect retipolla this young man but this King had such respect for the

164
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:55,080
monastics and really wanted to talk to retipolla so he teaches

165
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:01,559
he teaches he speaks to him with such respect and ratapola also offers him

166
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:07,400
respect and so why don't you sit with me so here's these two people sitting

167
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:13,740
and the king says to him

168
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:21,120
to write to public what did you know or see or hear that made you ordain just

169
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,460
thought out asks him I read to Paula replies

170
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:32,880
great king the blessed one blessed one is how monastic addresses the Buddha how they

171
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:39,539
refer to the Buddha so the blessed one great king the blessed one who knows and

172
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:45,780
sees the perfected one the fully awakened Buddha has taught four

173
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:51,539
summaries of the Dharma and it was after a knowing and seeing

174
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:56,700
and hearing these that I went forth from the laylife to homelessness

175
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,799
that expression from lay life to homelessness means to ordain

176
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:07,200
so retypile is saying he heard four summaries of the Dharma

177
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,480
and that's what touched him so much and inspired him to go forth that to forsake

178
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,700
his family abandon everything and go ordain

179
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:24,240
so if you can naturally imagine what the King asks well what are these four

180
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,620
summaries of the Dharma

181
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:36,600
was a really skilled teacher and so he spoke to the king in a way

182
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:44,940
that the king could understand and the way that the king could relate to so he doesn't give the king a lecture

183
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:51,240
he speaks to the king in ways that the king could understand like using examples that are relevant to the King's

184
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:57,120
life and he asks questions sir the king so it's more like a dialogue that they're

185
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:03,480
having rather than here let me preach to you or something like that we can imagine that this is something

186
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,520
that a king would appreciate and I'll say in the Buddhist teachings

187
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:15,419
in Nepali Canon that practitioners People Like Us

188
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:21,720
are often referred to as royalty also like there's something some dignity or

189
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:27,900
some royalty within us I I appreciate this this recognition that

190
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:35,280
we all of us have our own dignity whomever we are whatever our life is

191
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,679
there's some part of us that's royalty as well

192
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:47,480
so I like to imagine that Ezra Paul is talking to this King maybe he's talking to us

193
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,539
so the retipolla gives the first summary of

194
00:20:54,539 --> 00:21:04,100
the Dharma the world is unstable and swept away

195
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:10,500
the king asked for clarification what does that mean the world is

196
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:16,679
unstable and swept away so here's ratapala's response what do

197
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:23,280
you think a great king when you were 20 or 25 years of age were you proficient

198
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:29,159
at writing elephants horses and chariots and at archery were you strong and

199
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:34,860
capable I was Master at DePaula it's sometimes

200
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:42,000
it seems as if I had super powers then I don't see anyone who could have equaled me in strength

201
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,360
well what do you think great king these days are you just as strong and

202
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:54,840
capable no master atapola for now I am old

203
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:00,419
elderly and Senior sometimes I intend to step in

204
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:06,480
one place but my foot goes somewhere else this is what the Buddha was referring to

205
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,658
when he said the world is unstable and swept away

206
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:18,419
so retapala is pointing out what the king already knows that aging happens

207
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:24,299
and some proficiencies and capabilities and strengths that we had when we were younger

208
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:29,700
you know that goes away we all know this

209
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:36,000
and I'm sure the king recognized that but maybe he hadn't thought about it before

210
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,179
things are unstable and I like how the king gives this example that's explicitly about being

211
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:48,539
unstable right so that he tends his foot to step one way but it goes another

212
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:52,940
maybe even trips or slips or something

213
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:05,600
second summary but retipolla says the world has no shelter and no savior

214
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:13,679
and the King asked for clarification what does that mean heret Apollo says as an example asks a

215
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:19,799
question in this Royal Court oh I'm sorry the king is saying this to

216
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:27,179
retipolla in this Royal Court you can find divisions of elephants Calvary chariots and infantry so that for them

217
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:33,000
was their military their entire military and they will serve to defend us from

218
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,220
any threats yet you said there is no shelter and no savior how should I

219
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:43,380
understand the meaning of this I read to Paula response

220
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:50,820
what do you think great king do you have any chronic ailments

221
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,659
yes sometimes my friends and colleagues relatives and family members surround me

222
00:23:57,659 --> 00:24:05,039
thinking the king's going to die when rental Paula says well what do you

223
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:10,320
think great king can you get your friends and colleagues relatives and family members

224
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:16,380
to help can you say to them please my dear friends and colleagues relatives and

225
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:21,600
family members all of you can you like share my pain can you take some of it so

226
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:29,700
that I don't feel it these chronic ailments no I can't get my friends to share my

227
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:35,940
pain rather I alone must feel it the Paul says well this is what the

228
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:41,960
Buddha is referring to when he said the world has no shelter and no savior

229
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:51,020
so often we have this idea that something out there is going to make us feel better other people other things

230
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:58,320
but it's pointing to like no there are difficulties that we cannot run away from there are difficulties that nobody

231
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:05,100
can take away from us that that we far alone have to be with

232
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:11,520
that nobody else even though we want them to and we so much there's uh

233
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:17,880
industries that are trying to think oh as long as you just do this or buy that or do this other thing then somehow all

234
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:24,539
your difficulties will go away so the King has surrounded himself with

235
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:31,799
these tools of warfare thinking that that will protect him but you know in modern day we might have

236
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:39,419
what do we surround ourselves with that we think is going to protect us from experiencing difficulties

237
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:46,559
feeling difficulties some of these things have actually can't go away

238
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,960
I know like there's this cool industry like oh no you can feel younger just

239
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:58,740
take this you can look younger just do this right you know that's some of the

240
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:04,200
what we hear but there's nobody that can protect us from sicknesses

241
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:10,020
completely aging completely chronic ailments completely right

242
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:17,460
they just they happen that was the second summer of the Dharma the third summary of the Dharma is

243
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:27,200
retypes the world has no owner you must leave it all behind and pass on

244
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:34,440
and the King asked for clarification what do you mean in this Royal Court you can find abundant gold coin and bullion

245
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,659
stored in Dungeons and towers and yet you said the world has no owner you must

246
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:45,360
leave it all behind and pass on how should I understand that

247
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:51,000
I read to Paula says well what do you think great king these days you amuse

248
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,480
yourself supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation

249
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:03,799
five kinds seeing hearing tasting touching smelling

250
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:10,200
but is there any way to ensure that in the next life so after death

251
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:16,980
that you will continue to use yourself in the same way can you guarantee that after death you

252
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:22,580
will still be able to have this whatever makes you feel good

253
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:28,140
or will others make use of everything

254
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:34,919
all this gold and bullion all these things that you think are going to make you feel good after you die you're not

255
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:40,380
necessarily going to feel good others are going to have that they're going to have whatever the

256
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:48,140
objects were or whatever the equivalent of gold bullion is for us today

257
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:59,220
so he'll have to leave behind all his possessions everything men not only possessions but

258
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:05,940
in the next life will we be able to amuse ourselves with sight Syrian sea

259
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:11,100
scene smelling tasting touching smelling

260
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:16,159
we don't know nobody knows

261
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:24,179
so the king maybe was doing all this hoarding right he talked about how much gold he had and the Dungeons and Towers

262
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:31,158
there's a way in which we kind of like accumulate things thinking that this is going to protect us or make us happy

263
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:37,820
but there's a part of us that knows that's not the case

264
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:45,140
so then the fourth summary of the Dharma

265
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:52,620
the world is wanting insatiable the slave of craving

266
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:57,900
when the king asked for clarification how should I understand the meaning of this

267
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:03,299
retipolla response well what do you think great king do you dwell in the

268
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:09,539
prosperous land of Kuru that was the country in which they were

269
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:15,240
I do so what do you think suppose a trustworthy and reliable person were to

270
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:21,840
come from the East they would approach you and say Dear Sir you should know this I come

271
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:28,080
from the East and there is this large country that is successful and prosperous and full of people and they

272
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,480
have many elephants Calvary chariots and infantry and there's lots of money and

273
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:39,179
Grain and you could easily conquer it

274
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:46,080
and you should conquer it and then right to Paul asked what would you do if somebody said that to you and

275
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:54,240
the King replies I would go and Conquer it and get all the all the you know their Warfare and their people and their

276
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:00,059
grain and wealth and and then retipolla continues well

277
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:05,100
suppose a trustworthy and reliable person were to come from the West

278
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:10,500
and we're to say to you there's this large country that is successful and has

279
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:17,700
all this Army and people and wealth and you could easily conquer it what would you do

280
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:23,279
the king says well I would go to the west and Conquer that twin and you know where this story is going right and then

281
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:28,980
somebody comes from the north and says this oh I would conquer that too somebody comes from the south and says

282
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:37,100
this oh I'd conquer that too so it's pointing to like the king just it wants anything and everything

283
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:41,779
that he feels like he can get

284
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:53,279
and then write to Paula says well this is what the Buddha was referring to when he said the world is insatiable the

285
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:58,740
slave of craving insatiable

286
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,860
and it was after knowing and seeing and hearing this that I went forth from the

287
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:11,340
lay life to homelessness it was after understanding these four things that I ordained

288
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:17,340
and the King says wow it's incredible musteretta

289
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:23,279
it's amazing how well said this was by the Buddha

290
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:31,520
for the indeed the world is wanting insatiable the slave of craving

291
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:40,760
and then the king simply got up and left

292
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:48,960
they didn't show that respect to read to Paulie didn't show his appreciation but in my mind we can see that he's a little

293
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,898
bit troubled and like oh this is not what I expected

294
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:00,720
and just goes off to think about this and other versions of this story that

295
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,000
are preserved in the agamas if that means anything to anybody that the king

296
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,240
pays a lot of respect to retipolla and recognizes oh maybe they're the king

297
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,500
himself had recognized that there was some truth to what was being said

298
00:32:20,419 --> 00:32:28,440
he's pointing out that none of the things that the king believes are going to be sources of lasting happiness

299
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:35,279
actually aren't sources of lasting happiness and I would say for us there's a way in

300
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:40,919
which we know this that we recognize this

301
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:48,200
these things that we keep on chasing and thinking they're going to keep us safe keep us happy

302
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:55,039
youth Beauty wealth

303
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:02,580
objects experiences they aren't a protection

304
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:08,340
from what life brings they certainly enhance life and by no means should we

305
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:13,919
like deny ourselves and say they're awful and never pursue them but it's a

306
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:21,720
trap if we think that that's what's going to make us happy if that's what's going to make our life worthwhile if

307
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,940
that's what's going to bring meaning to our lives

308
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,840
and maybe that's something when we hear like there is suffering

309
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:41,159
there's a cause for suffering there's going to be an ending of suffering and there's a path to sending

310
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:48,240
the suffering maybe that's what's being pointed to these four summaries of the Dharma

311
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:56,659
maybe the changing nature of the world sense of any real shelter

312
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,360
from what life brings us the fact that all has to be left behind at death

313
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:10,560
and then this insatiability of craving is one way we might understand the

314
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,379
Dharma what spinning pointed to with the Dharma

315
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:23,280
so thank you for your practice and for your attention and I'll stay up here if anybody has any

316
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,898
questions thank you
