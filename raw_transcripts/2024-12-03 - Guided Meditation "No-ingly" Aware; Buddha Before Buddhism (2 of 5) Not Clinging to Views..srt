1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:08,080
so hello and

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:15,040
welcome to our meditation session delighted to see the names I see

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,640
there and uh some names I don't see very often

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,800
just very happy

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,240
and so yesterday

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:38,239
the theme was saying yes not to accept

7
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:46,440
everything but to say yes to the possibility of neither accepting or

8
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:54,280
rejecting I didn't say it that way but to say yes to when we let

9
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:01,600
go let go of our clinging preoccupations and concerns we're not accepting or

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:09,240
rejecting our concerns we're saying yes to something better saying yes to the awareness that

11
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:16,400
knows it yes to the freedom yes to

12
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:23,360
the maybe you can say metaphorically to the space between the

13
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:31,280
knowing and what is known that there is a distance there is

14
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:38,520
a spaciousness and to enter into this quiet still awareness knowing

15
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:45,560
recognition of things in a peaceful way is so good so whatever comes into

16
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:52,600
awareness we say yes not to reject it not to condemn it

17
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:59,360
not to accept it not to praise it but to say yes to that which holds it that

18
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:06,119
which is bigger in a sense or Freer in a sense yes and so it doesn't matter what

19
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:11,959
we're saying yes to uh the the object that's just coming into awareness what's

20
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:19,160
important is uh that the fact that we're aware so the same movement can happen

21
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,560
with saying no and sometimes no is really

22
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,599
helpful sometimes you know we're partly when we're meditating we're not just addressing

23
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:37,040
our conscious mind who we think we are when we're thinking and what we can observe about ourselves but sometimes

24
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,599
we're we're addressing uh subconscious parts that uh maybe are not so rational

25
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:50,640
maybe are not so um uh wise even or maybe are not so

26
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,400
developed maybe there's a childlike part of our subconscious and I learned raising

27
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,400
children that they were actually AR happier sometimes when we made very

28
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,879
clear lines of what they could not do we said no and then they knew the limits

29
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:13,599
and they felt secure then within it they okay now we can find our way and we know what to do but when they don't have

30
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:21,159
limits they were trying to kind of stretching against the against the uh outer rim to see how far they could go

31
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:27,560
where where where is it still safe and where can they actually be and it's almost like they needed to have clarity

32
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:35,400
about the zone of safety so there might be a subconscious part of

33
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,879
you where a no the loving

34
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:47,000
no um is really helpful so rather than an automatic

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,040
pilot or as a habit going off into thoughts and concerns rather than

36
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:58,000
repeating the same Loops of desires or aversions over and over again um for the

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,159
subconscious to hear from you no

38
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:10,799
no this is not healthy this is not necessary this is not the way forward

39
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:18,199
just a know and that know then can be the same thing and then with a no to that there

40
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:25,199
becomes the alternative not to move away from something or reject it but a wider more

41
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,320
expansive way of being so if we said no to our young kids

42
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,039
we didn't say no and pivot around and walk away that it was no and we would

43
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:42,240
stand there and just be be there loving and clear and available and when they're

44
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:49,400
really small kids sometimes we get down to their level so that they would not see us towering over them and say no you

45
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,960
can't do that so no so if you find yourself

46
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,840
preoccupied caught up in thoughts desires caught in feelings reaction to

47
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,320
things for this meditation gently

48
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,160
kindly but clearly with a Clarity to it maybe even

49
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,759
a kind of non-aggressive strength to it say

50
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:24,479
no and you might have to experiment with saying that a few times until you find

51
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:33,160
how saying no is being said from a very quiet peaceful Place deep inside that is

52
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:40,080
independent from what you're saying no to you're not rejecting it you're just

53
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,160
kind of stepping becoming bigger more expansive you're creating the larger

54
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,919
room to hold it without so it but it so it knows you're

55
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:59,840
here and you're safe but I'm not going to play with you no

56
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:07,560
so assuming a meditation posture

57
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:15,080
and if you're sitting cross-legged kind of on the floor maybe it's kind of nice to be at

58
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,400
the level of your

59
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,199
subconscious and to gently close your

60
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:37,120
eyes and to take a few long slow deep breaths settling in as you exhale

61
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:11,599
and letting your breathing return to normal and with a normal breath for a

62
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:18,360
few breaths continue to relax your body settle

63
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,520
in e

64
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:07,039
and then centering yourself at the place that is your

65
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:14,840
central focal point for breathing even if you have a wide

66
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:23,520
area Center yourself in the middle of that area and for a few

67
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:31,440
breaths relax into settle into that Central Focus point for breathing

68
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:03,720
on the exhales relax relxing the thinking mind

69
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,680
and then again centering yourself on your

70
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,160
breathing and you might limit the no

71
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:52,519
practice to discursive thinking to thinking about anything

72
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:56,360
which is not the meditation

73
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,000
and whenever you inhale let that inhale come along with a

74
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:13,600
gentle kind no to whatever thinking has

75
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:22,360
arisen and on the exhale letting the thinking mind be

76
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,360
quieter Stiller

77
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:41,079
saying gently to yourself know as you

78
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,839
inhale no to thinking

79
00:10:52,360 --> 00:11:00,360
anymore where the word no has a delight

80
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,519
ful word play between n

81
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:12,160
o and k n o

82
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
w

83
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
for

84
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

85
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

86
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120

87
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040

e e

92

and to keep you engaged you might

93
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:06,760
reverse will you say to yourself on the inhale no KN n o

94
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:12,199
w know what's here know if you're

95
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:18,000
thinking and on the exhale let go of

96
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,160
thinking with a no n

97
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,919
o maybe an extended no

98
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,760
that's almost like a

99
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
mantra

100
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760

e for

118
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,840
and as we come to the the end of the

119
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:15,919
sitting to take a few moments again to relax the body as you

120
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:23,398
exhale maybe relaxing micro muscles throughout the

121
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:29,799
body softening

122
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:43,480
relaxing micro muscles in the mind in the brain in the head where you

123
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,840
think a softening

124
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,518
on the exhale softening

125
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:17,159
relaxing your emotional Center maybe in the heart area wherever it might be for

126
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:24,919
you maybe the micro muscles associated with feeling emotions

127
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,600
mood attitude

128
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:59,840
and appreciating whatever degree of calm more

129
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,880
subtleness re relaxation is here for

mind in the chest

132
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:48,398
and for a few moments appreciating how you are breathing with how you

133
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:58,600
are with a gentle no to anything that takes you away

134
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,240
from the settled way that you

135
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,760
are so you can better feel it and sense how you are at the end of this

free thank you e

150
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:15,040
so hello everyone and welcome and today I'm introducing continuing to introduce to you this

151
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,960
ancient text it's maybe the earliest teachings we have of the

152
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:30,079
Buddha and um the language is archaic the context is old before um the all the

153
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:36,118
teachings of Buddhism built up in maybe over the 40 45 years in which the Buddha

154
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:41,599
taught he slowly built up and expanded on his teachings and organized them in

155
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:47,240
ways and we certainly know that after he died his teachings kept being organized

156
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:53,720
and expanded and added to and much of how we understand Buddhism as a

157
00:34:53,720 --> 00:35:00,119
religion uh wasn't really wasn't there the very beginning where the message was

158
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:08,960
very simple and I have this image of this man who is uh living you know Outdoors mostly

159
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,480
wandering around India as a monastic uh meditating much of the much

160
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:21,079
of his time available to meet people and walking around encountering people and

161
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:29,200
people being inspired by his peace his presence and he would offer teachings that were very simple

162
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:35,800
and um and uh these teachings in this book that I I call the book of AIDS the

163
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:43,720
poly word is atava which can mean the book of eights is um in my in my book that I

164
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:50,760
published through Shambala called the Buddha before Buddhism and I'm going to talk today

165
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:56,520
about the first of four themes that exist in this book and uh

166
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:03,800
and the First theme is letting go of views letting go of opinions and uh

167
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:10,720
about religious doctor spiritual ideas uh having a view that we should

168
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:17,800
stop for red traffic lights is not a problem but having views that are metaphysical views about Ultimate

169
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:23,440
Reality views about what is really true that people often want to know what's

170
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,560
true and want to hold on to that the truth they have the truth they know the

171
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:35,280
truth and for the Buddha he was very sensitive to the movement of clinging to

172
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,960
to called so-called truths to clinging to doctrines clinging to ideas sometimes

173
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:47,599
clinging to things that can't really be known for yourself but are clung to out of Faith out of some intuition that it's

174
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:55,079
true in some logic that it's true in some kind because my teachers told me it's true because it's in my sacred text

175
00:36:55,079 --> 00:37:01,400
it's true and um and none of those sources of the truth were interesting

176
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:06,839
for Buddha the Buddha or reliable for him what was reliable was what we can

177
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:15,079
experience for ourselves and the primary thing that uh he kept pointing to in this early text was non-

178
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:20,200
clinging not clinging to anything the absence of clinging that's where peace

179
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:26,319
is found as long as there's any clinging at all for the Buddha he understood that

180
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:33,760
any clinging there is that agitation without clinging there's no agitation and um and one of the primary

181
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:41,720
things he was concerned about in this ancient text talks about it repeatedly is clinging to religious doctrines ideas

182
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:47,880
of what is Ultimate uh clinging to what we think is ultimately true the greatest Truth at

183
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:54,640
all and he was very aware that in saying this he was going against the current of

184
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:59,720
all the different religions of his time in India the lots of religious teachers

185
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:05,319
uh who held up this is true this is true this is true and in fact back then the

186
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:12,920
parently there was a whole Rich culture of debate where religious teachers come to together to debate in the presence of

187
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:19,400
Judges who would then judge who had the best arguments and who you know to Champion the

188
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:24,440
truth and the Buddha didn't participate in these debates and as you'll see today

189
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:32,000
um uh he just saw the debates as being kind of pointless so just uh but so

190
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:39,280
views um the predominant teaching regarding views is the important of not clinging

191
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:45,640
to any opinions philosophy doctrines or religious teachings that's a powerful

192
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:53,119
message and as this is from my introduction to the book this includes views about ultimate religious

193
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:58,359
truth the text teaches that to find peace a follower follow follower should

194
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:04,720
shake off every view without embracing or rejecting anything shaking off views

195
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:12,960
without embracing or rejecting anything and this includes views about

196
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:18,560
views a number of verses are critical of any assertion that one's owns religious

197
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:24,440
beliefs are the truest or best While others are

198
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:30,599
inferior for many readers this seeming no view teaching is a radical message it

199
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:39,520
undermines the importance of doctrines that underly Many religious Traditions including some Buddhist

200
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:47,400
ones the teachings in the book of eights provides no support for the idea that one should believe teachings just

201
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:53,400
because they are found in certain Buddhist texts including this

202
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:00,760
one and finally the goal of practice is often described in terms of letting go of

203
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:07,400
views those who have realized the goal called the sages are not attached to

204
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:14,599
views and so avoid debates quarrels and any conceit that their view are better

205
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:19,800
their views are better than others letting go of their attachments sages

206
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:26,920
have no need for any Doctrine in terms of theories abstract Concepts or beliefs

207
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:32,359
with no no Reliance on any doctrines the wise person does not oppose anyone

208
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:37,839
else's Doctrine so this is a wonderful teaching that appears in this text not

209
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:44,400
to oppose other people's teachings have no views including uh views about other

210
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,440
people this is stated explicitly in the following

211
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:56,319
verse they the wise ones are not an enemy to any Doctrine seen heard or

212
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:01,560
thought out not forming opinions not shutting

213
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:09,560
anything out and not filled with desires they are sages wise ones who have laid

214
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,200
their burden

215
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:23,599
down so in the ancient India there was a lot of emphasis on Purity uh attaining

216
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:30,079
some kind of some relig some religions were a lot about becoming pure doing rituals to purify ones themselves and

217
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:37,240
somehow tapping into the highest Purity there is so this whole that notion of Purity was a very important Doctrine or

218
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:45,680
idea so the Buddha says they say only here is Purity only here in

219
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:54,400
this these doctrines they say no other doctrines are pure entrenched in truths of their own

220
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,240
they call good what they're attached to

221
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:06,480
lusting for debates and plunging into assemblies they take each other to be

222
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,880
fools they speak relying on what others have said passionate for praise they

223
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,920
call themselves skillful so a lot of this now is going to describe the debate

224
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:24,400
culture among religious teachers of the time wishing for praise while debating

225
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:31,599
in an assembly they became they become anxious refuted they become depressed criticized

226
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:37,800
and shaken they seek their opponents faults one whose doctrines is called

227
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:44,960
deficient by the judges rejected will then Despair and grieve

228
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:52,640
the inferior debater moans I have been defeated renunciant are elated and

229
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:57,920
deflated by the disputes that arise among them seeing this you should

230
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,319
abstain from disputes they provide no benefit other

231
00:43:03,319 --> 00:43:10,480
than being praised when being praised for proclaiming their Creed and assembly

232
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,920
they laugh and become conceited having gotten what they wished while that

233
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:21,599
conceit is a basis for distress they still speak with arrogance and pride

234
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:28,119
seeing this one shouldn't dispute disputes don't lead to Purity

235
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:36,599
say those who are skilled wishing for an opponent you

236
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:42,800
roar like a hero nourished on Royal food run off oh

237
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:50,440
hero to where the fight is as before there is no fight here in other words

238
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:56,920
the Buddha is not going to debate with anyone that's not the place to get into a debate

239
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:04,240
if grasping to a view and disputing they say this alone is true tell them in this

240
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:11,760
dispute you have no opponent here what opponent would you get from

241
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:17,520
those who live without opponents who don't counter views with views who don't

242
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:24,960
grasp anything here as ultimate for now that you've come here

243
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:31,760
speculating Thinking Out viewpoint with your own mind you're paired with someone

244
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:37,160
cleansed and so you can't proceed there's no way of engaging in debate

245
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:43,520
with someone who is not involved with debating with right and wrong with ideas of ultimate

246
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:51,760
truth and um so I find this delightfully refreshing and it uh without wanting to

247
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:57,440
criticize any views uh it uh

248
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,599
it it's a critique of any clinging to views but it's not even a critique of

249
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:08,559
people clinging to views it's simply that the sage the wise person doesn't

250
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:15,160
get entangled in the world of views is not involved in being for or against

251
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:21,440
religious ideas spiritual ideas even Buddhist ones it doesn't they argue for

252
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:28,720
you know the true teachings of the Buddha this is what's really important it's all about not self it's all about

253
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,800
emptiness it's all about this or that and this is the most important thing and

254
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:40,240
we have to teach this more or debate this and explain it to people this is what they have to

255
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:45,800
understand what the what this ancient text points to over and over again is

256
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:52,599
not a Doctrine not a belief but the simple Act of not

257
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:59,640
clinging simple but profound a non- clinging that brings with it a peace to

258
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:05,119
be deeply at peace deeply experience a deep

259
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:12,200
sense of well-being the primary goal in this ancient text is defined by peace not by

260
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:18,720
Enlightenment I think I think the word Enlightenment exists in the texts not by Liberation I'm not I think it doesn't

261
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:26,000
exist in the text as well these are more important later in Buddhism and they're a little bit more falling into maybe

262
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,160
that the idea views and ideas of what is but

263
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:39,440
peace is something simple peace is something human and I love the human very deep

264
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:45,720
human Quality naturalistic quality of this teaching here Find Your Peace by

265
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:52,640
non- clinging and then live a life engaged and active in the world but

266
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:59,000
don't give up on that non- clinging there's a gentle not you can say to any

267
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:08,078
tendency to cling to anything stay close to your peace so thank you
