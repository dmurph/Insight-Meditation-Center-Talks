1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:07,799
so hello everyone welcome to this meditation session

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,040
and I'd like to start with um

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,580
uh an introduction but the introduction will be a little a bit of a rhetorical

4
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:25,019
device so I say that to you because

5
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:32,360
maybe rhetorical devices should have a warning in front of them this way of talking

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:38,899
uh may be hazardous for your habits

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,079
and or maybe hazardous if you overdo them

8
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:53,899
that um important part of meditation is to enjoy it

9
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,820
to find pleasure and for this meditation I would like to

10
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:07,680
uh and give you some guidance some instruction if you like to take it

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,040
on actually enjoying your meditation finding pleasure and one of the places in the beginning

12
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:22,039
to find pleasure is to find whatever pleasure there might be in relaxing

13
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:28,380
and if so um

14
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:34,280
and part of the reason to use pleasure is in fact to break our habits

15
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,619
some of us have habits of kind of a negativity bias

16
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:45,180
habit towards thinking about what's terrible what doesn't work

17
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:52,259
a habit to orient Orient ourselves around the problems of life and the problems we have now and how we're not

18
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:59,100
doing well and how it's difficult it's uh certainly reasonable to have

19
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:06,060
those thoughts occasionally and if you never have those thoughts maybe that's not healthy either

20
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,300
but um but uh

21
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,819
for today let's try to break those Habits by focusing on what's Pleasant

22
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:24,060
and the pleasure but don't chase pleasure don't have a high standard for what it

23
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:30,060
means even the absence of some

24
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,580
thing uncomfortable you had in the past it can be kind of a pleasure

25
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:45,440
and so maybe that's good enough so assuming taking a pleasant posture

26
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:54,680
not the most Pleasant posture you can take but the pleasant posture for meditation

27
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:06,560
the most pleasant pleasant posture you can find that also where the body itself

28
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:13,940
expresses being alert aware

29
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,280
amen

30
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:36,659
to close your eyes

31
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:42,480
or let your eyes if you don't want to close them let your eyes be relaxed and

32
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,379
looking down

33
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:57,720
and then looking for how to make it Pleasant that you really enjoy doing this

34
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,819
doing it in your way take a few

35
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:07,760
deeper breaths maybe slowly

36
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,599
and the exhale slow enough to enjoy it

37
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,239
and to the extent it feels nice

38
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:55,259
and as you dig deeper breaths adjusting it

39
00:04:55,259 --> 00:05:05,240
maybe so it remains enjoyable and as you exhale relax your body

40
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:16,740
and look for where the relaxing is Pleasant enjoyable

41
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,020
even to the most minor degree

42
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:54,960
and then letting your breath return to normal

43
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:01,880
and even thinking of a normal breathing is occurring within a range

44
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,479
and as we breathe in

45
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:21,419
if you can look for how to breathe the normal

46
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:28,400
inhale that you enjoy that has some pleasure to it

47
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,819
maybe only a small piece of the journey of inhaling

48
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:39,800
the beginning the end the middle

49
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,960
and also seeing is there anywhere in the exhale

50
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,840
that you can enjoy there's pleasure

51
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,319
maybe it's the very very beginning of the exhale

52
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:32,120
or there's a smooth feeling in the middle of just or maybe at the end

53
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:48,300
maybe some of the pleasure of breathing very very subtle

54
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:54,060
is that it just before you breathe in

55
00:07:54,060 --> 00:08:03,740
it's slightly uncomfortable there's a desire to breathe in and it feels good to begin breathing in

56
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:13,620
and the same as you breathe out the very beginning might feel that you

57
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,240
like oh this is good to begin

58
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:46,320
and as you breathe in and breathe out foreign is there any pleasure

59
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:55,080
more widely in your body that is kind of the atmosphere or the

60
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,899
weather around your breathing

61
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,000
in how you are in the weather of your body

62
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:22,580
are there ways you can relax the body more as you exhale

63
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,320
may be enjoying the effect of relaxing

64
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:15,620
in part of the function of feeling

65
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:23,120
pleasure enjoyment while you meditate

66
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:33,260
is so that you can be more in the present moment where enjoyment occurs

67
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,800
the embodied pleasure or enjoyment

68
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:46,399
over here and now

69
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:09,980
and then to enjoy relaxing the thinking mind

70
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:23,720
maybe on the exhale softening quieting the mind

71
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:19,740
and maybe there's found some enjoyment or pleasure in the mind

72
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:25,519
if you're aware of the spaciousness around your thoughts

73
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:32,180
the softness beyond the edges of your concerns

74
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:04,399
and as you're being aware especially aware of your breathing

75
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:11,899
maybe it can be more pleasant to shift where you're aware from

76
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:18,320
if you're aware from kind of the front of your brain

77
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:24,800
be aware of breathing from the back

78
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:33,079
or be aware from within breathing itself

79
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:53,959
letting the thinking mind become quieter for the purpose of better

80
00:13:53,959 --> 00:14:00,899
sensing and taking in registering whatever is Pleasant

81
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:08,420
Here and Now in your body with your breathing

82
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,220
in the quieting of the Mind

83
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:22,319
allow yourself to feel whatever pleasure is here

84
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:29,839
if your body is beginning to ache hurt you might shift your posture

85
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,520
trust assume it's okay

86
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:47,059
to take in whatever degree of pleasure there is here

87
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:55,100
a pleasure which supports you being present in a quiet way

88
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:45,480
ever so gently slightly

89
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:51,919
turn up the corners of your mouth to a small half smile

90
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:59,580
and if there's any pleasure from doing that include that pleasure as part of

91
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:02,720
mindfulness of breathing

92
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,700
and then coming to the end of the sitting

93
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:47,520
feeling or imagining what it's like to be with yourself

94
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:54,179
when the body has a degree of ease

95
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,100
enjoyment within it

96
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:05,658
how and then imagine how you would walk around your home

97
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:12,740
informed by that ease or that enjoyment

98
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:23,640
how would you do ordinary household chores if you had all the time in the world

99
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:33,000
and you did them informed by the ease the pleasure

100
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,600
staying close to it not in a hurry to get the job over

101
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:43,919
but as a vehicle for continuing to feel the

102
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,278
pleasure

103
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:07,400
and if you're sitting in a comfortable chair feeling this pleasure and enjoyment

104
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:15,360
and you're talking with a friend and if you talked resting in this ease

105
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,480
or this pleasure how would you talk

106
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:43,520
there's a Native American expression to walk in Beauty

107
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:50,100
how would you live in Beauty how does it support you to live in

108
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:55,919
Beauty to have this reference point

109
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:02,600
of a sense of pleasure and enjoyment in your body

110
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:22,380
and how might you care for the welfare and happiness of others

111
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:29,419
if you cared in Beauty if you cared

112
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:35,960
informed by your sense of inner physical ease and pleasure

113
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:46,679
how might you I might your heart

114
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:50,360
wish well for others

115
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,899
may all beings be happy

116
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,059
may all beings be safe

117
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,179
may all beings be peaceful

118
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:14,120
and may all beings everywhere be free

119
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:32,910
[Music]

120
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:39,779
thank you so good morning good day

121
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:45,840
and um so we're looking at the strategies for

122
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,900
how we live our lives the strategies for how to be with challenges

123
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:58,500
and there are healthy strategies and not so healthy strategies

124
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:03,600
and I'm using the example of the five hindrances for the not so healthy

125
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:11,520
and the opposite of those hindrances for healthy strategies and part of the significance of taking

126
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,799
this point of view of strategies is that um

127
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:22,320
if we take the time to stop and asked ourselves a question what is

128
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:29,460
my strategy here what is my Approach how am I trying to get what I want how am I trying to take care of myself here

129
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:37,740
just that pause and asking that question will maybe get you to see more clearly

130
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:44,159
what you're doing habitually or unconsciously or unreflectively

131
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,799
and many times when there are challenges uh and if we're a little bit stressed in

132
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:56,880
it or very stressed that sometimes we're responding from kind of a gut reaction instinctual reaction or neurotic

133
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:03,960
reaction that we might have and we're so involved in that reaction we don't even know it we sometimes we

134
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:10,020
it's very easy to lose ourselves lose our our wisdom our Clarity our kind of

135
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:15,120
really be tracking what's going on and then we say things we later regret or we

136
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:21,299
run around in circles so just simply pausing and checking

137
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:28,140
asking this question is very significant and then we can answering that question

138
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:35,220
for ourselves we can say well maybe that's not the best way and let's see if there's a better way

139
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:40,980
so the hindrance of today is uh usually translated or one way it translates to

140
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:47,340
restlessness and remorse and wrestling is a kind of agitation

141
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:53,640
that is can be very compelling and they can come with a lot of

142
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:59,480
uh anxiety can come with a lot of rest or out of

143
00:30:59,779 --> 00:31:08,520
force and power to keep us in its grip and uh and it's uh often arises out of

144
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:15,840
something we're thinking about with and we and the way that maybe we're having thoughts which are

145
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:22,799
predicting danger or thoughts something that are challenging and then how we relate to those thoughts

146
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:28,559
is part of the we're part of the power of restlessness arises and remorse too

147
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:33,659
and that's because uh and that is to we kind of squeeze the thoughts we kind of

148
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:42,059
get close in they become claustrophobic around them and uh and that's squeezing them uh you

149
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:47,100
know keeps them going and kind of like just keeps flowing and flowing

150
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:52,320
and um and remorse is the same way remorse is in Latin means to chew again

151
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:59,940
and this rumination is chewing again over and over again of what we've done what we regret what we feel bad about

152
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:06,240
and again the thinking has gotten close and constricted or tight or in a way

153
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:15,299
that feels uncomfortable and that discomfort and how we think about these around our thoughts is part of the fuel

154
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:21,299
that generates more restlessness and more remorse and when we do things when we're

155
00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:27,140
Restless or filled with remorse we tend not to do them in Beauty

156
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:33,000
we tend it doesn't seem not a source of of working from pleasure it's very

157
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,340
uncomfortable and um and and restlessness is not

158
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:44,580
really a good strategy for dealing with uh with the with challenges it's almost

159
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:50,820
like avoiding it's like running around in circles and being trapped and not knowing what to do and and I just kind

160
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:55,919
of spinning out and uh it's almost like the absence of a

161
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:01,799
response um and um or if we do respond it just

162
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:10,320
kind of uh confused or or impulsive or not really attentive to what's happening

163
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,539
if we get lost in remorse we tend to shut down from a fuller picture of

164
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:23,220
ourselves where our whole definition of ourselves now defined by what we're remorseful about and there's a narrowing

165
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:31,700
and we don't have access again to pleasure or to or a sense of the beauty of how what to do that's beautiful or

166
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:36,779
so the other uh way of responding that's

167
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:43,500
healthy is um to be also I want to say this way so when there's restlessness and when

168
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:49,019
there's remorse there's a kind of energy or a way that we're animated

169
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:54,299
um that the where the energy for the activity is in the body that is off that

170
00:33:54,299 --> 00:34:00,299
doesn't feel Pleasant doesn't feel enjoyable it's maybe tight or hard or constricted

171
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:05,700
or has pressure behind it maybe pressure in certain parts of the body

172
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:12,740
there's a whole other way of being animated there's a whole other way of where the energy comes from so the energy is not

173
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:18,179
agitated Restless not constricted and tight like we've been remorse

174
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:24,118
and that is a kind of energy that is that where we leave we're not caught by

175
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:30,780
the thoughts so we're not squeezing them or kind of we kind of let go of the squeezing of the preoccupation that

176
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:36,118
attachment to thoughts being and and the animation comes from

177
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:45,540
some place inside that feels wholesome that feels like a home within us

178
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:51,720
some place inside that has a kind of pleasantness to it a kind of pleasure a

179
00:34:51,720 --> 00:35:00,359
kind of beauty to it a kind of ease and the uh the restlessness and remorse

180
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:06,720
is often we're very much often in the head in the thoughts and the ideas

181
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:12,359
uh sometimes restlessness can be purely physical but then maybe it's not the

182
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:18,599
hindrance of restlessness it might be more just kind of over activated

183
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:25,339
something but there is this other place source for something very profound about ourselves

184
00:35:25,339 --> 00:35:32,880
it there's a another source for how we're animated it's my way of saying where our Vitality

185
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,820
comes from where active so rather than being activated

186
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:44,640
um react by reactivity we are

187
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,920
um we are supported by a flow of Vitality

188
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:56,160
we're supported by an upwelling of something that feels good even if

189
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:02,339
we're taking care of something which is very challenging huge challenge is maybe painful and it doesn't give us a sense

190
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:07,980
of pleasure the source of the energy the animation where we're coming from

191
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:14,700
it comes from a place of home it comes from a place of beauty comes from a place of maybe we will call it Pleasant

192
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:19,920
or enjoyable and we don't sacrifice that to take care

193
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:26,820
of things that are so terrible in the world we sit there they're horrible in the world we don't because things are

194
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:33,060
terrible if we pause to see where we're coming from inside

195
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:39,000
we say well maybe I can shift from the agitated squeezing tightening tense

196
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,599
place of restlessness and remorse and come from

197
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:53,060
a place of of um of flow a place of of

198
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:58,619
upwelling a place of of maybe inspiration

199
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:03,720
and for instead of remorse uh get caught in remorse when we've done something

200
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:09,780
that we regret or feel bad about is to the Buddhist approach is to learn

201
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:17,640
from that and then instead of remorse to remorse is to re-engage

202
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:24,420
um to go forward dedicated to doing better and if we identify with something we

203
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:30,680
identify with the one who is trying to do better not the one who did something

204
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:37,320
that was not good and uh and so

205
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:44,880
um so what are the functions of meditation is not just to make us come but to make

206
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,040
us more and more familiar with a place inside

207
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:55,380
that sometimes can feel like there's a lot of Joy sometimes can feel very

208
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:01,560
peaceful and at a home sometimes it can feel like there's Beauty there inside

209
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:09,300
something that feels really right at a homeness from which can flow out

210
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:14,460
animating energy we're not passive from that place but

211
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:21,420
the source of motivation from that place is very different than the sort of source of motivation when we're squeezed

212
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:27,780
when we're tense when we're tight when we're restless and filled with remorse

213
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:34,020
so as we learn to meditate the idea is to begin appreciating this alternative

214
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:42,480
source of how we can be animated and and we learn not to sacrifice it for

215
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:49,680
the strong messages we get from our anxiety our restlessness our remorse our

216
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,960
regrets our the strong messages we get from the pain

217
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,780
that comes from the second third and fourth arrows we shoot it ourselves that just makes things even more

218
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:06,960
difficult to get trapped in some restlessness arises because we feel trapped by all these arrows we're

219
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:15,180
swinging we're we're shooting and so to take time to pause to ask

220
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:22,320
ourselves what's the strategy here where's my source of activation source of energy Vitality coming from

221
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:29,160
am I activated that word in English usually means reactivate it's kind of like

222
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:37,200
activated in a not healthy way triggered or am I am I

223
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:44,579
um inspired am I right is it flowing for me is it am I responding from some depth

224
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:50,820
outside so to pause to ask that question

225
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:56,099
and if we've been meditating for a while and doing this kind of foundation all

226
00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:04,380
the foundations that I'm talking about in this these weeks about how to work with challenges maybe it's reasonable to begin asking

227
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:11,640
that question and to begin switching over to being that way that's beautiful

228
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:17,280
being that way that maybe is closer to the place of pleasure enjoyment or at

229
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,920
homeness that we have here this human life of ours is very

230
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:28,200
important and it's well worth

231
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:34,619
an appropriate for us to begin discovering a different place from which

232
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:41,520
we're animated it's kind of like from the different Source within from which we live

233
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:49,020
the healthy place and to be able to distinguish that from the unhealthy places that we respond and

234
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:54,540
react to the world and

235
00:40:54,540 --> 00:41:00,900
the world is a better place if you can come from this deeper Source

236
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:07,619
come from a place of beauty and come from a place of of ease and at homeness

237
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:14,820
it's not selfish to do this it's actually a contribution to the world we don't contribute to the World

238
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:21,599
by worrying we don't contribute the World by being angry and hostile we

239
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:27,540
don't contribute to the World by diminishing our value by by living under

240
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:35,700
the weight of you know I'm a terrible person we contribute to the World by putting

241
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:42,420
all that aside enough since seeing if I can find that very natural place within

242
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:49,079
its nature to have this upwelling place the upwelling source deep inside

243
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:55,640
that has a flow to it has a joy to it has a pleasure to it

244
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,780
and whatever pleasure we can feel is healing

245
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:07,079
so if your fear of going through a big challenge pause

246
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:14,400
and if you have that situation allows for it go and do something enjoyable

247
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:21,140
don't stay in the middle of the challenge and kind of feel trapped or feel like just kind of like it's spinning out and

248
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:26,220
more and more after if you've been in this in a

249
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:33,480
challenging Place psychologically emotionally for some time go find something to do that's Pleasant

250
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:40,200
go find someone's pet that you can pet with or go go do something that brings

251
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:45,240
you a sense of pleasure do an activity that brings you pleasure you know it may

252
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:53,040
be cleaning or cooking or going for a walk pleasure is one of the great medicines

253
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:58,079
it can be one of the Great Escapes and avoidance mechanisms and that's what

254
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:03,660
you know the pleasure of addiction does but hopefully it's not that kind of

255
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:08,880
pleasure you do you find healthy pleasures that you you can do

256
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,099
when you feel over challenged by situations try not to stay stuck

257
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:20,700
try to engage engage Your vitality your energy Your Capacity to do things to go

258
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:26,280
find the healthy pleasures and then come back and address The

259
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:31,440
Challenge from a different place so

260
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:38,280
thank you and I hope that today you can spend some time exploring

261
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:43,560
um where you're at Where Your vitality is Flowing from where how you're

262
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:50,280
animated and is it coming from a healthy place or not such an inspiring place

263
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,000
thank you
