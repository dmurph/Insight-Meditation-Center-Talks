1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:07,120
so I'm very happy to be with you this week and to continue with the beautiful

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,400
practice that Gil's been coaching Us in of developing

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,400
somat step by step so this week I'd like to support

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:26,279
that practice by offering the opportunity to continue to grow our independent ability

5
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:31,439
to cultivate some so one way we'll do this this is to

6
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,000
use the morning session to have a little more time independently to explore the

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,960
practice we may sit for a little longer each day and I'll offer the mornings

8
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,320
with a little more silence and a little less guidance uh Gil has given us such

9
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,640
beautiful guided meditations and they're so helpful in

10
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,719
giving us a good sense of the practice and how to go about it and with these

11
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:09,240
guided meditations you really get a feel for what you're doing in the practice but then it's very important to do it

12
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,520
independent of the guidance uh to really understand how

13
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:23,119
it's working in your own mind heart and body so by allowing more time this week

14
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:29,439
to experiment with what Gil has already taught us we'll discover what supports

15
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:36,840
for some work for us one form of support I'd like to offer was based on a request

16
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,200
I heard in Friday's community meeting so there will be a second 20 minute silent

17
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,479
sitting each afternoon at 4:00 Pacific time that will be on zoom and so you'll

18
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:58,680
check the IMC calendar for the zoom link and the password and uh that way you'll get that

19
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,479
extra time to explore in Silence the

20
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,520
practice uh by spending a little more time this week on our

21
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,239
own uh another support will get to discover often this comes up more when

22
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:23,599
you're not listening to a guided meditation and that is what kinds of things surface in the mind those might

23
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:29,920
be helpful things that you know kind of self- coaching little soft ways you

24
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:38,040
Encourage Yourself they might be some of the hindrances that Gil mentioned last week that fragment our

25
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,239
attention and so we'll find ways to support ourselves with

26
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:52,120
that uh Gil suggested on Friday that we next try counting to 10 with the breath

27
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:59,599
so we'll do the guided meditation this morning with that remaining very closely attuned to

28
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:07,200
the breathing in the foreground and then staying with it from the very beginning of the in

29
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:15,480
breath feeling it staying with it throughout the course of the in breath to the very end being with perhaps any

30
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,080
pause that's between the inhalation and the exhalation and then staying with the

31
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:28,959
entire out breath until the end and perhaps returning each time to the still

32
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,599
quiet place from which the breath arises and

33
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,560
passes so keeping the cycle of breathing in the foreground and keeping the

34
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,000
counting in the background or kind of in the periphery it's just a way to keep

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,200
the Mind present so with that we'll start with

36
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,159
the guided meditation

37
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,719
briefly settling in

38
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,360
taking your

39
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:20,440
time perhaps a few longer slower deeper breaths

40
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:50,840
allowing yourself the time to breathe into and out of any areas of tension or

41
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:01,199
preoccupation and releasing any tension that can be released

42
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,880
allowing what cannot be released but perhaps softening a little

43
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:16,240
around any chronic areas of tension or any preoccupation that's remaining

44
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:35,038
here allowing breathing to provide alertness and

45
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,360
relaxation a balance

46
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:08,638
and gradually turning the attention to being present with the

47
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,240
breathing feeling the sensations of the

48
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,479
inhalation as the body Rises or

49
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,560
expands as the breath comes into the

50
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:40,880
body and following the

51
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,280
exhalation perhaps the body has a slight falling

52
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:58,800
or comes back inward as we release the breath

53
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:14,800
following each breath with fresh attention

54
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,400
and while keeping breathing in the foreground of

55
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,520
awareness we can introduce very soft

56
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,520
quiet counting in the

57
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:58,919
mind counting from one to 10 with each

58
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:07,400
breath so as you begin the inhalation softly in the background the

59
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,159
count of

60
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:22,639
one and with the next breath two

61
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:37,599
counting each breath up to

62
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,479
10 and then beginning again at

63
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:53,680
one and this is simply a way to keep the mind focused on the breathing in the

64
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:01,959
foreground so the primary attention is is on the sensations of the

65
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:08,160
breathing the inhalation from the very

66
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,720
start and in the background of

67
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:24,480
one being with a pause if there's a pause between the inhalation and the

68
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:32,839
exhalation and then releasing the breath and following the sensations as it

69
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,640
leaves the

70
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:55,279
body staying with this practice and giving it a chance throughout this

71
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:01,200
meditation it takes time take taking the

72
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:09,920
time to settle into it to notice what's happening with

73
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:32,680
it a very light touch of attention a relax relaxed state of

74
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,200
attention to the

75
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,279
breathing e

76
00:11:51,320 --> 00:12:00,440
if the mind starts to drift and awareness returns

77
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:07,279
noticing that it's drifting compassionately come alongside

78
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,839
of where it had drifted for a few

79
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:23,160
moments and gently turning the awareness back towards the sensations of

80
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:31,160
breathing and resuming very soft counting in the

81
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:50,240
background if counting one two up to 10 for each breath is not

82
00:12:50,240 --> 00:13:01,560
enough to maintain the awareness on the breathing you might try one with the INB

83
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,600
breath and two with the out

84
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:12,360
breath three with the next in

85
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:21,560
breath four with the out breath and so on up to

86
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
10

87
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040

88
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040

91

e e

92
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:49,120
softly noticing any shifts that naturally occur as you

93
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:56,920
continue if you need to start again it's always fine to start again

94
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:02,440
with one brething

95
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:11,120
in respecting what's

96
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
happening

97
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

98
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760

e e

107
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:29,080
so hello everybody I'm very happy to be with you today and extremely happy for

108
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:35,080
the beautiful volunteers at IMC who support

109
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:41,279
the technology and who helped overcome the tech glitches multiple Tech glitches

110
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:47,960
this morning so happy to be with you this

111
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:56,600
week this process of cultivating Sade is supported by spending time

112
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:04,919
independently discovering how it works for you so we're taking the time this week

113
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:11,600
to more deeply cultivate what Gil was teaching us last week

114
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:19,120
ease with thinking if it arises Simplicity through

115
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,600
counting settling steadying with the

116
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,600
breath and opening to spaciousness

117
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:36,679
this idea of spending extra time meditating in silence each day is one of

118
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:42,799
the very important supports for samade so for anyone who didn't hear this

119
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:51,440
earlier I'm offering a second sitting on Zoom at 4M Pacific each day this week

120
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:57,240
you can find the zoom link and the password on the calendar on the IMC

121
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:03,480
calendar on the home page page just by clicking on 4 pm and please

122
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:10,679
know it is not on YouTube it's only on Zoom so it'll be a silent sitting again

123
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:15,720
to give us more time and of course if you can't make 4M you can do this on your

124
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:23,159
own so that's one support a very important support for

125
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:30,840
what happens on the cushion with somadi is what happens during the rest of the

126
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:37,760
day both Sati and samadi both mindfulness and this settledness

127
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:45,320
collectedness work hand in hand they're very important strengths to cultivate

128
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:53,240
together and you can support Zade this week by watching what happens during

129
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:58,640
daily life as much as possible of course we're using

130
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:04,279
mindfulness as well in maintaining Awareness on the breathing as we do the

131
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:09,320
meditation with samade but in this development in daily

132
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:15,799
life one of the things that Gil mentioned to us early on was that we could start to

133
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:21,279
recognize how we're getting in our own way how we're fragmenting our

134
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:27,039
attention how we're uh not whole somebody we're trying to come to

135
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:34,760
wholeness to a settled alignment of everything right here and now

136
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:42,720
within and by applying mindfulness in daily life and also on the cushion we can see

137
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:49,440
ways that we fragment our attention become distracted become uh

138
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:55,600
preoccupied and one of the ways we do this is the hindrances that Gil

139
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:03,320
mentioned so we can uh uh see that in meditation and in our daily lives for

140
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:09,760
example we might notice the habit of mind that clings to wanting things to be

141
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:15,480
the way we want them to be the way that's Pleasant ideal the way

142
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:21,399
we think things should be rather than the way they are in this

143
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:29,000
moment so keeping in mind that the hindrances are very common and human

144
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,480
strategies that are trying to bring us to happiness and to a good life but

145
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,559
they're just strates that we find out over time don't work so when we find

146
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:46,919
ourselves wanting things in meditation or in daily life to be the way we want not the way they

147
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:54,320
are we can take a few breaths relax and soften with compassion

148
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:02,279
wow look at that look at what my mind's doing of course I want the way I want but here's how they are right

149
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:09,279
now or we could be uh wanting things to be to go away to not be the way they are

150
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:17,240
we want to push them away avoid them not have it happening even though it's happening so

151
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:26,480
this aversion is another thing that we can greet with a pause a breath and some compassion wow

152
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:32,519
look at how much energy it's taking me to push this away to resist what's

153
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:39,360
actually happening instead of responding a third hindrance that can

154
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:48,440
happen that you might notice on the cushion or in daily life is when lethargy comes up you had a full

155
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:55,200
night's sleep but for some reason as you're working on a particular task you keep getting drowsy or you're falling

156
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,559
asleep while meditating and it's not from lack of sleep if it's from lack of sleep you can

157
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:07,399
just get more sleep but lethargy can arise again approaching it with

158
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:15,760
compassion same with restlessness the fourth hindrance that can arise we can get caught in the idea that

159
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:23,080
um we can control things if only we worry about them enough if only we uh

160
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:30,760
make things be a certain way if we work really hard at it if we do do do uh then

161
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:36,320
we can conquer life and and be happy but again

162
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:45,000
bringing some compassion to that it just doesn't work it keeps us tied up in knots it keeps us exhausting

163
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:52,039
ourselves perhaps releasing some of the tension that arises in restlessness with

164
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:58,279
a whole series of out breaths using the breath breath

165
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:04,279
throughout as our Ally in this practice and then of course doubt can

166
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:10,840
come up and it's very useful during meditation if it comes up to say very

167
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:16,360
quietly say I see you doubt and you're not going to stop me in daily life you

168
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:24,159
could write down what your questions are or you can if it's about yourself you can practice the exercise of doubting

169
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:31,320
the doubt writing down all the reasons that you can uh imagine that the doubt is not

170
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:39,200
true so as we work the with these hindrances and they get more and more subtle we start to benefit by seeing

171
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,640
that what's coming up is just phenomenon rolling through experience rolling

172
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:52,480
through it it's not ours it doesn't have to be about me it's just what's happening so this

173
00:30:52,480 --> 00:31:01,559
opportunity during daily life to strengthen mindfulness will support the ability to settle the

174
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:09,600
mind when we notice the mind getting caught in a hindrance or distracted or in some way preoccupied during the day

175
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:18,279
and mindfulness arises awareness arises we can notice the impact that it's having on us we can learn the truth of

176
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:23,639
what the Buddha is quoted as saying in the middle length discourse

177
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:30,159
19 which Tanis biku translates as two kinds kind of thinking here's his

178
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:36,880
translation with slight alteration in gender whatever one keeps pursuing with

179
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:43,600
one's thinking and pondering that becomes the inclination of one's

180
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,799
awareness this is so important have you noticed the impact of

181
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:54,880
what you frequently think about during the day of what you're frequently occupied

182
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,279
with if you can check in from time to time during the day whenever mindfulness

183
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:05,399
arises and you realize oh let me see what the mind is doing right

184
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:12,519
now we can see how what we're pondering thinking any hindrances present is

185
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:19,760
shaping what's happening with our attention and our awareness and that has everything to do then with how settled

186
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:26,000
we can become on the cushion when we're meditating or whether we're caught in

187
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,840
the preoccupations the concerns the

188
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:38,960
hindrances so the invitation today and this week is to check in frequently as

189
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:45,120
frequently as you can remember to S Sati also is translated as

190
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:52,240
remembering remembering to be mindful and checking in with what are you preoccupied with what are you engaged

191
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:58,440
with mentally is it in the direction of more agitation more activity

192
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,799
is in the direction of peacefulness calm

193
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:09,320
responsiveness so see what happens if you take maybe two minutes five minutes

194
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:15,960
during the day uh from time to time as well to check in with the

195
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:21,760
breath come back to this still settled

196
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:27,799
place all of these things that happen during the day will support the

197
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:35,240
cultivation of somadi so thank you for being patient with our Tech attack today with my
