1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,639
so hello everyone on this Solstice winter

2
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:14,719
day and I'm recalling how my son in when he was

3
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:21,920
in third grade there was a teacher who gave all the students in the class each of them

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:29,359
their own poem to memorize in the course of the year uh once a week each student would

5
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:35,520
uh recite their poem for the whole class and my son was uh happiest with his poem

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,640
because it was so short and uh and uh it went something

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,280
like this is this short that nothing is born without

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:54,440
Darkness nothing grows without light so you certainly you can question

9
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,719
if that's universally true but uh I was inspired by that my son doesn't remember

10
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:07,799
having having that poem but I do that um that that a tremendous

11
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:14,119
value of what is what gets born out of the

12
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:20,079
darkness that uh whether it's a seed buried in the ground in so-called

13
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:28,079
dark in um human being Who develops in the so-called darkness

14
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,320
of the womb and comes comes into the

15
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,759
light what it does for me is to appreciate everything has its season

16
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:46,880
everything has a potential and The Darkest Days of Our Lives when things are very difficult are

17
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,200
maybe the seeds within it there contained the seeds for something new to be

18
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,920
born and what wants to be born out of the darkness what wants to

19
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,799
be born out of our difficulties and challeng challenges and I found that this

20
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:09,479
mindfulness practice has been invaluable in making

21
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,920
space for this deeper kind of an organic natural

22
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:21,440
process to unfold in the midst of our challenges rather than think thinking we have to

23
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,280
fix all our challenges and solve them we create the

24
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:35,480
conditions within ourselves that makes room for something profound something right

25
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:42,080
to be born out of the challenges out of the whatever is

26
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,840
happening so now in the darkest day of the year here in the northern

27
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,280
hemisphere that maybe we can think of that this is

28
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:01,760
um uh you know a time for birth something new is coming for all of us

29
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:10,799
so part of that condition is to be simple to be simple enough we

30
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:16,200
not crowding the space of awareness with distracting

31
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:23,360
thoughts crowding it with commentary and judgments and planning and Analysis and

32
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,680
reviewing and trying to figure things

33
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:35,120
out and um and

34
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,599
so the

35
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:46,319
um so one of the tasks of meditation is not to be lost in thought not to be cut

36
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:53,280
up in it not to be claustrophobic or not to fill the space of the Mind the heart

37
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:01,519
with ruminating thoughts discursive thoughts and one of the ways to do this

38
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:07,439
is to um uh

39
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:15,400
think thoughts that calm the thinking to have thoughts which calm our

40
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:22,440
thinking down and for that we first have to have them very clear and I want to emphasize

41
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,600
very very clear recognition

42
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,280
acknowledgment of what's Happening we are thinking we are maybe out of control

43
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,680
thinking sometimes this is discursive thinking this is rumination this is fantasy

44
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:47,759
whatever it is to um you have to begin by acknowledging it

45
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:54,400
and when the acknowledgement is really clear really like definitive oh this is

46
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,880
the distracted mind at that moment we're we're stepped away from it part of of us

47
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:06,400
is not identified with it we're identifying it but not identified with

48
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,440
it and um and then one

49
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:18,759
possibility is to have that recognition be done with a

50
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:25,680
voice or a manner that is

51
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,000
calming that conveys a sense of care and goodness and

52
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,080
safety like meeting someone's agitated and talking to them in a calm

53
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:45,360
way and then to use the simplest kinds of

54
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,919
thoughts that you can to continue with a

55
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:57,240
calm assured

56
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:06,199
settled mind thoughts to recognize what's

57
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:14,479
happening with this so it's used a mental note a note is a kind of

58
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:20,440
thought so we're using a thought to stay present and not to drift

59
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,840
away and the manner in which we say the note is

60
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:34,479
calming maybe even soothing if that's what's needed is grounding is

61
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:42,240
centering and to make the this mental note more

62
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,199
meaningful is to make the mental note say have the mental note to recog note of

63
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:54,360
recognition come from a profound place within not in the surface mind but in

64
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:01,720
the Deep Mind maybe in the heart or in the belly some Place

65
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:07,280
deeper it doesn't have to be a labeled word that you

66
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,960
say it could be from a preverbal cognition

67
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,000
recognition which is kind of a thought but without

68
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:24,319
words but have that be clear make time for the recognition the

69
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:30,000
act of noting and do it in a way that's calming

70
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,080
that part of your mind which is agitated calming the one that's wanting to

71
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:44,720
daydream or think this is thoughts which calm

72
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,800
thinking so assuming an upright meditation or assuming a meditation

73
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,960
posture that's right for

74
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:01,319
you and gently closing your eyes

75
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:22,680
and just notice straight off how are you how are you in your body mind

76
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,479
heart starting by acknowledging where you are the the starting

77
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,919
point of this

78
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:45,279
meditation and then allowing your

79
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:52,760
diaphragm your body to extend the

80
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:05,399
inhale and giving more time for the body to

81
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,760
Exhale as you allow the body a little longer time to

82
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:22,800
inhale use the expansion of the

83
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,040
Torso to feel and sense the

84
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
Torso

85
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,120
and the exhale to

86
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,120
relax letting the breathing return to normal

87
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:11,040
normal and then spend a few time few moments as you breathe to feel your body different

88
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,680
parts of your body on the inhale and then to relax that part of

89
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,600
your body on the

90
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
exhale

91
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
for

92
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
for

93
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:56,360
and then breathing in and out feeling the thinking

94
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,959
mind and relaxing the thinking

95
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:19,079
mind as the Torso expands on the inhale maybe imagining that the Mind

96
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:27,880
expands on the inhale and relax on the

97
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
exhale

98
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
for

99
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:11,600
and then Center yourself on the

100
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:19,360
calmest or quietest or most stable place deep

101
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,959
inside of

102
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
you

103
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
like a d Rock dropping into a lake settles in the lake

104
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:49,639
Bottom let awareness drop into your body until it finds a place to

105
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:56,079
settle awareness at rest deep in the

106
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
body

107
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:23,839
and from the deepest place available to you the calmest place

108
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,680
within allow yourself to

109
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,880
have certain thoughts engage in certain

110
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:42,639
thoughts recognizing your present moment

111
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:56,320
experience maybe verbally or

112
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:03,959
nonverbally calmly peacefully ful

113
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:08,160
recognizing with a single

114
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:15,880
word what is happening what you know and

115
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,399
feel Here and

116
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
Now

117
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,759
and if your mind is thinking a lot distracted

118
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,000
thoughts from that deep place within

119
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:03,040
clearly definitively name that that's the

120
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:08,319
case saying thinking or distractions

121
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:13,360
or rumination whatever it might

122
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:27,079
be but acknowledge it with a word with a thought that is calming and

123
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:36,279
peaceful where you have all the time in the word world for each label each

124
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
note

125
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,199
maybe the note recognizing what's

126
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:30,400
happening is made on the exhale

127
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:39,200
calm quiet

128
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,159
definitive thought arising from the

129
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:00,399
depths and whenever there's thinking in the mind

130
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:10,120
let that be an occasion to use a calm

131
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:18,039
note to recognize to

132
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:27,320
disidentify and to calm the thinking

133
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
mind

134
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
for

135
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
for

136
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
for

137
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
for

138
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
for

139
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
for

140
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
for

141
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:35,200
for if you find yourself

142
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:45,600
thinking lost in thought swept in thought or thinking

143
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:52,400
habitually there is an alternative and that is to find a place

144
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,960
deep within from which to have simple calm

145
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:06,799
cing thoughts of recognition recognize that you're

146
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:15,919
thinking recognize that you're breathing recognizing your hearing

147
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:23,679
or whatever is happening to take

148
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:29,760
refuge in a calm knowing

149
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,080
calm thought of

150
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
recognition

151
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
for

152
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
for

153
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
e

154
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
e

155
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
e

156
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
for

157
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,520
e

158
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,520
and as we come to the end of this

159
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:47,600
sitting have some quiet calming spacious thoughts think

160
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:54,480
about how your meditation has unfolded from the beginning till

161
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:05,519
now what might you have [Music] learned about different ways of

162
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:13,080
thinking and about how to think in a way that is

163
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
calming

164
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:39,679
what have you [Music] learned about thinking

165
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,039
deliberately so that how you

166
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:56,399
think is calming

167
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:01,579
peacing [Music]

168
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:11,000
deactivating so think about these questions in a way that is calming

169
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:33,919
now and then and turning your attention outward into the world of the people you

170
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:41,519
know you don't know and experiment with repeating the

171
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:49,000
words that I say but repeat them in a calm

172
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:59,320
way so that there's the calming influence on yourself and maybe on the world itself

179
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,519
thank

180
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,159
you

181
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:40,200
so welcome to our fourth talk on wise

182
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,200
thinking

183
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:53,240
and when uh thinking is an automatic pilot it's

184
00:32:53,240 --> 00:33:01,000
way too easy for thinking to be stress ful or even harmful to

185
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,360
ourselves it's very easy to spin out in all kinds of thoughts and worries and

186
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:13,639
judgments and biases and we don't have to be the

187
00:33:13,639 --> 00:33:21,840
victim of our thoughts sometime some people are really major victims of their thoughts they don't realize it because

188
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:27,120
they think they are their thoughts they are their thinking and and

189
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:33,159
if I'm thinking something it must be true because it's who I am but thoughts are not who we

190
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:39,080
are thoughts are a product of the mind but that doesn't mean that that

191
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:46,960
that they're they Define who you are any more than the your growing fingernail defines

192
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:54,320
who you are it's just what the Mind does it's a product of the mind that is a consequence of many

193
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:00,519
causes and conditions in the inner landscape but we don't have to be identified with

194
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:06,960
it andc and especially we don't have to be lost in it and have to live at its

195
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:16,480
whims going along with it or just coping and managing with how it is it's possible to think

196
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:24,800
deliberately and in doing so to have a beneficial influence on the mind the

197
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:31,919
heart the body itself on the world itself self we don't want to think deliberately

198
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:38,040
all the time there's a time for giving the Mind freedom to think whatever it

199
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:43,960
wants to think I do that when I exercise and I find that very helpful

200
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:51,320
and nice to give that kind of freedom to my mind but I don't give that kind of freedom to my mind when I'm

201
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:57,440
thinking um I don't get swept along with with my

202
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:03,760
distracted thoughts I Marshall a deliberate

203
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:10,880
attention a deliberateness of thinking to see and know that I'm

204
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:18,079
thinking to step away and disidentify with thinking so that I can

205
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:24,680
call upon something a way of being a way of thinking a way of of

206
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:30,960
thating which uh has a more beneficial influence on me than the way that my

207
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:39,440
automatic pilot thoughts might be having and um so in vasna we have a

208
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,960
technique called mental noting and that just an emphatic way of

209
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:51,640
recognizing what's happening while it's happening and sometimes being more emphatic in The Knowing is what frees us

210
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:57,920
from being caught up in it and mental notes is a form of thought

211
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,000
very simple meant to be simple rudimentary non-judgmental thoughts just

212
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,240
recognizing what's happening and to think of it not as work

213
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:15,160
not as something coarse that we do but to have the mental note that recognition

214
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:22,400
come from a place that's very peaceful or calm settled within if the distinction between the

215
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:30,680
Surface mind and the Deep Mind is relevant for you have that thought well up from the deep mind so from this deep

216
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:37,880
vantage point this calm Vantage Point recognize that if there's distracted

217
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:43,359
thought now there are distracted thoughts these are distracted

218
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:48,680
thoughts and so if you recognize distracted thought by the very same kind

219
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:56,880
of thinking that's distracted we can stir oursel up even more but if we recognize from this deep

220
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,640
quiet place that has all the time in the world is not in a hurry for anything

221
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:10,400
just calmly recognizes um then it can be settling for that surface mind it be calming for

222
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:16,280
it and so to um use thinking to calm

223
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:24,640
Thinking by using this deep thinking that we're capable of it's the source of creativity source

224
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:29,800
of of um intimacy source of feeling uh

225
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:36,720
of wisdom to really kind of drop into this deeper place that is uh wiser than

226
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:42,599
the surface mind because it's holistic it takes in all the information from all the

227
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:50,040
different uh faculties that we have and so it is much wiser than the

228
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:56,119
distracted mind which is very limited in in how it's integrated into the rest of

229
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:01,599
us and so to have take a certain kind of

230
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:07,920
relaxed deliberateness not forcing it not overriding your

231
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:16,760
thinking but in a sense underwriting it coming from underneath it just recognizing it so so that uh like come

232
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:23,920
sit down relax it's okay sit down and so the idea of deliberately

233
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:30,000
thinking in a beneficial way in a calm way not exactly controlling the

234
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:37,599
situation but little bit taking charge uh of yourself by choosing how

235
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:43,880
you're going to know and see and be present for your

236
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:51,000
experience now this mental not noting can be done verbally it can be done in images people

237
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,800
have a lot of use images a lot visualize their when they think it could also be

238
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,960
done nonverbally because we often know things before we have the words for them

239
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,680
there's a nonverbal kind of precursor to the words

240
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:16,240
that we say so there can be a sense or feeling of knowing that doesn't seem to come along with words but it's still a

241
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:25,440
knowing it's still a kind of a thinking process and it's possible maybe to adjust that so that it's calm it's

242
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:32,000
peaceful and um to do this in meditation is kind of like going uh to a gym and

243
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,560
working out we're we're working out in strengthening and developing or or or

244
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:43,680
bringing forth more and more a different way of relating to our

245
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:51,319
experience we're not just calming ourselves in meditation to just calm ourselves and let that be all we do sets

246
00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:57,960
us up for just getting agitated again but we're calming ourselves by by we're

247
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:03,640
we're by calling upon a way of relating a way of being a way of

248
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:10,240
thinking that is an alternative to thinking as usually happens for us and

249
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,480
over time that can become more of a resource for us more of a even a a

250
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:21,480
little bit second nature a little bit more of the Refuge for ourselves there are ways of thinking

251
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:29,000
that become a refuge it's important not to overemphasize thinking even coming from

252
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:36,720
this thinking from this deep place within uh uh the task of thinking is

253
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:45,560
almost like task the task of thinking is to um unglue us to unstick us to let go

254
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:52,200
of desires aversions doubts regrets

255
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:57,920
agitations to experience ourself ourselves more and more free and deep deeper and

256
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:05,240
quieter and um and so um so that we can enter the

257
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:13,800
world relating it from the Deep Mind the Deep heart that does have desires but

258
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:19,599
there's no stickiness in them that does want to engage in the

259
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,880
world and want to speak with our friends but has no

260
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:32,119
stickiness with it that comes from this place of freedom of calmness of

261
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:38,720
Peace So if this what I'm talking about today makes sense to you experiment with

262
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:45,800
this through the day maybe even put a timer on your device that reminds you

263
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:52,599
that maybe times when you're alone take a time out to assess how your

264
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:58,640
thinking is going what kind of thinking are you doing and is it possible

265
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,760
to change gears and think from

266
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:10,039
a deep down inside to think from a calm way peaceful

267
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:17,040
way and this deepest and the simplest way of thinking that is

268
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,400
calming is to think thoughts of

269
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:28,000
recognition all we do is recognize what's happening

270
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,000
there's a time and place for other forms of thinking and creativity even from this deep

271
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,480
mind but uh for this practice of mindfulness the how it really supports

272
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:46,960
us to do a house cleaning and settling and connects us something deeper is to

273
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:53,079
have the simplest most peaceful calm thoughts of

274
00:42:53,079 --> 00:43:00,920
recognition usually with just one word Maybe to and let it be that

275
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:07,319
simple so that Simplicity is part of the message is

276
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:14,200
part of the influence on your whole system it's like stepping into a calm

277
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:23,440
after being in a very noisy Place stepping into a calm room

278
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:31,240
ah the simple recognition is that calm room ah this is what's

279
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:36,640
happening and so what I hope this will this will do is teach you that there are

280
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:43,359
different ways of thinking you don't have to merily go along only with the way you usually

281
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:48,720
habitually think as if that's the way it has to

282
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,440
be somehow the causes and conditions of your life has led you to think a

283
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:59,480
particular way there are other

284
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:05,480
ways and if your thinking is not good for you by all

285
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:13,359
means experiment with this alternative I'm offering today find whatever place you can that's

286
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:20,800
calmer than your surface mind and know and recognize what's

287
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:28,000
happening calmly to bring a calm

288
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:34,240
reassuring presence to all that is agitated and

289
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,559
unsettled within

290
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:47,400
you may you be may you be your own best friend may you be your own

291
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,839
Refuge by how you think about

292
00:44:52,839 --> 00:44:57,960
yourself thank you very much
