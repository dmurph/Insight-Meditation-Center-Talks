1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:07,560
so good evening everyone welcome and uh maybe as we did last week

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:14,839
if you have any questions you want to ask this might be a good time people some people might still be coming and so

3
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:19,920
do start officially a little bit in do you have any have any questions about

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,000
what I taught last week or about medit your meditation up here on the

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,840
stage yeah yeah if you can use the mic please

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:39,160
can you hear me um so one of the things that I don't seem the ability to do to

7
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:45,039
be able to observe my thoughts I guess the thoughts or the emotions maybe are

8
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:51,840
so strong that I just you know I'm hopped on that train and I don't realize it till I've kind of come off the train

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,920
so I was wondering if you had suggestions you hold it closer because my hearing's not so good so I really

10
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:03,920
have to have get the yeah so I'm not able to observe my thoughts yeah um I

11
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,720
guess maybe they're I'm just so attached to them and I was wondering if you had any

12
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,320
suggestions yeah I don't know what to say I mean uh it then I wouldn't worry

13
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,040
about it but do you notice when you're lost in thought

14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,400
I I notice afterwards after I've kind of got off the train I can say Okay prob

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,840
how how long do you spend on the train it it could be 30 seconds it could be two minutes could be five minutes so so

16
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,520
one part one way to deal with it is uh just be content with that and slowly

17
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,680
what you're doing is trying to develop your mindfulness so when you come to after however long it is just emphasize

18
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:55,079
exercise the muscle of mindfulness and try to be present for a while to be with what's going on and slowly over time

19
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:02,399
you'll settle you relax that your ability to be mindful to get stronger and at some point it'll be time for you

20
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:09,720
to see your thoughts as they occur and you won't get pulled into them so quickly that's one thing you could do

21
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,160
but uh is there any time during the day where you're self-reflective about the

22
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:21,239
fact that you're thinking like do you ever say I have to think about a shopping list now

23
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:27,760
or yes so I mean there could be lesser things or it could be you know

24
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,879
more serious stuff you know my mom died a few years ago so a whole bunch of

25
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:39,319
stuff was happening with the Estates that I understand but it could be a simple because I'm having trouble hearing it it it could be as simple as

26
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:47,159
yeah did I pay my you know water bill or something like that so so so find something which you can think about that

27
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:54,040
you can watch also that you can stay you can stay mindful as you're thinking and see what you can learn about yourself so

28
00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:00,560
probably pick a one that's uh weaker so to speak yeah yeah but but maybe not in

29
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:08,120
meditation but uh but you as you go about your day and and you have one of those weaker ones and you're and you're

30
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,560
you're aware that you're thinking just start start paying attention to some of the different characteristics of your

31
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,400
thinking like we did yesterday last last week okay thank you and then slowly you'll become more familiar and maybe

32
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,760
then you won't be pulled in so

33
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,480
quickly the other thing about uh thinking that uh and the more easily we

34
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,959
get caught in thought the more likely there's tension somewhere in our system

35
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,599
in our body in our mind so when you finally catch yourself uh being lost in

36
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:48,319
thought oh one of the things to do at that point is check in where am I tense

37
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:56,400
because people who notice their thinking and they just come back to their breathing without doing anything else um the conditions for thinking are still

38
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,439
there so you have to relax so so see if you can just take a deep breath and just relax and see see what can be relaxed

39
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:10,040
and that could be the body it could be the the thinking muscle itself the kind of tension around in the mind where

40
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:16,519
you're thinking because tension it's kind of like this um that um I don't

41
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:24,479
know if any of you have had the experience that um if you're squeezing a toothpaste tube you could be

42
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:30,360
wiping it off from the from the opening trying to get it away and it'll keep

43
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,759
coming out you have to stop squeezing so I'm not trying to be

44
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:44,600
disrespectful of your thinking but um too much but uh but if if there's a lot of

45
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:51,639
tension in our system it's kind of like the toothpaste tube is being squeezed you know so you have to stop

46
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:57,160
squeezing and so don't just let go of your thoughts and come back spend some time in seeing where the tension is and

47
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,240
see if you can soften a little bit don't be too too ambitious about relaxing but

48
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:10,360
it is really helpful to relax someone

49
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,840
else yeah I found that uh the labeling technique that you mentioned I think in

50
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:27,000
one the which technique the labeling technique that is when I'm racing so every so often it pop up and say okay

51
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,360
that is that and then go again in the train so so that was helping and slowly kind of see fantastic it the labing for

52
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:40,240
some people is extremely helpful and that also might help you with your thinking that um if you have a if you if

53
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,880
you have a kind of relaxed ongoing rhythm of just labeling your experience

54
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,160
in breath out breath sound

55
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:59,479
itch breath INB breath out breath belly tight feeling tightness breathing in

56
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:06,319
breathing out thinking uh if you have that habit regular that that you're using a

57
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,639
thinking to keep you present rather than using your thinking to take your away so

58
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:18,160
an idle mind sometimes wants to do something and so sometimes you want to give the thinking mind something to do

59
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,599
and the labeling gives it something to do and the regular but it's helping you

60
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:30,080
out rather than taking you away some people complain about labeling because just makes the mind more busy and they

61
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,680
think however it's actually better than the alternative which is the getting lost in

62
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:43,039
thought over and over again and then also because if you have a regular kind of gentle rhythm of noting you're less

63
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:50,479
like more likely to notice if you get lost in thought because you stop labeling so that's a so that glad you

64
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,039
brought it up

65
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:05,599
to good evening um I remember the first

66
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:12,840
class you mentioned that there was a reason for your ordering of the breath

67
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:21,039
body emotion thought yeah I was wondering if you could remind us what that is and then I seem to recall there

68
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:27,919
was something about it that was maybe culturally based culture culturally

69
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:33,560
based and I was wondering if you would have a different order if you were

70
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:41,280
teaching the class in a different part of the world

71
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,639
um well I think one of the cultural things that's uh has developed in

72
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,879
Buddhism in in the United States is putting much more emphasis on

73
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:03,199
emotions uh if you go to and uh and so very famous uh Westerner who's a very

74
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:10,919
senior monk in Thailand now he's a monk aano and he's almost retired now but um

75
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:16,639
uh he says he's fluent and Thai but also teaches lot in English and he says he

76
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:25,039
teaches differently for the two communities for the ties they don't have the same um e culturation around Freud

77
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:31,280
and Yung and Western psychology that is kind of part and parcel of some of the

78
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,680
popular or common culture in the United States and so so so so common here in

79
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,919
the United States that people don't even know that it's where it comes from it's just part of life it's just what obvious

80
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:49,360
isn't it but we use language we use thoughts we use orientations that are very much they're only 100 years old and

81
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,839
kind of crept into our culture in the west they don't have that in Thailand so

82
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,920
here John Sam will talk about psychology emotions acceptance so all these things

83
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:07,000
that have to do with psychology he would never do that in Thailand ties that wouldn't compute it

84
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,920
wouldn't work so there are cultural differences that we take into account and um and in fact it's hard to

85
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:21,279
find in some Indian languages a nice clean word for the English word emotion

86
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,880
it's even more so in the in P the ancient language so we we've organized the human

87
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,079
pie we all have the same pie we're all humans but we cut the pie pieces in

88
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:37,760
different sizes or different ways and we have this we' we've made this cut in the

89
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:45,680
pie and called it emotions they cut it a little bit differently and called it some could be something else and so so

90
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:53,640
those are kind of cultural differences and uh so the logic of what I did is that it's a thinking is hard

91
00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:00,120
for many people to be uh one of the biggest obstacles to being present because we get pulled into thought

92
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:06,680
it's a lot easier and if you if you start with being mindful of thinking what it's going to be is thinking about

93
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:12,640
thinking it's not really going to be mindfulness so it's a lot easier to be mindful of

94
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:18,680
thinking uh if you have some mindfulness of your emotions because a lot of them

95
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:25,560
uh thoughts especially the ones that drive us or catch us have an emotional base the emotions are sometimes the

96
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:33,200
factory sometimes it's the other way around but as it generically that's kind of it's easier then emotions are always

97
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:40,600
present moment phenomena thoughts could be about the past and the future and we get pulled out of them present so so

98
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,480
it's easier to be with thinking if we know if we're connected to the emotions it's easier to be with emotions if

99
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,560
you're connected to the body the body creates a container a context a safety

100
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,639
of grounding to be with em emotions that is hard to do for some people if you

101
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:04,040
just some emotions are just so difficult just be aware of your emotions and some people have panic attacks or

102
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:11,200
something and so but if you have the body as a foundation it's easier grounding and it's uh easier to ground

103
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:18,560
yourself in your body some people say in if you start with um breathing and uh

104
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:25,600
breathing kind of kind of stabilizes some people it gets the other your head enough and so it's easier to be with

105
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,519
your body what I've seen in recent eration of basna teachers like what I'm

106
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:38,360
teaching here is that we have much more diversity now among the teaching community so my generation were

107
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:44,519
basically white privileged people and so they had a particular way in which they

108
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:50,040
organized or had to deal with the world with a newer generation of teachers who

109
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:57,079
come from very diverse populations some really disadvantaged populations in this culture where there's been a lot of

110
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:04,399
trauma then uh they they find that it's much better to start with the body than with breathing and so that in a sense

111
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:11,720
that's a cultural difference as well and so so for them I'm not as

112
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:19,279
trauma sensitive in my teachings for a certain population uh than they are and that's true you know so we have I have

113
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:25,480
to kind of navigate all these all these different issues there cultures within our culture

114
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:31,560
right so how do we manage with it all so is

115
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:47,519
that hi Gil um i' like everyone else I'm suffering through the all these uh

116
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,959
uncontrolled thoughts coming um

117
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:59,519
entering uh my mind when I'm uh meditating and it comes and goes Etc

118
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:06,839
but I wanted to say that uh I've been um since the pandemic I've been uh

119
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:12,880
attending the morning sessions um pretty much every day that

120
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:19,440
uh that's on and um I'm finding um over

121
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:27,160
the past 3 years I feel more

122
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:33,320
settled I don't know how now I feel my language has

123
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,480
changed I refrain from saying some of the things I used to say or the way I

124
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,320
said them before

125
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,720
um I can't I'm not sure it's wisdom or whatever but I see

126
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:55,360
it when I digress or move away from what I think I should be doing I see it right

127
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,560
away perhaps before I was Oblivion to

128
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,120
it so it does

129
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:14,320
work I have no idea how but it does work yes and uh that's all I had to say great

130
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:22,720
thank you I love hearing that that's a nice testimonial it does work and it's a slow process and uh slowly we begin to

131
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,800
be able to monitor to see what's happening while as it's happening and we

132
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:33,920
have more choice we have a choice with the words we use and the activities we do because we see it coming we see

133
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:40,120
ourselves in the middle of it and and there's much more awareness also the meditation provides a different

134
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:46,480
reference point for what it means to be alive that uh you discover that it's

135
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,880
that you can be alive and feel at ease you can alive and feel um comfortable in

136
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:59,959
your skin you can be alive and feel a kind of ethical sensitivity the the body

137
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:06,560
that's one of the reasons so good to be in the body connected to it the body is kind of an ethical

138
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:13,399
antenna that uh it picks up and understands when something is eth ethically off it'll understand it in

139
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:19,440
yourself it the attentions the yuckiness or there it's very subtle but if you're

140
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:27,160
lost in thought all the time or filled with greed and hatred all the time you don't have that subtle tuning in to the

141
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:33,000
the antenna that's here but if you're slow down quiet down you

142
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,560
sens heighten sensitivity and one of the consequences of that is heightened ethical uh wanting to live an ethical

143
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:46,639
life so um and uh it's quite inspiring to see it in people as they get into

144
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:53,720
this practice so you you kind of describe that I feel there's someone next to me watching everything I do yeah

145
00:15:53,720 --> 00:16:00,560
and it's yourself right it's myself but in a way you know in private you may think think do something but not in

146
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,880
presence of others yeah very nice I feel there's somebody right next to me fantastic fantastic so so this

147
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:13,480
heightened ethical sensitivity is part of what happens through this practice and um and you're not even

148
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:21,440
asking for it some of you are going to run run away now you and um and one of

149
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:28,040
the things that the probably one of the more common ethical reports that people come to me about here people who work in

150
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:33,399
a kind of business environment where work environment where people kind of hang

151
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:40,040
out to the coffee machine or at snack time talking about things and they say you know the the medium for talking at

152
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:46,079
work is gossip but I don't want to gossip anymore it doesn't feel good but it now

153
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:52,839
it's really hard to be social with people it's like now I'm feel like I'm disconnected or I'm not part of the gang

154
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:58,800
and it's kind of awkward because that's what that's how people connect is by gossiping but it just feels wrong wrong

155
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:06,240
to do it so um and then there's people who find out that they the work they do

156
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,280
remember one person who said that uh the company he worked with was got a

157
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:17,839
commission a job to make parts for a fighter jets and he went to his boss and said

158
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:23,959
you know I can't do that can I be assigned to something else and so he was

159
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:29,120
and so it wasn't anybody taught them to be ethical it's just this ethical intent

160
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:35,559
develops inside and what I'd like to say is that that antenna is you already so

161
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:42,000
it's not like anybody's imposing anything on you it's like you that capacity to feel and sense in a deeper

162
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,200
ethical way is is ever present in you just mostly you're distracted from it

163
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:54,160
you know busy and too busy to notice so for me that's very inspiring I

164
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,400
don't know what some of you think about that I usually I never said this in intro class

165
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,480
though I have said sometimes that we could just call this a a five-week introduction to

166
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,240
ethics but then no one would

167
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:18,039
come so um okay so let's uh get ethical let's

168
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:23,679
meditate and um so what I'll do is uh it'll be a guided kind of mindfulness

169
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:32,679
exercise is not exactly how you should meditate you could if you want but it's but it's to give you a a um a direct

170
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:39,960
experience of a way that mindfulness can work so the way that we teach it here is

171
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:47,080
as I've said the default is to cultivate mindfulness and stability steadiness continuity of

172
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:53,440
attention on the breathing but if anything happens that

173
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,760
uh is pulling on your attention if it's just a sound in the room and it doesn't pull you away from

174
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,840
the breathing don't worry about it but if a sound is strong enough it starts pulling you

175
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:10,559
away then follow your attention follow where your awareness is

176
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:16,600
drawn and uh and and be aware note mental labeling of what that is that's

177
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:23,280
has your attention know it be mindful of that for a while and then when that's no longer

178
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:29,400
compelling come back to your breathing and so that could be the body it could

179
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,679
be emotions it could be thinking it could be sounds in the room it's a lot

180
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:42,280
of different things it could be but it is we're always going back to the center so in this exercise I'm going to we're

181
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:48,039
to alternate between being with the breathing and then going out to these uh

182
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:53,640
three other areas that I've taught you about today and then uh I'll add one

183
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:59,159
more area uh to that so that that's what we'll be doing okay

184
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:05,480
so so assume a meditation posture if it's the end of the day and

185
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:12,559
you feel really tired you might feel like relaxing back I would suggest that

186
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:22,039
for this time you sit up straighter so there's a little bit more energy coming out of your body into your

187
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:30,400
mind and if you're tense and agitated from a difficult day then you might want

188
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:36,480
to settle back and rest a little bit more in the back rest

189
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:45,600
or and then with gently closing your eyes or if you keep them half open

190
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,120
having them pointed down towards the

191
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:58,640
floor and to transition into the meditation you could take a few long

192
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:05,200
slow deep breaths deep enough maybe like 3/4 full

193
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:12,320
not not without a strain but full enough lungs that you

194
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,400
feel your insides your rib cage

195
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:24,880
expand stretch and then relax on the exhale

196
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:31,000
with a longer relaxation long exhale than

197
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:38,640
usual just to allow more settling in the shoulders and the

198
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:43,080
arms maybe the

199
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,520
belly and then let it then your breathing return to

200
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:13,480
normal and continue for a few breaths to see if there's more places in

201
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,799
your body that you can relax

202
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:29,000
soften and this relaxing the body is also a way of becoming more sensitive to

203
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,879
the body attuned to your

204
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:57,559
body and then you might also see if in the mind the thinking mind is there any

205
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:04,440
tension pressure contraction associated with

206
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:12,320
thinking thinking mind and if there is as you

207
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:20,039
exhale soften the thinking mind as if it's a muscle relaxing the

208
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:22,399
thinking

209
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
muscle

210
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:45,679
and then Center yourself on your

211
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:56,720
breathing your body your torso has its own experience of

212
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,919
breathing follow that experience as you breathe in

213
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:05,559
and breathing

214
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
out

215
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
for

216
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,320
and now switch your attention from

217
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,799
breathing to some the most compelling sensation in

218
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:23,640
your body it doesn't have to be that strong but whatever it might

219
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:32,080
be and the body has its own experience of that place of those

220
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:40,240
Sensations notice how the body is experiencing this strong bodily

221
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:50,799
sensation letting your awareness be close in or letting your awareness rest

222
00:25:50,799 --> 00:26:00,640
in this place in your body while you feel it receive the

223
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:22,559
sensations and for a few moments to allow this bodily sensation to be there

224
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:31,720
as it as if it has full permission it's okay and for you you accompany it you're

225
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,440
present with

226
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,200
it and then return to the

227
00:26:54,279 --> 00:27:02,760
breathing maybe there's some way that you can Center yourself on the

228
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,278
breathing the body

229
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,520
breathing

230
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:41,640
and then in a relaxed way notice the predominant emotion or

231
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:47,840
mood or mind State inner state that you

232
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:55,360
have doesn't have to be easily identified as an

233
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,600
emotion but some St state that you

234
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:08,158
have and allow it to be there for these few moments of

235
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:14,720
mindfulness as if it's never had a chance to be in the sun the sun of

236
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:24,080
awareness let it be there and just notice it feel it feel how it's experience in the

237
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
body

238
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,399
for

239
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:10,440
see if you can experience your emotional state mood state of mind without any

240
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:16,519
stories connected to it without adding adding any meaning to

241
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:20,440
it just let it be what it

242
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
is

243
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:54,480
and then return to your breathing if it helps you you might take a little bit stronger Fuller in

244
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,320
breath to reconnect

245
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
for

246
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:49,120
and then continuing now for a three breath Journey just give yourself over

247
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,880
to three

248
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,240
breaths

249
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,240
and now switch your attention to your

250
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:25,200
thinking whether it's strong or weak

251
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:32,000
whether it fades away if you notice it

252
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,360
notice your

253
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:44,320
thinking and see if you can notice how you're you're thinking without thinking

254
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,799
more very simple matter of

255
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,279
fact if there's an emotion connected connected to

256
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:04,080
it be aware of

257
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:17,600
that if there's Body Sensations connected to it include awareness of

258
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,080
that

259
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,039
e

260
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:21,600
and then return to your breathing reestablishing

261
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:28,960
yourself on the body breathing

262
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,960
for

263
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:19,760
and then one more shift of attention now become aware more aware of

264
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:25,520
how you're mindful as you're aware of breathing or anything

265
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,119
else how would you characterize how you're

266
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:40,000
aware is there any strain involved

267
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:58,879
expectation

268
00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:09,240
is there any hesitation or reluctance

269
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,680
or or lack of

270
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:32,559
commitment and then come back to your

271
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:01,000
breathing so will continue for just a few more

272
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:08,760
minutes maybe with the breathing at the center but as you need to become aware

273
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:16,839
of whatever pulls your attention and then return to the

274
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,720
breathing

275
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,680
for

276
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,599
e

277
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,599
for

278
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,640
for and then to end this

279
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:40,520
sitting you can take some long slow deep breaths feeling the contact of your body

280
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:46,400
against whatever surface that you're connected

281
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,960
to and when you're ready you can open your

282
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,520
eyes

283
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,869
[Music]

284
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:23,359
so um so this is a particular way of doing mindfulness meditation there are

285
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:28,640
many different ways it's taught and um and I just want to say

286
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:35,480
that for some people what works best is to just stay with what I taught the

287
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:41,000
first evening mindfulness of breathing and don't make it any more complicated

288
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,200
than that and um and if all you did was every time you wondered off you came

289
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:51,960
back to your breathing stayed with it and developed stability in your breathing it can be

290
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:58,200
phenomenal the Buddhist teacher that I spent time with in Japan said that everything you need to know about

291
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:03,440
Buddhism will be discovered through your breathing so it's breathing is

292
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:09,440
considered really great so if that's you want to keep it really simple that's one

293
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:15,200
opportunity for you one of the reasons why we expand it outwards to include the

294
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:21,920
body emotions and thinking and then other things as we go off is that then

295
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:27,480
more of our life comes under the purview of our attention and

296
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:32,720
awareness and the more we can hold everything in in Awareness it tends to

297
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,880
move our whole life towards Health it tends to move to freedom to Healing to

298
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:43,200
all kinds of good things and we learn how to be present in life for our

299
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:49,560
emotions for our thinking for different parts of our life and it there'll be a time when it's really useful to have

300
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:56,000
that skill when I was a Zen student um I was pretty good at the

301
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:03,640
breath meditation thing but I had no idea how to be mindful of my anger in fact I didn't

302
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:10,400
even know I was angry people would tell me gil you're so angry and I said

303
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:16,119
really um and uh there was uh no um no

304
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:21,680
teaching about how to notice your emotions and be mindful of them and so they were just there operating in the

305
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:28,640
background kind of subconsciously then and having their effect and influence on me same thing with the thinking and so

306
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:35,640
to be able to have a practice that encompasses everything um in my mind Buddhism

307
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:41,119
doesn't say this explicitly is that then your awareness becomes

308
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,800
sacred s it's so special to have an awareness that nothing is left out

309
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,400
nothing's outside of it nothing is not acceptable for awareness to

310
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:58,960
hold then it's a you enter into kind of almost like a different universe if everything can be held in

311
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:04,440
awareness and um and so so we're learning how to do that in this practice

312
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:11,560
how everything has a place for an awareness how everything we can include and be present for it and the big big

313
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:18,440
big Delight Thea moment for me in um when I was practicing in Asia was um I

314
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:25,160
was learning about how to be mindful and I was learning just just a simple Act of mindfulness there was a

315
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:31,800
kind of Freedom that could be found there freedom from entanglement freedom from being for and against variety of

316
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:37,680
kind of freedom and I said wow and I had this moment where I kind of was stopped in my

317
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,800
literally stopped in my tracks and I realized that if I thought you know I

318
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:49,119
can be mindful of anything that's an experience anything that it's a direct experience that I'm having in the moment

319
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:54,599
in theory I can be mindful of it and so in theory I could be free in

320
00:42:54,599 --> 00:43:01,000
relationship to everything I was just and I got so happy that wow that kind of

321
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,400
freedom is possible in this world uh and it comes from being mindful being present for

322
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:15,119
experience so we're trying to teach you here at IMC a way of in bringing in or

323
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:20,599
encompassing your whole life in the scope of mindfulness of

324
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:26,559
awareness and um and so one of the things that includes then is uh and not

325
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:33,400
just meditation but bringing the practice into daily life and one of the great rewards that I get from just do

326
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:39,440
teaching this is when people come meditating for a little while and they say this is fine and good this

327
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:46,480
meditation but how do I bring this into my life how do I bring more mindfulness into my daily life and my activities or

328
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:52,480
what I do and um the line between your

329
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:59,680
you in meditation and you outside of medit meditation is an arbitrary

330
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:05,079
line and and this the deeper ethical sensitivity deeper sense of Peace of

331
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:10,839
calm or deeper intimacy with yourself deeper sense of not being caught seeing

332
00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:17,880
more choice in how you what you're doing and you meditate all these good things that happen with in mindfulness why

333
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:23,119
should you only do it in while you're meditating why not the rest of your life

334
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:28,680
that was my big question that brought me to live at a Buddhist Monastery I wasn't

335
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:35,319
so much interested exactly in the monastery I was interested in how to expand what was happening in meditation

336
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:40,720
in talking with people working doing the different things that I do and so a very

337
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:48,200
important part of this practice and or potential in this practice is to start bringing mindfulness in daily life

338
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:55,160
activities so rather than being distracted and we live in a distracted culture distracting culture I mean

339
00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:01,400
people have written about about this or people who get paid a lot of money to keep you distracted or to to grab your

340
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:07,839
attention and keep it going you know and get more clicks on the your device and whatever to get people's attention it's

341
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:14,400
it's you know and so people's minds they are jumping around jumping and jumping and jumping here and here and here and

342
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:20,720
in doing that they're not being mindful they're not centered settled on their experience here and

343
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:26,640
now and um and so uh so to bring this

344
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:32,920
mindfulness into daily life is helped a lot by find things you can

345
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:41,640
do that you just do that one thing don't multitask if you're at home and

346
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:47,559
cooking just cook don't have the radio if anybody has radios

347
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:52,839
anymore podcasts don't have um you know music

348
00:45:52,839 --> 00:46:00,079
don't have don't be on the phone don't have all the on at the same time and read the news on your on your your

349
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:07,280
tablet you know just to cooking just to be as you're chopping a

350
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:12,480
carrot just be there like you would be just with your breathing in meditation

351
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:20,079
just be with a carrot and chopping the carrot put your attention in your hands have your eyes

352
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:26,839
looking at what you're doing and be and then watch your mind and let if your mind wonders off

353
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:32,319
talk thinking about something else then you know this is boring come

354
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:40,000
back no there's more you know I have a lot to do I have to multitask otherwise I can't do all these things come back

355
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,280
it's just you and the carrot and and then slowly you'll learn

356
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:51,079
something about getting concentrated you'll reclaim your mind that you've

357
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:57,520
lost to distractions and you'll feel how delicious it it is to be present for

358
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:02,960
activity washing your dishes just do the dishes with both

359
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:08,480
hands you don't have to do this of course but if you want to start learning how to bring mindfulness into your daily

360
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:15,920
life you have to train you have to practice it and develop it that capacity and then um and then start

361
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:21,280
expanding where you do it um what I learned from Zen a little

362
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:26,920
trick from Zen was every time I walk through a door

363
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:32,760
frame you're walking into a new place pay

364
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:39,920
attention be mindful of the place you're walking into it was it's been a fantastic thing to do I'm certainly

365
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:45,240
capable of being doing very important things like thinking about how I'm going

366
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:51,640
to teach mindfulness to you caught up in that and I just walk you know from one room in my house to another room in the

367
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:57,240
house and like thinking you know I'm capable of that but it's that's not a a good life

368
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:03,440
either it's good to be present for the life you're living it might seem boring it might

369
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:10,119
seem you're not getting a lot of excitement in your life then but it's kind of like you have to go a transition

370
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:19,040
time like kind of like withdrawal time like withdrawing from caffeine to switch over to being present

371
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:25,839
until being present is delicious it's deeply satisfying it's kind of like you now

372
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:32,000
feel a sense of Integrity or wholeness or completeness or contentment with

373
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:39,359
whatever you're doing because you're present for it in a good way and then when you do that that

374
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:45,520
becomes a vantage point for wisdom and one of the qualities of what

375
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:54,599
what mindfulness is leading to is wisdom to understand better what we do in our lives and um and so once you have some

376
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:59,760
subtleness some stability some continuity of

377
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:08,319
mindfulness uh that becomes a a uh that helps highlight when you start losing

378
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:15,400
it so an analogy that's given is that if you have a a a

379
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:20,960
napkin or a towel or something that's full of

380
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:26,680
stains really dirty you and no one else might notice

381
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:32,680
one more stain it's just not noticed but if you clean it and bleach

382
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:38,240
it and there are no stains then you notice the dirt spot that comes and then

383
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:45,040
you clean it or do something so it turns out the same thing with our mind if our mind is fragmented busy running around

384
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:51,000
doing too many things distracted from distractions by

385
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:57,240
distractions then you don't see what you're doing one more mean word I mean

386
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:04,559
you don't even know to you've been mean to someone because you know you're you're mean all the time you know you

387
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:10,880
it's just normal or something but when you settle down and become calm you see

388
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:17,359
the meanness coming oh look there it is you know oh wow that's a big deal I

389
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:23,640
didn't know how I did it so much and so we start we start seeing how

390
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:28,839
this works so I wonder do a demonstration to you of what you might

391
00:50:28,839 --> 00:50:33,960
see about how your mind works when you are settled enough and

392
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:40,200
mindful enough to see and

393
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:47,319
um and I hope that this is kind of an analogy to you so the idea is you apply

394
00:50:47,319 --> 00:50:53,240
this to yourself in some way so it's a kind of show and

395
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:57,440
tell so

396
00:51:04,359 --> 00:51:10,400
okay so here we have a

397
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:18,280
flower there's a famous story in Zen that once upon a time the Buddha had

398
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:25,440
an assembly of people listening to him ready for him to give a Dharma talk

399
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:33,240
a sermon and he didn't say anything but he lifted up a single flower like

400
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:40,640
this maybe most people were perplexed but one of his disciples

401
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:46,559
smiled and he knew that that disciple understood

402
00:51:46,839 --> 00:51:52,319
it so then we're supposed to figure out what this meaning of the story

403
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:59,720
is but this idea of holding up a flower so the flower many people think a flower

404
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:06,920
is beautiful a flower is a flower and with one flower like this we have what in

405
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:12,200
Buddhism is called the suchness of the flower the flower is just being the

406
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:21,119
flower just it is itself it doesn't even even use the word flower to describe itself it just

407
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:27,000
is the isness of the flower it's content being

408
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:35,520
itself happy but now look what

409
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:46,759
happens now let's see how I do

410
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:53,280
this now I'm holding up two flowers and now we can say something

411
00:52:53,280 --> 00:53:00,359
about the first flower we couldn't say before for we can say that this flower in my

412
00:53:00,359 --> 00:53:06,280
left hand is the big flower and this is the small

413
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:11,359
flower big small okay that's pretty

414
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:16,640
straightforward this is the big one right so there's I'm going to do a slight of

415
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:23,119
hand and you're going to see how not going to do it so fast so you don't see the magic you're GNA you're G to be

416
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:29,720
you're going to see how the magic works and some of the magic is your

417
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:36,799
mind so this was the big flower

418
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:46,040
right it's kind of wilted but

419
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:51,440
now this is the big flower and the big flower has become the

420
00:53:51,440 --> 00:54:00,200
smaller flower you see that small flower big flower wait a

421
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:06,799
minute big flower small flower what is it it's a

422
00:54:06,799 --> 00:54:11,920
flower the isness of the flower but the human

423
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:18,040
mind can compare and some things only exist in

424
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:24,079
the comparison big and small only exists in the mind that compares it's not

425
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:30,960
inherent in the flower a lot of human

426
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:37,119
suffering comes from comparisons one way or the other compare ourselves to others to

427
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:43,680
ourselves in the past or in the future ideals and all kinds of things as we get

428
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:50,240
quieter and mindfulness gets stronger we start seeing the mind doing

429
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:56,480
this we see the birth of a comparison and because we see it in

430
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:02,799
mindfulness we have a choice whether you know do we believe it is this a useful

431
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:08,000
comparison if I want to ask someone to go get the big flower then that's useful

432
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,559
because I say big flower not the small one there's only two so that's that's

433
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:20,240
practical but um go get the ugly flower or get the beautiful flower for

434
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:25,640
me thank you

435
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:31,200
bring me the beautiful person no no bring me the ugly person I mean isn't

436
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:37,880
that painful that we live in a world like that and so you know we do a lot of

437
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:45,760
comparisons and I you know I did a lot of it when I was younger for myself you know I my selfworth was tied

438
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:52,680
to all kinds of things about my body you know I grew up in the hippie times so I

439
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:58,839
was a little bit little bit young for it but I used to sit in school pulling my hair to make it grow

440
00:55:58,839 --> 00:56:04,720
faster because that's what it took or it was just it was just a generation I was

441
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:10,039
in junior high school M Middle School when um they started

442
00:56:10,039 --> 00:56:15,280
um bleaching blue jeans and they would some people would

443
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:21,839
actually put them on the road for cars to drive over they're brand new right or put through the washing machine 10 12

444
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:26,960
times to really make them look old and they would tear them and all that and so

445
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:32,960
I didn't know this this kind of happened over the course of a summer when I was away in Europe and I came back and my

446
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:39,319
hair was shorter my blue jeans were new and this was a

447
00:56:39,319 --> 00:56:44,680
disaster I was no longer acceptable whereas when I lived in Italy

448
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:51,960
for that summer I had longer hair than any of the Italians men boys so I was

449
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:57,240
cool and all I had to do is fly over the Atlantic and come come back to United States and I was no longer

450
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:04,400
cool right big small fires big flower small flower cool man boy not cool boy

451
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:10,839
it's ridiculous right when you describe it that way but we do this kind of thing all day

452
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:17,720
long so part of the wisdom of this practice is have the foundation the

453
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:23,799
subtleness the clarity that we can see this operating as it's

454
00:57:23,799 --> 00:57:30,200
operating we can see it in oursel we can see it in other people it's tragic what happens in

455
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:35,880
our society around these kinds of things but to see it in ourselves and

456
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:41,440
then see it clearly enough we don't buy into it we see it for what it is before

457
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:47,119
we get hooked before it drives us evokes emotions and tensions and all kinds of

458
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:55,359
things so this is an example of the wisdom that can AR arise from the practice because we see what goes on in

459
00:57:55,359 --> 00:58:01,640
the mind so this mindfulness of thinking is not just an abstract thing it has

460
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:07,520
tremendous uh you know consequence and application as we go about our life and

461
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:12,640
so to cultivate slow they cultivate the greater and greater capacity for

462
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:17,680
mindfulness so then in terms of daily life and bringing into daily life it's

463
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:27,240
invaluable to meditate every day or six days a week and um the um and the trick about

464
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:36,680
that is to uh sit as long as it allows you to sit every day

465
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:41,960
so if you say I'm going to sit for 45 minutes but your life doesn't allow for that then you get discouraged and you

466
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:48,240
give it up but if you can only do 10 minutes do 10

467
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:55,680
minutes and probably should be able to get 10 minutes in if you can't

468
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:01,079
do it anyway and find out what's going on find

469
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:07,359
out what emotions what beliefs What feelings what restlessness what

470
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:12,880
anxiety is operating that you can't take 10 minutes to meditate you'll learn a

471
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:18,400
lot about yourself that you won't learn if you just give into all those things

472
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:23,480
and go about you know not paying any attention being driven by your whatever

473
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:31,839
your your desires or anxieties so sitting every day for 10 minutes what might happen to you is that

474
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:38,359
you might find that 10 minutes after a while feels too short well don't sit longer because I

475
00:59:38,359 --> 00:59:43,839
said so but if you say so well it's okay if

476
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:50,960
you get the feeling you die it's nice I like to sit more you might start seeing that it makes a difference in your daily

477
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:56,839
life you might find that you're kinder you might find that you're more relaxed

478
00:59:56,839 --> 01:00:04,400
you might find that you're more paced in what you do you might some people actually say that um that uh they

479
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:11,200
meditate regularly and they don't really see the effect after a while they say well does it really do me any good and

480
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:16,680
then they stop oh boy that was a hard day I you

481
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:22,599
know I got so much more agitated so much more anxious so much more you know speeded

482
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:28,160
up so the idea is if you every day for a short period of Time start bringing

483
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:33,359
mindfulness in daily life um I don't know how it is so much

484
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:41,200
nowadays but um uh there was a time where uh I could feel that if my

485
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:46,520
telephone rang there was some inner drive that it

486
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:53,079
was essential to pick up the phone answer the phone as quickly as possible

487
01:00:53,079 --> 01:00:59,839
no one ever told me that but I I felt like was urgent I have to get there and I learned you don't have to do that most

488
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:04,920
people don't hang up after two rings and I found that I use that as a

489
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:12,400
mindfulness spell I would use that just check in with myself breathe relax and

490
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:17,480
maybe the fourth or the fifth not not so long right four or five rings but just

491
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:24,240
that little bit of time to be connected with myself change my posture relax I

492
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:30,640
was so much better shape to answer the phone I had much better conversations

493
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:36,160
because I took that time to just gave myself that time so there's a lot of

494
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:41,880
these things you can do through the day and um and the more you do it the wiser

495
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:47,880
you'll become meaning the more clarity you'll you'll see more clearly what

496
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:55,119
you're actually doing you'll see the effect that desires

497
01:01:55,119 --> 01:02:01,680
and ill will has and you'll say wait a minute this doesn't make any sense I

498
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:08,160
knew someone here at IMC who had resentment for an ex

499
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:13,640
partner for I think seven years and then one day she was being

500
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:20,319
mindful about her experience of resentment and she said to wait a

501
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:26,359
minute I'm harming myself more than him

502
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:32,440
and then she gave up her resentment so to really see the the cost

503
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:38,240
of these things so here's another teaching story that comes from

504
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:45,160
Buddhism uh it has to do with uh how you apparently how you uh catch trap monkeys

505
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:53,200
in India so you take a coconut and you you cut a slit in it and

506
01:02:53,200 --> 01:03:00,200
kind of carve out a little bit the inside and you put some candy inside because apparently monkeys like

507
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:06,440
sweets but it's the the cut is a slot like you know so in order for the monkey

508
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:13,200
to get the the hand into the slot it has to have the hand flat and it can get in

509
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:18,240
but in order to grab the candy it makes a little bit of a fist and once it's a

510
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:24,480
fist it it can't get it out that slot but it's so greedy it's not not

511
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:30,359
going to let go and so the hunter just comes and picks it up oh because the coconut is

512
01:03:30,359 --> 01:03:35,520
attached to a rope to a tree right so it so it can't go

513
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:42,000
anywhere and so um and so the monkey was so consumed by

514
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,440
its greed it doesn't see the the dangerous position it was putting

515
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:52,559
himself in but if the maybe if the monkey had been

516
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:57,920
mindful he would have maybe maybe felt the problems of having this fist that

517
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:03,880
can't get out and then he would let go and pulled his hand out so we can feel

518
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:11,119
that for ourselves we can feel the effect of greed how it makes us impatient how it leads to anger how it

519
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:16,319
leads to Compulsive activity that ends up harming us and we can then ask

520
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:23,079
where's the where's the grasping where are we fisted up where we caught and because we know how to bring mindful to

521
01:04:23,079 --> 01:04:28,720
mindfulness to our experience we can feel it the fist in our body we can feel where the tension is in our

522
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:34,520
body we might feel the emotions the desire the greed that we might have for

523
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:40,319
something might be really have Deep Roots inside it might be we feel really

524
01:04:40,319 --> 01:04:48,359
insecure and Afraid and we think if I can have that then I'll be safe but that's fascinating to

525
01:04:48,359 --> 01:04:54,680
understand those deeper roots and then bring mindfulness to that it might be think that because

526
01:04:54,680 --> 01:05:00,640
you're being Mindful and you know how to be mindful as of thinking you start noticing the beliefs

527
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:07,000
around what you're trying to grasp what you're greedy for if I have this people

528
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:12,520
will love me if I could have this then I'll be a success and everyone I'll have

529
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:18,640
high status if I can have this then I'll have the pleasure that will put make

530
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:27,200
everything right something you know you fill in the blank I'm just trying to make something up but um so to live a

531
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:33,720
life that two things where you see all these things so you can be

532
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:39,119
wiser and to live a life where you see them and you know from your direct

533
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:44,480
experience something better you know you can like you know

534
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:51,960
it's better not to grasp it's better not to be caught in those comparisons it's better to be settled

535
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:57,279
than it is to be tense agitated there's a feeling of wholeness feeling

536
01:05:57,279 --> 01:06:03,319
of contentment feeling of Peace feeling of well-being that we can carry with

537
01:06:03,319 --> 01:06:08,720
us it's better than a lot of other things and so we do have a healthy

538
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:17,400
comparison there's there a place for comparisons oh look at that if I spend my

539
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:25,200
day you know just pursuing everything that I want

540
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:31,559
more more and more more that doesn't feel as good as a a

541
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:38,400
day where I live contented and peaceful and at home here settled the end of the day I fall asleep

542
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:46,079
in the second way the greedy way I'm still spinning many years ago when I was in my

543
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:52,720
early 20s um I loved you know this is you know some of

544
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:57,960
you matter I hope I don't explain to you what this is um but uh there was

545
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:04,359
something called bookstores and there were lots of them

546
01:07:04,359 --> 01:07:10,599
and um and I loved going into bookstores and uh did a lot of reading

547
01:07:10,599 --> 01:07:18,279
and uh but after a while I realized when I went to bookstores I always was really exhausted and tired when I left why am I

548
01:07:18,279 --> 01:07:24,880
so tired and uh and then I realized some point what it was was I had I had almost

549
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:30,119
no money so I couldn't buy any of the books that I saw but I wanted a lot of

550
01:07:30,119 --> 01:07:35,680
the books I want that one I want that one I want that one at that one and I was just consumed by greed wanting

551
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:40,960
wanting wanting wanting and to spend an hour in a bookstore only wanting is

552
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:46,000
exhausting and that's what tired me out and when I realized that then I went

553
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:54,000
into booksto I still went into bookstores but then I kind of just chilled I just kind of roamed around and

554
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:01,480
looked for some sections and you know approach the bookstore in very different ways so I wouldn't get

555
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:07,200
exhausted so um this is another example of wisdom operating understanding the

556
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:12,359
consequences understanding the what's better for us and what's worse for us

557
01:08:12,359 --> 01:08:18,719
and having a clearer and clear reference point that that's of for some people it's

558
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:25,719
unimaginable the degree of peace and happiness we're capable of experiencing the an unimaginable the the

559
01:08:25,719 --> 01:08:33,440
feeling of feeling fulfilled feeling happy with ourselves for no

560
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:39,838
reason at all just because we're alive in this beautiful way we don't have to

561
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:44,960
be fulfilled our desires don't have to be fulfilled for us to be subtle and

562
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:50,920
happy you can just sit and meditate and feel greater degree of Peace than maybe

563
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:56,359
that you feel any other time and the beautiful thing that happens with this

564
01:08:56,359 --> 01:09:03,400
practice is that then your inner well-being sense of well-being

565
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:09,838
inside becomes less and less dependent on what's happening in the

566
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:16,679
world and you're no longer a victim where your well-being is influenced by whoever

567
01:09:16,679 --> 01:09:23,278
comes along and and uh Praises you or blames you then you're kind of like at

568
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:28,520
their whim but if you car your own confidence and

569
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:33,758
well-being and happiness that's that doesn't depend on what how people think

570
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:39,640
about you then you're not so caught in that world let them think what they

571
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:44,798
do that's not dependent on having the latest and the greatest device that's

572
01:09:44,799 --> 01:09:50,278
out there that happiness only lasts for an

573
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:57,199
hour after you get the device or something like that but the happiness of this inner device

574
01:09:57,199 --> 01:10:04,000
inner connection that we can get with ourselves that can last for a long

575
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:10,320
time so um now it's your turn and if we have

576
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:17,480
time we can do another little meditation but do you have any uh questions now about any of this and what I said today

577
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:22,640
and what's happened here or um about these weeks we've been

578
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,640
together

579
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:32,480
yes

580
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:42,000
please here you go thank you

581
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:47,880
um this is maybe kind of a trivial thing but uh I think

582
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:55,880
of some of the practice as it from kind of a science scientific or curious point

583
01:10:55,880 --> 01:11:01,199
of view so like with distractions when you were talking about doing one thing

584
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:06,560
at a time I uh I have habits of

585
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:12,719
multitasking and so I will just lately I've been do trying the

586
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:19,080
habit of just eating and not reading I can talk to you

587
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:24,760
know I can talk but I just just eat

588
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:30,120
and seeing what's that's like so I guess this is more of a comment than a

589
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:37,840
question that I'm just approaching some parts of the practice from that sort of

590
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:43,320
practical let's just try it see what happens I love it that's that that's the

591
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:49,040
spirit of this practice that's that's how we become our own teacher in this practice by trial

592
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:54,480
and error experimenting trying things out seeing what we learn that's definitely the way the go and that's

593
01:11:54,480 --> 01:12:00,159
even true in meditation there's a little bit of we try things out like today I'm just going to stay more with my breath

594
01:12:00,159 --> 01:12:05,679
what's that like or and then noticing how hard it is like when I start I'm

595
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:13,440
like oh the newspaper's over there I could read no don't read exactly so I think I I that's very very s very

596
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:20,159
gratifying for me to know that you're approaching it that way with experimentation and learning that's Fant

597
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:25,480
that's that's the way to become wise thank you

598
01:12:44,199 --> 01:12:51,080
bu um it's more of a comment just appreciating something that you were just talking about

599
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:57,719
um I found the idea idea really interesting of trying to understand why

600
01:12:57,719 --> 01:13:05,800
we want the things we want um because you know I'm aware that there's this kind of constant engine of

601
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:12,360
Desire I don't think I'm alone and um and we live in a very

602
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:19,000
materialistic Society also and um so I I

603
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:25,440
think the next step after recognizing that you have kind of non-stop

604
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:31,159
desires is actually looking underneath and asking yourself what the root of it

605
01:13:31,159 --> 01:13:38,159
is and right for some reason that never occurred to me before but I really like the idea a lot yeah that's fantastic so

606
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:45,560
so there's a number of ways to get to the roots under the surface to see what's going on I mean you a person could go for a

607
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:51,880
walk and think about it reflect on it and analyze in kind of more intellectual way people go to therapy for that kind

608
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:56,960
of purpose and find out the the historical roots of these things in the

609
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:02,639
in the mindfulness practice it's it's one way out one approach out of many approaches and I'm not saying this is

610
01:14:02,639 --> 01:14:08,040
the best approach or the right approach but I was just to give you the full

611
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:13,120
power in Poss a way that mindfulness Works we're not thinking our way we're

612
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:19,159
not analyzing we're actually being very simple so we would bring careful

613
01:14:19,159 --> 01:14:25,560
attention to the experience of desire and as we stay centered and

614
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:32,800
centered on the desire get to know how it feels like in the body what it gets feels emotionally what's happening in the thinking mind what's happening even

615
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:38,600
in the breathing you start seeing what's going on then at some point things begin kind

616
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:45,320
of clearing up or breaking open a little bit and then what jumps up at you what

617
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:52,120
comes to you what gets revealed not through analysis not by figuring anything out oh underneath that desire

618
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:57,360
there's anxiety or anxiety is the root of it it could be something else I'm

619
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:03,639
just um so the point being we're not trying to go below the surface in this

620
01:15:03,639 --> 01:15:11,040
practice we're trying to be with what's obvious in such a way that whatever needs to be revealed will show itself to

621
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:16,600
us we don't have an agenda in in the moment in the bigger

622
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:21,920
picture we do have the agenda that yeah I really want to get to the root of this and Gil says all I have to do is just

623
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:28,639
stay really present and then it'll come okay so I'm going to be present without an agenda because

624
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:35,960
that's a good you know that's guilt says that's how to fills my agenda it's but it's kind of

625
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:42,920
true just be present for you know so just just be with the obvious the Hallmark of this kind of mindfulness is

626
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:50,080
is just be present for what's obvious and then what's obvious unfolds and changes as you stay and be present and

627
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:55,198
over time you get through the layers and the depth

628
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:04,960
um I've been practicing with is my the volume okay yes for me it's good okay um

629
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:12,000
I've been practicing with trying to stay present with really kind of strong

630
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:19,360
unpleasant difficult emotions when they arise and sometimes it's really tricky to do

631
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:27,719
um especially like with anger it's like there's a heat to it and just it's it's tough to stay with it um I appreciated

632
01:16:27,719 --> 01:16:32,840
some things that you said in the last number of sessions that that have been helpful for this things like I love the

633
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:37,920
analogy of um it was something about not looking a cat right in the eyes just

634
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:43,120
kind of coming up alongside it and waiting for it or something like that

635
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:49,920
and just wanted to take the opportunity to ask if you have any other suggestions or guidance for how to be able to stay

636
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:57,679
present with really kind of you know big emotions or tough emotions yeah uh there's I mean that's a

637
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:04,639
lot to be said but uh like with this really strong anger um a nice thing to

638
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:11,760
do is not meditate with it but maybe go for a long walk and and give freedom to

639
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:17,080
the anger give freedom to your thinking but be present and so there's something

640
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:22,760
about walking the rhythm of walking for me at least that keeps me from getting stuck in my thoughts stuck in whatever's

641
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:28,360
happening and then but I'm paying attention but I'm also giving it Freedom I'm not

642
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:34,000
trying to stop it I'm just letting it run and then because then so I'm it's

643
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:39,199
easier to be present for it that way sometimes than it is sitting still the

644
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:45,800
walking helps it all and that might be a good way to kind of practice mindfulness while walking that's bit by bit you kind

645
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:50,920
of start kind of breaking it open the other thing to do is sometimes with

646
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:57,080
strong emotions like anger is um uh again sometimes it's helpful to

647
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:02,880
just let the thinking just run don't don't try to stop the thinking but uh

648
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:08,800
because maybe that's even needed who knows but anger you know some powerful processes going on we don't even know

649
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:13,840
what's going on so in this practice we want to be respectful of all emotions so

650
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:20,000
even anger um but what I found really helpful is to keep what I call composting it in

651
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:26,840
the body so every time I noticed that I'm thinking about my Angry thoughts feeling angry I have enough wherewithal

652
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:33,560
to be present I feel the anger how it's being expressed in the body how it feels in the body and for me that's called

653
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:38,600
composting it in the body and I keep referring it back to the body the body

654
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:45,199
and every time I do that I'm kind of disengaging a little bit with the story but I'm not trying to stop the story and

655
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:52,360
I find that if I do that over and over again something very different begins to happen but I have to be very careful not

656
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:58,040
to uh want a quick fix I just be patient and just okay just feel it in the body

657
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:05,400
feel it in the body if there's grief it can be very much the same way

658
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:10,880
grief grief is more more commonly recognized that the heart knows how to

659
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:18,760
grieve if we get out of the way if we allow it and so the art of it allowing it is to allow it without sinking into

660
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:24,320
it without participating in it but radical allowance to grieve you're

661
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:32,199
allowed to cry all you want in this meditation as long as you sit reasonably straight and but as soon as you go oh

662
01:19:32,199 --> 01:19:39,040
poor me then you're participating and then then the inner

663
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:44,080
movement the inner processing that can the heart knows how to do gets

664
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:50,760
interrupted so so I've known people who sat like this look they you know from a distance they look like they're deep in

665
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:55,880
meditation not moving and they're cheeks are streaming with

666
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:59,320
yours that that's

667
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:08,880
fine um yeah just a um experience I had um last session

668
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:14,040
actually last week that this is making me think of so I came in here and was

669
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:20,239
feeling some anger about something else and um so I was like okay you know I'm I'm here let me try and be present with

670
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:26,440
us and something switched and it was grief actually and so I was like okay let me

671
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:31,679
try and be with the grief and when I was with the grief and not in the story

672
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:37,600
about the grief it was like it got silent actually and it wasn't grief it

673
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:42,719
was something else I don't know fantastic yeah that's that's so you're describing very well what can happen

674
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:48,960
here and um and uh because you weren't in the story the story sometimes feeds

675
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:55,719
the problem story is kind of participating it and feeding it but if if we cannot be involved in the story

676
01:20:55,719 --> 01:21:03,360
all kinds of other things have a chance to happen that was beautiful for for my point of you is an example of the

677
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:05,920
potential

678
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:18,320
here uh I just wanted to say thank you and you spoke on Sunday about um one

679
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:24,040
aspect of in your talk was about community and I think I'm very new to

680
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:30,760
this so I I really appreciate the opportunity to meet some people that are also on the path and I think we're all

681
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:35,840
kind of on our own separate paths but uh towards self-improvement or Discovery

682
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:43,080
and I just want to say thank you for great for this community thank you very much so that's another thing in terms of

683
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:49,679
uh learning to bring this practice more into your life and spread it out it's actually helpful from per time to time

684
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:55,960
to go meditate with other people and uh so we're here so you're welcome to come here but there might be

685
01:21:55,960 --> 01:22:02,000
I don't know where you live there are other groups you can go to but there's something that um about the osmosis of

686
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:08,280
being around other people who are doing this kind of practice that's something we learn from other people we're

687
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:14,120
mirrored by other people very differently in this kind of environment than we are you know in a hectic work

688
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:19,159
environment um we model things for each other we model how we behave when we're

689
01:22:19,159 --> 01:22:27,320
connected to ourselves in a deeper way that sometimes is hard to see and in other other places in this world we can

690
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:36,560
be inspired um I know that the some teenagers and kids um uh will think that

691
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:42,679
their parents are really strange because they meditate like weird uh but then they find out that

692
01:22:42,679 --> 01:22:48,639
they come like to a Children's Program here and they find out other parents meditate and suddenly their kids their

693
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:55,840
parents are not so weird actually now they're kind of cool and um so anyway so as adults you know

694
01:22:55,840 --> 01:23:02,239
it can be help also that you know that you know you're around people who have similar values and as I said there's

695
01:23:02,239 --> 01:23:08,040
this uh ethics antenna that we we tune into in this practice so there tends to

696
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:14,080
be a little higher ethical values just ethical Norm in this kind of environment

697
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:21,040
and so when you're not gossiping you come here and um and you don't feel strange here so it's a little bit

698
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:29,400
reassuring that you're people understand you and um and then uh and then uh some

699
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:36,719
Sometimes some people find it a lot easier to meditate when they're meditating in a group some people find it harder for the people who it's easier

700
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:42,000
it's this is available come here and whenever we have a session here you're welcome to

701
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:49,800
come and um and we have all kinds of programs and a lot of these programs are ways of building a practice or expanding

702
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:56,400
it and developing it further and further and we have have a whole whole series of progressive programs that you could be

703
01:23:56,400 --> 01:24:03,080
busy here for years because we so we have so much you know in terms of just you know progressively developing

704
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:10,880
maturing this practice more and more so that's another way of continuing is just hang out in the place like

705
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:20,760
IMC so well maybe we should we have five minutes and um I want to thank you I

706
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:27,840
appreciate this chance as I said I think the first their first day I Love Actually teaching the intro class I find

707
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:33,320
it very lots of fun and interesting and I'm I'm also always seeing what what

708
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:39,600
else what's new going to come out of my mouth am I going to learn something

709
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:45,760
today you know and uh so so that's this is kind of uh wonderful for me to be

710
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:53,320
part of this too so thank you and um I used to teach these three times a year

711
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:58,600
I'll Pro I'll probably try to do it again in the fall maybe in August um

712
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:06,440
there's some talk about some other people here teaching one an intro class is that right yeah is that right yeah so

713
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:11,920
Tom's going to come and teach one maybe in some afternoon like a Tuesday afternoon maybe in the next couple of

714
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:19,000
months maybe so it'll be in the newsletter hopefully and it'll be in the calendar and then also Diana Clark has

715
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:25,679
also been talking about wanting to do one uh she's one of our teachers here and so she she does she she might

716
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:31,520
incorporate it into her Monday she teaches every Monday and she might do an inter class on one of her Monday Series

717
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:36,760
so we're going to start slowly start doing more here so some people come back

718
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:42,360
repeatedly to the intro class at first I was worried that that you know am I not

719
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:48,400
teaching well enough but um but I think it's you know

720
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:53,800
it's I it's all so I'll end with this uh a piece of

721
01:25:53,800 --> 01:26:00,880
wisdom andbe I don't know I don't think I said it here I say things in all kinds of settings I don't remember so in in

722
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:06,080
