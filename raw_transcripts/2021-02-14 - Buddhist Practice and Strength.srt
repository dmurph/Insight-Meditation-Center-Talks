1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,400
so i want to share with you some of my

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,759
reflections from this weekend and maybe

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,040
you'll permit me not to

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,519
give a dharma talk but maybe a dharma

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,559
chat

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,960
since um maybe they're not so well

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,560
formulated

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,640
but the topic is an important one and

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,000
one that

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,359
is i think seldom talked about

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,240
and maybe even there's some reluctance

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:28,640
to

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,199
teach it here in the united states

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,320
because that

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,520
the topic is um is easily something that

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,320
is off-putting for people or can come

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,559
across as something which is

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,840
maybe even dangerous

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,760
and uh that is the topic of strength

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,039
uh that the developing uh

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,920
inner strength and inner power even

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,079
through this practice of ours

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,920
that that is part of what we're doing

24
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,160
here in this practice

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,198
and i think much of the

26
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,600
way that the inside meditation practice

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,960
is taught in the modern west

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,080
maybe that's implicit but

29
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,560
it's explicitly more language of

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,360
acceptance

31
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,200
more language of just being with your

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,200
experience

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,320
not trying to fix your experience

34
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,479
the idea of personal agency that you

35
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,360
have some

36
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,880
control some power some uh

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,680
in urex practice is not really get

38
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,079
emphasized

39
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,360
and i think that sometimes maybe it's a

40
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,399
shortcoming that we don't do that and

41
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:43,280
that

42
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,399
really developing becoming strong people

43
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,640
is actually one of the benefits of

44
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,000
developing and practice

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,079
becoming a strong person that develops

46
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,520
strong inner

47
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,438
core or capacity of various kinds

48
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,719
and it's important because certainly we

49
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,960
wanted to have enough strength

50
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,399
to not succumb to our defilements not

51
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,040
succumb to greed hate and delusion

52
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,200
not to come to uh

53
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,760
unwholesome unhealthy fear

54
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,920
and one of the things that people are

55
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,680
can be afraid of

56
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,200
is they can be afraid of themselves

57
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,360
and uh and so certainly be afraid of

58
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,959
things out in the world

59
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,760
but they can be afraid of themselves

60
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,519
afraid of what they're going to say

61
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,959
what they're going to do what they're

62
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,200
going to think and what they're going to

63
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,239
feel

64
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,959
and so there's a kind of an avoidance of

65
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,720
really connecting here

66
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,599
because of this self fear that that can

67
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,959
exist

68
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,280
now uh but that and that self-fear then

69
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,080
also

70
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,000
what it does it can easily dampen uh

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,680
personal strength and in fact some

72
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,000
people are afraid of their strength

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,560
they're afraid that if they are strong

74
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,080
that they will

75
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,599
harm someone that they will

76
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,040
cause trouble for other people other

77
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,959
people be uncomfortable

78
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,640
that somehow they'll be seen as

79
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,519
conceited or seen as being

80
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,560
somehow assertive too much

81
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,560
in a way that's maybe considered

82
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,879
unacceptable in the scenes the situation

83
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,280
we're in

84
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,760
and uh and and then also sometimes this

85
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,080
fear of one's own strength can be

86
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,840
related to a fear

87
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,120
an idea that we don't really

88
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,720
have a full right to exist or we're not

89
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,680
really

90
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,200
worthy enough to be strong that somehow

91
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,120
we're diminished we're less than others

92
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,599
or

93
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,280
we should really what what's you know we

94
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,720
should really kind of

95
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,480
keep uh small stay small or stay

96
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,239
unnoticed or stay in the back row and

97
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,959
somehow diminish ourselves because to

98
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,640
not diminish ourselves

99
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,680
sometimes is socially disruptive for the

100
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,360
scene that we're in

101
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,280
and sometimes in some families and even

102
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,640
some cultures

103
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,079
that there's a preference for somehow

104
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,280
not being a little bit

105
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,600
self-effacing a little bit not assertive

106
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,919
and certainly that can be quite valuable

107
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,600
and at times of quite healthy and

108
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,040
appropriate

109
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,720
but it can lend itself for support

110
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,040
go along with a tendency for people to

111
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,199
be afraid of their own strength or

112
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,000
reluctant to embody it or engage it or

113
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,840
not to realize or appreciate that can be

114
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,960
developed

115
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,320
and grow some people are kind of looking

116
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,120
for

117
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,320
something that's going to fix them some

118
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,960
insight some experience something

119
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,120
that's going to be their savior from

120
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,120
their difficulties they have

121
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,560
and so they're kind of a little bit

122
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,479
looking outside of themselves

123
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,000
for a solution and and one of the things

124
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,919
about strength is strength and practice

125
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,039
develops

126
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,280
there's something that grows from the

127
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,880
inside out

128
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,919
that is a little bit has the effect of

129
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,600
of not solving problems not

130
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,880
providing an answer per se but we grow

131
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,160
in such a way

132
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,360
that like the snake that grows the skin

133
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,479
gets shed

134
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,639
the old skin gets shed and there's

135
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,479
something about cultivating developing

136
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,000
a strong inner strength or sense

137
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,120
of power or powers or strengths maybe in

138
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,120
the plural

139
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,720
that makes us grow and all things

140
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,840
just get shed they fall fall off us

141
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,240
rather than needing to be solved so to

142
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,360
spend too much time

143
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,919
trying to solve problems sometimes as a

144
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,440
dead end

145
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,479
solve our inner turmoils and challenges

146
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,240
sometimes it's actually more useful to

147
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,160
develop a strength

148
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,039
so for example a strength in mindfulness

149
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,800
a strength and concentration

150
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,840
as strength and ethics integrity a

151
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,639
strength in

152
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,160
um in patience and strength in telling

153
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,240
the truth and being truthful to oneself

154
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,319
or maybe to others

155
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,039
as really a strength of presence really

156
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:23,680
to

157
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,440
and sometimes that can be done

158
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,759
physically in fact

159
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,759
so much of what can be developed in

160
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,280
practice develops

161
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,319
uh stronger develops more more more

162
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,520
effectively

163
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,039
if there's a kind of embodied

164
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,560
association or embodied

165
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,199
connection to actually doing this

166
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,680
embodied mindfulness embodied

167
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,120
presence in body truth

168
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,720
so clearly the buddha wanted people to

169
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,319
be strong

170
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,280
and buddhist practice develops inner

171
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,680
strength

172
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,240
and as i said ideally we become stronger

173
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,440
than our defilements

174
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,360
so we don't cause problems in the world

175
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,759
or problems for ourselves

176
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,680
and some of the language that buddha

177
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,039
used in his teachings

178
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,680
are words that i associate with strength

179
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,199
the words like ardency

180
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,479
with practice in an ardent way to

181
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,840
um the word that's often translated as

182
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,360
effort

183
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,840
which kind of the word effort is a fine

184
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,639
word

185
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,199
but it's kind of a neutral neutral word

186
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,120
just effort it doesn't carry any

187
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,560
strength in it and the word that's often

188
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,039
translated as effort is viria

189
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,440
and viria probably more appropriately

190
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,440
should be translated as something like

191
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,199
courageous effort that the word vira

192
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,840
that viri is part of

193
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,160
is a word for hero i've been told that

194
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,520
in modern india

195
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,199
it's the word for a soldier and so

196
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,360
a heroic effort i think is sometimes the

197
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,120
way it's translated in uh

198
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,199
maybe in tibetan buddhism where they use

199
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,879
the word hero that

200
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,240
in related terms so

201
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,000
the idea of courageous effort and

202
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,199
and then also the word power itself that

203
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,479
is used and um

204
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,360
and as people develop in freedom in

205
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,000
buddhism

206
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,199
greater freedom including a freedom from

207
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,840
conceit

208
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,360
they are frequently depicted as becoming

209
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,080
powerful

210
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,200
language and symbolism of mature

211
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,518
practitioners is often with

212
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,360
represented by images of power

213
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,720
so for example there's a delightful suta

214
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,000
where someone who develops

215
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,320
some degree of freedom initial degree of

216
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,800
freedom

217
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,880
together with the seven five seven

218
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,800
powers of awakening seven factors of

219
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,240
awakening

220
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,760
is described as be having a great self

221
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,440
a large self and um it's a little bit

222
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,279
surprising to hear this language of self

223
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,279
use in such a definitive way

224
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,480
a great self a large self and that great

225
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,320
self enlarged self

226
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,600
is uh represented or is the

227
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,560
analogy for it is a kind of a great

228
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,160
mythic being

229
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,560
that develops that grows in the great

230
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,240
himalayan mountains

231
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,800
that's a it's kind of a river spirit a

232
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,200
river serpent

233
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,600
and uh and so it's called the naga

234
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,000
and in this case naga means many things

235
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,920
but one of the things these river spirit

236
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,240
serpents and that a person a person

237
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,240
develops some initial

238
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,200
taste of freedom becomes one of these

239
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,399
great

240
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,839
nagas of with uh who are

241
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,480
of a great self and a large self

242
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,320
expansive self is one translation

243
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,079
the um and uh one of the also delightful

244
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,200
uh expressions of the power the strength

245
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,760
that a

246
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,800
practitioner can have is in what's

247
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,880
called the lion's roar

248
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,079
it was something that the people the

249
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,399
time of the buddha the buddha did this

250
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,480
and other people did it as well they

251
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,000
would declare

252
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
their full awakening when someone came

253
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,839
and told the buddha that they had

254
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,200
then now they were fully awakened

255
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,920
that was referred to their lions roar

256
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,040
and i don't know if you've ever been

257
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,200
close to a lion that roared

258
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,040
but i have fortunately it for me

259
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,959
at the zoo maybe not fortunately for the

260
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,480
lion

261
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,200
but i was probably only standing only

262
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,920
four or five feet away from the lion

263
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,040
and with bars between us

264
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,800
and the roar that it uh directed in my

265
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,079
direction

266
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,320
was one that commanded a tremendous

267
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,680
amount of respect

268
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,800
it had felt i had a primordial feeling

269
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,200
that the like the whole bowels of the

270
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,680
earth were kind of roaring at me and

271
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,040
and uh i thought the only respectful the

272
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,800
only proper thing to do with

273
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,440
that roar was to walk away

274
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,519
so the lions roar not that we're

275
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,360
supposed to walk away from in lines

276
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,240
enlightened people but it's a it's a

277
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,680
expression that conveys

278
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,720
great confidence and great strength

279
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,000
so so one of the things that

280
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,240
are called powers in buddhism and here

281
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,120
we see the powers are not meant to be

282
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,120
powers that we on other people

283
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,040
but rather inner capacities that we have

284
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,279
the five powers are the five faculties

285
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,880
when they're strong

286
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,760
and these are faith or confidence to

287
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,640
have a

288
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,480
conf the power of confidence of faith

289
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,800
uh the power of this courageous effort

290
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,480
that the courageous effort has now

291
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,160
become something a real strength that we

292
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,839
carry with us

293
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,320
the power of mindfulness the power of

294
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,839
samadhi

295
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,839
usually translate as concentration and

296
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,120
the power of wisdom

297
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,200
what a great power to have ways to be

298
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,839
wise in a way that has a real strength

299
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,800
that we carry with us

300
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,680
another place we seek i associate with

301
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,120
powers what's called the

302
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,320
four resolves and uh

303
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,600
the holy word is aditana which is a

304
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,200
means could almost more literally try to

305
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,079
be translated

306
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,839
in english as taking a stand

307
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,720
the etymology of the word and but

308
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,720
usually as resolves

309
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,440
and and so what we have resolved for is

310
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,360
what there's a power there's a strength

311
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,360
behind us in doing it

312
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,079
and um and so these are also interesting

313
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,040
lists

314
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,320
um again it's not power over others

315
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,519
so it's um the first one

316
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,760
resolve is not neglecting wisdom

317
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,880
the second one is um

318
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,079
is um

319
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,920
preserving protecting the truth

320
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,440
the third is cultivating the capacity to

321
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,279
let go

322
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,200
to relinquish and the fourth is to

323
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,560
train in peace train peacefully train to

324
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,399
become more peaceful

325
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,120
to so to develop a strength of being

326
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,920
peaceful

327
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,240
sometimes we don't associate i think

328
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,160
power and peacefulness together it's

329
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,320
almost like peacefulness is is an

330
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,560
alternative to being powerful but the

331
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,320
power the resolve of

332
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,760
being peaceful so

333
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,839
living in a confident committed and

334
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,040
dignified

335
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,000
fashion is are some of the associations

336
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,920
with this developing this power this

337
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,000
capacity to be

338
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
and so there's not in itself if there's

339
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,440
not a there's a there's

340
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,360
it doesn't look from the outside like

341
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,079
some developed practitioner is

342
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:00,720
self-effacing

343
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,880
at least not in how they carry and hold

344
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,560
themselves

345
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,639
but it is in terms of not having any

346
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,800
conceit or arrogance

347
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,600
letting go of being self-centered at the

348
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,800
same time as being

349
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,920
strongly centered

350
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,800
no egotistical center but a strong

351
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,600
centered in our lived vital experience

352
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,240
of being

353
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,199
here and present

354
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,120
one of the ways we might understand this

355
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,760
is to live in a manner where there's no

356
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,639
need to apologize for ourselves

357
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,279
i think there's a strong tendency in in

358
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,720
the united states for

359
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
some people to constantly want to say

360
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,199
they're sorry to apologize to

361
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,600
to kind of diminish themselves for

362
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,720
exerting themselves or being even being

363
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,399
and i think that to live in a way that

364
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,000
we don't have to apologize

365
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,839
not regularly of course not regularly

366
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,839
not as a policy not as a

367
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,839
second nature thing to always feel sorry

368
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,760
or apologize

369
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,320
and the way to do that in buddhism is to

370
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,959
live

371
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,720
what the buddha called the blameless

372
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,639
life a

373
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,800
life the blamelessness that is meant to

374
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,959
bring a certain kind of joy

375
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,839
the strength of a blameless life and

376
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,440
this is to live a life

377
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,880
that adheres to the precepts to not

378
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,399
harm people not intentionally be

379
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,279
involved in causing hurt or harm through

380
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,880
killing and stealing and sexual

381
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,040
misconduct and lying and

382
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,079
and using intoxicants and to

383
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,600
really have confidence that one is

384
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,279
living this way

385
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,320
um the end

386
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,480
we end up living a life we don't

387
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,399
apologize for ourselves

388
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,519
to be blameless and i don't think it's

389
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,120
second nature for many of the people

390
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,560
here in this country

391
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,880
but it's uh but if you can live that way

392
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,519
then you're encouraged to feel the joy

393
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,959
of that

394
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,959
the joy and the power of a blameless

395
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,560
life an unapologetic life

396
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,839
in the dhammapada there's

397
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,320
wonderful descriptions of of strong

398
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,600
people

399
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,000
that they don't use the word strong but

400
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,480
i think we can substitute it

401
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,639
reasonably enough and there's a whole

402
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,560
chapter called the brahman

403
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,920
the brahmanas were kind of the priests

404
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,680
of the brahmanical religion

405
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,560
they're also a hereditary role so there

406
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,160
were families that were brahmanical

407
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,199
families

408
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,279
and they thought of themselves as being

409
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,839
the top

410
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,880
class in society and uh

411
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,880
the dominant class and often they were

412
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,120
had a lot of authority sometimes and

413
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,399
owned a lot of land had a lot of wealth

414
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,079
and uh they're responsible for the

415
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,920
religious rituals of the brahmanical

416
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,199
religion

417
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,240
and there was often a kind of not just

418
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,600
in buddhism but in

419
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,320
other areas of india as well a kind of

420
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,920
jockeying for

421
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,600
position or um you know

422
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,440
but who was it really should be dominant

423
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,520
or kind of kind of critique of the

424
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
dominance of the brahmanas

425
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,720
and the buddha he did this by

426
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,720
redefining what it means to be a

427
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,918
brahmana

428
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,959
and he defined a brahman as someone who

429
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,079
has some degree of spiritual awakening

430
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,000
and so so here are some examples of

431
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,480
these

432
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,918
ways which he says this this is a verse

433
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,640
from the dhammapada

434
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,080
who has no clinging who has

435
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,840
nothing i call the brahmana

436
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,720
so at first no clinging having nothing

437
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,240
and that doesn't really seem

438
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,760
like a situation of power or strength or

439
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,520
you know important class of people in

440
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,840
society or someone someone to revere or

441
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,120
something who has no clinging who has

442
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,919
nothing

443
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,520
i call the brahmana whoever

444
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,960
is most excellent a bull

445
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,160
a hero a great sage a

446
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,080
conqueror free of craving cleansed

447
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,000
awakened i call a brahmana so here now

448
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,240
that's all these are all synonyms for

449
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,760
the same person all kind of describing

450
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,160
the same kind of person

451
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,080
hey or they're talking about excellence

452
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,080
a bull which is a powerful

453
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,679
uh animal and a hero which has

454
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,360
strength to it and a conqueror

455
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,440
now this can be quite off-putting for

456
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,720
many people in the west to have these

457
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,000
kind of masculine

458
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,799
seeming words or concepts associated

459
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,240
with it

460
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,039
but but there is clearly a show

461
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,320
associated with

462
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,600
non-clinging freedom from craving inner

463
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,840
cleanliness

464
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,880
it's not an assertiveness or a dominance

465
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,840
the idea of conquering being a conqueror

466
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,320
is really becoming conqueror of

467
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,760
one's own defilements one's own inner

468
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,160
attachments and clinging one conquers

469
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,679
oneself in a sense

470
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,039
not others so we get this

471
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,240
clear example in other verses

472
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,080
that this power strength of a

473
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,559
practitioner is not meant to be

474
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,400
over other people it's really over

475
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,520
themselves in these verses

476
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,799
having given up violence towards beings

477
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:23,360
both

478
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,120
timid and strong whoever neither kills

479
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,240
or causes others to kill i call

480
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,600
a brahmana i call i say

481
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,120
is strong whoever is not adversarial

482
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,720
among those who are

483
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,840
peaceful among those who are violent not

484
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,919
clinging among those who cling

485
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,760
i call a brahmana whoever lets passion

486
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,280
hostility conceit and hypocrisy fall

487
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,160
away

488
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,480
like a mustard seed from the tip of an

489
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,440
all

490
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,520
i call a brahmana who speaks

491
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,960
what is true informative and not harsh

492
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,640
who gives offenses offense to no one

493
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,919
i call a brahmana

494
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,200
so for me in in these

495
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,240
these verses all this emphasis on

496
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,760
non-harming

497
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,679
is presented in a way that prevents a

498
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,280
real strength of people there's a

499
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,080
dedication a community this definitively

500
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,799
this is what a person is this idea of a

501
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,640
blameless life that doesn't cause harm

502
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,000
in any kind of way

503
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,760
to do that with strength and be able to

504
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,039
stand up and

505
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,919
in a dignified to be a dignified

506
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,440
confident way

507
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,200
to carry oneself in the world with

508
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,640
confidence

509
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,200
to no one sells well enough to know all

510
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,480
the forces of fear

511
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,520
self-belittlement self-fear

512
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,240
the ways that we self-criticize ourself

513
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,280
or

514
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,760
and and kind of become less than who we

515
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,559
are

516
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,640
and to learn to shed those to learn to

517
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,760
not have them

518
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,880
diminish us us so that our native

519
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,520
strength we don't we're not it's not

520
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,880
assertive strength

521
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,280
it's not like puffing ourselves up in

522
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,240
some arrogant macho way

523
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,480
but rather the native strength of who we

524
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,440
are

525
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,960
can be there in a simple natural

526
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,240
full way it's not we don't

527
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,679
we don't diminish it we don't

528
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,960
apologize for it we don't you know

529
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,159
hide it or hide from it that somehow

530
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,000
we're allowed to be

531
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,200
strong we're allowed to be present fully

532
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,600
embodied in here in a clear definitive

533
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,080
way we are worthy of that

534
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,640
in fact one of the the meaning for our

535
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,640
heart someone is fully awakened

536
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,760
literally means a worthy one and uh

537
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,840
i i kind of like to translate to

538
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,960
interpret that i mean

539
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,960
they're worthy of really being present

540
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,120
to being here and alive and full

541
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,039
so that one of the goals of buddhist

542
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,919
practice is to become fearless

543
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,679
and and part of that is to stop

544
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,679
undermining ourselves through fear

545
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,280
and the fear that i wanted to emphasize

546
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,880
today in this chat is

547
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,799
self fear how we are afraid of ourselves

548
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,880
and therefore diminish ourselves and

549
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,280
and kind of undermine our strength

550
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,600
so to do this it helps to take stock of

551
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,480
our fear

552
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,120
of how we're afraid of ourselves

553
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,159
including

554
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,440
our fear of being strong

555
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,440
this then allows us to address these

556
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,880
fears

557
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,679
and develop growing confidence in our

558
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,679
capacity to live intentionally without

559
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:44,400
harming

560
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,240
anyone including ourselves

561
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,200
so i hope that

562
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,240
these ideas that i've presented here

563
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,400
uh are meaningful enough for you for you

564
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,000
to reflect and consider

565
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,280
a little bit how it is that um

566
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,400
as a pro in what appropriate way

567
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,760
can you step up

568
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,039
and uh and allow for yourself

569
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,400
to have a native power native strength

570
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,919
of someone who metaphorically

571
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,280
stands their ground

572
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,320
speaks speaks freely and confidently

573
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,880
what they feel like they have to say can

574
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,400
talk honestly

575
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,360
can doesn't diminish themselves but just

576
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,559
as they're

577
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,960
allowed to be present and fully there

578
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,600
and

579
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,480
have a voice and show up and um

580
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,360
and that that is i think one of the

581
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,279
great

582
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,919
benefits from doing mindfulness practice

583
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,919
the mindfulness practice that helps us

584
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:52,880
to

585
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,080
let go of any force within us

586
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,279
that diminishes us that undermines our

587
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,400
native natural strength that's here

588
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,520
and in doing so um we might

589
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,559
end up looking like strong people

590
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,000
in the eyes of others but in our

591
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,880
in our own inner sense we won't

592
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,600
necessarily

593
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,039
feel that we are now strong

594
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,200
the inner sense is feeling now we're

595
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,039
free

596
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,360
and uh but to be free from the outside

597
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,400
will look as if we become strong

598
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,000
so i hope that you will think about

599
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,400
this and reflect on it and so hopefully

600
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,840
there's something of what i said today

601
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,559
that

602
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,760
will be useful for you and

603
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,480
i would love to meet each of you in your

604
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,679
strength

605
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,840
so thank you all very much
