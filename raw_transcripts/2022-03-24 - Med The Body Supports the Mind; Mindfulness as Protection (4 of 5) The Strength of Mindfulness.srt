1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,358
so good morning or day or evening

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,920
it's nice to see everyone coming on it's a good time to start uh sitting

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,760
together so just settling in

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,480
once again and finding your meditation posture for today

5
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,720
bringing the attention gently into the body

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:43,680
maybe just taking a moment to check in internally how are you right now

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,000
how's the body how's the mind

8
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,559
just knowing that you're here letting go of whatever you were doing

9
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:05,239
before or whatever activities were needed before getting to the screen

10
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,520
and just knowing that you're taking this time for meditation

11
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,720
so inviting some ease throughout the body

12
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:41,119
maybe softening some of the usual tight places

13
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,000
maybe the face letting that soften

14
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:54,399
the jaw letting the shoulders release

15
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,200
just soften

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,719
softening the belly

17
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,239
and the arms and legs

18
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,080
shifting the body slightly if needed in order to have a balanced and natural

19
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,080
posture

20
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,319
encouraging a sense of aliveness in the body

21
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,319
alertness and also relaxation

22
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,840
and then similarly in the mind inviting some ease

23
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,920
so there may be thoughts or feelings

24
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,640
which is all fine and normal but can we find some part of the mind

25
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,000
that can be at ease with that

26
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,280
somehow by knowing that by just being aware of what's going on

27
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,400
often the mind can relax

28
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,480
and to help the mind orient we can feel the sensations of the

29
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,879
breath

30
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:19,000
the in and out rhythm of however the breath is right now

31
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:02,720
and then expanding the awareness to include the whole sense of the body

32
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,479
so not necessarily the details of each little sensation

33
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,759
but the general sense of the sitting posture

34
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,400
or if you're lying down the lying down posture

35
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,880
even if the breath remains the primary object it's very helpful to have

36
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,600
a general sense of the body sitting

37
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:39,039
so in today's sit i would like to offer [Music]

38
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:46,400
three ways that the scent of the body

39
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,199
is useful in

40
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:57,039
being with the changes that happen in the mind being

41
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,479
with the thoughts and emotions that can distract the mind

42
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:09,599
so the ways that the body can support the mind

43
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:20,918
and they're only if you're interested if you prefer to just stay with your meditation that is fine

44
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,680
so these are supports that we can bring in [Music] at a time when we notice that the mind

45
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,120
is easily getting caught up

46
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,360
so as you're sitting resting with

47
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:09,599
the breath of the body if the mind is getting going down rabbit holes shall we say

48
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:15,520
we can firm up our sense of the body

49
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:23,440
so instead of getting drawn down into anxiety or sadness

50
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,960
or envy one of the heavy emotions

51
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:37,200
we can rest in the sense of substantiality in the body

52
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:47,519
somehow that strength of the material body can sometimes

53
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:54,920
keep the mind from getting overwhelmed by an emotion

54
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,160
so it's useful to get familiar with feeling that

55
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,600
substantiality of the body

56
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:55,440
another way that the body can support the mind

57
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,320
is to tune in to the stillness

58
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,720
of the body to emphasize the non-moving

59
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:15,279
part of the posture and to imagine that as a

60
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:24,079
a calming or a dampening effect so this is useful when the mind is

61
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:31,120
engaged with the flames of irritation or discontent

62
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,839
the various ways that the mind can flare up

63
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:49,680
and then we can have a sense of the stillness of the body like a calm lake

64
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:57,320
cooling down the tirade of the mind

65
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:14,160
the contrast between the still body and the movement of the mind is obvious

66
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:22,040
so we can help to reel the mind back in

67
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:14,240
and then the third option [Music] for how the body can support the mind

68
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:20,959
works particularly well with the meditation on the breath

69
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:28,399
simply to increase the continuity of the mindfulness

70
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:37,360
the extent of it so we can allow mindfulness to pervade more of the

71
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:45,560
body really feeling the fullness of the breath in the body

72
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,680
and also extend the continuity in time

73
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,720
to feel the full duration of the breath

74
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,760
committing to stay with all the little sensations throughout the body throughout the

75
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,320
length of the breath

76
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:21,519
and we may find that there's something satisfying about that in a certain way

77
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:28,240
because it's simple just to be with these various breath sensations

78
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:36,959
and then there's no room for long thoughts or complex emotions

79
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,560
there's some satisfaction with that

80
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:33,199
so we can imagine that the mind gains strength through its association

81
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:38,560
with the body together they can

82
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:48,279
prevent various thoughts and emotions from taking hold and dragging the mind and heart around

83
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:58,800
and it's not that we don't need to attend to those things but it's often helpful in meditation to

84
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:05,520
to say not now we will think about these things but but

85
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,919
later

86
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:22,000
so we have the substantiality of the body

87
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:35,120
and the sense of stillness it can cool the mind down

88
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:45,480
and the continuity the close connection between mind and body

89
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:08,240
so noticing how the mind and the body work together

90
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,200
even in meditation which may seem like it's mostly about the mind

91
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,200
there's this interaction going on

92
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,840
they support each other

93
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,960
oh

94
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:53,400
perhaps there are ways during your day today

95
00:26:53,919 --> 00:27:00,320
when you could find ways to benefit from this support

96
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,519
between the body and the mind

97
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,320
the body is always in the present moment

98
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:19,039
so we can always drop into our awareness of the body

99
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:25,840
throughout the day whether we're on the computer or talking with someone

100
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,440
or shopping whatever we need to do

101
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:43,440
maybe there's a way to connect with the material substance of the body its

102
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,600
robustness its strength even if we're not physically strong the

103
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,398
sense of substantiality

104
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:01,158
to help the mind be more grounded

105
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,840
or maybe we can use the relative

106
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:21,520
slowness of the body to slow the mind down

107
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:31,720
to dampen down any flames that arise in the mind

108
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:47,200
or maybe just deliberately tying the mind to the body for a

109
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:53,039
stretch of time will provide less opportunity for the

110
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:58,200
mind to wander off or to get caught up

111
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,640
the body is so available to us and there are many ways that it can

112
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:12,720
support our mind throughout the day and then that supports our relationships

113
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:19,760
and our ability to be present and to do what we can to serve this

114
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:27,720
world that so much needs our presence

115
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:54,440
[Music] uh

116
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,280
[Music]

117
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:31,440
so we're talking this week about mindfulness as a protection

118
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,279
and different dimensions of that image and we talked earlier about

119
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:43,600
mindfulness as safety and non-mindfulness is danger

120
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,880
and kind of along similar lines but with a different facet of that

121
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:56,640
sometimes the buddha talked about mindfulness as a strength and lack of mindfulness as weakness

122
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,640
so today we'll talk about protection in the form of

123
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,399
strength and there are a whole [Music]

124
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:15,919
bouquet of wonderful similes about this in the discourse that is on mindfulness of

125
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:22,159
the body that's matching uh 119 for those of you who

126
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:28,799
want to look it up and i just want to um read a little bit

127
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:34,240
about some of these images are really great so

128
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,279
um okay so when someone

129
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:44,399
has not developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body

130
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:51,840
mara that is the forces of distraction mara finds an opportunity and a support

131
00:31:51,840 --> 00:32:01,760
in that person suppose someone were to throw a heavy stone ball upon a mound of wet clay

132
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:09,200
and then he asks what do you think would that heavy ball find entry into that mound of wet clay and the monks say oh

133
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,559
yes yes venerable sir and so if someone has not cultivated

134
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:19,840
mindfulness of the body mara can get in

135
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:25,760
and then later he's and then he says the opposite of that you know suppose that

136
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,880
someone has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body

137
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,919
in that case mara cannot find an opportunity or support

138
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,440
and the image is suppose a person were to throw a light ball of string at a

139
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,559
door panel made entirely of heartwood what do you think would that light ball

140
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:53,039
of string find entry through the door panel of heartwood and of course the monks say no

141
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:58,799
no it wouldn't so we have this these two powerful contrasting images of a heavy

142
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:04,640
stone ball thrown into wet clay and a light ball of string thrown against a

143
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:11,679
door of heartwood and so as i reflect on this um

144
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:18,799
i know that there are times when you know when the emotional state is kind of one of collapse

145
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:24,159
right and so you know the mind is just kind of collapsed and so it's it's easy

146
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:29,840
for even small things to push their way into our psyche at times like that

147
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:35,120
and so this image of a stone ball kind of points toward heaviness and burden

148
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:40,159
and then in in contrast a door that's made of heartwood feels

149
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:46,399
upright and strong and solid it has a clear shape and clear

150
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:52,080
boundaries so i think that's the contrast being made

151
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,519
here i know i've had sittings where my mind was repeatedly overrun by certain

152
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:04,159
emotions or thought trains and then when i look back after regaining mindfulness

153
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:10,878
it's as if i had no firmness along that dimension where the thought or emotion was coming in

154
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:17,839
and even if i was vaguely aware that those thoughts were starting to emerge i had no real resistance to their just

155
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:23,599
pushing into my whole consciousness like the wet clay doesn't resist an entry of

156
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:30,560
a stone ball so then you know what's the remedy for this when we realize

157
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:37,839
you know sometimes it can help to just be a bit firmer in our resolution to sit in meditation

158
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:43,079
or we can use as i mentioned in the guided meditation this feeling of

159
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:49,760
substantiality and body to bolster the strength of the mind

160
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:56,398
so the door image nicely conveys that we're kind of closing the door on certain inputs that they don't gain

161
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:03,119
entry into the mind and just say no thank you this is not the time for that and we

162
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:09,760
in that way we kind of bolster our healthy boundaries in mind if you will

163
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,720
so then there's a second image we're going to do three images all from

164
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:22,079
this suta today the second image says

165
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:28,640
again suppose that somebody were not to cultivate mindfulness of the

166
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,720
body and so he says suppose there were a dry sapless piece of wood

167
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,760
and a person came with an upper fire stick thinking i shall light a fire i

168
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:46,160
shall produce heat what do you think monks could that person light a fire and produce heat by

169
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:52,880
rubbing the dry sapless piece of wood with an upper fire stick and they say oh yes that would work well

170
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:59,440
and similarly he says mara can find an opportunity or support in someone who hasn't cultivated

171
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,800
mindfulness of the body and then the opposite image is

172
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,839
suppose there were a wet sappy piece of wood and a person came along with an

173
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:16,880
upper fire stick and wanted to light a fire but they would not be able to do that

174
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:25,520
you know because of the wet sappy piece of wood that they were striking it against and so you know similarly

175
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:31,839
we have this image then of this image i think relates especially to

176
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:38,240
irritation or aversion but it could also i think apply to greedy or deluded thoughts but when the

177
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:44,320
mind is is weak and it's not connected well to the body the mind can easily pick up a

178
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:51,200
small input like a pain in the body or a subtle thought of frustration or dislike

179
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,720
and then keep rubbing away at it until it catches fire it becomes a huge

180
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:03,920
conflagration in the mind but with mindfulness of the body that repeated irritation

181
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,200
can't build up and cause the fire have you ever had sittings like this i

182
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:16,880
certainly have so i remember one time having a conversation with a nun who was talking about how her mind

183
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:23,440
sometimes felt like it was on fire and she was struggling to put it out during meditation

184
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:29,680
and she said that often when she would investigate more carefully around the edges of that fire

185
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:35,839
maybe the parts that weren't so much in the foreground of her consciousness she would discover that some part of her

186
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:43,119
own mind was throwing kindling on the flames you know kind of in the side where she wasn't looking so carefully

187
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:49,200
and this is really the case you know we so maybe the image from the suta would be that over on the side we we're

188
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:55,040
rubbing the fire stick and just generating more and more sparks to build up the flame

189
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:00,720
so um you know we think that what we need to do to deal with is our irritation and our frustrating our

190
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:07,920
frustration because that thing is so irritating and i have to manage my irritation of it and it's so irritating

191
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:15,359
but in fact there are many supports in our own mind that inflame irritation or frustration

192
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:21,040
the image of the two fire sticks is pretty apt in that we're supplying half

193
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:26,320
of the stimulus right which maybe we're supplying both haves

194
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:33,599
so [Applause] often we have views and beliefs that we aren't quite aware of or expectations that's

195
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:40,640
very common so the mind is getting riled up and if the mind is getting riled up repeatedly

196
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:46,400
it can be worth investigating to see what ideas or expectations in our own

197
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:52,320
mind are contributing and then bringing mindfulness to those and one

198
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:58,160
support can be to feel the stillness and the relative coolness of

199
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:04,880
the body so to imagine the body is kind of a um a lake and at least the awareness of

200
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,160
the body as a calm lake and then this conflagration in the mind is kind of on

201
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:17,200
top of that and contrasts with it so we should be able to use that to investigate and see

202
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,760
how it is that we're riling ourselves up

203
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:30,400
okay and then the third image in the suta is of a water jug so

204
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,599
in the case of non-mindfulness of the body suppose there were a hollow empty water

205
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:40,640
jug set out on a stand and a person came with a supply of water

206
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:46,400
what do you think could the person pour water into the jug oh yes yes of course

207
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,440
and so similarly someone who has not developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body

208
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:56,640
mara finds an opportunity and a support and then the contrast is that if there

209
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:03,520
were a water jug that were full right up to the brim with water and a person were to come along could they pour water into

210
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:10,079
that jug and the monks say no no of course not and so if we've cultivated mindfulness

211
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:15,119
of the body then it's like trying to pour water into a full drug

212
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:22,560
we can't do it and so in this image there's a sense of fullness as a strength and

213
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:27,760
in my own practice i see this as relating to continuity of mindfulness

214
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:33,680
so there are kind of two dimensions of continuity in relation to mindfulness of the body

215
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:39,680
and my use of the breath as an example in the meditation so we can be aware of the full

216
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:46,000
spatial extent of the breath it's not just in the lungs but it kind of pervades the whole body

217
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:52,319
as energy and actually even if we try to look for the boundaries of the body sometimes they're

218
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:57,920
not so clear so it might be that the breath extends even out into space a bit

219
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:04,319
and when we're full to the brim we haven't left out any aspect of the breath

220
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:10,319
in the bodily experience there's a fullness to how we're experiencing that

221
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:15,599
and then there's also the second dimension of continuity and time so we can be aware from the very

222
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:22,480
beginning of the in-breath to the end of the in-breath the little gap and the start of the out breath and then all the

223
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:28,000
way to the very end even as it gets very subtle before the next in-breath

224
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,280
and when mindfulness has this kind of fullness then there's no opportunity for some

225
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:40,720
distraction to slip in any more than we could pour water into an already full pitcher

226
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,160
so if we pay attention in our own mind we can check where in the cycle of the breath

227
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:52,800
does mindfulness tend to be weak you know that's where the thoughts can find entry or are there parts or regions of the

228
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,000
body that we're not really aware of and so you know if we have thoughts or

229
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:06,640
emotions that are related to that part of the body they would easily get into the mind and start growing

230
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:13,520
so then so there are interesting images right about mindfulness as a strength and not succumbing to the

231
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:21,200
weakness of being overpowered by these various things in the mind and then the buddha after that

232
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:26,319
lists a bunch of benefits of mindfulness of the body we don't have time for all

233
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:31,839
the benefits but i want to just mention a few of them

234
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,280
so one of them is that and again it uses this image of you'll

235
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,560
hear the strength metaphor one becomes a conqueror of discontent

236
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:48,480
and delight and discontent does not conquer oneself one abides overcoming

237
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,680
discontent whenever it arises one becomes a conqueror of fear and

238
00:42:53,680 --> 00:43:00,000
dread and fear and dread do not conquer oneself one abides overcoming fear and dread

239
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,359
whenever they arise so there's a sense of [Music]

240
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:10,720
strength in being able to overcome various issues in the mind

241
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:18,000
and then it goes on there's another one about overcoming one bears well with cold and heat hunger

242
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:26,240
and thirst contacts with various physical things wind the sun creeping things

243
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:32,160
and also one endures ill-spoken unwelcome words and painful bodily

244
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:39,920
feelings so there's a way in which this mindfulness of the body gives strength for unpleasant physical and mental

245
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:46,000
experiences and our willingness to be present in our

246
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,319
form helps us to overcome those things to conquer those things and then i'll skip to the end of the

247
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:57,599
list which is where one realizes for oneself with direct

248
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,880
knowledge and abides here and now in deliverance of mind and deliverance

249
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,960
by wisdom the destruction of the taints so all of that is code for one reaches full

250
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:14,960
awakening so mindfulness of the body can take one all the way to freedom

251
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:21,680
from great hatred and delusion so all of this power or strength i want

252
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,800
to emphasize is not the kind of power that is oppressive or dictatorial or

253
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:32,800
aggressive instead i will suggest that it comes from compassion

254
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:38,000
it's the strength of really caring about our own mind and heart

255
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:45,280
and also caring about other people so um you know when we're strong and mindful

256
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,480
we are protecting our own well-being from the various inputs that we've said

257
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:56,800
many times we're not going to be able to not have inputs we're going to have to learn somehow to meet them with

258
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:03,599
mindfulness and this strength that's being pointed to here comes from caring about our well-being

259
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:08,880
caring that we are able to meet things well in life everything from the irritation in our

260
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:15,440
need to ill-spoken unwelcome words to discontent because life is

261
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:21,680
challenging and we can't get things the way we want it all the way up to the moment of death

262
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:27,599
so when we're strong and mindful we can protect not only our well-being

263
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:33,440
but we can i'm now going to say extend that protection outward to care for others

264
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:38,800
and that's tomorrow's topic is mindfulness as protection for both our self

265
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:47,359
and others so i hope you'll appreciate these images of strength and be inspired is um

266
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:53,520
that mindfulness is really a powerful force in our lives and it may bring you a lot of benefit today

267
00:45:53,520 --> 00:46:00,520
and also spread to those around you all right see you tomorrow
