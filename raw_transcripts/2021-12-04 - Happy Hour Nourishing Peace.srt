00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:48,800
so so we have time for questions

105
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:56,160
four comments and jane i see your hand is raised is that correct no

106
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,720
so yes we have time i see gabriel's hand is raised is that

107
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:12,400
correct gabriel yes yes

108
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,839
please hello nikki thank you very

109
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:23,119
so every question that popped up in my mind

110
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:28,960
during the session it was about the teachings on meta and on anatom that

111
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,320
self i was curious hear you say a few words about how we can work with the both of

112
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:41,280
these and if they can help each other yeah there is so much i can say about

113
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:47,839
this so um but without going into our long drama talk

114
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:55,520
tell me how this is coming up for you how it's showing up this question for you so i know what to say that might be

115
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:01,440
helpful to where you are in your practice right now with this uh yes so

116
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:08,079
um i'm working my practice on

117
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:15,200
some inside practice and just to see how the cell is concentrate and i'm wondering to see all the say

118
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:21,359
that again the selfish contract is constructed sorry yes it's built by the mind

119
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:27,119
and at the same time so this can sometimes feel a bit dry you

120
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:32,320
know but and at the same time there is the meta practice that uh

121
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:37,599
and i don't i don't know my uh it's just

122
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:43,359
it's not clear still in my mind how they can how they work together i know that they do but i'm not sure i'm not i don't

123
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:48,960
know yet how precisely got it great okay so

124
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,640
the the way i hear your question the way this is arising for you is that you're working

125
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,560
with inside practices and anata saying how self is

126
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,640
constructed how the self that is constructed from our thoughts and ways of seeing and

127
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,680
being and in some ways it feels kind of dry and

128
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:17,280
and you have this intuition that that meta care love has something to do

129
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,640
with this practice but don't quite know how it fits in yet did i hear you

130
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,960
correctly and you can keep yourself unmuted if you like when you do the back and forth yeah so and to be more

131
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:35,920
specific just it may be interesting i'm working with this in relation to my music practice because i try to see uh

132
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:44,160
when i play it's there is no me in there it's just happening by itself and it feels very rich to explore those ideas

133
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:50,880
and that's why i'm working with that got it okay well that's very helpful that's beautiful to hear that you're

134
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,240
yeah this is a sense of co-creation there's so much in creativity that

135
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:03,359
it feels like it moves through you it moves through you it's and and of course part of it is your

136
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:08,960
volition part of it is your will and and and also all the causes and conditions

137
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:16,000
so so to yeah i'm so glad you brought music especially because seeing the

138
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:23,200
uh seeing um love meta in that

139
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:30,000
um so so let me say let me say this um

140
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,480
the teaching of course as you know is not that there is no self there is a self for conventional reasons it's very

141
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,920
helpful yes there is and and yet from the particular way of

142
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:48,319
seeing from a particular perspective we can see how it's all constructed it's it is

143
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:53,440
constructed and in that construction in that

144
00:41:53,440 --> 00:42:00,960
it doesn't mean that things become meaningless or that there is lack of love and care

145
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:06,000
or beauty in fact with what you bring in with music in fact you can see the

146
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:12,000
beauty you can see the grace there is this this this beauty that moves through

147
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:19,839
there is there's the uh there is this impersonal love and beauty and grace

148
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:25,680
that's not yours it's above and beyond you

149
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,838
and and yet it is you and you are a part of it

150
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:38,960
so this this this love beauty grace music just all of this

151
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,838
this can infuse the the impersonality

152
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,640
it's not just you see does that make sense yeah it does

153
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:56,000
[Music] and instead of it becoming dry actually

154
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,760
it becomes more graceful wow this beauty this um because as a musician you know

155
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:07,760
this it's amazing right when as a jazz musician

156
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:13,359
when it clicks it's like it's this is bigger than me it's not me there's some

157
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:20,400
this is wow you know when you get uh you know when you just get goosebumps

158
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:26,000
like this is bigger than this is not this is me and not me yes i am creating

159
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:34,560
this music and yet this is bigger than me so it's that is where the sense of meta love grace that

160
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:41,200
that's where it can come in play with that invite it thank you thank you very much thank you

161
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:48,960
so much for this question this was great really appreciate it yeah beautiful

162
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:58,880
maybe we have time for one more reflection before we turn into

163
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,000
practicing with small groups

164
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:13,680
okay so how about we turn

165
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:22,400
to small groups of roughly size three and start with maybe 15 seconds of

166
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,839
silence um and our theme has been peace and silence

167
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:34,960
and see how you can care for yourself care for others in the space of silence

168
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,400
meta care and then share as much or as little as you like

169
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:45,839
take care of yourselves take care of each other

170
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:51,359
this is a sacred space it's both you and not about you

171
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:57,599
i really appreciate gabriel bringing that in see how you can make beautiful music

172
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:03,040
of meta with with people in your small group

173
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:09,119
the rooms are created and here we go i'm going to open them up

174
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:15,119
open them now okay welcome back everyone the rooms are

175
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:20,319
closed everybody's back and we have a couple minutes for any

176
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:26,319
reflections questions comments what you noticed

177
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:31,680
anything it's part of your gift to the sangha from your

178
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:39,280
practice i see bill's hands fred and abraham okay

179
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:45,359
all right bill hey um

180
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:50,640
i just i i find the silence i mean the the the peace

181
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:59,520
appealing but of course my mind wants to go off and find entertainment somewhere else you know and it's it's always bad

182
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:06,160
so anyway it's always it's always that you said or it's always bad i didn't always that you know it's always that

183
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:11,359
yeah yeah and you know what it's um

184
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:18,000
i'm glad you're noticing this bill and this what you're reporting is not unusual at all

185
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:24,640
um it's a matter of seeing the delight and the joy of peace because we're not

186
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:31,680
used to that we are so not used to that um and there is so i'll give you a little

187
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:36,880
example you know when i was younger um i loved um you know ice cream that

188
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:43,359
had all kinds of stuff in it rocky road and marshmallows and nuts and chocolate and i couldn't understand why people

189
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:50,640
liked vanilla it seemed so plain and yet when i've gotten older it's like wow vanilla is so

190
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:56,400
sophisticated it's so subtle it's sublime right

191
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:01,680
but i needed to train my taste buds to appreciate the

192
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:07,680
subtle so of course and think of your mind that way yeah the mind kind of likes the

193
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:14,800
and it but it's a matter of training your mind to appreciate the the subtleness

194
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:20,400
thank you thank you and and and that's completely normal completely normal part of this

195
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:25,838
path thanks bill fred please

196
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,119
uh thank you nikki i was just starting to say this in our group um

197
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:42,880
how appreciative i am for this practice uh as as today i was sitting

198
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:48,079
in the att office after several hours of trying to

199
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:54,880
unravel a bureaucratic snafu and i as i was sitting there in silence in

200
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:01,040
fact i could picture myself at another time

201
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:07,440
enraged cynical uh impatient and i was a little of all

202
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:14,800
those things but i wasn't flaring to make it worse

203
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:21,839
and everybody around me was being as helpful as they could be and it was a drag for them too

204
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:27,520
and we all by behaving better together

205
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:36,000
got a resolution um with minimal you know with no damage really and i

206
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,599
and i thank you and sanka and this practice um for being helpful

207

213
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,920
if all we needed was maybe some little quiet time and

214
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:29,359
maybe sometimes we just need rest uh i really appreciated that that he hit

215
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:36,079
a chord but it was so nice to be in a room with a bunch of guys who had spent the day sending love out into

216
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:41,839
the world and it was it was nice and the same thing in all these other rooms
