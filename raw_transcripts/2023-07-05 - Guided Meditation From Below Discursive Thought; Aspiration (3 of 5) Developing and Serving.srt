1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:07,980
hello everyone and welcome back happy to be here

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,240
and um

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:20,760
one of the profound opportunities or possibilities with military meditation

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,519
is to be aware as we sit in meditation be aware of

5
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:33,300
ourselves be aware of sounds the situation we're in from some place within

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,199
that is not filtered by our discursive thinking

7
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:47,219
and to be aware from there but also to be aware of their

8
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:56,399
to be aware of what's going on deeper than discursive thinking in US discursive thinking can often color our

9
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,640
perceptions our experience of the world uh this whatever kind of story idea

10
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,880
judgments commentary we're making sometimes can be

11
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:15,479
undermining us if it's uh depressing story we're telling then the

12
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:21,360
telling of the story repeatedly conditions more depression if it's anger

13
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,780
it conditions more anger if it's some attitude that uh I'm incapable or

14
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:33,240
unworthy it kind of conditions us to kind of feel that and be that more

15
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:40,640
it's almost like discursive thinking is fuel for

16
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,439
to support any kind of negative thinking that we

17
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:53,579
might have about ourselves or the world and it might be a sum of thinking is accurate enough but for it to be the

18
00:01:53,579 --> 00:02:00,659
condition that the conditioning that shapes us can be often quite unfortunate

19
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:07,680
so if we can somehow listen to us listen deeper listen from a place that's not or

20
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,680
perceive or to know or to feel ourselves a meditation to feel to be

21
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,200
embodied in our breathing to be embodied in our experience of our emotions to be

22
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:26,099
embodied in our moods or what's happening to sense and feel almost from the heart

23
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:31,560
or from the Torso or the belly then through the medium of wherever we're

24
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:38,879
thinking stories and ideas and if we can do that then

25
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,280
um we're not going to be so conditioned by the thinking

26
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:51,200
and discursive thinking and they'll still be thinking but to that think thinking which is not a story

27
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,480
tends to be wiser it tends to also not have the same

28
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:04,620
kind of impact that an ongoing story or commentary might have

29
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,200
also it's very respectful I think the deepest way to respect

30
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:17,280
what's happening within us is to not see it understand it through the lens of an

31
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,800
ongoing commentary ongoing judgments ongoing stories and predictions and

32
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,159
Fantasies but to really to be present for what's deeper inside with

33
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:35,400
a quiet mind with a quiet heart and then mindfulness has kind of a Midas

34
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:43,019
Touch everything turns to Gold Everything has a chance to transform into something good it's remarkable even

35
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:48,720
if something is you know deep down feels kind of negative it's remarkable when

36
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,760
that's a tend to two respectfully from the quiet place within below that

37
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,920
discursive level something different begins to shift and

38
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:06,659
change and open up it's kind of like if we're in some kind of level of distress

39
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:13,439
and a friend sits down to us and just listens to us doesn't fix us doesn't even try to help us just listens and

40
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:19,260
it's present it tends to kind of shift what's going on within our relationship to it

41
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:27,300
so to offer that to ourselves so to assume a meditation posture

42
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:33,180
and this idea of taking an upright posture either actually or

43
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:41,280
metaphorically I like to think of it as a posture of that we begin the uh

44
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,620
the attitude of respect for ourselves

45
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:53,040
for all that we are and so an attitude that demonstrates

46
00:04:53,040 --> 00:05:01,759
that or allows for that and then to gently close the eyes

47
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,880
and take a few moments to be as quiet as you can

48
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,280
Don't Force It and just listen feel sense

49
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:21,740
yourself in a full way in a deep way

50
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:30,060
As You Are Here and Now as if you have permission to be this way

51
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,580
and you're just going to be present for it

52
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:46,020
almost like a discovery or or a reacquaintance

53
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:58,560
or like you're your own friend sitting with yourself just here to listen to be present for

54
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:06,180
her and if you are quietly present for yourself Here and Now

55
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:13,380
without spinning off into the discursive thought or without living in it it might still go on

56
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:19,699
but to live in a deeper place the quiet place that can listen and be present

57
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:32,039
and then gently not too much take if a bit deeper

58
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:39,020
inhales and a little longer exhales

59
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:46,319
almost as if you're massaging or opening settling

60
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,060
this deeper place within

61
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:17,180
relaxing your face and shoulders and belly

62
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,639
relaxing the thinking mind

63
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:48,979
and if there is a lot of discursive thinking it's okay

64
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:56,699
see if you can listen or be present from a quiet place a deeper place within

65
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:02,940
so you become your own friend sitting at a bench listening feeling sensing allowing something

66
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:10,460
deeper to show itself underneath the discursive thinking

67
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,800
and they're settling into your breathing normal breathing pattern

68
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:48,300
and if you can offer this deeper quiet attention to breathing

69
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,920
just that is profound

70
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,620
and as different things occur Within

71
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,959
let it be known from whatever place that's available for you

72
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:20,279
that's underneath or deeper than discursive thinking there might be simple thoughts involved

73
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:26,279
in knowing it but those thoughts will probably be more peaceful

74
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:32,519
or simple than or maybe even wiser than what's available through discursive

75
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,000
thinking

76
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:51,320
and rather than fixing anything or making anything go away

77
00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:02,000
let it be known respectfully by this quiet presence

78
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:09,839
through this quiet presence let it be known by a simple mindfulness

79
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,620
awareness

80
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:26,120
that is an act of respect everything is respected

81
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,880
in a sense nothing to fix because

82
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,339
we don't see anything as being broken

83
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:47,459
it's just something to hold in our awareness breathing with it

84
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:56,959
letting the breathing the rhythm of breathing support awareness from the quiet place within

85
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:07,799
relaxing as you exhale and in the relaxing

86
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:16,559
can you settle into quietest place within

87
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:25,820
where you can be present for yourself where you can know or sense or feel

88
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:36,780
that's underneath or deeper than story making mind

89
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:43,160
the commentary mind foreign

90
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:13,039
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

91
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:21,600
to consider what it's like to offer a presence to others

92
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:29,340
that's from a quieter place without our need without projection or judgment or

93
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:34,559
commentary but to be present quietly for the

94
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:40,820
humanity of others as they are with respect and care

95
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:49,799
and then consider the ways in which good will might flow from this quiet place

96
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:54,899
a simple Goodwill well-wishing

97
00:27:55,260 --> 00:28:00,380
care for the happiness and well-being of others

98
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:09,559
into wish as we bring this to meditation to an end

99
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:18,500
to for the well-being of everyone so that we begin

100
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:26,340
reminding ourselves or can begin familiarizing ourselves

101
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,440
with how this meditation practice

102
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:40,140
is something we do not just for ourselves but for the world around us

103
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:46,020
to prepare us to come into the world with friendliness and good will

104
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:51,320
so we contribute we can contribute to the possibility

105
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,700
that all beings may be happy

106
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:03,539
all beings may be safe all beings

107
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:11,419
may be peaceful and all beings may be free

108
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,140
may it be so

109
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:35,059
[Music] thank you

110
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,440
thank you

111
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:47,820
so continuing on this theme of aspiration one of the really beautiful parts of

112
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:53,100
compassion is this desire for the alleviation of suffering for suffering

113
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:58,260
to come to an end and we're so fortunate we live in a world where people do have this

114
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:05,399
aspiration have this wish and um and because it's such a beautiful and

115
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:11,100
important desire or wish it's important to consider the different facets of it

116
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:17,460
or how to how to do it well and if we do it kind of just on it you

117
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:24,299
know kind of automatic pilot but you know what we think it's supposed to be like we might do it simplistically or

118
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:29,779
ways it actually might not even be helpful I'm involved with training people to do

119
00:31:29,779 --> 00:31:34,919
chaplaincy Buddhist chaplaincy and there were chaplaincy is kind of uh

120
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:41,159
in the public sphere one of the few maybe professions where it's much more

121
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:46,500
explicit almost like a job description is to bring Compassionate Care

122
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:54,360
to patients in hospitals to be inmates in prison to all kinds of

123
00:31:54,360 --> 00:32:00,600
different situations to hospice excuse me schools colleges many places

124
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:09,059
where they have chaplains and one of the kind of core ideas of chaplaincy world

125
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:14,700
is um that the Compassionate Care should be

126
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:19,860
done in the service of others as opposed to fixing them or helping

127
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:27,659
them there was a famous article by Rachel uh Raymond

128
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:36,779
who wrote about this distinction between fixing and helping and serving

129
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:42,659
and not not representing her so accurately but speaking for myself that

130
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:48,059
fixing uh implies that someone is broken

131
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:55,620
and if we're going to go fix them then we're fixing their Brokenness and it doesn't really feel good to be

132
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:01,620
approached as if you're a broken person and um and it kind of well the

133
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:07,880
compassion might be there it comes along with a message that that can reinforce

134
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:13,380
all kinds of societal ideas and personal ideas that there's something wrong with

135
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:18,480
us the other idea is to help that seems

136
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,700
like it's innocent enough this idea of help and helping and it's it's often a beautiful thing to do

137
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:30,480
but it provided that we're not seeing other people as being helpless

138
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,480
and if we see other people that helps helpless we're also kind of conditioning people or viewing people in a very

139
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:43,080
limited way and so if we go in there to alleviate suffering for people

140
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:50,659
and we're trying to get rid of the suffering as fast as we can we might actually be limiting people dramatically

141
00:33:50,659 --> 00:33:57,539
serving is the third option and the idea of serving is that there's deep respect

142
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:03,240
for others and for their agency and for their capacity and for their potential

143
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:11,060
and that we're there to support that to grow so yesterday I talked about going deeper

144
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:19,858
below this uh to the causes of suffering and today I want to emphasize that we

145
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:25,919
also want to go deeper and look at people's potential how they can develop and how they can

146
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:33,358
grow and um and it's more than just removing the the causes of suffering it's really

147
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:41,460
growing up and developing ourselves in such a way that we have the strength the Inner Strength the inner capacity to uh

148
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:47,280
people everyone had helping to develop the inner capacity to be with the

149
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:53,700
difficulties of life and the adversities of life that challenges of life is often where people

150
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:58,920
grow where people develop and get stronger and wiser and and working

151
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:04,080
through some of the complexes complex kind of attachments and and conditioning

152
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:10,260
we have that gets in the way and so to Simply go there and alleviate suffering too quickly

153
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:16,680
kind of can deny people the opportunity to grow into it and develop themselves

154
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:23,760
and so to see people as being not broken but see them as capable see them as as

155
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:30,599
whole beings moving towards wholeness see not as helpless but see that yes

156
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:38,040
they have the potential the capacity to help themselves and so then we serve those capacities we

157
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:44,820
serve their ability we serve their wholeness their movement towards wholeness and so we're available we're

158
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:50,339
there we're not the Savior we're not coming in there in our you know with you

159
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:57,359
know as uh you know you know Savior and shining armor to be the one who helps them

160
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:02,579
and uh it's a delicate thing because people some people sometimes want to be

161
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:09,839
saved they're looking for others to take responsibility they're looking for others to do it for them and and we come

162
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:16,740
along and offer them help and we even fix them in some ways temporarily perhaps and they're so grateful and so

163
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:24,960
rewarding as a compassionate caregiver to feel the Gratitude and the wonderfulness of people that we've saved

164
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,180
and we feel like we've done the right thing but uh Maybe not maybe we've done a fine

165
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:35,520
thing maybe it's maybe it doesn't cause harm but maybe it's uh shortchanged

166
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:42,480
people and what really what needs to happen is people need to grow up they need to grow or even if there are grown

167
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:50,000
up there's all this continued capacity for emotional growth spiritual growth

168
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,400
relational growth that people are capable of and and so if there is

169
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:02,579
emotional psychological challenges that um maybe there's we should be a little

170
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:08,300
bit tender and careful not to interfere with people's ability

171
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:14,339
to struggle and people's ability to find their way with what's difficult

172
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:21,240
and as serving them where they're with them we're accompanying people we're available we say I'm here for you let me

173
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:28,140
know what I can do what can I how I can support you or I'm here with you and I

174
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:33,720
see that yours your challenge you're struggling and I want to support you in

175
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:40,320
that struggle to find a way through it um and then you know we kind of are there

176
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:46,859
as a companion as a support as a sounding board as a maybe we offer ideas

177
00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:53,280
maybe we offer questions that helps people understand but it's important not to take away

178
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,619
people's agency to take away people's ability to to move to wholeness because

179
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:04,619
that movement towards wholeness that movement to health is a a health health

180
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:12,599
and wholeness in and of itself so um to allow people to develop

181
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:18,599
so people who suffer where do they need to develop what needs to grow and be

182
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:24,180
cultivated and so for example I mean I'm because

183
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:30,119
we're I'm in the meditation tradition someone who's suffering a lot maybe you

184
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:36,000
support them to go to a Meditation Retreat and then they're really sitting really

185
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,780
present for themselves and for what's going on and it's remarkable the deeper connection the deeper process of working

186
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:48,839
through things and growing and developing in capacity that can happen on a Meditation Retreat

187
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:54,300
so being coming to help people you know you're helping them to help themselves

188
00:38:54,300 --> 00:39:02,700
and you offer them the possibility of do a retreat there's many other things they could do but the idea is to support people to do

189
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:11,579
it and find a way themselves and um so development and service

190
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:17,839
and to be careful with the fixing mode and the helping mode so these are two aspects of aspiration

191
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:22,859
to look and see how to support the people's development

192
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:28,380
and to look and discover how within ourselves we can be of service

193
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:35,460
and one of the supports for this for ourselves to be able to have Compassionate Care this way

194
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:42,300
is to learn how to be present for ourselves and for others from someplace

195
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:48,540
deeper than the realm of our discursive thinking discursive thinking even when it wants

196
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:53,880
to help people can come along with so much bias and Prejudice and simplistic

197
00:39:53,880 --> 00:40:00,720
ideas and stories and memories and associations it's remarkable that discursive thinking

198
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:06,900
is not so innocent it's sometimes heavily conditioned by so much

199
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:14,180
background luggage that we carry along with us and so to be able to

200
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:21,300
feel or know or connect to a thinking that's deeper than discursive thinking

201
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:28,140
um is one of the great skills that can come from meditation practice where we learn to quiet the discursive mind

202
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:35,160
so that we can listen and feel and know and be wise from some place that's below

203
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:42,180
that level and as I said in the meditation part of the problem with discursive

204
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:48,240
thinking discursive constructions of stories and ideas and commentary is that

205
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:55,500
if any of that is negative in nature at the stories we say about others stories we say about ourselves the

206
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:01,440
ongoing nature of discursive thinking means that that's being reinforced and it's like creating an atmosphere and a

207
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,480
mood and once we start creating atmospheres and moods within us it feels

208
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:13,079
like it is us it gives it a kind of sense of Truth or this is how it really is there's kind of an authority sometimes

209
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:18,900
in the moods and attitudes and emotional states that we end up in

210
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:25,740
but when those are reinforced by discursive thinking it's probably best not to give them a

211
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:31,800
lot of credence so to um so to have the ability to drop deeper

212
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:38,099
and as I said in the meditation as well one of the ways of using our capacity to

213
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:46,140
to know and feel and sense from a quiet or deeper place is that we can turn that to our

214
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:52,619
discursive mind itself kind of like we're being with a friend who is troubled

215
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:59,160
and we're not fixing them we're not saving them we're not helping them except what we're doing we're being

216
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:04,800
present and listening and accompanying them showing them they're not alone

217
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,079
listening to them deeply maybe asking simple questions to help kind of bring

218
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:15,660
forth what's really happening and uh and so the same way we can do

219
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:21,960
with ourselves that deeper presence the deeper awareness towards our discursive mind

220
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:27,000
and all its constructs and ideas that's spinning in there's always going to be

221
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:33,300
something deeper underneath it that's oh that's always a surface expression of something that's really more important

222
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:40,880
than needs to be heard and felt and known and so as we learn this aspiration for

223
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:48,599
aspirational aspects of compassion we're learning also how to connect and be with

224
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:55,260
ourselves and with others from this deeper capacity we have that we are developing

225
00:42:55,260 --> 00:43:00,780
the capacity to be present from a place of wisdom of Love of care

226
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:09,240
that is not skewed by some of the spinning discursive

227
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:17,180
thoughts that are so easy to live in our minds so um

228
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:26,520
so thank you and um and I hope that these words are useful

229
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:32,339
for you and if they're not then please feel free to discard them and then we'll

230
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:37,760
continue with this word aspiration tomorrow thank you
