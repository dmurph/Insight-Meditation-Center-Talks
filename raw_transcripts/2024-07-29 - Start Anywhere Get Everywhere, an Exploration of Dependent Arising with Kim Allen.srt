1
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:08,760
so welcome to everyone here everyone who's here is very welcome to come to

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:16,198
IMC whether it is your very first time walking in here or if you've been here for decades and welcome also to the

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:23,279
folks who are online we're joined by many people around the world

4
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:31,680
perhaps so when the Buddha was setting out on his quest for Spiritual

5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:38,680
Awakening the story says that he was concerned with the large existential

6
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:44,879
questions of Being Human so we find ourselves in this life right and that

7
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:52,879
just goes toward aging illness and death which are suffering so how like what

8
00:00:52,879 --> 00:01:00,039
does that mean how can we overcome that suffering so that our life is not

9
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,799
inseparably bound up with some kind of stress and struggle and difficulty that

10
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,880
was the Buddha's kind of initial question why does it have to be like

11
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:18,479
this and then after he did awaken it said that he sat in meditation under the

12
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:25,159
bod tree for an additional seven days and he contemplated what is called

13
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:30,640
dependent arising so dependent arising is a a

14
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:37,320
series or a set of interrelated conditions that culminate in the

15
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,439
experience of Aging illness and death or the mass of suffering in general so what

16
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,640
he was doing though is that he was reflecting under the Bodie tree that he

17
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,840
had actually solved the issue he was reflecting back to his original question

18
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,399
how do we deal with this human life and the big questions that come with it

19
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,600
did I solve that problem and he realized yes he had solved that issue and he had

20
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,040
completed his quest so this meant that the Buddha

21
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:20,040
understood very deeply how suffering comes about and how it can not come

22
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:27,239
about by seeing that certain things are dependent on each other so things depend

23
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,800
on each other they're related to each other he saw how experiences happen

24
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,519
based on supportive conditions and also how they fall apart when the supportive

25
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:44,440
conditions are no longer there it sounds straightforward enough when said like

26
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:52,720
that but how do you solve that problem for the specific case of suffering of Dua could we figure out what is

27
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,080
sustaining it and then not do that that was what the Buddha found and it's not

28
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:06,480
something that the Buddha have made up or brought into being he said very clearly in one of his Dharma talks later

29
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,159
whether or not anyone awakens to this conditioned nature of experience

30
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:19,120
nevertheless this law operates so it's fundamental he

31
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:25,200
discovered something fundamental about how things work and then later the Buddha was

32
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,959
quoted by one of his disciples as saying one who sees dependent AR arising sees

33
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:37,159
the dhma and one who sees the dhma sees dependent arising so it's quite a vision

34
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:42,439
you know that he had sitting under the VOD tree and I'd like to talk about this

35
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:49,319
Vision today in a way that is tangible and practical for us because it's

36
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:55,560
actually something with which we all have experience it really

37
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:03,840
is so I want to start by emphasizing this phrase uh that I used dependent on

38
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,560
because it's easy to want to think in terms of causes our minds are kind of attuned to that in in the west it's

39
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,320
simpler for our brain a causes B but we're actually talking about necessary

40
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,960
conditions that support something being there or not so if you think about something like

41
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,479
rain rain happens but it depends on certain necessary conditions being in

42
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:36,080
place in order for it to happen there have to be clouds with a certain amount of moisture in them the atmospheric

43
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:43,000
pressure has to be right the temperature has to be right various other things when all those conditions are there it

44
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,800
will rain and when something shifts enough that we go out of some range

45
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,680
right then the rain has to stop for example I don't think we're

46
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,720
going to have rain today because there aren't any clouds it's just not in the

47
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,800
conditions they could form later I'm not saying that couldn't happen but at this exact instant we don't have the

48
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,080
conditions so we don't have the rain sometimes the Buddha also used the

49
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:20,120
analogy of an oil lamp so an oil lamp Burns Independence on oil a Wick air

50
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:27,680
also and um but with the oil runs out or the wick runs out I guess if the air

51
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:34,440
runs out um then the flame would go out right so these are physical examples

52
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,600
that makes them I think pretty easy to relate to but in fact we could relate

53
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,560
this same idea to the realm of the mind you know suppose you're having an

54
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:52,039
emotion did that come about randomly no there are necessary

55
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:59,400
conditions for the appearance of a given mind State whether it's an emotion or a thought or anything else and there are

56
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,560
also oo conditions for maintaining that and conditions when they change it will

57
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,840
fall away when the necessary conditions are no longer

58
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:16,160
there so this General principle of things coming about dependent on

59
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:23,280
conditions is named by the poly word AA payata and you don't have to remember

60
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,800
that but I wanted to say it because this word um Paya which you can hear in there

61
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:36,160
it means dependent on so we could kind of summarize this law a little bit

62
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:43,319
casually as this arises dependent on that and if this doesn't happen then it

63
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,440
doesn't then that doesn't arise that's a little bit casual um

64
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:55,879
there are actually kind of two different kinds of dependency weaving together one is more present moment and one is more

65
00:06:55,879 --> 00:07:01,919
overtime but um I think I'll wait and not go into that in much detail right

66
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:08,120
now um but the Buddha so that's the very general principle which I think I think

67
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:14,639
we can understand in a broad way but remember I said the Buddha was particularly concerned about Dua that's

68
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:21,840
the word that we translate as suffering or stress or struggle or unsatisfactoriness so Dua the difficulty

69
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,919
that we have in life so he wasn't that interested in clouds actually and rain

70
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:36,199
and such um but he was more interested in the Practical question what are the necessary conditions for Dua when what

71
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:42,199
is present will there be Dua and when what is eliminated will duka

72
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:47,720
cease and then more practically can we discover how suffering or stress comes

73
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:54,960
about and how it can be released that is a spiritually fruitful

74
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:01,479
question so the Buddha framed the answer to this question in a number of

75
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:07,080
different ways in the teachings um we're just going to talk about the most common

76
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:14,840
one today which is he talked about a series of 12 uh links and I put the word

77
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:21,919
links in air quotes because it's not quite literally a linear sequence 1 2 3

78
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:28,919
4 up to 12 um it is 12 sequential conditions but uh they have kind of

79
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:34,760
feedback Loops within them um that add a little bit comple of complexity and they

80
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:40,640
also operate on a different various different time scales that can overlap so it ends up being a little bit more

81
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:48,920
complex than just 1 through 12 um but basically there are 12 lengths of dependent arising and in this specific

82
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:56,519
form where we're just where we're talking about how Dua comes about then it's called in pi by the term Patia

83
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:01,680
samua which means AR Rising together Independence

84
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,040
on okay again that's another pow you don't have to remember but I like to say

85
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,959
them because they're meaningful so I'm going to we're going

86
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:18,920
to go through these 12 just so that um you know them but uh the talk doesn't

87
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:26,240
focus on dissecting all 12 of them in detail but let's at least go through them I'm going to name them in what is

88
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:33,320
classically called the reverse order so that we can start with Duke um which is also called in this sequence

89
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,760
aging and death and the whole mass of

90
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,839
suffering so um so remember the Buddhist question was how does aging and death

91
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:54,720
and the whole mass of suffering how does that come about you know that was what he wanted to know so he he really

92
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:01,040
contemplated this and he and he looked in his own experience and he saw that aging and death and the whole mass of

93
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:08,640
suffering arise dependent upon birth if there isn't birth there

94
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:14,600
wouldn't be death would there I mean that's clear enough um so birth to say

95
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,920
use the language we're using here birth is the necessary condition for aging and

96
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,560
death and birth arises dependent upon

97
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:31,880
becoming becoming is kind of the the movement toward creation uh that that

98
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:39,320
feeling we have where we want to bring something into being you know we're moving toward that in when there's an

99
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,519
image given for this step I think becoming is a a pregnant woman so we get

100
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:50,560
the idea um and so that but is becoming the very Source no it isn't becoming

101
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:57,680
arises dependent upon clinging so that means that we've grasped onto uh the

102
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,959
idea of what we want to create we have a a vision in mind in some way

103
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:09,920
or we're just grasping clinging and clinging arises dependent on craving we

104
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:16,440
want something craving by the way also includes not wanting something that has

105
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:22,880
the same effect it's a a movement either toward or away attraction or repulsion but it's just called craving because we

106
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:30,120
need to have one word but is craving the total source no craving arises depending

107
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,399
upon what's called V or feeling tone um

108
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:41,320
feeling tone being Pleasant or unpleasant or neutral neither Pleasant

109
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:48,320
nor unpleasant those are the three feeling tones so because experience has this veilance to it where we like it or

110
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:56,639
we don't like it that's why we want things or not want things right because they're Pleasant or unpleasant to

111
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:05,399
us feeling arises depending on sense contact so you know something comes in

112
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:10,920
that's why we have a certain feeling it's because we've had an experience we've seen something we've heard

113
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:16,639
something we've touched something that's what's Pleasant or unpleasant sense contact arises

114
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,959
dependent on the six senses of course we have to have sense organs if we didn't have them we wouldn't have experience

115
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:29,600
and in this teaching we say that there are six so there's the five usual ones associated with the body and then mind

116
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:36,519
is the six so ideas can also be pleasant or unpleasant the six senses arise

117
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:42,959
dependent on what's called name and form more Loosely we could say mind and body

118
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:50,240
we have a mind and a body and that arises dependent on Consciousness so the fact that we feel our body and our mind

119
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,320
is because we have awareness we can detect things we can know that something

120
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:03,160
is happening and that arises consciousness arises dependent on a very difficult to

121
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:10,399
translate word called Sanara which is usually translated as say let's say volitional formations or mental

122
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:17,000
formations so there's some movement toward wanting to know wanting to have

123
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,360
experience and all and those S Sanara arise we've made it to number 12 by the

124
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:28,800
way Sara arise dependent on something called ignorance not knowing something that we

125
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:34,440
don't know so we won't go through all of these in detail um remember that this is

126
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,959
the Buddha's Grand Vision of how suffering operates in the mind so it's

127
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:46,720
meant to be deep but nonetheless uh we can get the essence of it we can get the

128
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,360
essence of it so I I just want to highlight a few key

129
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:59,600
links note notice first of all the foundational link which I read last but it's technically called the first link

130
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:07,079
which is ignorance so suffering depends eventually on some kind of not knowing

131
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:12,880
or not understanding something so that's interesting you know that's already

132
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,240
interesting it's not a cognitive knowing it's something you have to discover through practice but there's something

133
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:26,079
we don't know um and then there's also a key sequence in the middle uh of the ones

134
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:33,759
that I read so uh dependent upon having sense organs we're impacted by contacts

135
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:39,519
which we feel as pleasant or unpleasant and then we react to that feeling by

136
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:46,199
wanting or not wanting the experience so contact feeling craving that's a hugely

137
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:51,720
important little section of dependent arising so in general let's remember

138
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:59,560
contact feeling tone craving all supported by ignorance and then after craving

139
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:06,160
um just to name one other part we go on to create an identity around that wanting and not wanting that's the

140
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:14,800
clinging becoming and birth part so I just want to say that birth doesn't have to mean literal birth um it can also be

141
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:21,880
the creation of a sense of self just so you're clear on what those steps refer

142
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:27,040
to so we have a background

143
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,839
misunderstanding experiences coming in and contacting us they're Pleasant or

144
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:40,720
unpleasant and so we react by grasping or pushing away is this generally plausible for how

145
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,279
things go in our life anybody agree with that I see a few nods yeah you don't

146
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:51,600
have to meditate for very long to notice that that's kind of what's going on

147
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,519
so so the Buddha gave this teaching on dependent arising also called dependent

148
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:05,079
origination you'll also see that that one it's refers to the same thing so that we can see how suffering or stress

149
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:10,720
or struggle come about because we're clinging or identifying with or simply

150
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,639
misunderstanding something you know the idea The Hope here is that by

151
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:24,279
understanding the conditions for suffering we gain some ability not to do that not to if we don't fulfill the

152
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:31,040
necessary conditions then we wouldn't have the suffering so if we could see see these conditions like the oil and

153
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,480
the wick that support the fire of suffering in the mind we could direct

154
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:44,000
our practice toward eliminating those conditions no oil no

155
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,720
Dua no Wick no dooka no match lighting the wick no

156
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:56,720
dooka that would be valuable to know right so this is pretty empowering

157
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,839
actually this teaching it's pretty

158
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:15,400
empowering so sometimes people ask what time frame is this operating on that's a

159
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:22,360
good question it's actually happening on many different time frames so there's a

160
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:29,080
classical teaching in the Buddhist text that tries to extend this over three lifetimes

161
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:35,280
we're not going to go that far today we don't need to go that far actually because I think it clearly also happens

162
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:41,039
over normal time scales in a human life right when I just asked you that question about do you see this happening

163
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:49,120
yeah people were nodding you know it happens over uh periods of minutes or hours or days or years we can see these

164
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:55,880
conditions coming into being interestingly it can also happen quite quickly you know we can see it

165
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,760
functioning in meditation we can sometimes see it function in when our mindfulness is very sharp we can see it

166
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:11,000
functioning rapidly in just a few mind moments we go through a whole cycle it's like oh wow and you see the mind um very

167
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,880
quickly uh going from misunderstanding something to grabbing it to suffering for

168
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,039
it so we have the case where a bunch of

169
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:29,120
these 12 link Cycles are happening on various time scales and there's also feedback Loops

170
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,760
within the cycle you might have noticed as I got closer to the beginning of it it didn't sound like it might have

171
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:40,240
sounded like some of them were a little bit similar or overlapping and there are actually feedback loops within it we

172
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,360
won't go into those in great detail but if you imagine you have a bunch of these Cycles operating over different time

173
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:51,760
frames and there's feedback loops within it how would that end up looking in our

174
00:18:51,760 --> 00:19:00,679
mind I have a suggestion I brought with me a little demonstration something like this

175
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:05,720
so this is a a tangled ske of um twine

176
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:12,120
in this case that was uh it's been sitting in my drawer and I kind of pull off little pieces of it sometimes but

177
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:20,440
then I just throw it back in So inattention leads to Tangles this is also a Le a Dharma lesson for today so

178
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:28,400
what I'm trying to show is that our mind is a little bit more complicated than oil lamp I'm sorry to say um so the

179
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,360
Buddhist suggests that this tangle is a pretty good representation of the mental

180
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:40,159
and emotional patterns that bring stress and suffering into our life and when we

181
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:47,919
start meditating we can start to sense that yes this does resemble the structure of the ordinary unawakened

182
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:53,000
mind I mean there's no perfect metaphor but this one's pretty good how many

183
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:01,000
people have some sense of there being a tangle in your mind yeah okay great so you're in good company actually

184
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,720
somebody back in the time of the Buddha once asked him um they asked him sort of

185
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:15,159
a a a riddle and they said a tangle within a tangle without this generation

186
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:21,720
is entangled in a tangle I ask you this oh Goa that's the Buddha who can

187
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:27,320
disentangle this tangle so it's a little riddle about

188
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,799
solving this problem I'll give you the Buddha's answer to that riddle later um

189
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:38,320
but for now here we are we have this tangle in

190
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:44,360
our heart or our mind and it even affects our body um there are two pieces of good

191
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:50,600
news one is that this can be untangled we can actually get through this that's

192
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:56,679
the whole premise of the Buddhist teaching and the teaching on the 12 lengths of depend and arising helps

193
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:03,960
tremendously because we can start to get get a handle on what the components of this tangle

194
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,360
are and then the second piece of good news um which you might have to take a

195
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:16,520
little bit on faith at this moment but is that we don't have to have the complete Vision that the Buddha had

196
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:23,760
fully comprehending how every little strand of the tangle Works maybe you need that to be a Buddha but it turns

197
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:30,000
out to be sufficient for us to just understand one part of the tangle in a

198
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:38,039
in a deep way so uh once we understand say one link of that chain of 12 we have

199
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:44,640
significantly loosened it and sometimes we can even kind of collapse the whole structure because it's all dependent all

200
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:51,880
these things are dependent on each other right and if we could see through just one section really clearly and remove

201
00:21:51,880 --> 00:22:00,400
that necessary condition the the whole structure loses the ability to hold together so this is is also really good

202
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:07,760
news so I want to I like to sum this up this whole thing we've built up so far as

203
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:13,200
start anywhere get everywhere so you can start anywhere on

204
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,799
the set of 12 and if and you're working toward the unbinding of the whole

205
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:26,440
structure so I want let's get practical so I want to I want to give a scenario that helps us see how this works in an

206
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:33,200
everyday situation and I'll say it first and then we'll go through it again um put pointing out some of the steps

207
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:40,000
because what we have is the tangle right and the question is how do I find the 12 links in here like how do I really see

208
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,600
what's going on so here's a scenario please uh you know grab me a little leeway on the on

209
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,799
trying to come down with just one one example but suppose you're going to a

210
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:59,279
meeting you're going to a meeting you're at work you're going to a meeting at your supervisor's office where you're

211
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:06,000
supposed to present the results of a project that you just did and you also have a chance to ask about getting more

212
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,240
resources for the next phase of the project okay so as you round the corner

213
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:19,559
in the hallway to your boss's office um you see a coworker just arriving at the

214
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:26,440
boss's office and the coworker is someone that you've often disagreed with and you didn't know that that person

215
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:32,720
would be at the meeting your heart sinks you didn't want this person to be

216
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:38,320
there and while you describe your results because some of your results are a little bit touchy they have some

217
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:45,720
touchy points that you trust your boss would understand but you don't trust this coworker to really understand uh

218
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:53,159
and do you know and also you wonder if you and he are going to be competing for the next resources to go forward with

219
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:59,360
the next phase right so um all kinds of scenarios start turning in your head as

220
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:06,120
you're approaching the office you're worrying that it will go badly and so you try to figure out whether you should

221
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:11,440
take a tough straightforward approach which uh might come across as kind of

222
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:18,080
aggressive or whether you should be more accommodating and Cooperative even though you don't really want to

223
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,320
cooperate so you feel stressed as you open the door and then when you do

224
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:29,520
actually go through the meeting you again feel pushed and pulled as the events unfold right you make some kind

225
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:36,360
of choice eventually about how to present yourself either beforehand as a resolve I'm going to do it this way or

226
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:41,679
on the fly in the moment you decide to be a certain way um and you go ahead and

227
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,760
do the meeting but then later no matter how it went you worry about whether the

228
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:52,640
way you presented yourself is going to be the best thing for the future you know did I you know did the way that I

229
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:59,000
came across in that meeting is that going to work out so we've created in our mind

230
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,039
one of these a tangle based on this very simple

231
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:09,080
scenario so let's go back through it and name some of the um qualities here so

232
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:16,440
you're going to this meeting with your boss you come around the corner and you see the coworker also entering so we

233
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:23,480
have ignorance present in your mind you're not very mindful at this moment so we have contact then we have your

234
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:29,000
heart sinks I said you have this deflated feeling feeling tone unpleasant

235
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,600
feeling tone is coming in you didn't want this person to be there because you

236
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:41,480
have these touchy results you want to explain to your boss without this competing person there there's craving

237
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:48,320
you want you wanted it to be a certain way and you don't want it to be the way that it's looks like it's going to

238
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,640
be um so then all these scenarios start going through your mind you're worrying

239
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:59,320
that it's going to go badly so you're clinging to the idea that it needs to go a certain way

240
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:05,880
then you try to figure out whether you should take you know how you should present yourself should I be tough and straightforward should I be

241
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:11,360
accommodating and Cooperative so we have becoming happening in the mind I'm

242
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:19,320
moving toward choosing an identity you feel stressed as you go into the office Dua has already happened and then when

243
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:25,120
you actually do go through the meeting you make some kind of choice that's actually Sankara the Second Step you

244
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:31,520
have a a mental volition toward being something and then you present yourself in a certain way you create an identity

245
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:37,640
you step into it through birth you enact it and then no matter what happens later

246
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:44,120
you worry about whether that was the right thing even if the meeting went well was that really going to is that going to serve you in the future so we

247
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:53,039
have death of that identity and the associated Duca of that there you go you just did them

248
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:58,840
right there in that 15 minutes of however long that meeting took so we

249
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:04,320
have some complexity um in in these scenarios and I'm sure you could think

250
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:10,360
of a similar scenario in your own life that has a lot of these links in it um probably interconnected the way they

251
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:18,279
were in that scenario so we have this complexity but we also have the Simplicity of knowing that if we could

252
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:23,559
just remove the necessary conditions for this structure it would have to collapse

253
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:29,039
if we could completely remove one of the necessary conditions it would no longer work

254
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:36,279
you know just like the necessary conditions there are a bunch of necessary conditions for these lights being on for example if I remove any one

255
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:43,519
of them the light will go off if I turn off the light switch it'll go off if I blow up the power plant it'll go off you

256
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:51,679
know there's multiple ways to turn off the light so maybe we can find a weak spot

257
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:59,760
in the 12 links something that we could see well enough to change the situation

258
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:06,240
so probably to fully end the mind's underlying tendency to get entangled is

259
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:13,399
going to take a lot of work but in any given scenario this like this one scenario with our boss I think we should

260
00:28:13,399 --> 00:28:20,480
be able to make that collapse pretty easily right so you get that there's multiple pictures going on here so when

261
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:26,600
we are just enacting out some stressful scenario without any awareness then we

262
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:33,919
are living in the foundational condition of ignorance which supports the Dua suffering actually depends on us not

263
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:39,519
knowing that we are enacting it but when we see this process operating that

264
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:45,880
changes things so we've inserted a little bit of knowledge and we've weakened ignorance so the very Act of

265
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:53,159
seeing dependent arising the very Act of understanding that there are these 12 conditioned things these 12 links is the

266
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:59,679
beginning of untangling the uh the ske let's say that we've created in our mind

267
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:05,200
but probably that top level knowing you know just knowing that there are these 12 links that's probably not deep enough

268
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,559
to collapse everything so we're going to do better if we practice with some of

269
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,640
those middle links the ones I mentioned before about contact feeling tone and

270
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:21,720
craving that little spot is one place where we can often be successful in

271
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:29,320
removing the necessary conditions such that the stress or the Dua does not come about

272
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:34,919
the Buddha in his teachings he actually gives lots and lots of practices in the

273
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:40,799
discourses that we have those are all those big books of the poly Canon right he gives practices that are related to

274
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:47,159
contact that are related to feeling tone related to craving actually for any of the 12 links there are sutas and

275
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:52,799
teachings and practices that help us work with that link I think it's not a

276
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:59,679
stretch to say that everyone of the um for any of the 12 12 links there are

277
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:05,559
practices associated with them and probably all of those practices are designed to be deep enough that they

278
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:12,760
would be able to cut the chain at that point if we did them completely if we really did that practice remember when

279
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:18,840
one sees the Dharma one sees Depend and AR rising and when one sees Depend and AR Rising one sees the

280
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:24,080
Dharma so but we're just going to focus on these few in the middle because

281
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:29,720
they're both easy to understand and very powerful

282
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:36,760
so one of the most basic instructions that you will hear here at IMC is to be

283
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:41,799
mindful of your experience in a non-reactive way has anybody heard that

284
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:48,720
instruction yeah so we're talking about contact at our sense doors sounds that

285
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:55,360
we hear Body Sensations that we feel if we feel a pain in our back that's an

286
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:01,399
unpleasant sensation right um unpleasant feeling tone and the the aim of the

287
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:08,440
practice is that we're supposed to be able to be with those Sensations and not get caught up in the aversion not move

288
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:15,919
on from feeling tone to craving from it hurts to I don't want it so not getting

289
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:21,639
angry not catastrophizing about needing back surgery not fantasizing about how

290
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:27,960
if I just bought a better cushion that would probably help you know these kinds of things so and then a little bit more

291
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:34,799
subtle is also to work with the six sense St you know if we have thoughts or emotions coming into the Mind contacts

292
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:39,880
that are happening at the Sixth Sense store maybe I should Point here

293
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:45,399
um how do we be with those in a non-reactive way can we be with fear

294
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:52,880
without getting into a long uh story about it can we be with the Judgment of

295
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,600
another person can we be with Envy things that arise internally also

296
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:04,639
so this is I'll read you a quote from the sutas about this practice there is the case where a

297
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:10,480
practitioner on seeing a pleasant sight with the eye does not long for it or

298
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,600
become excited by it or generate Lust For It their body is steady and their

299
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:22,440
mind is steady inwardly well composed and liberated and on seeing an unpleasant

300
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:28,840
form with the eye they are not dismayed by it not daunted not de rejected and

301
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:34,399
without ill will their body is steady and their mind is steady inwardly well

302
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:42,639
composed and liberated and it goes on to say the same thing for the ear nose tongue body and mind all the six senses

303
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:48,360
and the instruction says if you see something pleasant or you see something unpleasant at any of those six sense

304
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:54,639
doors we would aim to be well composed and liberated not rushing off into

305
00:32:54,639 --> 00:33:00,440
wanting it or not wanting it contact feel feeling tone let's let's not go

306
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:09,880
from feeling tone to craving that's what the instruction is saying right so we don't go from Pleasant and

307
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:16,320
unpleasant to grasping and pushing away so the shape of the tangle is affected

308
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:22,360
by our mindful presence if it doesn't have all the

309
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:29,919
pieces it needs to hang together then it can can't it can't uh

310
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:35,880
cohere let's say so you know from experience that if you are actually able

311
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,960
to just be with the pain in the back and not go into all the scenarios it does

312
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:46,960
reduce the suffering doesn't it there isn't as much duka yeah it still hurts I

313
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:54,120
get it um but there isn't that there isn't the same amount of Dua we've we've

314
00:33:54,120 --> 00:34:01,360
somewhat loosened the tangle we don't have as much and if we some of you may have had the

315
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,480
experience actually of managing to do it all the way you know like we really are

316
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:12,919
mindful of the pain to such a degree that we suddenly realize 5 minutes later it's not there

317
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:17,960
anymore it's gone wow the whole structure

318
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:25,358
collapsed sometimes that happens we don't always get control about that but this is all you know this is all

319
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:30,878
straightforward excuse me straightforward mind fulness practice straightforward Sati patana practice

320
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:38,200
that we teach even in introduction to meditation courses and of course it can be done on deeper and deeper levels as

321
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:45,118
mindfulness gets more and more developed in us so that's good news is that you

322
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:51,560
actually already know how to do this why am I giving this talk you already know you already know the fundamental

323
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:56,919
instruction but remember that there are multiple instances of these 12 links

324
00:34:56,919 --> 00:35:04,079
going on at any given time in our life and they're happening on different somewhat overlapping time scales so that

325
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:09,880
if we just see one instance of back pain and we're not reacting to it that's probably not going to collapse all of

326
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:17,119
our duka probably true but nonetheless that particular instance of it could cease

327
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:22,200
and in doing that through Dharma practice we are slowly moving toward a

328
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:28,320
larger scale collapse of the 12 links that might actually untangle a noticeable portion

329
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:34,040
of our Tangled heart and mind so each instance of mindfulness practice every

330
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:40,400
moment that we do where we're mindful because you can't do it any other moment than this one each moment where we do

331
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:46,440
this practice is helping to untangle that tangle and the specific practices

332
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:57,280
that you've already learned are targeting certain very vulnerable um places on this chain

333
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:03,760
so this is great so I've used an example from practice that you probably already know and what we're doing here is we're

334
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,040
putting it in this larger context of depend and arising I'm showing how this

335
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:16,960
one practice fits into the bigger picture of the reduction and eventually the end of Dua which is what the Buddha

336
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:24,680
was doing so even if we're only partway there along this untangling we can start

337
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:31,280
to understand that that's pretty much what it's about it's about entanglement and non- entanglement or about Dua and

338
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:37,280
the end of Dua that's it sometimes the Buddha said I I teach

339
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:42,520
only Dua and the end of duka that's what I teach so he was referring to that very

340
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:46,800
top level so start anywhere get

341
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:56,920
everywhere so maybe just to put in a little one other little connection if it

342
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:01,960
makes sense that's great and if it doesn't that's okay um in the four noble

343
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:07,520
truths we might remember that's also a very fundamental teaching of the Buddha

344
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:12,880
it's a compact teaching on how suffering comes about and how it ceases and you

345
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,880
might remember that the second Noble Truth says that the origin of suffering

346
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:25,680
is craving right so that's a key factor that's one of those links right craving is about in

347
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:31,000
the middle it's the one we just talked about so the 12 links are a little bit more

348
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:37,560
expanded version but when the Buddha gave the compact version in the four noble truths he just zeroed in on

349
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:43,560
craving he said if you could just eliminate the craving that's the end of the duka that was what we just talked

350
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:48,640
about that that step from feeling tone to craving that's a good place where we

351
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:55,160
can intervene and be able to see deeply enough that the duka doesn't happen but there's these other you know there's 11

352
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:01,200
other choices but if we just focus on craving that would be pretty good and that's right in line with the four noble

353
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,920
truths right so we see that connection

354
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:12,760
so we practice for a while or slowly untangle in more and more sections of

355
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:20,880
our knot and the knot thins out over time it thin gets thinner it gets

356
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:27,960
lighter and eventually we get down to the point where things are getting pretty thin and then we discover

357
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:33,599
something very interesting that's the other thing in my

358
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:42,119
box so I brought another ball you see this it's not wrapped around

359
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:47,839
anything so here this is wrapped around a piece of

360
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:54,800
cardboard but as we thin out these Tangled threads it turns out that we are

361
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:01,560
also thinning out the cardboard part and eventually we find that it's when we

362
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:08,480
get down maybe to this last one we can see that there's nothing in the middle

363
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,520
and when this one goes if I could pull this all the way out this would vanish

364
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:21,040
wouldn't it so teachings on conditionality are closely connected to

365
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:27,960
teachings on emptiness when everything is depend dep

366
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:34,560
on certain conditions certain necessary conditions then it has to be that those

367
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:40,319
things don't have an unchanging Essence to them a stable core that doesn't

368
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:47,119
change there is no stable core to this it's actually more like

369
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:55,559
this so things are empty of an unchanging Essence that is very

370
00:39:55,839 --> 00:40:03,960
freeing so the great thing is that your heart or mind can do this we don't have

371
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:11,359
to be smart enough to do it all on our own by our will or by our cognitive

372
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:18,920
intelligence it's like the way a wound can heal itself kind of by itself right

373
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:23,960
there is a lawful process underneath the healing of a wound and all we have to do

374
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:31,800
is supply some supportive conditions for it right but we don't have to like direct that with our mind and make that

375
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:37,839
all happen right I I hope not that would be hard um but there are things that we

376
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:43,880
have to do and in the case of untangling this tangle uh we have to look you have

377
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:51,319
to be mindful you have to be aware awareness is the foundation and we have to look in a skillful way we have to

378
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:57,040
look at this as a process and we have to look at it in the way that the Buddha

379
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:04,400
gives instructions for how to practice it doesn't have to be perfect it just has to be good enough to see the next

380
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:11,480
thing that we need to see the next thread to pull on that will make it looser and that's always

381
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:18,400
possible so I said I would tell you the Buddha's response to that Riddle That that the person asked about the tangle

382
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,720
right so um here's the original question and also his

383
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:31,640
response a tangle within a tangle without this generation is entangled in a tangle

384
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:37,400
I ask you this oh Goa who can disentangle this

385
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:45,280
tangle a person established on virtue wise developing the mind and wisdom a

386
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,760
practitioner Ardent and discreet they can disentangle this

387
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,800
tangle so that's us we have our foundation of ethical

388
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:01,400
conduct of being virtuous in our life we're developing our practice we're

389
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:07,640
doing it in line with wisdom as as best we can at our level of understanding as

390
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:13,040
much wisdom as we have and we just continue on and we know that the tangle

391
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:20,680
is untangling so I hope you will be inspired to just keep on and let the

392
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:25,558
tangle untangle thank you
