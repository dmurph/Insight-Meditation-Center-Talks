1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:06,799
so I'm happy to happy to be back here after

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:13,759
being uh gone for a week i was at the Zen monastery in down outside in the

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:21,439
mountains of um Big Su near Monterey Tasahara and Tasara has a river going

4
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:28,800
through it the Tasara River and one of the

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:40,079
you know one of the fairly well-known saying is the idea you cannot step in the same river twice but the uh full uh

6
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:47,280
uh quote goes something like you cannot step in the same river twice because

7
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,239
it's never the same river and never the same person that the person's also changing all the

8
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,520
time buddhism uses a a central metaphor in

9
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,198
Buddhism is a river flowing in a river

10
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:12,000
and so for this meditation I'd like to offer you a image

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,720
uh for sitting in meditation that uh emphasizes the constant change

12
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,600
the river of change that we're in river of time river of change that's all

13
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:35,280
around us so the image is that of a big solid

14
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,520
boulder sitting in the middle of a river and the water of the river just flows

15
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,000
right by it just flows and flows and flows but the the the the boulder is

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,079
solid sitting there and that someone goes to meditate on

17
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,240
that boulder and feels like the boulder solid

18
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,280
and everything is allowed to just flow by every thought every feeling whatever

19
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:12,480
is happening is allowed to flow to be in the river we don't pull any

20
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,599
water out of the river we don't um

21
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,520
we don't do pull a bucket of water and hold on to the bucket we just let everything flow in meditation move and

22
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,959
flow through the variation of this is that the boulder

23
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,280
is you and you're sitting there like the

24
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,959
boulder but the boulder also is not made of rock

25
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:51,360
but it's made of ice maybe a big ice block fell off a glacier into a river

26
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:58,319
and that slowly over time not only does the river wear out the ice

27
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,519
it melts the ice it melts the ice

28
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:10,560
and eventually all the ice all the water of the ice melts

29
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:17,680
and joins the river and now instead of being

30
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,720
the boulder you are the river

31
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:30,080
in this way we sit in meditation in the stream of change

32
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,000
everything's changing constant change

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,400
except for in some way or other we freeze our

34
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:49,159
experience through our thoughts our attachments our preoccupations

35
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,560
and the meditation is to allow for all things to flow and move in our

36
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,799
experience it's the nature of perception experience

37
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:09,360
even the nature of thoughts themselves to constantly be shifting and changing

38
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,120
and flowing and that doesn't have to be

39
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,160
a whirlpool doesn't have to be an eddi or rapids

40
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:30,080
it doesn't have to be a stagnant river everything can flow can flow together in

41
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:37,199
the same direction harmoniously and we flow in it we ourselves are

42
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:44,320
constantly changing we also are the river of of change

43
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:51,639
so to sit in meditation like a boulder

44
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,960
feeling solid in your seat in the place where you're meditating

45
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,160
and to gently close your eyes

46
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,160
and to settle into being here in a solid grounded way

47
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:25,880
taking some fuller breaths deeper breaths

48
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,600
and relaxing on the exhale

49
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,039
releasing to the pull of gravity on the exhale

50
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:49,000
without Losing a solid posture

51
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:25,759
letting your breathing return to normal and for two or three breaths more

52
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:32,440
softening the the body on the exhale

53
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,440
softening the thinking mind

54
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:56,479
as if what is solid and tight or contracted in the mind thinking mind

55
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,560
can melt can soften Amen

56
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:24,400
do you feel for some people the emotional center

57
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,000
maybe in the heart or the belly wherever it might be

58
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:37,280
soften softening relaxing

59
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,080
sometimes the river is a river of tears

60
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,759
sometimes it's a river that's gentle gentle

61
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,199
flow through our body

62
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,800
and then to feel the sensations of breathing

63
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,960
the inhale comes and goes

64
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,640
the exhale begins and ends

65
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:56,800
the changing sensations of the inhale are sensations in the body

66
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:03,720
expansion and pressure movement

67
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,160
a feeling of fullness

68
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,480
and imagine that your the sensations of breathing the experience of your body

69
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:39,399
breathing that you're gazing upon it

70
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:47,440
from your boulder but watching it flow by

71
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,800
as if sitting looking at a river the current the

72
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,720
gentle waves the ripples

73
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,439
as the water flows on and on

74
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,279
or watching the waves lap up on the sand beach

75
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:17,760
and recede with the kind of gaze that would you

76
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,279
that you would use relaxed

77
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:32,640
watching a natural process of change in your own body

78
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,440
watching their river the waves of breathing

79
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,959
except for sitting on a solid boulder

80
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,920
let everything else

81
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:55,639
be in the river of Change every perception

82
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,800
every thought every feeling

83
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,959
is flowing moving

84
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:30,880
Some things like a river the river is always there

85
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,720
but the flowing of the river is also always there

86
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,120
the river is the flow the change

87
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:18,839
and then allowing the boulder to dissolve in the water

88
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,040
maybe the boulder is made of ice

89
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:32,880
so nothing is held out of the water nothing's held away from the flow

90
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,839
all of who you are

91
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,399
is part of the changing nature of the present moment always

92
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,079
changing shifting flowing

93
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,839
every p perception changes

94
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,199
thoughts change

95
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,440
sensations and sounds

96
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:50,360
maybe the sensations of breathing are the central current of the river

97
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:59,399
stay in the current in the middle of the river change

98
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,040
all things are changing

99
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:58,160
just as in the present moment the sensations of breathing

100
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,200
are changing

101
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:10,760
so in the present moment all experiences

102
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:16,120
all sensations thoughts feelings

103
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:24,600
in and of themselves are shifting changing

104
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,799
flowing

105
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,120
don't hold yourself out of the river

106
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:50,919
let all things melt into the flow of change

107
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,720
and as things change

108
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:24,480
to be soft soft without resisting change without pushing

109
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,799
the change

110
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:40,400
finding a way to be in harmony with the change that's about to happen

111
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,559
which is bringing this meditation to an end

112
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:55,080
just the river is taking a different bend

113
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,520
it's always flowing

114
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:10,960
to take a few long slow deep breaths to feel

115
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,240
more connected to your body

116
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,240
maybe feeling a little bit more like you're on the boulder again solid and

117
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,720
grounded here

118
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:46,840
and appreciate that one way or the other all of us

119
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:54,200
are involved in a constant process of change

120
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,399
sometimes what's new appears sometimes

121
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:12,240
what has been disappears sometimes what's here grows old

122
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,600
or matures and ripens

123
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,600
and in this tender changing world

124
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:31,600
to be each other's companions in the river of change

125
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:38,960
so we care for each other we help each other float and move and

126
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:45,360
be known may it be

127
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:53,600
that we are each other's companions with care with kindness with love

128
00:28:53,600 --> 00:29:02,480
in this flowing and changing world may all beings be happy

129
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:08,640
may all beings be safe

130
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:15,600
may all beings be at peace

131
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:24,320
in this changing world may all beings be free

132
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:32,840
as a river flows freely without any obstacles

133
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:37,720
may all beings be happy

134
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:52,129
[Music]

135
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,398
thank you

136
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:02,000
so hello everyone and welcome back to this series on insight

137
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:09,039
that is following the longer series on samadei

138
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:15,200
and um so after a break uh for this last week I

139
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,960
want to pick up again and now do a series of talks on the first primary

140
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:27,679
insight of insight meditation which is uh insight into the experience

141
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:34,960
of change of inconstancy of impermanence

142
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:41,760
and um that things are constantly shifting ing and changing and arising

143
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,799
and passing appearing and dissolving and disappearing

144
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:52,559
that this is a really central aspect of human life

145
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:57,679
and becoming wise about the changing nature of life is something that a lot

146
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,960
of wisdom traditions maybe all wisdom traditions uh emphasize

147
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,559
and Heracitis is the one who said you can't step in the same river twice but

148
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:14,159
even more wisely u the rest of the quote goes uh you

149
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:22,559
cannot step in the same river twice because it's never the same river and never the same person stepping into it

150
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:28,000
and um the um

151
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,440
um so even you are changing just as the river is constantly changing and

152
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,840
shifting and we often have ideas

153
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:45,600
that don't change with the changing nature of reality we have ideas that

154
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:52,799
things are going to be this way forever uh and some things will never that

155
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:58,399
disappear will never come back but the art of

156
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:04,240
and the power of mindfulness practice is to appreciate that in our direct

157
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:10,559
experience what we're experiencing is constantly coming and going

158
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:18,159
and uh and the nothing stays the same uh in experience in what we sense and feel

159
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:23,200
and and um the nature of all the different aspects of the human being

160
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,720
that come together in the moment we're always a change and to a great degree

161
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:37,279
the world is too there's a a Sufi story that I like of uh

162
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:45,600
a man who had a ring made and uh he went to a Sufi master and said "Can you

163
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:51,840
inscribe something on this ring that uh whenever I look at it um I will be wise

164
00:33:51,840 --> 00:34:00,159
or will support me in my life." And so the master said "Yes please leave it here." And when the man returned in a

165
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:06,000
week to pick up his inscribed ring uh uh in it was written on in it was on it was

166
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:13,200
written um this too will pass

167
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:20,480
this too will pass and um so Buddhism is not unique in

168
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,560
emphasizing the changing nature of the world and in fact I've met people who I

169
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:32,800
thought were more wise than uh many of the Buddhists I've known people who have

170
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:40,480
been in the middle of uh life's challenges in the middle of uh all the

171
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:49,919
changing nature of life and death and change and war and peace and

172
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:56,800
um poverty and wealth and just has been people have been through it all so much

173
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,920
different things that and through it all they haven't been become become bitter

174
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,359
they haven't become despondent they haven't become afraid somehow or other

175
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:12,880
they've come to the point in their life where they understand in some deep way

176
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:19,680
and wise way that everything is changing all the time and to expect change not to

177
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,880
be surprised by it certainly there can be sadness certainly

178
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:33,599
there can be grief certainly there can be joy and celebration by what changes and moves along in our life the uh but

179
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:40,240
um but to to really appreciate so that there's a way maybe of stepping into the

180
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:47,440
change be stepping with it being with it flowing with it being in harmony with it

181
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:54,079
um not fighting it unnecessarily not um

182
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:59,119
uh pushing for change faster or not

183
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:05,520
holding on to things so they don't change these are not universal ways of being

184
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:10,560
but given how much things are always changing there's a way of being wise

185
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,760
about that and not foolish there's a ways way of being in harmony with that

186
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,960
rather than out of harmony with how things are always changing

187
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:28,400
in uh Zen Buddhism a person who's a novice monk a monk in training uh is

188
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:35,839
referred to in Japanese as an unsui and uh the word unui is made up of two

189
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:42,880
characters two words cloud and water and it's pointing to the idea that uh

190
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,800
someone in training in Zen um should go wa go through the monastic life like

191
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:55,200
clouds and waters fluid and flowing and moving around not resisting anything

192
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:02,640
uh but um somehow adjusting and sh and and reforming a cloud is constantly

193
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:09,520
reshaping itself with what's there and a water uh is constantly kind of going to

194
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:16,560
the going to the the lowest point always flowing around things and with things

195
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:22,240
and being lowest point being the point maybe of peace or freedom that something

196
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:28,079
inside of us is in the flow towards freedom from holding tight freedom from

197
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:38,240
being contracted freedom from resisting tight because those things are a lot of work those things involve a resistance

198
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:45,280
we don't have to accept things as they are uh we don't have necessarily accept everything that's changing part of

199
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,960
Buddhism is to appreciate how deeply things are changing but um they're not

200
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:58,160
chaotic and especially in our own direct experience for ourselves what's moving

201
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:03,680
and flowing and throughing us and what's growing in us we we we're not internally

202
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:11,520
chaotic through dharma practice we slowly learn to uh to come into a kind of inner

203
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:17,920
harmony and to shape and develop so that the river that's flowing through us is a

204
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:25,760
harmonious river or the the what's growing within us becomes u uh beautiful

205
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:32,079
and supportive and healthy there's a metaphor in Buddhism of again

206
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:38,720
of the rivers often used by the Buddha but one one metaphor is the analogy is

207
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:45,040
that um high up in the mountains when the river is still small and a creek or

208
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:52,320
a stream and it's going over rapids and going over boulders and um the river can be

209
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:58,960
quite noisy and when it's a waterfall it's a big roar

210
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:04,720
and um but when the river finally uh gets big enough and comes down into the

211
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:13,440
plains and is wide and big and the river becomes silent and it flows harmonious

212
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:20,880
so in our own life as we begin dharma practice um the dharma is flowing

213
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:27,200
through us um kind more like a high in the mountains and uh it's having to deal

214
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:34,480
with boulders and rapids and waterfalls and u blockages and things and and um

215
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:41,359
and it's uh sometimes it's chaotic and sometimes it's um you know waterfalls

216
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:46,880
and rapids sometimes It's uh noisy and challenging

217
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,960
but we stay in the river we stay in the practice and as we bring our kindness we

218
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:59,440
bring our uh clear attention as we bring our samadei as we bring our goodwill as

219
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:07,920
we bring our nonattachment all these things grow as as joy grows as

220
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:15,200
seeing things more clearly grows as um a sense of tranquility grows

221
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:21,760
equinimity grows uh the sense of The dharma river we we are becomes stronger

222
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:31,440
bigger and it begins flowing silently it still flows but it's a silent flow

223
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,720
and um and so we can go through

224
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:42,560
this world as a powerful

225
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,760
peaceful flowing river that can meet anything

226
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:55,680
that comes anything that comes our ways with wisdom with compassion with clarity

227
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:02,880
maybe with a skill and the ability to welcoming welcoming it into that

228
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:09,920
peaceful river welcoming into the flow of love and care friendship that we

229
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:17,040
change the world through the flow of love the flow of

230
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:26,280
peace the flow of the river of caring for each other in this world

231
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:32,960
we don't we're not a boulder we're not the rocks that are tumbling in

232
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:40,560
the river banging against each other we become the river we welcome

233
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:46,880
everything into the river maybe we're helping the ice b the ice

234
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:54,400
boulders to dissolve so this introduction then to the theme

235
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:00,240
of impermanence uh I wanted to emphasize that um it's

236
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:06,560
not a unique wisdom that Buddhism has uh I think I'd

237
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:12,800
like to propose that all wisdom traditions have contended with the same experience that we live in the river in

238
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:18,160
the world of change things are changing all the time and that there's an

239
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:25,680
ordinary even everyday way that we can become wise about how things change that

240
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:34,560
doesn't require deep meditation doesn't require deep insight it just in it requires

241
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:42,400
um ordinary sight that we see clearly and we stop and reflect and contemplate

242
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:48,480
the all the change that we see here so that

243
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:56,480
we can be in this world in a wise way may it be that our exploration of

244
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:02,319
impermanence ana the poly word may it be

245
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:09,520
that uh it's a way of supporting this world to become more peaceful and caring

246
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:17,240
may we care for all beings without exception thank you
