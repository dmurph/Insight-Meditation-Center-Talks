1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,240
welcome back i'm happy to be back again

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,599
continuing this series on freeing freeing the thinking mind

3
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:26,080
so in my own practice um over the years sometimes I felt the need to gladden my

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,719
mind and heart to inspire myself so during different periods of my practice

5
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,160
I begin the first several minutes of my meditation with some form of bringing

6
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:45,280
inspiration to my sitting um an example is something I used for

7
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,440
quite a while was imagining an honored guest coming over to my mind sometimes

8
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,239
the Daly Lama sometimes the Buddha how would I be if they were visiting my

9
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:03,120
mind you know I'd be really welcoming i'd clean up my environment i'd pay

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,680
really careful attention to everything they said so the idea is is that can we treat

11
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,240
ourselves as our honored guests and other times I begin my

12
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:23,360
sittings with you 5 10 minutes of loving kindness phrases a simple version of meta towards

13
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,840
myself and all beings may I be happy may I be

14
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:37,320
peaceful may I feel safe may I be free and then may all beings be happy

15
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:44,439
peaceful feel safe be free and so

16
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:51,200
um I I like still like to begin my sittings with just a little bit of uh a

17
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:58,880
warming of the heart in some way that touches me uh so let's begin this sitting with

18
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,040
another version of gladdening our hearts and minds

19
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:12,640
take a comfortable but alert posture gently closing the

20
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:22,440
eyes begin with taking a few deep breaths and with each

21
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:30,160
exhale settling into the body relaxing any obvious tension or

22
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,480
holding

23
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:56,080
Think settling into our seeds into the

24
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,680
earth or cushions

25
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,720
and then allowing the breath when you're ready to return to

26
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:30,120
normal getting a sense of the whole body

27
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,440
taking a minute to allow the attention to meander freely throughout the

28
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,879
body relaxing any obvious tensions

29
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,960
en close to the body you can begin to notice the

30
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,759
movements of the

31
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:47,840
breath finding the area where the breath feels like

32
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,779
home allowing your attention to rest [Music]

33
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,919
there settling into the rhythm of the

34
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:13,000
breath resting in this body in this

35
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,560
breath in your Home

36
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:29,440
now take a moment to connect with a wholesome quality that might particularly nourish

37
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,840
you at this time some form of

38
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:41,479
goodwill maybe kindness goodwill

39
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:50,080
love gratitude peace any form of goodwill that that

40
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,840
feels particularly nourishing to you

41
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:23,400
You might imagine that you're bringing this quality to the center of your

42
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:29,160
chest and in the center of your chest is a warm

43
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,759
sun and you can fill you can permeate that sun with the

44
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:39,599
goodwill whatever form you chose

45
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:50,160
and now allow the sun to radiate outward into the whole body maybe beyond your

46
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:58,759
body and as you breathe this sun can pulsate with each

47
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:07,520
breath with each exhale it radiates outward filled with kindness

48
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,639
goodwill love

49
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:28,120
peace a warm sun in the heart radiating outward

50
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,440
and whenever you'd like you can return to this simple

51
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:16,920
rhythm of breathing in and out this simple

52
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:22,839
opening to our lived experience however it

53
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:28,640
is not putting anything outside of our hearts

54
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:51,600
if the mind has drifted if it's become

55
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:57,600
lost gently welcome it back home

56
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:07,440
it's good to be [Music] home back to the rhythm of

57
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:15,880
breathing back to this body here and Now

58
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:43,800
[Music]

59
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:03,200
the thank you um so thinking is an essential part of

60
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:09,279
human experience and uh when we people begin

61
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:15,840
exploring the mind um they soon find out that the mind has a mind of its own and

62
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:21,480
then most of the thoughts we have um arise automatically just one after

63
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,640
another and it's easy to believe that that's just the way our mind is that all

64
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,840
we can do is observe it and sometime sometimes thoughts are

65
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,360
just really strange too you know i know um if you think about our dreams which

66
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:44,679
are kinds of thoughts you know they're um they can be quite unusual

67
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:51,320
but in addition to observing our experience um the Buddha taught us to take

68
00:31:51,320 --> 00:32:00,559
responsibility for our thinking and that when our thinking is harmful to us to purposely change

69
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:11,398
it um an essential part of the eight-fold path is the sixth step or wise effort

70
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:24,080
a simple way of describing wise effort is that it's the effort to let go of any

71
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:30,000
unh wholesome thoughts and states and to cultivate the wholesome

72
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,279
and helpful ones um the unh wholesome thoughts and states

73
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:42,480
are thoughts that are based on ill will or greed and the helpful ones are the ones

74
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:49,320
that are based on goodwill generosity love compassion

75
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,360
so because we tend to we tend to teach that mindfulness is being with our

76
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:02,840
experience just as it is allowing things to be and nonreactive

77
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:08,080
awareness a letting go sometimes we might not give attention

78
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:13,360
to the other side of effort the part that stresses the cultivation of these

79
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:21,200
wholesome thoughts and states that support our wholesome thoughts and states

80
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:27,039
and this mindfulness practice needs both of them letting go of the unh wholesome and

81
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:33,480
the nurturing of the wholesome of course just by meditating

82
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:39,559
regularly and paying attention to the mind we're already cultivating the

83
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:44,880
wholesome mindfulness is wholesome concentration is wholesome we're

84
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:51,440
developing patience but there are times where can it can be

85
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:58,240
very skillful to consciously bring in something more directly like the qualities of the heart

86
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:04,240
I mentioned or ideas that inspire us like the Daly Lama

87
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:09,878
visiting we often don't even realize we're telling ourselves unhelpful

88
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:14,358
stories harmful ones

89
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:23,760
much of the time the most helpful practice is to drop the story and find

90
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:31,878
the feeling but at other times it might be more helpful to tell a better

91
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:39,280
story it's important for not to be a huge fabrication that denies her experience that denies her suffering but

92
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,879
just a different way to consider it

93
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,560
an example might be let's say we're out for a long hike and it's almost the end

94
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:05,280
of the hike but instead of returning home we just realized we took the wrong trail and we're now over an hour away

95
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,520
and it's really hot and we ran out of water and we're really thirsty and our

96
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:18,079
feet hurt you know we messed up we might feel angry with ourselves and we might

97
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:24,400
trudge along despondently hurting and miserable

98
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:30,400
but without denying the reality of the situation without denying the fact that

99
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:37,520
we're thirsty and our feet hurt and that we made a mistake what if we saw this as

100
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:45,800
a hero's journey with the hero trudging through the desert thirsty and hung and

101
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:51,040
hurting there would be a sense of dignity a sense of presence as we finish

102
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,280
our journey

103
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:05,920
or maybe we're meditating and the mind is filled with a recurring aversion over and over we try

104
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:12,520
going back to the body back to the breath and there it is again it's hindering my meditation we might

105
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:20,240
think but what if we look at it with the idea of what can I learn from this the question can bring a wholesome

106
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:25,720
curiosity into the process where we're no longer caught in the

107
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:33,480
aversion into trying to get rid of some thoughts trying to get rid of something but now we're learning about

108
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:39,920
it or sometimes you know when we're really caught in something like that you know it's like just recognizing oh this

109
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:45,560
is duka this is why I practice being aversive is

110
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:51,440
painful and we can bring compassion to our suffering i'm hurting may I be free

111
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:59,040
of suffering and that changes the story

112
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,280
completely in this

113
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:19,599
path um I'll start with a story instead um uh you know one of the scientists who

114
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:26,040
studied happiness Daniel Conorman uh spoke of two aspects of the

115
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:31,240
self the experiencing self who lives in the

116
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:37,839
present they feel the warmth of the room you know we notice the light lighting

117
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:46,040
we're listening to this talk in meditation is the felt sense of our experience the moments of our

118
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:52,800
lives this moment to moment sitting here listening feeling the body it's

119
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,880
experiencing self the other aspect is the remembering

120
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:05,280
self the remembering self keeps score it maintains the narrative of our lives boy

121
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:12,720
that was a great meditation the remembering self is a storyteller we what we actually keep of

122
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:20,640
our experiences is a story that was a great meditation doesn't come close to the 30 minutes we

123
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:26,320
just spent showing up and some of them may not have been

124
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,520
great some of them may have been great uh but that's just an evaluation the way

125
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:37,200
we remember it what tends to define a story are the

126
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:43,119
changes uh any major moments uh doors slammed in the middle

127
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:48,400
of the sitting you know and the endings you know maybe we're really calm

128
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,720
at the end of the sit in researching

129
00:38:53,720 --> 00:39:00,079
happiness one of the things they found that is that there's a great discrepancy

130
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,160
between the quality of her momentto moment experience and her memory of

131
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:13,440
it that there can be significant difference between being happy in our lives minute by minute and being happy

132
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:21,520
about our lives or with our lives um and the story that that uh he

133
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:28,480
tells is about a man who was at the symphony and um you know he said for the

134
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,560
first 20 minutes the music was awesome it was just amazing he was deeply deeply

135
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:40,760
moved by it but near the end there was a horrible screeching

136
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:46,760
sound he said it just ruined the whole experience that was a terrible

137
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:53,280
symphony but it really didn't he still had those 20 wonderful minutes but it

138
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,440
was the memory that was affected and that's what he

139
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:05,280
kept that was the symphony that got ruined by this loud screeching sound

140
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:11,520
but his conclusion about the concert wasn't true and that's what we often do about

141
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:18,560
our lives you know we come up with conclusions with ideas with me and and

142
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:24,000
assume that that's reality and these stories that we

143
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,880
habitually tell ourselves they have a very deep effect on us

144
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,920
the experiencing self lives its life continuously those moments are lost

145
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:42,119
forever how many of the moments of or whole lives do we

146
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:49,160
remember and most of them are ignored by the remembering self that's most of our

147
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:56,720
life but the quality of how we spend these moments is essential but it isn't essential to

148
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:03,920
remembering self and it's a remembering self who makes the decisions in our

149
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:10,560
lives so for instance for our experiencing self we can ask how happy

150
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:16,640
are the moments of our lives that's what's important for the remembering self we

151
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:22,880
ask how satisfied are we when we think about our

152
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:29,040
lives they're very different what brought happiness to the

153
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:34,680
remembering self was achieving goals success

154
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:43,920
status what brought happiness to the experience self was spending time with people we like or activities we

155
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:50,800
enjoy when we think about life it's very different than how we

156
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,400
feel when we experience it

157
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:03,240
in mindfulness practice we bring the remembering self closer to our

158
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:10,560
experience that's part of what sati one of the meanings of sati to remember so we keep bringing that

159
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:15,880
remembering self very close to our experience so you can see clearly and

160
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:23,599
appreciate or momentto- moment experience and that helps decrease the

161
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:32,640
discrepancy the Buddha taught that um whatever a person frequently thinks

162
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:38,760
and pers upon becomes the inclination of one's mind

163
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:44,800
attention is like food when we repeat the harmful stories we feed them they

164
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:51,040
grow stronger so if we have a lot of judgmental thoughts it becomes easier to

165
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:58,560
be judgmental if we have a lot of insecure thoughts it becomes easier to be

166
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:04,160
insecure to feel insecure but if we have a lot of loving

167
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:11,520
thoughts it becomes easier to be loving so it's very helpful to shift the mind

168
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:17,760
away from unhelpful thinking if we're in the habit of

169
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:24,160
judging people negatively seeing what's wrong with them seeing what's wrong with people that's

170
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:30,240
what we tend to see the most but by purposely taking time to notice what we

171
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:38,400
like in someone it begins to weaken the judging habit and especially with ourselves we

172
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:45,040
can shift from focusing on we think is wrong with us what isn't good enough to noticing

173
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:50,480
all the good things within us our

174
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:57,839
intentions our stories are just stories they're not the full reality of

175
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:05,359
our lives and they're not even true many of them are not even true

176
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:11,760
but they shape our lives they influence our lives and as we bring mindfulness to the

177
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:18,160
stories we tell ourselves we can reshape the stories in the service of more and

178
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:25,160
more freedom of more and more happiness of more and more

179
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:34,760
love so may may all beings be happy may all beings be peaceful

180
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:42,040
may all beings feel safe and may all beings

181
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:49,079
everywhere be free thank you
