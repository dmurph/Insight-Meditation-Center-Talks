1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:08,880
so warm greetings from

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,099
inside Meditation Center here in Redwood City

3
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:20,699
wonderful to have you as part of this and um

4
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:27,720
as an introduction to this meditation one of the great possibilities or

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:36,559
opportunities in meditation is to lessen our self-preoccupation

6
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,960
and being preoccupied with our ourselves our concerns our

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:50,640
worries our desires our conceits this is all it has a very much to do

8
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,840
with our discursive thinking a lot of that is fueled by discursive thinking it's perpetuated by it it's

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,300
strengthened by it it's um reminded of it

10
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,340
and I think not a few people will discover that if they track what their

11
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:15,180
discursive thinking is about that often oneself is a

12
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,580
a key character or is an important reference point for What the how the

13
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:26,580
the commentary discussion fantasies are going

14
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:33,479
and as the discursive mind becomes quieter and we become Stiller or calmer

15
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:41,400
and and uh and perhaps some of the uh strength of our desires our Ambitions

16
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:48,180
our fears anxieties our conceits become less and less

17
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,520
then something remarkable begins happening and that is that the

18
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,399
orientation that we come from no longer is so self-centered

19
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,899
it doesn't mean that we ignore ourselves but it means that there's a kind of a opening up

20
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:13,340
a receptivity a sensitivity that

21
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:18,620
others and their well-being their suffering

22
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,940
becomes as important as our own there's no

23
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:32,360
the line there's no hard and fast kind of barrier towards

24
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:38,879
giving kind of a non-preferential care whoever is in our environment and

25
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:46,560
whoever is in our circle of concern or in our in our view or something

26
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,739
and as practice deepens that Circle of concern the circle of how we care for

27
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:59,900
can become even Universal for all beings partly because

28
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:06,480
there's no restrictions there's no limitations there's no preferences put

29
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,879
on the heart's capacity to care the heart's capacity to be open and

30
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:17,159
available and we are part of that kind of universal

31
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:24,540
kind of care and compassion and love that but it's remarkable to be able to

32
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:32,040
drop so much of the self-concern we have and discover a very different orientation

33
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:39,739
that um how to live our lives it can be life-changing it certainly was for me

34
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:46,319
so maybe not easy but the hearing they said this is a possibility of meditation

35
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:53,519
maybe as we meditate today that can be a reference point maybe a reference point to when there's

36
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:59,159
a self-concern to pay attention to see what the the

37
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:04,560
tension the contraction the limitation that's there the blinders that are on

38
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,780
what's being that so much is being left out because of the narrowness of that Focus

39
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:15,959
and that maybe there's some way that the narrowness can be relaxed and soften

40
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:22,440
the prioritization that to be some often give to ourselves and our own experience and who I am and our judgments of

41
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:29,520
ourselves what we need um and just to relax that and relax it

42
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,880
and maybe with every exhale to relax self-concern

43
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:44,340
every exhale to soften and open up Beyond the limitations of self Me Myself and

44
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,979
mine and it could be in very small steps it could be simply that the next sale is a

45
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:56,880
willingness uh to for this new possibility this new way and maybe it's not easy to tap into

46
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,979
it or touch it but just being willing to do it is the beginning of a softening

47
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:07,620
and opening a freeing that goes on so let's see how this goes

48
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,380
so assuming a meditation posture

49
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:20,340
and um and part of the goal of a mind of a

50
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:26,160
meditation posture is a posture within which you can both be alert

51
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,680
but also relax and let go in your body in a deep way

52
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,400
and this combination of a certain intentionality of being kind of somehow some intentionality and

53
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:46,440
having a an alert posture and a posture that

54
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:53,759
provides enough support that the musculatures in our body can

55
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,680
relax in a deeper way than usual

56
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:11,720
and to close the eyes and to take a few long slow deep breaths

57
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,479
maybe on the exhale letting go of any thoughts reactions you might have to

58
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:26,060
what I've said or letting go of any concerns that you brought with you to the meditation

59
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:32,240
and if they're not easy to let go of to soften around them

60
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,419
to ease up

61
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,319
into

62
00:06:53,699 --> 00:07:01,698
let your breathing be normal and to relax the body

63
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:08,840
maybe with every exhale this different part of your body can soften and relax

64
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,960
and as you continue breathing what is your discursive mind up to is it

65
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:02,039
already quiet or is it already can you notice that there's kind of some

66
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:07,440
kind of self-concern maybe an appropriate one an innocent one

67
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,740
but still it's concerned with oneself

68
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:22,740
if you're worrying about someone else is there some way that the worry

69
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,879
is in fact self-referential

70
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:35,039
in that maybe in that we're concerned about our own distress

71
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,000
or our own

72
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,540
or our responsibility or something

73
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,959
and then with every exhale

74
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:02,580
see if there can be a softening of self-concern self-referencing

75
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:13,920
the mind's movement towards viewing Things From perspective of Me

76
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,600
Myself and mine

77
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:31,320
even the idea of my body and my breathing my meditation

78
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:38,519
my experience can be subtly shifted to

79
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,019
the body's experience

80
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,899
the bodies experience of breathing

81
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:01,700
The Experience that's occurring now

82
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:09,120
without reference to self course it's happening

83
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:15,920
to you in a sense but to Overlay that with

84
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:22,700
the idea of me myself and mine is extra

85
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,140
is in some way a limitation on the open awareness the

86
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:33,540
open-heartedness the openness of just sitting here

87
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:38,300
breathing calmly relaxantly

88
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:49,760
letting go of self with every exhale

89
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:37,920
with every exhale equally letting go of self-concerned

90
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:45,980
as you will would letting go of other concerns

91
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,120
through deeper meditation

92
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:59,660
any direction of concern towards others or towards oneself

93
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:06,720
is not needed it's a limitation

94
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,780
to the settling and the opening the quieting

95
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:21,298
letting go of any thoughts about any by anyone at all self or other

96
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:30,179
just here available open receptive

97
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,960
present

98
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:40,519
here for what is without limitation

99
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,880
and as we come to the end of the sitting

100
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:57,480
there's a way of now opening our Circle of Care concern

101
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:03,799
compassion so that we're available

102
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:12,380
to care available to have a compassionate or a loving response

103
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:21,440
to whatever comes into view whatever we think about or meet or see

104
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:27,419
that translates to a universal

105
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:34,200
care Universal compassion for all beings not because we're thinking about all

106
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:41,539
beings or intending to have compassion for all beings

107
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:48,480
but because We Care without limitation

108
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,720
there's an openness a receptivity a sensitivity

109
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:59,400
that allows for compassion who are

110
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,440
whoever comes within View

111
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:13,158
maybe even for whatever comes into view including animals and

112
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:18,260
the nonsense non-sentient world

113
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:27,539
because we're thinking this or wanting this it's a byproduct

114
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:33,140
of our care being fully open and available

115
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:42,179
almost like a readiness or as a way of not limiting

116
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:47,520
no restrictions limitations no blinders

117
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:53,880
for our care and then to make a universal dedication

118
00:27:53,880 --> 00:28:01,740
of Merit it's not so much the idea of all beings

119
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:08,000
that it's the heart of the dedication but rather

120
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:15,380
this way of being that's available and open to all to all

121
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:25,820
May our hearts be fully open

122
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:33,360
to have good will for whoever comes into view

123
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:40,320
comes into our circle of awareness knowing

124
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:47,120
May or care be available

125
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:56,360
to promote the peacefulness and safety for all beings

126
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:00,620
their compassion

127
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:09,900
be always ready and sensitive to care for the freedom

128
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:16,100
freedom from suffering freedom from oppression

129
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:21,139
of anyone who comes into our view

130
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:31,640
so that deep inside it's almost almost as if

131
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:38,159
or almost as if these words give expression to this inner freedom

132
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:45,360
may all beings be happy may all beings be safe

133
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:53,179
may all beings be peaceful and may all beings be free

134
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:09,910
[Music]

135
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:17,179
thank you

136
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:31,500
so this topic of this week aspiration

137
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:39,080
is something very dear to me my journey along Buddhist practice

138
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:47,100
it's related to the topic of intention and the wise kind of way of letting

139
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:53,399
desires bubble up from within from some deep wise place within

140
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:58,860
and um and to some degree the aspirations which

141
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:06,360
the deeper intentions with which we want to live our lives in some ways are among the most important aspects of Our Lives

142
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:11,820
and getting clarity about Our intention clarity about our aspiration

143
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:18,658
and using the word aspiration rather than intention uh

144
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:24,779
suggests also that we're talking about something that is can be grand or big or

145
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:30,240
Central intention might be something very specific

146
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:38,039
and that could be Broad in general but aspiration is a little bit more has in my mind and my breathing has more of a

147
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:44,399
wide broad largeness to it it's like really essential it's like the heart's

148
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:52,500
aspiration the hearts deepest wish or something and the reason to refer to it that is

149
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:59,419
that as we settle in meditation as we relax and calm we're calming the

150
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:04,940
agitations that are always going to be there if there is conceit if they're

151
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:12,000
self-preoccupation if we're being driven by desires for what I want desires of

152
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,360
what I don't want or if we're caught up in fear not all fear but a good part of

153
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:25,740
fear is rooted in our certain kind of self-concern self-reoccupation

154
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:33,840
it could be that it's a preoccupation with my emotions my feelings my reactions

155
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,880
that might look like our cons our preoccupation is with someone else

156
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:46,080
someone else is suffering and we're really concerned about them but what fuels it is our own distress

157
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,840
and if we're distressed there is a way in which that has its roots in our

158
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:58,019
self-concern self-preoccupation or some idea that that we have to take my

159
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:05,580
distress somehow seriously or something it's a complicated ecology this inner life of

160
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:11,760
ours and the degree to which known and unknown it's it's centered on

161
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:17,300
self-concern a self-attachment is actually quite large

162
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:23,700
so as we begin to as we as this practice maybe any spiritual practice deepens and

163
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:29,520
deepens and we're calming and calming and letting go and relaxing the

164
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,700
self-concern relaxing the anxieties and fears relaxing the desires we have

165
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:40,878
relaxing the hates all activities that take energy and take stress and takes

166
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:46,138
effort to some way even though it might seem like it's effortless that there's

167
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:51,960
no me behind it is there it's actually as we settle in quiet we see the effort

168
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:57,180
the energy that goes into it and that that effort can be softened can relax we

169
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:02,580
can begin to slowly stop it's not easy to do it's a slow process

170
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:08,520
but the goal the treasure that's found in the end of that process is an

171
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:14,220
experience of living a lie being alive which is not a self-concerned

172
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:21,180
not self-preoccupied I like the word preoccupied so really stressing that there's something extra going on in the

173
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:27,660
self-concern there's an attachment there's a tightening there's a a drivenness there's a

174
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:36,000
preoccupation and um and um and so then at some point what

175
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:44,780
becomes uh what becomes here for us is uh attention awareness presence

176
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:49,980
heartfulness that doesn't have the limitations that come with

177
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:56,180
self-preoccupation that doesn't come with and as we're less self-preoccupied

178
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:02,480
it's a simultaneous movement or a parallel movement is to not be

179
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:08,220
preoccupied with others and some people feel like they're supposed to be preoccupied rather as an

180
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:13,560
expression of their compassion their care it's it's an expression of their love and of course they're supposed to

181
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:21,240
be loving well yes but not all the time we're not required to do it 24 hours a day

182
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:28,079
it's okay and you can feel the okayness in meditation as we deepen to it's okay

183
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:34,200
to let go of all preoccupations all the effort to think can be concerned

184
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:40,140
with others and oneself and so there's a uh certainly

185
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:47,220
selfishness begins to dissolve but also a parallel kind of movement that to make

186
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:52,500
up an English word um other uh

187
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:59,640
other ishness where we're kind of caught up in creating others and the view of others

188
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:08,099
the interpretation of others are and there's so much of this otherishness that goes on where we are projecting

189
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:15,420
idea of other people and what they need and what they want and and I saw that through with raising

190
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:22,400
my children that I projected onto them when they were small kids going to school

191
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:29,940
my own challenges that I had at school and so as they got to be certain age and

192
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:36,900
went into the playground some of the terrible things that happened to me in the playground I got worried for them

193
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:42,000
they were going to have the same thing and I have to protect them and make them safe and it was a project you know to them it

194
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,099
was an utterishness of of making them into something that had more to do with

195
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:53,400
my thoughts than it was about who they were and so this softening and relaxing of

196
00:37:53,400 --> 00:38:00,900
otherishness of uh and selfishness is uh one of the gifts of meditation

197
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:08,280
and it isn't that we're abandoning ourselves or abandoning others it's the opposite now there becomes kind of a

198
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:15,780
universal uh sensitivity Universal care that can be there that's not restricted

199
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:22,079
in any any particular direction and so as we have compassion for others

200
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:29,160
and are looking into studying the aspiration the desires we have for the alleviation of suffering

201
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:37,079
one possibility is that we check in and see is our compassion impartial is it is

202
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:44,220
it available to everyone is it unlimited is it not restricted it are we not are

203
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:50,700
we not being selfish sometimes there's a lot of selfishness in compassion some people do it

204
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:55,740
seemingly for themselves more than for the other to overcome our own distress

205
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:02,760
about people suffering we try to fix them or help them and sometimes where other-ishness we're

206
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,920
kind of making another projecting another and our care for others is more

207
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:14,040
still caring for ourselves because we're caring for that projection that we have of what's happening to the others and

208
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:19,760
what they're suffering might be like and so this deeper way which is not

209
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:26,040
actively concerned for self or others but 100 available

210
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:31,440
to be responsive and that's that is a kind of universal

211
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:39,300
compassion Universal aspiration that is possible and it has the expression that we're

212
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:44,460
caring for everyone concerned and so what's the best for everyone

213
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:51,780
concerned is a is part of this Universal care Universal aspiration of compassion

214
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:58,200
and it's important because if we're part of a group a couple or a family or a

215
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:06,000
neighborhood or work team or something things will go much better if if we're

216
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,180
not singling out one person to be or some some subgroup of people who are the

217
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:19,680
ones we have to care for the most and we have to kind of be selfless to ourselves or put aside other people's needs and

218
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:26,460
situations including our own so we can care for others everyone's equal player Everyone's an

219
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:31,740
equally Justified for our care and I know of

220
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:38,940
families where the parents

221
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:44,220
sacrifice themselves in unhealthy ways for the purposes of their children and

222
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:50,220
the children grew up kind of askewed because they didn't understand that part of what it being in a group is in a

223
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:55,920
family is is to compromise is to care for everyone to include everyone as

224
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,079
important players and having a role and respecting everyone's kind of needs and

225
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:07,800
finding a way to compromise or balance everyone's situation and if children learn that from an early

226
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:13,859
age then it's just second nature but if the parents poor all their concern into

227
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:20,280
their children without any concern for themselves the children get kind of a

228
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:26,520
skewed message so that that's what I use that as an example to all kinds of situations

229
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:31,740
and so this idea that we have you you know as we have a desire to alleviate

230
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:36,900
suffering to investigate to look at the nature of that desire the nature of the

231
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:42,480
aspiration and can the aspiration be Universal

232
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:49,140
where we're actually caring for everyone concerned and there might be a kind of a priority

233
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:55,320
given to someone who is the suffering the most but not at the expense of everyone else

234
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:03,060
in the room everyone else in the in that kind of connected and I think one of the brilliant things that we can do is to

235
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:09,420
take the time not to rush to compassionate action unless there's a real need for immediacy

236
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:15,839
but rather to take the time to look around and say what's best for everyone

237
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:22,680
here how do we care for everyone how does everyone how to go forward here

238
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:29,160
to relieve and the suffering that everyone has in this situation

239
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:35,339
and what I'd like to believe is the when we stop and do that kind of wider care

240
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:42,660
wider inclusion of everyone as our Circle of Care that this is actually a powerful

241
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:47,820
medicine for everyone involved the people who are suffering the most to

242
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:55,020
feel and sense that it's not just about their own suffering but there are others here also so that their Circle of Care

243
00:42:55,020 --> 00:43:02,400
opens up so that they're not tripped up by excessive self-concern themselves for

244
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,619
their own suffering which is maybe horrible but it uh there's a way in which that's

245
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:13,079
maybe maybe beneficial for others to kind of include others in the picture if

246
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:21,720
they can and uh and appreciate that others are being cared for too and the medicine of universal aspiration that

247
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:27,000
um is not just a the universal aspiration that's the medicine but the

248
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:32,180
inner freedom of non-preoccupation non-attachment

249
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:37,099
non-prioritization non kind of

250
00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:47,400
you know the absence of partiality that I think can be inspiring in its own

251
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:52,560
medicine for the suffering of the world so um

252
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:57,660
so to um so what I've to Summer summarize is that

253
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:02,760
you have Universal aspiration it's less it's a little bit less than

254
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:08,160
I'm suggesting that we try to have as a policy to have Universal aspiration for

255
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:13,520
all beings but rather we the practice is to

256
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:19,619
release ourselves from partiality release ourselves from limiting

257
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:27,359
we are our care and our love and um and the byproduct of that I hope

258
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:33,900
will be at Universal care a universal availability for compassion to be

259
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:41,280
concerned with the welfare and well-being of everyone who's in that Circle that uh that we're involved in

260
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:48,900
this moment whether it's a circle of two people a circle of four or 15 or

261
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:55,920
a hundred thousand you know whatever seems like the right you know you know range it seems appropriate for their

262
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:01,260
circumstance so um

263
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:09,480
thank you and may your Circle of Care be Broad and wide in all directions

264
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:15,020
and then we'll continue tomorrow thank you
