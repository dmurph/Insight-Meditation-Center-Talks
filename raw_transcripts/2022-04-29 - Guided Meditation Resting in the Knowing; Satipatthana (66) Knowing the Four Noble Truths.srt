1
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:11,040
so good morning everyone and here we are in the last day of

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,800
discussing the four noble truths and in terms of uh

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,000
how it relates to meditation it's it's central to the whole process

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,119
in buddhism but what i'd like to emphasize for this meditation

5
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,119
is that an um word in the

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,520
wording a description of the four noble truths that's often overlooked

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,200
and that is the word understanding

8
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,800
to understand the noble truth of suffering to understand

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:58,079
the noble truth of the arising of suffering to understand the noble truth of the

10
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,239
cessation of suffering and to understand the noble truth

11
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,240
of the practice leading to the cessation of suffering

12
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,960
and so you see the word understanding keeps getting repeated and

13
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,720
it's it's uh we tend to kind of look at the rest of the sentences to understand

14
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:30,159
we means we have to understand something we have to understand what it's the meaning of the statements are

15
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:36,720
but half of what we're doing also is beginning to appreciate more and more

16
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,920
value recognize um the understanding

17
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,000
the awareness the the knowing

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,040
that goes on and it's kind of a little bit maybe the secret that rather than

19
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,680
solving the four noble truths and seeing them understanding them a big part of what we're doing is

20
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,520
heightening the our recognition our appreciation of

21
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,520
the mind's ability to be attentive and that takes many forms one of them is

22
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,680
to understand to know to be conscious of

23
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:27,200
and as this sense of has a sense of

24
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:35,599
attentiveness awareness knowing clear comprehension

25
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,480
mindfulness becomes stronger it becomes a refuge

26
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,360
it becomes a place to abide in and it becomes a place where we feel

27
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:56,239
safe present as we're able to look out into the world or look into our own suffering

28
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,599
in an effective way it is we're not blinded by

29
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:08,400
or absorbed or about what suffering is but we appreciate the ability to step

30
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:16,480
back and just hold it in awareness so for this meditation

31
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,640
maybe there's some way that you can switch

32
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:30,159
the paradigm of how minds often operate where they're concerned about something

33
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:36,799
and when if we do mindfulness we're trying to be mindful of something and that's all fine

34
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:43,200
but there's a whole other half of what's happening and that is the awareness itself the

35
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,840
knowing the attentiveness the clear comprehension i

36
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,879
use a lot of words because different people resonate with different words or their minds work differently

37
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:04,319
and so their attentiveness is different using different capacities

38
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,879
so

39
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,560
i see some felt sense a felt sense to feel what's going on is

40
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,000
also another way if if we don't get caught up in how we feel

41
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,160
but are able to rest and be receptive in that feeling sense that we have

42
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:39,240
so let's see how that goes today so beginning the meditation

43
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:54,240
lowering your gaze if their eyes are open and looking down

44
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,759
and not looking at anything in particular

45
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,600
but the eyes see there is seeing

46
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,440
that seeing which make has no effort to see

47
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,960
maybe things are not in focus but still the eyes are taking in

48
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,520
light and

49
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,800
receptive receptivity of the eyes

50
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,840
and then gently closing your eyes

51
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:44,160
and there's the receptivity of hearing where it maybe it doesn't matter so much

52
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,960
what you hear but if you can hear something

53
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,360
i appreciate the hearing

54
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,400
the hearing-ness of hearing

55
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,800
the receptivity of the ears

56
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,440
and then there's the sensations of your body

57
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,639
sensing the body

58
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:40,800
but not searching for sensations but the way the body is receptive to

59
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:48,599
sensations and sensations appear

60
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:57,440
are present and being appreciating the receptivity

61
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,400
of our sensing the body

62
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,080
if you feel any holding or tension in the body

63
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:22,440
maybe on the exhale relax the holding soften

64
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:06,960
and letting yourself just take a few moments to breathe consciously

65
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,840
to breathe attentively

66
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,080
where the attentiveness to breathing

67
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,560
is appreciated as something important

68
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,880
just attentiveness itself

69
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,320
the fact that we're conscious

70
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,720
is kind of a miracle

71
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:08,920
and to be conscious is always something that happens in the present moment

72
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,160
to appreciate being conscious is to appreciate the present

73
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,800
a consciousness which is not searching or trying to do something

74
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,600
that is more receptive

75
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:05,079
as you exhale perhaps you can relax any tension or pressure around or within

76
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:14,519
your field of attentiveness around consciousness being conscious

77
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,519
perhaps allowing the sensations or the experience of

78
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,640
breathing to be like a gentle wind

79
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:26,600
flowing across the field of consciousness

80
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:33,040
gentle waves washing up across the beach

81
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:40,680
coming and going on the beach the beach being consciousness

82
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,200
being conscious

83
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:19,600
when a new sensation arises a sound

84
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,800
feeling in your body a thought a feeling

85
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:32,480
the beginning of a new in-breath or beginning of a new out breath

86
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,839
when things arise

87
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:45,279
in awareness i appreciate how that arising

88
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:51,519
can remind you of being of being aware itself

89
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:58,639
of knowing itself things are known

90
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:05,079
sensed felt experienced

91
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:17,839
the arising of something new is an occasion to appreciate

92
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,639
that we're conscious

93
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,440
perhaps you can notice

94
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,839
being conscious being aware

95
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:45,440
that you can notice now what arises effortlessly in awareness

96
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:53,199
maybe it's something unexpected what arises effortlessly and is known

97
00:16:53,199 --> 00:17:00,360
effortlessly it can be anything at all

98
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,079
a new sound a new sensation a repeated sound repeated sensation

99
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,678
whatever it is maybe initially before we get involved

100
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:30,880
in it there's a effortless knowing

101
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,840
recognition

102
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:46,200
and appreciate that part of the mind

103
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,919
that is attentive effortlessly

104
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,120
the part of the mind is not choosing what to attend to

105
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:22,720
not directing the mind part of the mind that just is

106
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:30,559
and experiences arise are known

107
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,360
sensed felt

108
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:25,679
and now with this kind of

109
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:31,200
knowing kind of

110
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:38,440
attentiveness that has this effortless quality receptive open

111
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:45,120
become aware of something that's uncomfortable here and now

112
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:53,000
your body some emotions some feeling some thoughts you're having

113
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,919
anything that's uncomfortable or stressful or

114
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:08,240
and see if you can know it that kind of awareness

115
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,520
the receptive open effortless awareness

116
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:19,280
where discomfort is just known but it's not a problem for this

117
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:26,280
effortless mind effortless consciousness

118
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,840
the mind being conscious of it is more appreciated

119
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:46,919
more valued than the discomfort

120
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:19,039
and then bring to mind some suffering you have in your life

121
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:28,000
maybe remember it think about it but rather than prioritizing

122
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,760
the thinking about it prioritize

123
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:40,559
the awareness that knows it quietly peacefully

124
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:47,679
prioritize the capacity to be conscious as you

125
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,880
are reminded of your suffering

126
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:43,679
and now gently softly

127
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:50,559
take a few long slow deep breaths comfortably longer

128
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,559
and relax let go as you exhale

129
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:04,159
settle deeply more deeply into this body relax

130
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,559
settle in

131
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,880
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

132
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:56,799
maybe relaxing into a simple

133
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:05,360
capacity for being aware or conscious the place where things are just known

134
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,960
receptively or effortlessly

135
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:19,200
and from this place of receptivity maybe clarity

136
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:25,919
maybe a kind of stillness gaze upon the world

137
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:32,240
kindly gaze upon yourself

138
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,960
kindly

139
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:50,240
with compassion for the suffering of the world with compassion for your own suffering

140
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:59,600
and perhaps from some place deep within some place that feels

141
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:05,039
maybe a place of home or a place of integrity

142
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,200
it can express the kindness the compassion

143
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:21,200
with the aspiration the generosity

144
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,559
of wishing yourself well

145
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,399
wishing yourself happiness

146
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,159
safety

147
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,000
peace and freedom

148
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:59,679
and then gazing out across the world a world where there's

149
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,360
abundance of suffering

150
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:14,080
and not getting caught in that suffering appreciating being conscious of it

151
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:21,559
and the kind of place of conscious stillness or openness

152
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:27,120
that's a powerful channel

153
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,120
for your compassion for the world

154
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:38,640
where your aspiration your generosity for the world

155
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:45,679
might be taken in the with the words given with the words

156
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,720
may others be happy

157
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,398
may others be safe

158
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,640
may others be peaceful

159
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,600
may others be free

160
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:30,839
[Music]

161
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:41,360
i wanted to read a wonderful passage from the teachings of the buddha

162
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,360
that

163
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:54,480
uh the buddha talks about he says it is enough

164
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,399
it's it's enough to do this this is a a good enough wonderful life

165
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:06,000
this is enough just if you just do this with your life somehow something like that

166
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,320
so rather than thinking this is like a high standard something but maybe it is but this is enough this is

167
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:18,158
uh this is a wonderful way this would be enough if you just did this it would be enough

168
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,480
um

169
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:34,240
um practicing for your own for your own welfare

170
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:40,480
is enough practicing for the welfare of others

171
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:47,120
is enough practicing for the welfare of both the

172
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:52,399
self and others is enough

173
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:58,240
there's a little bit more it's a little bit more than that it was a little bit of a paraphrase of the text

174
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,279
but um here we are uh practicing hopefully for the our

175
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:08,480
welfare and the welfare of others and we're this week we looked at the

176
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,880
four noble truths and the wording of the four noble truths is

177
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:21,679
uh to me is very simple the wording itself but very

178
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:30,080
evocative so one way it's evocative is that there are no pronouns in it

179
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:37,520
it says uh one understands the noble truth of suffering

180
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:44,000
one understands the noble truth of the arising of suffering one understands the noble truth of the cessation of

181
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,840
suffering and one understands the the noble truth of the practice leading

182
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:55,279
to the cessation of suffering and

183
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,519
there's no pronouns there it's not it's not emphasizing one's own suffering

184
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:08,559
or the suffering of others and i like to uh interpret this to mean that uh when we

185
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:15,279
practice we are available we to be to recognize suffering wherever it is

186
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:21,760
in ourselves in the world around us and and that we can it can be equally our

187
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:28,720
care to care for the suffering of others that is care for ourselves each of them is enough this little text

188
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:35,919
suta says and um in someone else in uh it's in the samyutta

189
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:42,480
book 12 22. and

190
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:50,080
it's um uh so each each of the each is enough but

191
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,120
whenever we're at paying attention to the suffering of others if that's what's salient that's

192
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:01,360
what's prominent that's enough that's good paying attention to our own suffering

193
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:08,000
that's good as well doing both here it says is enough but i think that doing both is really

194
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,519
the best because if we only pay attention to the suffering of others

195
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:20,000
but not our own we can easily say and act in ways that cause more harm

196
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,039
for ourselves and for others if we only pay attention to our own suffering

197
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:30,320
then it's too easy for that to be to reinforce self-involvement

198
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:37,679
self-preoccupation uh selfishness of a certain kind and it's too easy to um then to not pay

199
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:44,320
enough attention to the suffering of others to similarly cause harm because we don't understand people we don't know the

200
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,919
impact we're having or what is supportive for people but to be able to do both is a

201
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:56,640
phenomenal thing and one of the phenomenal aspects of the keeping the four noble truths at the

202
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:03,200
center of buddhist practice it's a form of self-protection

203
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:09,279
and a protection for others because the ways because we notice

204
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:15,679
when we start becoming uncomfortable tense stressed

205
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:23,600
de-stressed we stop and pay attention to that this is worth

206
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:29,679
understanding this is worth looking at and that's a very different approach

207
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:36,080
than just barreling ahead with the suffering kind of being preoccupied with in a way that

208
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:43,200
reinforces it but with this special awareness we're developing and mind mindfulness the ability to kind of in a

209
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:49,200
in a metaphorical way step back and know it be conscious of it

210
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:55,120
where being no knowing and conscious of it is in some ways more important than the

211
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:03,200
content in what's happening where the knowing of it is where some freedom is found

212
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,878
and where the knowing of it gives us information about how maybe to correct your course

213
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:14,878
correction how do you know if you notice the shoulders are tense maybe we could that's maybe simple to relax the

214
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:20,000
shoulders if we notice we're attached to some outcome maybe that's not so easy to let

215
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,158
go of that or we're holding on to some pain and being attached to suffering that's not

216
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,760
so easy to let go of but slowly we begin to learn that to have this different relationship to

217
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,280
suffering where it um where it doesn't uh

218
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,560
it's not driving the show it's not uh confusing us or

219
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:50,398
or preoccupying us in some deep way we're learning this ability to step back

220
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:55,919
and be conscious so that in that consciousness there's

221
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:02,640
some ease some freedom and there's the information we need to maybe

222
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:08,400
do course corrections so that's how it's protective so that works for example in in meditation

223
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,440
practice at some point we become aware that we're straining

224
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,960
maybe we're trying too hard or or we have an expectation that should be different

225
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:25,680
we have this idea that i'm not doing it well those kinds of thoughts

226
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,119
uh and those kind of that kind of strain probably you can feel

227
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,400
some discomfort around having them some dukkha some strain or stress

228
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,920
and if you notice it then you're you're on the road to becoming free of

229
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:48,079
it especially if you've developed this capacity to be consciously aware

230
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:53,440
in this very clear way that we're talking about today and um

231
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,480
so this is a this and then and then we can make a course correction we can maybe change

232
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:06,000
what we're doing as well so we're not so much focused on the content of what we know

233
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,680
and we're not necessarily focused on the process of what's happening but we're

234
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,760
prioritizing being conscious of it some people might feel um that that's

235
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,800
not enough that's not you know that's dangerous or we're not going to take care of ourselves properly

236
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,480
but the uh what happens is as we can be relaxed and open and conscious in this

237
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:35,119
kind of effortless way that then we have access to deeper places of wisdom within

238
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:41,359
deeper knowing deeper we have time for some deeper process to unfold and

239
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:48,079
um and uh and uh enter reference how we what we say and what we do

240
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:55,200
we can reference it with uh against or with this freedom or this spaciousness or

241
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:02,240
this ease of this kind of knowing so

242
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:09,838
so to be [Music] so the four noble truths

243
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:17,200
and instead of trying to understand what they mean

244
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,800
which is appropriate i hope you under you know understood more this week what it mean

245
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:29,760
but to also remember how important the word to understand to know

246
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,680
to know each one and the knowing grows the capacity to know present

247
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:42,640
moment awareness present moment conscious awareness can grow so it becomes a place of abiding of

248
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:49,520
resting a place of freedom where we discover

249
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,880
that um in a deep way what we're looking for in

250
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:01,280
practice in a deep way the freedom the peace the deep what we're looking for

251
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:07,599
maybe is not found in what we're trying to understand

252
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:13,920
but it's found in our capacity to understand

253
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:22,400
it's not found in what we're trying to know but it's found in the knowing itself

254
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:30,400
and that's a paradigm shift may you appreciate your knowing

255
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:38,079
your con your ability to be conscious to be attentive to be aware

256
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:43,359
may you over this weekend uh try to go through the day

257
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:48,560
periodically tapping into or exploring what i talked about today about this

258
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:56,240
value of understanding knowing in this being conscious in this kind of effortless way we're used to receive

259
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:03,839
and see what you'll learn see but you learn how difficult it is when it's easy what benefits come from it

260
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:10,720
even if you just have a little hints of it from here and there and then monday we'll start the last week on

261
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:18,640
these on the four foundations of mindfulness now that we've gone through all the exercises there's a foundation for

262
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:24,240
um for bringing it to a close

263
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,838
so thank you very much and

264
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,960
look forward to monday
