1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:18,240
so I want to talk tonight about our affective responses to

2
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,199
experience okay so as life flows along from morning to evening from day to day

3
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,720
we're impacted right we feel things and other people do too I hope hope I'm not

4
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:38,680
saying anything radically new with a statement like that but I also want to

5
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:44,800
suggest that we carry at least some

6
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,680
identification and maybe a lot with our particular

7
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,600
emotions and we can see this in the way that we say things like the sunrise

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:05,119
makes me happy or I always cry during romantic movies and we some consciously think

9
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:12,119
that part of who we are is our emotional landscape which is relatively constant

10
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:20,079
relatively fixed right this is how I am so let's explore a little bit in this

11
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:25,799
realm and see how it relates to Dharma practice and to what Buddhism says about

12
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,000
training our minds so I hope we'll start off in ter teritory that's pretty

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,439
familiar and you might be saying yeah okay I get it and then let's let's

14
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:43,759
wander forward with that and see what some of the implications are and how

15
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,079
that emerges in our practice so first of all let's

16
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:55,240
consider how uniform are people's responses to a given

17
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:01,280
event I'm remembering back to the time uh long ago when I was

18
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,560
working and the company I was working for the founder of that company was

19
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,160
getting ready to retire and he sent out you know an email

20
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:19,879
to all of his colleagues and business associates just to let them know that

21
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:27,879
you know at a certain time in the future you know five or six months from now he would be retiring so he just wanted to

22
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:36,599
uh let them know and say something about how nice it was to work with them Etc and he got back a lot of responses

23
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:43,040
you know from the people who knew him well and he noticed that his American

24
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,800
friends tended to write back and say congratulations fantastic you know what

25
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:56,200
are you going to be doing next something like that and um this was an

26
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:04,720
international company and almost all the responses he got got from his Japanese colleagues said I'm so

27
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:11,440
sorry you know because um at least at that time a while ago the understanding

28
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,519
was that you know if you were retiring you would lose your connections many of your meaningful Life Connections to the

29
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,599
Working World and so they said well I'm I'm sorry you need to be doing that I

30
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:31,439
hope it's going to be okay for you so clearly in some cases there can be quite a wide variation by culture and

31
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:38,080
we can imagine um many other circumstances that would affect someone's response of

32
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:45,000
course so the event itself does not determine how we feel about it and

33
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,360
that's even true in more extreme cases as we'll see later but what about the person you know

34
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,079
does a given person tend to respond in a predictable way to certain kinds of

35
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:03,519
experience well people do have what's called temperaments this is even

36
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:10,360
recognized in the Buddhist commentaries it talks about different temperaments that people have and we say the same

37
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:18,199
kind of thing we don't always use that word but you know we know that certain people are generally warm or anxious or

38
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:24,479
hot-tempered or hesitant you know and this is real we do see some stability in

39
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:31,720
fact that stability is exactly why we can identify with our emotional habits

40
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,120
that relative stability allows us to think I am like this or that person is

41
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,240
like that but for the

42
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,560
Buddha these habits are all just that they're conditioned habits some of them

43
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,960
are very deeply conditioned and may not change in the course of our life and

44
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:00,160
some of them are less so and it's expected though that d

45
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,160
training will shift our emotional responses over

46
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,320
time right it has to because we're moving in the direction of less

47
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:17,280
suffering right so that means that as we practice we will less often experience a

48
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,720
re a reaction that comes from greed or hatred or

49
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,319
delusion so this all might sound pretty clear yeah I get that theoretically but

50
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:35,919
what does that imply well it means that we're going to have to give up our subconscious idea that we are

51
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,880
always angry or anxious or envious in certain

52
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:48,840
situations and sometimes that is a real barrier on our path is getting past our

53
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,919
own expectations of how we should

54
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:01,400
feel so to be clear we do have whatever emotional

55
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,800
response that we have that is a lawful arising so I'm not talking about

56
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,039
experience needing to be a certain way or certain responses not being the right

57
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:17,120
response I just want to say that really clearly because emotional realm can be

58
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,360
an area of a lot of suffering um not just for the emotions themselves but we

59
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:28,680
have ideas about that oh I have too many emotions I have too few emotions I have

60
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:35,599
the wrong emotion so we add extra judgment onto our emotions and I'm not I'm not making any

61
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:42,800
judgments like that what arises is what arises but I am saying that over time we

62
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,479
do expect shifts aan cha a Thai teacher from the

63
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:54,199
last century said that one measure of our practice is that as we move along

64
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:59,280
the path fewer and fewer things cause us to suffer and more and more things bring

65
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,639
us happiness and that's a very broad brush statement but doesn't that make sense if we're moving away from

66
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:10,800
suffering there would generally be that Trend it's kind of an average Trend

67
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,960
don't think it sort of goes linearly because it doesn't but it's an average

68
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,440
Trend and I think the reason for that is clear greed hatred and delusion are UNH

69
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,560
wholesome or unskillful so they're sort of ethically detrimental things whereas

70
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:35,319
skillful or wholesome qualities like patience or care compassion meta

71
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:40,879
honesty these things actually bring happiness ethical conduct is the root of

72
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:46,560
a deeper kind of happiness and we uncover more and more of that on our

73
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:54,120
path so now let's let's go a little farther along this

74
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,520
idea sometimes this development of how we respond in an AFF

75
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,599
effective way can go in surprising directions so I want to relate a story

76
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:12,759
that I heard recently from a teacher this teacher is someone who used to have

77
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:17,879
a lot of anger so he was an angry person earlier in his life he would have

78
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:23,479
characterized himself that way um before he had done much practice and he's

79
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:29,960
addressed it a lot of different ways you know sometimes just with mindfulness sometimes with actively practicing meta

80
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:35,560
things like that but he says that um he's practiced for a long time now he

81
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:42,440
says now he goes walking and he likes to pick up bottles and trash that he finds

82
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:50,160
along the walkway and sometimes when he's walking with someone the other person will Express anger that people

83
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,399
have been littering you know people have not been taking care of the

84
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:02,000
environment but he says that he feels nothing but happiness because it's a chance to pick up trash

85
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,480
and bottles and make this face look more beautiful than when he than before he

86
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,640
got there and he noted also a little bit to the side

87
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,880
that sometimes the person who's expressing anger is not picking up any

88
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,399
bottles they're just expressing the anger about

89
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:30,079
littering so do we always need to have the conventional emotional

90
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:35,240
response no no who who's happy about finding

91
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:43,519
bottles along the road this guy who's practiced for a long time is great we can be genuinely happy about

92
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,600
trash sometimes so this path goes against the stream that might be a

93
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,920
phrase you've heard and this is actually noted in the

94
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:00,200
sutas so I'm not just making this up this is from the SU nepata

95
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:06,480
what others speak of as happiness that the noble ones speak of as suffering

96
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,560
what others speak of as suffering that the noble ones have known as

97
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:19,519
happiness don't take it too literally you know you could read that and say come on what about war or disease of

98
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,279
course that's not what it's talking about we can give Buddhism a little bit more credit than

99
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:33,000
that so I think it's some saying something a little bit more subtle what others speak of is happiness

100
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,240
that the noble ones meaning longtime practitioners who have some understanding that they speak of as

101
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:45,399
suffering what others speak of as suffering that the noble ones have known as

102
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:52,399
happiness I understand this to mean that the more commonly accepted ideas of

103
00:10:52,399 --> 00:11:00,240
Happiness such as material possessions or you know world success of

104
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:07,079
some kind tend to become less appealing to people who have done a lot of Dharma

105
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:12,839
practice those people maybe find a different and more satisfying kind of

106
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:19,240
happiness in things like Simplicity or living a Dharma oriented

107
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:25,279
life so like we mentioned you know a few minutes ago the person who is happy

108
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:30,760
about seeing trash that they get to pick up make the world more beautiful

109
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:36,120
there's a way that wholesome qualities provide the foundation for a deeper kind

110
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:42,560
of Happiness might even be that you know

111
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:50,639
what others speak of is suffering having to wait having to you

112
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,240
know be with people who are in distress maybe that's a form of Happiness if your

113
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:03,639
heart is very compassionate that's a wonderful opportunity to connect to

114
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:10,519
serve this same text that I quoted from a little bit later says that some of the

115
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:18,639
insights that one has along the path of letting go run counter to the entire

116
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:25,199
world this was written not written down but it was said 2500 years ago so the

117
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:31,959
Buddhist world was similar even then people who were doing longtime practice started to feel different in a certain

118
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:39,440
way started to see things differently to the point where they felt like maybe they had different

119
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:46,600
values so we see this you don't even have to be a longtime practitioner to start running into this as a

120
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:53,199
teacher I hear fairly often from people who have started to practice

121
00:12:53,199 --> 00:13:00,399
regularly that they aren't as interested in hanging out with with some of their

122
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,560
friends now that they're meditating so the activities that they

123
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:13,199
do with those friends just don't seem as interesting or as enjoyable now this is okay this is

124
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:19,839
normal natural uh I I don't tell people to go out and get rid of those friends

125
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:25,440
immediately I tend to say just add some Dharma friends you know just add add a

126
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,680
few extra people add some people that also meditate or that will understand

127
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:36,120
something about what you're getting into now and and just let things evolve and

128
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,920
as they do so we started out with very obvious

129
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,279
statements about our affective response our emotions and we kind of followed

130
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:53,880
that into how is this changing along the path have we wandered into kind of surprising

131
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:59,120
territory oh wait a minute yeah things do change such that I'm not quite as in

132
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,880
alignment with the usual suffering of the world that's cu the usual conventional way in the world is a path

133
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:11,360
with a lot of suffering we're trying to do something different here and yet we still live in

134
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:19,839
the world how does that work so one implication of all of this I

135
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,240
would suggest is that we need to develop a certain kind of

136
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:31,920
confidence maybe the confidence to have the actual response that we do and not

137
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:38,000
require it to be what is expected by Society by other people even by

138
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,560
ourselves can we acknowledge that our emotional responses are changing and of

139
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:51,199
course they are this is the path that transforms us transforms our way of seeing the

140
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:58,519
world we have to allow ourselves to change though if we're going to walk this path we have to allow ourselves to

141
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:05,759
change in Zen there's a process called uh

142
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:13,519
tario where a practitioner has to wait outside of the monastery gates for

143
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:19,000
anywhere from hours to days uh before they're being led inside to join the

144
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,360
monastery in practice and it's supposed to demonstrate your dedication maybe and

145
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:32,600
also it's a chance to watch your mind when it's under some stress pretty much just put in a room and said you sit here

146
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:38,040
and we'll come get you you don't know how long that's going to be I mean they they give you food and they let you go

147
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:43,680
to the bathroom but other than that it's pretty much it and so Gil actually went

148
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:51,199
through this process when he was doing his Zen training he did a a period of tario and when it was finally over after

149
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:58,600
a couple of days his response was not actually relief or Joy or maybe there

150
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:06,319
were some of those things but what was most prominent was that he cried because he thought that he

151
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:12,480
would never be that intimate with himself again that was his response after being

152
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,519
locked in a room for a couple of days I think he was surprised that that

153
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,560
was what he felt that was maybe different than what he would have expected so can we allow

154
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:29,519
ourselves this kind of freedom of response

155
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,199
I think practice moves us toward a kind of deep inner

156
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:41,120
honesty where we really open up to how things feel in a complete way in

157
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:51,279
ourselves rather than in a conventional way or in a habitual way we accept that part of us might

158
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:57,480
feel happy at a funeral or saddened at a

159
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:04,038
wedding we all allow ourselves the full range of feelings to flow and to change

160
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:11,240
as the path changes us now we wouldn't Express or act on

161
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:16,880
just any of our inner experiences we can still have discernment about what would

162
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:24,798
be appropriate you know for the people that we with of course we might not say or do anything

163
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:30,760
with the feelings that we have arising if they're quite unconventional or

164
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:36,480
unexpected from the usual but part of this training that we're doing is not to

165
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,679
suppress our inner response and instead to be clearly mindful of

166
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:48,559
it and to have the confidence that if we keep seeing honestly our inner world

167
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:53,960
will harmonize and will move toward more like that response that Anan cha

168
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:00,000
mentioned more and more things bring some measure of inner Joy To Us

169
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,640
isn't that nice you could have inner joy and not have to express it if it's

170
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:14,039
not expected in that situation and yet there you are not suffering on the

171
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:20,080
inside so it's a reasonable question to ask how do we do that so let's turn now

172
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:27,760
to practice how can we practice with including more inner emotions and

173
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:35,280
responses so the first way I'll mention is something that I do in my own practice sometimes um which is to create

174
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,400
an atmosphere of safety for various inner

175
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,799
responses sometimes I'll note to myself at the beginning of a sit I actually say

176
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:51,280
this in my own mind it's okay for anything to arise and it's okay for

177
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:59,080
anything to cease and sometimes I also um add that I won't dismiss any responses that come I

178
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:04,480
won't laugh at them and I won't make them into anything that they're

179
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,720
not so you might try it if that sounds appealing it's interesting because we

180
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:17,400
can be our own barrier in terms of feeling our inner response you know what I what am I supposed to be feeling now

181
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:23,280
what am I supposed to be thinking what's the way that I've always felt about this for the last 25 times I've thought about

182
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,840
it but sometimes we can ask is there anything else here something I haven't

183
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:35,000
acknowledged or admitted it's useful so I find that when I do this

184
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,640
like when I say it's okay for anything to arise or cease Something in My Heart

185
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:50,039
relaxes and I'm more likely to be able to sense a wider field of my emotional

186
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:58,360
landscape of course it's also important to have the capacity of mindfulness to be able to handle anything that comes up

187
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:04,480
so so make sure that you're developing that muscle as much as possible um

188
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,159
throughout the day on and off the cushion and if anything comes up after you've invited you know it's okay for

189
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:15,960
anything to arise or cease if anything comes up that feels like it's getting overwhelming it's fine to back off you

190
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:22,240
don't have to have to stay with anything that's arising we just want to make sure we're

191
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,720
not limiting ourselves so it's also the case that the

192
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:34,280
Buddha gave some specific recommendations for How to Train our perception and how to relate to

193
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:40,039
experiences such that we uh don't get caught up in just habitual responses and

194
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:45,200
I'll name just a few of them tonight probably the most important is

195
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,559
to notice the quality of anicha of inconstancy or impermanence that's the

196
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:57,960
poly word anicha and particularly we can notice that in the realm of uh feeling tone

197
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:05,080
wether experi experiences Pleasant unpleasant or neither Pleasant nor unpleasant and also mind states which

198
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:12,559
our emotional responses go into that realm if we start watching we see that they change all the time Pleasant

199
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:17,799
unpleasant Pleasant neither unpleasant neither Pleasant if you try to track

200
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:24,039
feeling tone it's always constantly shifting and as we respond to that

201
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:30,320
emotionally uh we can start to feel that there is a lot going on

202
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,880
and also you know maybe more subtly when we allow ourselves to see change with

203
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,679
some continuity for a long time the heart begins to understand at a at a

204
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:48,960
deeper level than our thinking mind starts to understand that clinging doesn't really make sense things just

205
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:57,080
keep changing right so um when we're clinging less getting

206
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:02,919
stuck less often then the Mind naturally becomes more flexible more

207
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:08,840
responsive which we could call Freer right more flexible more

208
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:14,760
responsive so Dharma practice like the realm of noticing anicha noticing

209
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:20,919
feeling tone tracking our emotions you know that is a a practice it's a way of

210
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:26,200
corralling the mind to you know pay attention in a certain way but if we pay

211
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:32,000
attention in that certain way in a wise way it will eventually open up and

212
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,760
become more flexible does that make sense so if we wisely contain the mind

213
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:45,600
in certain ways we're stopping it from dissipating its own energy and sapping it away through clinging so then it gets

214
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:52,400
freed up to be more creative more reflex more more flexible more able to

215
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:59,120
respond so the fruit of practice where we're open we allow ourselves to be more

216
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:05,480
and more emotionally responsive even in surprising ways is that we become Freer

217
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:12,679
a Freer response these trainings open and release the mind so it's less stuck in

218
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:18,760
conventional ways of seeing things it's subtle we're slowly learning to free the

219
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:26,120
Mind from various deadening or limiting responses we are our greatest limitation

220
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:33,919
actually and then another crucial understanding that comes from this is that we begin to let other

221
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:42,520
people have their responses also whatever they are there comes to be less judgment less

222
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:48,000
policing of other people's ways of being ways of seeing

223
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,720
things this comes about naturally as we learn to loosen our own way of seeing

224
00:23:53,720 --> 00:24:02,000
things and so this is a way to reduce conflict so much conflict comes because of

225
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:09,200
rigidity in how things are seen we can help by increasing our own

226
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:15,799
freedom of response so to be clear we don't become

227
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:22,080
you know more LAX in areas like ethical conduct because we learn that you know

228
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,679
reducing harm leads to deeper happiness but in all the ways where where we're

229
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:33,760
unnecessary holding on to fixed ways of seeing things or habits or old ideas or

230
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:41,720
conventions all of those begin to soften so I think this is the secret of

231
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,840
why quite a few longtime meditation practitioners particularly monastics you

232
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:52,360
can see this but many longtime practitioners seem to get jollier and

233
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:58,840
more peaceful right as they practice and also more surprising

234
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:05,240
in their responses so I want to end by reading a

235
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:11,960
story from the monastery within this is Gil's book from a little while

236
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:18,440
ago and try to listen to it in light of what we've talked about tonight it's a few

237
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:24,120
pages I hope you'll indulge me for it's four pages um I hope you'll indulge me

238
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:30,760
in reading the whole thing because it takes us kind of on a journey of a change an emotional response an opening

239
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:36,600
up a freeing and then a maybe surprise surprising by the

240
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:44,520
end so read it listen to it in in light of what we've talked about tonight of allowing our emotional landscape to

241
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:50,679
change so the abis of the monastery was a most exceptional person she seemed to

242
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:57,960
always have a smile in her eyes when she looked at you it seemed as if she knew you better than you knew yourself she

243
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:05,240
once told the following story of how she first came to the monastery when I was 13 my family would

244
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:12,200
send me up to the mountains around the monastery to collect edible plants for our evening meal these foraging trips

245
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:19,640
were the only work I enjoyed doing otherwise I tried every trick I could to avoid work on my family's Farm I was

246
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:26,559
still in school but school had no interest for me my anger was a welcome barrier to learning anything the teacher

247
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:32,559
was teaching on one of my foraging trips I would pass by the monastery while the monks and

248
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:38,919
nuns were out sweeping the leaves from the pathways the first time I saw them working I was mesmerized watching them

249
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:46,320
go about their work for many months after I would often stop a while to watch them sweep they worked silently

250
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,120
and with an efficiency that seemed effortless then one day a monk walked up

251
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:59,520
to me and asked what I was doing in the mountains the question frightened me and I became defensive I resented anyone who

252
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:06,200
tried to get to know me so instead of answering the question I countered by asking what he was doing and the monk

253
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:12,320
smiled and answered that he had been told to sweep and that he was just killing time until he could return to his room for a

254
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:18,799
nap as I walked home later that day I thought about his answer and was glad that he did not seem any different from

255
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:25,760
me when I was required to do anything my heart was never in it and my attitude was that I was just passing time until I

256
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:31,960
could be excused taking a nap was certainly preferable the next time I passed by the

257
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,000
monastery on one of my foraging trips a nun stopped her sweeping and also asked

258
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,200
what I was doing again I resented the question it felt like an intrusion

259
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:47,240
however this time I did not feel as scared again I deflected the question by

260
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:52,320
asking what she was doing she answered that she was doing extra work in Hope of

261
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:58,480
being assigned to the kitchen which was warm in the winter and always seemed to have one or two extra sweet rice cakes

262
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:05,880
in the cupboard to nibble on without saying anything I nodded and left to continue my foraging the nuns answer

263
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:14,080
resonated with me since I too liked to be warm and eating Sweet Cakes was one of my favorite activities second only to

264
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:21,519
sleeping the next time I passed the monastery another Monk asked me the same question this time I was surprised I was

265
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:29,039
not defensive or resentful of being asked however again I deflected the question back to him he explained that

266
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:36,240
he was sweeping as a spiritual discipline to help him overcome his anger later as I walked the mount and

267
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:43,440
trail with my bag of plants I felt a kinship with this monk like me he had anger but I was perplexed that he would

268
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:50,640
want to overcome it for me my anger protected me a week later I was again outside the

269
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,760
monastery watching the monastic sweep yet another Monk came up to me when he

270
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:02,240
asked what I was doing I mumbled something about collecting plants I doubt he could hear me my voice was so

271
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,840
faint but I did muster up enough strength to ask him what he was doing he

272
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:14,399
replied that he was beautifying the monastery so that others Could Be Inspired in their work of spiritual

273
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:19,440
transformation before I left him I glanced down the well swept paths and

274
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,880
realized that part of the reason I was compelled to watch the monks sweep was that they seemed to be transforming the

275
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:32,159
paths into something that made me feel peaceful the next time I stood outside

276
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:38,760
the monastery watching the monastics I was drawn to walk over to yet another nun and before she could ask me what I

277
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:44,960
was doing I asked her she looked at me with kind eyes and after what seemed

278
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:52,279
like a long but soft silence she explained that she was sweeping to be of service to all who used the monastery

279
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:58,720
and in practicing this way she hoped to find Ultimate peace as I left the mon Monastery that

280
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:05,360
day I thought her answer strange as I didn't know what she meant by service and by peace I certainly couldn't see

281
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:11,080
how these had much value for me the next time I visited the monastery

282
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:16,799
was the last time I had an unfamiliar feeling as I walked up into the

283
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:22,320
mountains it was a warm glow of gladness in anticipation of what I would

284
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:28,880
find when I arrived at the monastery I walked up to an old monk who seemed to be absorbed in his

285
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,760
sweeping I inquired what he was doing as he answered each of his words

286
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:41,720
washed over me like cleansing water me I am not doing anything my

287
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:47,960
self-consciousness was Swept Away long ago there is no eye that does

288
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:54,080
anything before I could respond he handed me the broom and walked

289
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:59,200
away I have been here ever since

290
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,279
so why are you sweeping your

291
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:20,440
path so with that we'll shift to if you have any any

292
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:31,158
questions and we have a microphone so that others canar here and we can record

293
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,039
it yeah Jim behind

294
00:31:54,279 --> 00:32:00,000
you thank you for your talk seemed very

295
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,200
instructive I'm wondering if I understood understood it correctly or

296
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:11,720
you seem to be pointing at if we sort of impose some constraints on our

297
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:17,320
thinking and and specifically probably trying to diminish hatred greed and

298
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:25,320
delusion or we obtain Freedom or it leads us to Freedom

299
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:32,039
through these constraints in a sense is that yeah you look puzzled as you say

300
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:38,559
that is that the part that you're trying to clarify well it seems pleasantly

301
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:44,919
surprising but but also it sort of makes sense but I'm just wondering if it if that's a

302
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:51,519
reasonable uh summary well I don't know if it's a summary of the whole thing but it's a um

303
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:58,159
certainly a thread that was in there is that um uh channeling our attention in

304
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:05,120
certain specific ways it feels like it might be a constraint um but uh the if

305
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,440
we do it in the particular way that's prescribed through these practices it

306
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:18,840
has the effect of opening the mind making it for more flexible and free and yeah I think that's can be

307
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:24,200
somewhat intuitive and yet you know we do wonder about it but it's clear enough

308
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,279
right that if we um at least everybody who's made it to the room I think is

309
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:35,159
that if we keep living life as just kind of following the whims of our mind we

310
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:42,799
begin to get a feel like it feeling like it may not be going anywhere in particular or at least not where we were hoping it would and so the question is

311
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:49,960
if we can put in some kind of you know is there a way that we can um tweak it

312
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:55,799
that's a technical term uh such that it um we actually reduce the constraints in

313
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:02,200
the long run so that was what I got to at the end is how we practice and that's what's represented by the monastery and

314
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:07,679
you know taking on the the path of of sweeping the path so we're you know

315
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:15,919
we're doing less we're doing we're channeling our attention in certain ways noticing body feeling mind mind and mind

316
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:21,320
States right the four foundations of mindfulness but as we do that um there's

317
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:26,520
a way in which we discover uh all the ways in which we're

318
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:32,679
limiting our own mind Mind through just habit conventional responses we

319
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:39,760
understand how things work we understand how we're bringing about a lot of the suffering that we experience in our mind

320
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:45,599
and as we let go of the the ways in which we're limiting ourselves we become

321
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:55,040
both happier and more flexible so I'm hoping that you know

322
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:01,920
by saying that in sort of a broad way way we can think of maybe examples in our own life where that's been the case

323
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,560
where actually um doing the practice has brought about some kind of shift such

324
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:14,920
that we felt looser more open and I Wonder has there been anything like that in your

325
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:22,599
practice it's a work in progress It's always a work in progress for sure um

326
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:27,839
but even something as simple as um in the Physical Realm often people find

327
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:34,440
when they start practicing that they relax you know something in the body

328
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:41,520
actually feels a little bit more relaxed why how can that be just from sitting still but if we were sitting watching TV

329
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:48,359
this wouldn't happen but if we sit and pay attention to the breath over time maybe we soften a bit that's a certain

330
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:55,200
kind of release a certain kind of opening so even

331
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,640
that yeah thank you

332
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,119
yeah over

333
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:18,280
here thank you for your talk um two things that came to my mind um it's um

334
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:23,599
nonjudge being non-judgmental yeah and um unconditional

335
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:29,640
positive regard um trying to have a that kind of

336
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:36,920
running in the background um you know I'm a teacher so um and I

337
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:42,200
believe I work in a system that is fraught with

338
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:48,040
um um inefficiency so I say what what kind of a teacher are you uh special

339
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:55,119
education special education and today I I was judgmental two times and I acted

340
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:00,720
unskillfully both times and uh um your talk helped me kind of reflect

341
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:08,920
on that um and how you know I try to use my practice as

342
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:16,359
um you know as a life tool um um a relation a

343
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:24,760
relationship tool yeah um as much as an inner um Journey definitely yeah so um

344
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:30,079
thank you for reminding me to uh attempt to stay non-judgmental

345
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:35,280
and retain positive uh unconditional positive

346
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:43,119
regard is there a term in Buddhism or is there a concept that would match that unconditional positive regard um I

347
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:48,920
suppose that's an aspect of meta okay of generally having a mind of Goodwill

348
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:55,839
toward whoever we're interacting with okay thank you yeah I think we don't

349
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:02,800
need to constrain ourselves to um I don't know unconditional positive

350
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,680
regard yeah let's just call it part of meta that's good

351
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:27,079
enough anything else yeah here's one

352
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:34,319
thank you so much for the talk and and the the closing uh story so I was sort

353
00:38:34,319 --> 00:38:42,800
of struck by how um as the the monks and nuns

354
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:49,480
progressed right it started from a very I'm sweeping to kill time before I

355
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:54,560
go to sleep right a very yeah you know self-oriented self-oriented right then

356
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:00,880
I'm you know I want to be warm then I want to help others s you know on the path and and you know make it more

357
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:06,200
beautiful for others and becomes outward looking and you know just struck by how

358
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:12,760
you at least me right you don't come into this saying I want to be of service to others right you're like no I need to

359
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:18,119
find some way to calm my mind because I'm suffering and you know I just need

360
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:24,440
to be able to you know deal with myself right but then once that calms you can

361
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:30,119
begin to think about others and you know to your point I'm a I was a professor I've been an investor

362
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:37,280
I've run companies and like every time it starts you start it's about me it's about me it's about me but at its best

363
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,599
it's about service to others and helping others and that's the only thing that ultimately you know when you talk to

364
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:49,760
people who've been successful or have reached you know some piece in what they do it's always outwardly looking nobody

365
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:55,640
says yeah I know at the end it was all about me right that never ends up being the the end of the story so anyway I

366
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:03,160
found that really an interesting aspect of of how the whole thing unfolded yeah certainly there's a shift to including a

367
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:09,520
bigger perspective what did you make of the last fellow who says uh you know there's

368
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:16,960
no one who does any sweeping anyway transcendental right yeah so this particular path I think

369
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:25,400
goes all the way all the way back yeah yeah thank you

370
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,839
if anyone has typed anything into the chat we could have one from online

371
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:46,200
you're invited online if you want to type anything in someone is watching it's just nice to include

372
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,200
everyone

373
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:22,160
it can be helpful at times on our path to um just reflect

374
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:27,640
internally why is it that I'm practicing or still practicing I don't Rec recomend

375
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:32,720
doing this like every sit or even you know every week that's that would be too

376
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:39,400
much but like maybe every year something like that um and the

377
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:46,760
reason for that is that it refines over time remember the story that I read um

378
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:52,280
and so we have to uh kind of renew that in a sense and maybe we'll discover that

379
00:41:52,280 --> 00:42:00,240
something new has emerged we have to keep you know tracking this and kind kind of when the space opens in your

380
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:08,720
practice if there's been some kind of a release there's a way in which we have to step into that space and occupy it in

381
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:14,440
order to then take the next step so I just offer that as a piece of

382
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:21,280
advice if you haven't for a while reflected on what you're doing sit down and have a session where you just allow

383
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:28,960
things to come up about why you're practicing and see if anything's different and if it is that's okay too

384
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:35,040
and if it is move into the space all right that'll be it for

385
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,760
tonight have a wonderful rest of the day
