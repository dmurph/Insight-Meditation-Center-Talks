1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,879
so hello and welcome to happy hour everyone

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,920
lovely to be with you and to practice together

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,600
so so for today's practice um

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,439
i wanted to bring in um

5
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:29,599
into our practice practice space internally and

6
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:36,880
externally um something that's really important perhaps is synonymous in some ways it's

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,840
synonymous with meta with loving i

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,440
yes that that idea that concept that way of being in the world

9
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,800
is um is generosity generosity of spirit generosity being in some way synonymous

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:04,478
with menta with loving kindness with care both for ourselves and for others

11
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:11,600
and i recently actually wrote an article on generosity how important generosity

12
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,920
is which showed up in uh i think just recently came out in the buddha dharma

13
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,000
magazine which is a lions roar magazine it's online so maybe later i'll send

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,759
the pointer to that to neil so that he can share it on the google groups

15
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,399
so you guys can see that but but many reflections

16
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:43,600
on the importance of generosity one thing is that there is this list of what's called the

17
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,720
ten perfections in buddhism the ten perfections ten beautiful qualities of

18
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,640
the heart loving kindness is one of them there is equanimity

19
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,000
there is perseverance there's patience

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,600
many beautiful qualities of the heart and guess what is number one [Music]

21
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,360
number one is generosity generosity the spirit of generosity

22
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,840
and generosity when i bring up the word let us not

23
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,239
limit ourselves to the idea oh i have to be generous i have to give

24
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,720
stuff to people it's not about that at all and really that's a sub

25
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:37,519
sub category of generosity well the shooting is not part of generosity or if you feel

26
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:46,239
like you should be generous just don't be kind to yourself instead but giving things to people is is a sub

27
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:53,680
aspect of generosity really generosity of spirit giving people the benefit of the doubt

28
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,280
giving them or giving yourself care and kind of being generous with

29
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:07,680
yourself for example when you're hurting when you're having say physical pain or emotional pain that aspect of generosity

30
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,239
is really synonymous with love with meta or to others or giving others your time

31
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,159
giving them your attention or giving them the generosity of not giving

32
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:26,560
them advice just giving them your presence just listening with kindness all of these

33
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,879
are aspects of generosity and not only is it important

34
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:39,959
interactively but as i want to point out tonight in our guided meditation

35
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:46,159
generosity can serve as a container for us to relax

36
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:52,200
into for the mind to feel its own [Music]

37
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:58,480
expansiveness its own generosity and relax with more

38
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,480
cohesion with more coherence maybe more concentration one word to use but really

39
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,799
with more um settle into ease of it's okay it's okay again

40
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,880
meta and generosity being synonymous there so that's the practically speaking that's what i'd

41
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,440
like to bring in tonight into our guided meditation this exploration of

42
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:30,400
of uh of generosity or in pali the word is donna

43
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,840
giving to ourselves others sense sitting in

44
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,120
this sense of graciousness really so

45
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:48,880
that's all i want to say to set up the space let's just practice together so

46
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,360
so sitting landing

47
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,919
in your seat i'm saying what is most generous to you

48
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:08,840
what is a generous posture right now that's most both supportive of your

49
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:16,320
body it allows your spine to be as straight as possible and yet

50
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,160
and yet it allows a sense of ease

51
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:31,120
a sense of gracious

52
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,120
largesse to your body oh dear body

53
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:44,320
ah this perspective

54
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,320
generosity to our body as we gather ourselves in

55
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,640
the sitting or even lying position in this moment before we begin

56
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:00,280
[Music] as we begin

57
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:38,080
letting go letting go is also an aspect of generosity when you release

58
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:45,680
it's the same movement of the heart same movement of the mind when you don't cling to something you release it

59
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:53,280
you let it go with ease releasing thoughts

60
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:02,240
releasing tightness tension holding in the body and the mind

61
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:10,360
same practice same movement of the heart as generosity

62
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:38,240
i'm feeling the generosity of the earth of the seed of this chair or cushion

63
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:45,080
holding you supporting your weight

64
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:52,479
ah accepting the generosity and the gesture of releasing your weight completely

65
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,360
releasing your weight

66
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,400
arm to the chair the cushion to the earth

67
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:59,279
and letting awareness connect with the breath this generosity of the breath that

68
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:08,240
fills the lungs fills the body with oxygen as if it's a gift being received from

69
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,519
the universe this breath

70
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,880
a gift every moment

71
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,480
and every time you notice the mind is wondering perhaps

72
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,760
lost in thought it's okay can you be generous to yourself

73
00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:01,839
generous to your mind this in this moment when you realize

74
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,839
you've been lost such an important moment to be generous

75
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:16,839
it's okay it's okay we can release we can relate smilingly

76
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,800
as if we're returning a gift

77
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:29,600
to the universe thank you this thought that has come up i didn't choose it it just came up

78
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:37,360
i'll release it back release it back into the mystery

79
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:47,800
right where it came from no fuss no judgment

80
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:38,880
releasing releasing into gentle generosity for yourself

81
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,839
trusting there is generosity of course there is

82
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,639
in your heart and mind

83
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,839
and receiving the generosity with each breath

84
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,399
each in-breath in each out breath

85
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,120
letting each breath

86
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:23,440
perceived received imbue imbue the body the heart the mind

87
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,560
with the goodness of generosity

88
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:14,639
again every time you may find your mind wandering can you be generous to yourself

89
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:26,160
this is what minds do this is what's happening right now or maybe you're sleepy

90
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:33,839
can you be generous and kind yet bring in more energy

91
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:40,320
maybe deeper breaths maybe sit up a little more straight

92
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,040
to support yourself

93
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,919
i'd like to invite you to consider now

94
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:14,798
you're sitting you're sitting in a container of generosity this whole body is held

95
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:25,280
an interweaving interconnected world supported by so much generosity yours

96
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:33,840
and others offering our work our heart our efforts

97
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,559
all of us

98
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,840
through the generous work of so many people who have come before us

99
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,840
their dedication because they cared so much

100
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,600
so many things in their lives as possible it's available

101
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,880
people who supported us who reared us

102
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,279
family friends

103
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,440
strangers

104
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,640
and maybe someone comes to your mind

105
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:02,880
has been particularly generous in your life

106
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:09,360
to you or maybe not to you specifically but when you think of generosity they come

107
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:15,520
up as someone whom you relate to

108
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:24,919
as an example someone who exemplifies generosity of spirit

109
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:33,520
maybe giving the benefit of doubt or sharing their time their attention or

110
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:40,320
maybe their affection generously

111
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:48,960
letting your heart your breath connect with this being in your mind's eye with their goodness

112
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,720
feeling nourished that they exist or they've existed

113
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:05,400
it could be someone you know personally or an archetypal person you've heard of

114
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:15,600
say could be mother teresa with her generosity of actions in the world

115
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,960
see who works for you

116
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:36,480
as if with each breath you were feeling into appreciating the goodness of this

117
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,919
being's generosity awakening yours

118
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:12,880
maybe you consider the gifts you have received

119
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,120
from this being if you know them personally

120
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,600
the kindnesses you've received

121
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,399
the sense of gratitude

122
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,159
which helps you feel the abundance of your own heart

123
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:48,600
and giving to yourself and others

124
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:04,360
feeling feeling the risk receptivity the receiving difference

125
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,159
c

126
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:21,600
notice if your body relaxes if it melts a bit

127
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:27,200
when you consider the gifts you've received the kindness that you're held in

128
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,200
kindness

129
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,760
no need for feeling undeserving or anything like that

130
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,320
you're a child of the universe we are

131
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:54,240
all deserving of kindness generosity good will

132
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,840
let your heart receive

133
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:06,960
the memory of the kindnesses the generosities

134
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,960
that have been bestowed upon you

135

all of a sudden became yours as if you're stepping into the shoes

140
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:09,840
looking at your own life through the gaze of kindness generosity

141
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,760
and also to others

142

145
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,039
with each breath connecting to generosity

146
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,880

150
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,840
to be generous to ourselves and others

151
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:07,200
maybe you've had teachers who've been generous to you

152
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:18,000
feeling into sharing [Music] their generosity

153
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,559
outward receiving giving

circle of generosity

155
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:56,480
and if judgments arise internally externally can you be

156
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,840
generous see what happens

157
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:09,679
when you receive when you meet the judgments with generosity

158
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,600
instead of believing them

159
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,960
generosity of spirit largesse of spirit

160
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:43,200

162
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,720
and it can become available at well

163
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:04,679
expanding expanding through cultivation

164
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,720
this

165
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,200
for the last moments of this practice period

thank you that today was your generosity dharma talk today was my generosity experience day

188
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,599
on sunday night i had lost all of my sensory motor functions

189
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:28,880
temporarily to meniere's disease and had been a tough week dealing with that

190
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:37,119
afterwards day by day until last night i was losing i was back in contact but not happy and

191
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:42,880
not in any way able to feel generous in any way to myself or to anyone else and

192
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:49,040
i went to bed thinking you know i just don't have that touch of happiness in my

193
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:56,880
life anymore and i awaken for some reason i awakened fully back in touch with myself there i

194
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:03,440
was there was my body functioning not only functioning but happy

195
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:09,359
and i meditated and i went did as i am one to do go online

196
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:14,960
and there met immediately a note thanking me for the generosity that i

197
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:22,480
had given to my daughter and then from the church that where she where i had taken her as a child where

198
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:29,040
she wanted me to give the money from both of them from my generosity which i had remember

199
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,079
i had given and then i told my closest mindfulness

200
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:39,359
friend anna who knew you through the retreat as i did

201
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:45,920
and she was generous in her acceptance of me i can't believe that all that was

202
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:51,680
happening to me today and then i see a note on social media from a woman who

203
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:58,720
had given me the experience of my lifetime taking me underwater to be able to visit an

204
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,920
octopus in his den at a safe distance where i didn't threaten the octopus and

205
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,040
there was a note from her saying she in belize is beginning a new beginning

206
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:15,040
shelter for all the animals it sounds like yeah and you gave me that and then

221
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:53,920

222
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:59,280
um present oh there's one question that just came

223
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,839
i feel clinging to the person who is generous how to be generous but not

224
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:10,480
clinging um you feel clinging to the person who is

225
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:16,800
generous um i need to i guess how to be generous but

226
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:23,359
not a little unsure about the fullness of the question i think there's more you

227
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:28,960
mean here if you wanted to raise your hand or if you wanted to type more because like i'm

228
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:35,280
not there two different things you're asking here someone's clinging to the person who's generous and then

229
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,160
like me who's generous or another person legit

230
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:48,040
if you feel like if you feel like i'm muting and sharing your welcome where you can just type

231
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,200
okay since i'm not seeing anything come through yet

232
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:10,560
just pause one more moment while i give the instructions for the breakout room so

233
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:17,359
so for the breakout rooms again as always we um

234
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:23,760
speak please speak from our your own experience only your own experience not

235
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:30,160
managing or asking probing questions of others just let them have their own experience you

236
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:37,280
have your own experience and so what you're offering could be silence you could be offering your presence holding

237
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,800
holding others and you offer one nugget just one

238
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:50,240
brief relative nugget and then the next person will offer a nugget about your experience of this practice

239
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:57,760
period we have and the next person next person will go around tonight we'll go who's whoever has the

240
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:03,040
birthday closest to january 1st will speak first

241
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:08,800
just to mix it up a little bit and have fun with generosity as if you

242
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:13,920
were the generosity you're holding others with your generosity and others

243
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,520
were and um others are holding you see what it feels like to take the practice off

244
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:24,560
the cushion into uh into the small groups into

245
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:32,800
this interacting with others so so i will create the rooms now

246
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:39,040
and um and let's see what do i want to say um i

247
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:45,520
think that's it creating the rooms take care of yourself take care of

248
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:52,880
others here you go okay welcome back everyone the rooms are

249
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:58,640
closed and we have just about a couple minutes any reflections what came up in

250
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:05,280
the groups um you can raise your hand you can type in chat or if you have any

251
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:12,000
questions from before can still follow up still have that one question i didn't answer but i

252
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:19,560
can't quite decode it so any reflections

253
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:34,880
neil so we talked in the group

254
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:41,280
right about how you know generosity seemed to just make more generosity

255
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:47,200
right someone else mentioned it i know i felt it too you know i felt more generous to the world and

256
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:52,720
you know by the end i was like oh gosh so many people have been so generous to me you know and

257
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:58,319
you know i mean that certainly wasn't how i went into this meditation you know so it was just sort of

258
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:04,480
interesting you know the way it it yeah right it was like like a a

259
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:10,800
a a skillful benevolent um positive cycle

260
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:17,920
yeah yeah beautiful skillful benevolent positive cycle i

261
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:24,640
love it i love it yeah it's another word that just came up which is not as elegant as what you said

262
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,839
it is kind of the snowball effect you start to realize oh wow yeah this

263
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:37,040
is bigger than i realized and in in a in a beautiful way so lovely thanks for

264
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:43,359
sharing that neil thank you that's just lovely yeah especially they didn't of course as

265
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:50,400
you said come in this evening with that intention but realizing wow so many people have been so generous to me what

266
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:56,480
a beautiful feeling for us to take into the weekend together or into the day or

267
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:02,640
month and year and lives so many people have been so generous to us and it opens

268
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:10,720
our heart to generosity to give back to to share our gifts with with them that's certainly how i feel

269
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:16,960
yeah so yeah oh i see the question came through let's

270
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:22,880
say i meant when there is a sense of lack i tend to be claiming oh yes of course

271
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,400
of course yeah when there is a sense of lack so the the the

272
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,599
what i suggest there to actually notice how much you have how much you

273
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:40,640
have received and how much you really have sense of gratitude um really supports generosity and i make that

274
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:46,720
point in the article i wrote so i'll i'll ask neil generously to send that to

275
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:53,440
you and on the google group so thank you all thank you for your generosity in showing up and supporting

276
00:46:53,440 --> 00:47:00,880
yourself supporting others may all beings be happy may all things be free
