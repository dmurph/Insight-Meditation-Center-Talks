134
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:27,840
this week we have been exploring the mind's body or

135
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:33,919
the energy body some aspects of it there's so much more to explore so much

136
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:39,919
more to explore a lifetime the worth of uh practice is the

137
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:47,519
material to explore and yet and yet we've been exploring um them this week

138
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,640
together and um today i like to bring it all

139
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,440
together and also share some more teachings

140
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,240
so so as we started at the beginning of the

141
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,839
week with with the intention setting our intention

142
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:17,679
why are we exploring this and anguttara nikaya 4 45 the buddha said

143
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:23,839
the end of the world can never be reached by walking however without having reached the

144
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:28,878
world's end there is no release from suffering

145
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:36,398
i declare that it is this that it is in this fathom-long body

146
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:43,118
with its perceptions and thoughts that there is the world the origin of the world the cessation of

147
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:49,919
the world and the path leading to the cessation of the world so our our exploration of

148
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:55,358
course the body energy body is

149
00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:00,720
for the purpose of awakening

150
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:07,119
path leading to awakening so it's not just fun and games even though

151
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:14,320
at times it might be it might appear so especially with some of the teachings i shared today which might seem sound a

152
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,200
little more esoteric but actually it's what naturally arises

153
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:24,720
then we explored together

154
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,000
the different locations of paying attention to the breath on on tuesday we

155
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,640
did that at the um abdomen in the abdomen chest and

156
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:42,160
nostrils and the pros and cons of each of those especially with

157
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:48,320
relationship to the hindrances on wednesday we explored a different way

158
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:54,560
of paying attention that that

159
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:00,560
can actually lead to insight uh to not self anata

160
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:06,400
that in this and we talked about the bahia sutra in the sensed only the

161
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:12,160
sensed only the sensed being in this sensation only

162
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:18,480
the sensation being known in and of itself in the body there's no self needed it's

163
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,760
and again there's so many layers layers to that teaching if you feel like you've

164
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:30,480
you've got it great and yet know that there's so many more layers to still know and explore

165
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:37,520
yesterday thursday we explored a sense of verticality in the energy body

166
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:43,280
as well as uh this bellowing in the orb and and um

167
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,200
spaciousness body without boundaries completely expanded and spacious

168
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,560
and how that might feel and also how that can be a support for for practice

169
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:00,480
of meta for pervading kindness and just really both physically

170
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:07,200
connecting to the heart can be a lovely practice and today in our practice in the guided

171
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:13,280
meditation i led us through a body scan and if you noticed often body scans

172
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:20,000
typically start from the feet or the head ends of the body but actually i think it's even though yes those are the

173
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:26,160
ends of the body seems you know makes sense and yet hands feel so much more sensation in our

174
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:33,119
brain there is a lot more area devoted to sensations of the hands so it makes more

175
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:38,400
sense actually with respect to neuroscience and knowing what we know about our bodies to start with the hands

176
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:44,640
to really settle the sensations of the hands and then move to the rest of the body

177
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:50,880
so just a note there and um and many many

178
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:57,760
um ways to do body scan many uh uh gifts that arise from it and

179
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,960
something that uh i was hoping would arise today with a

180
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,560
sense of stability sensing these sensations the groundedness of the mind

181
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,680
in the body and again different way of relating to the body this mind's body

182
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:19,040
this energy body i was hoping that the andy would feel um

183
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:25,599
you would sense wow so much sensations here and their sense of calm

184
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:31,920
a different shift it's hard often hard to put these in words but but i'll just leave that for your own

185
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:38,880
experience um exploration there's so much to explore here but one thing i do want to say in terms

186
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,720
of the teaching i want to add today is that

187
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:50,640
um well with with mindfulness of the body especially

188
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:55,680
in different ways that when paying attention um

189
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:01,440
and also different practices um samadhi concentration

190
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:08,640
can arise the sense of really the mind calming collecting

191
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:14,640
becoming stable stabilized and also what are called

192
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:22,880
um uh jonic factors can arise so the particular genic factor

193
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,560
and their five genic factors i think i've talked about them before here when i've subbed

194
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:36,480
for gail before when i talked about concentration for the whole week but today i want to talk specifically about

195
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:43,200
the the factor of what's called pt or rapture because that's really one way

196
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,720
that the energy body the shifts and movements in the energy body really show up

197
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,920
and a lot of times for practitioners when pt arises pt

198
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:01,359
translated both as rapture and also as joy there are many different aspects to it

199
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:07,920
when a rapture these the and rapture can show up pt let me just call it peach because

200
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:14,160
there's so many different ways that it can express and practitioners often get surprised like

201
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:20,640
whoa what is that and that's really the energy body or the mind's body shifting

202
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:26,560
moving different ways as if energy channels are opening

203
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:32,400
so gosh very little time left but very briefly there are five different types

204
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,520
of pt and these these are from the visudi maga uh path of purification

205
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:43,760
teachings so this is a practice manual a thousand pages long

206
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:51,920
and deep the first one is minor rapture which um can feel like hair standing on

207
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:58,240
end you might have had that experience of meditation um and

208
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:06,160
or or maybe tears flowing and minor rapture actually occurs for some

209
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,359
not all practitioners could happen in rare occasions some

210
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:16,480
people might experience it regularly and and some not experience it at all

211
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:25,680
the second type is called momentary pt and this can feel like a um like

212
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:31,520
um insects crawling on on your on your body and and i know that when i was a

213
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:37,760
beginning meditator i would open my eyes and look like wait something crawling no nothing and over time i realized oh

214
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:43,760
whenever that happens it means my mind is getting really really settled oh then

215
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:50,880
i would never i would open my eyes it's like yeah that's what that means so so it could feel like that it can feel like

216
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:57,440
uh maybe something cobwebs brushing your face or or

217
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,680
body jerks jolts movements of the body that are not

218
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:10,240
intentional like wow what is happening and sometimes practitioners get spooked out if this ever happens to you do not

219
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:16,720
get spooked out it's just energy body uh opening and moving and it will go through it will be a phase

220
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:24,240
the channels will open and then they will settle again so just there's so much about this body we don't know so

221
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,960
uh the third type is called

222
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:34,640
showering or flood it's like a showering uh pt

223
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:40,640
and it's a stronger it's like it can be a stronger shock of electricity sometimes it can feel like wow

224
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:45,680
electricity bright lights like bursting and bursting in the body

225
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:51,839
electricity way or or waves breaking on the shore and also sometimes it could be a lot of

226
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:57,440
movement and people feel like they're being rocked back and forth repeatedly being

227
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:04,000
tossed about and sometimes people can consider this uh blissful

228
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,440
and not and sometimes not blissful actually not pleasant like okay enough already

229
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:16,319
and again just letting it pass um the fourth type is uplifting joy or

230
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:22,640
transporting uh transporting pt which the mind can feel the body feels fluffy

231
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:29,920
light as if you're walking on air you um and supposedly this is how yogis

232
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,119
levitate i haven't experienced or witnessed that but supposedly this is this is the

233
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:41,839
energy body that supports that but but you can actually and i've experienced a lot of lightness just like walking on

234
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:47,440
clouds this body is fluff so again different aspects of the energy body and the last

235
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,800
one is um all pervading pt

236
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,240
which the sutas talk about especially with respect to the third genre

237
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:04,560
which is pervading and this one is actually this this pt this fifth kind is

238
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:09,680
is very blissful and it's just it's

239
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:16,160
joy bliss radiating all over the body it's a an extra ecstatic feeling

240
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:21,920
um that doesn't leave any part any cell of your body untouched just completely

241
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:28,160
drenched in in this the sense of of of of

242
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:33,839
of bliss and joy of this kind of energy body shifting and moving so

243
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:39,680
so i wanted to share these with you just in case they come up but but but also don't want to share these with you to

244
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:45,359
bring any sense of wanting because like i want to experience that well

245
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:50,800
if you practice give your heart to the practice dedicatedly end and

246
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:56,560
they will arise if they need to arise it's not about fun and games it's about

247
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:02,880
awakening and being kinder being more generous being more

248
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:10,640
more wise for our own benefit and others and these are some aspects that can come up in our practice

249
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:15,759
