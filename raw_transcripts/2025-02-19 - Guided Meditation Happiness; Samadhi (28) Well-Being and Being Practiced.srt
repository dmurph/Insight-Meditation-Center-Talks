1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,799
and welcome and here

2
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:12,639
we're middle of a series on samadi which is H samadi refers to a

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,160
state of being more than it does to a particular

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,840
practice practices can lead to this state

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:31,200
and so yesterday I went to uh have my teeth

6
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:38,800
cleaned and the hygienist uh took very nice care of me and got me comfortable

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,719
in the dentist chair and and uh and it's soon enough I would

8
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:52,440
closed my eyes and I opened and closed them as needed for her work but there

9
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,480
was something very uh wonderful about her care the way that she tended to me

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,559
and gently touched my my body to make it comfortable or

11
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:11,240
talk to me what she was doing and and uh and just that she was attending to me in

12
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:20,680
such a nice way and so as I was laying there my body started to feel relaxed

13
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:26,920
calm it started to have a tingling and warmth kind of through my body kind of a

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:33,040
nice warm contented feeling that spread through my

15
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:40,079
body and um I wouldn't say it was dramatic but it was quite Pleasant enough that part of the reason I closed

16
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,159
my eyes is just stay with that feeling that was going on and it was a feeling

17
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:52,520
of contentment nothing was needed uh just being just being alive was enough just being present here in

18
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:58,280
this uh situation and um and there certainly was

19
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:04,880
attention I put to my mouth my teeth to what was going on but it felt holistic

20
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,440
it felt like it I was not fixating attention on concerns about what she was

21
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:17,360
doing or to track every slightest little movement um I was there present in a

22
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,480
nice way but it was also there at the same time a diffuse attention a diffuse

23
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:31,519
presence through my body and this diffuse contentment of just lying there and uh nothing need to

24
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,920
happen so this is a state and uh as we come into

25
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:44,599
meditation um sometimes uh we're looking for a state of being a state of

26
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:50,239
Simplicity where which is there in a diffuse way to support us to provide a

27
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:56,640
kind of contentment or ease so that we're not thinking of meditation and

28
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,280
thinking about um somebody as a mental

29
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:09,080
exercise an exercise of somehow tightening up the attention the brain

30
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:16,239
the mind to really get to work now and focus on something um it's uh has a lot to do

31
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:23,560
about relaxing and letting go settling in and allowing some deeper sense of

32
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:30,080
maybe contentment sense of well-being sense of comfort sense of safety perhaps

33
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,200
to kind of course through us or vibrate or flow through us so that when we close

34
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:42,959
our eyes and metaphorically when we settle into the practice there's something there supporting us holding us

35
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,439
where in a sense just being alive is enough we don't have to do the

36
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:54,239
meditation practice we could offer uh ourselves to the practice we

37
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,760
can offer attention incl be inclusive of breathing the rhythm of breathing that

38
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:06,159
to could be the center of attention but um it's not like a uh a tight one it's a

39
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:15,239
settling stabilizing there in this field when I uh first started meditating

40
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,519
regularly twice a day in college uh twice a week I would go to a evening

41
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,440
sitting group in someone's uh house and I would bike there and after some months

42
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,639
of biking there I discovered that I started to to feel uh that as I biked

43
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,320
there as I approached the house that my body was already starting to feel kind

44
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:46,240
of this contented feeling this sense of gathering sense of being present sense of just being here is enough and so by

45
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:53,199
the time I sat down sitting down was a homecoming now here this is good that

46
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,919
could not happen if I sat down as if it was an assignment as if it was okay now

47
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:04,240
I have to get serious I about meditating and re in my mind and focus my mind and

48
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:11,560
all kinds of things so with that introduction perhaps uh there's

49
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,759
something that in your life your experience that is similar to this maybe

50
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:23,479
as a child uh there was some cozy place you would curl yourself up and be safe

51
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:29,000
and contented um that uh that maybe is a

52
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,840
reference point for a way of being a state state of being that

53
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:40,560
is the approach state for somebody it's it's it's the kind of

54
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,680
almost not doing anything um there's a not doing as we

55
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:53,319
allow something else to flow and open within us and there's a gentle doing

56
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:58,800
just a little bit more just just more enough more than nothing that keeps us

57
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,840
here so to assume a meditation

58
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:12,039
posture and for those of you who have done this often maybe just the posture is familiar

59
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:18,360
as [Music] home and maybe the care that you can

60
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:25,440
give to yourself to feel into your posture to see what small adjustments

61
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,560
you can make to make it more comfortable and more align

62
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:42,000
mind or maybe even it feels good that you're attending to yourself to your own

63
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:55,160
well-being and then with a posture of meditation that's right for

64
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:02,479
you to now simply check in just feel the familiarity of the

65
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:09,160
meditation posture see if there's anything just in the sitting here

66
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,560
now which is enough maybe you're still easily

67
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:22,639
distracted and cut up in thoughts but even so is there something about here and now in this

68
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:30,039
body that has a nice feeling to it a contentment a coming home

69
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:37,879
maybe you haven't noticed but maybe right now here and now in the place you're

70
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:44,560
in you're safe maybe you're warm

71
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:55,199
enough and with the eyes gently closed as a way that you're caring for

72
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,960
yourself doing something good you

73
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:08,560
gently without a lot of force taking some deeper

74
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,879
inhales and relaxing exhales

75
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:46,760
and then letting your breathing return to normal and now feel into your

76
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,600
body and how is it to be present in your body after those few big deeper breaths

77
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,839
and relaxing

78
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:07,720
if you allow your attention to be broad is there any

79
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,920
broad suus of feelings of well-being in

80
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,600
your body not

81
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,959
dramatic maybe they even coexist with whatever challenges you're

82
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:31,360
feeling but maybe there's a little s sense of calm now settling in

83
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,399
maybe a small amount of pleasure just being here in your

84
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,480
body maybe a

85
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:54,560
relief maybe a contentment a

86
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:05,200
comfort that is not located in any one place doesn't have a center in you maybe

87
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:13,160
but it's diffusive pervades some part of your

88
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:33,240
body and is there some way that it can feel

89
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,120
good to sit here without

90
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,240
meditating without doing anything except

91
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:53,880
maybe gently lovingly letting go of doing if you're thinking that's a

92
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:03,279
doing if you're trying to change something or Attain something that's a

93
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:17,560
doing not doing is there any feelings here and

94
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:25,320
now that just to be present just to be here is enough

95
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:42,839
not doing anything and allowing whatever arises in your

96
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:49,200
experience to come to

97
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:01,279
you to be to occur within some broad

98
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:10,279
State that's spacious or open contented

99
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:39,320
and then to be aware of breathing and is with breathing being in

100
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:45,720
the center of it all but not focusing on the

101
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,959
breath maybe almost as

102
00:12:52,880 --> 00:13:01,880
if the sensations of breathing and awareness meet each

103
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:07,639
other they meet halfway

104
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,320
each receiving the

105
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:29,519
other almost like a warm sunlight

106
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:36,480
and you receiving each other as the sun warms you

107
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,320
up to experience the rhythm of

108
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,480
breathing where the sensations of breathing

109
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:08,279
have both a Clarity to themselves but also a diffuseness

110
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:15,079
as they are part of the wider field

111
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,880
state that has some pleasure

112
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,920
contentment maybe even some

113
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
happiness

114
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

115
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

116
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

117
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

118
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
for

119
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,880
e for

120
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:28,919
noticing if the if there's any broader state of being

121
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:37,799
that is Pleasant enjoyable nice comforting for

122
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,870
you maybe it's a bit of [Music]

123
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:53,080
calm some form of well-being

124
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:01,280
contentment and if there is such a wider State

125
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,280
however subtle it might

126
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:14,600
feel relax into it so that it's almost as if that state is doing the

127
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:29,280
meditation so the Mind rather than working at meditation

128
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:35,879
feels that it it's can relax into the

129
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:44,679
state almost as if the mind and the effort of the Mind joins the broader

130
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:48,880
state that spreads through your

131
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,639
body it is gently animated

132
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,440
by the rhythm of breathing in the

133
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
body

134
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

135
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

136
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

137
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

138
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,480
e e

139
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

140
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,360
e for

141
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:04,080
and as we come to to the end of this sitting taking some time

142
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:10,799
here to feel or sense whatever way that you've become

143
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:17,279
more comfortable or more

144
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,360
settled calmer

145
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:37,679
is there some way that some of you is little more contented just to be

146
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:50,080
present and is there any way that there is

147
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,600
some something in the mind the body the

148
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:02,120
heart that you could say has a is

149
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,320
Happy some form of well-being that feels settled and

150
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,398
contented or

151
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:18,600
calm that maybe is effusive through parts of your

152
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,600
body

153
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,840
that feels nice to surrender

154
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:41,080
to surrender into the feeling of

155
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:53,919
well-being that's more a state of being than something you're

156
00:27:53,919 --> 00:28:00,720
doing what you do is surrender to it settle into

157
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:07,039
it open into whatever subtle or not so subtle sense

158
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:13,960
of well-being happiness is here

159
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:22,760
now or peace or spaciousness

160
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:41,080
and then if there's any way that you feel better now than you did at the

161
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:48,559
beginning of the meditation imagine that better imagine

162
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:56,360
that good feeling S A well-being is something you

163
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:03,279
can replicate and offer to

164
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,399
others imagine that you

165
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:15,399
could simply wish for others to feel it and it would spread into

166
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:19,480
them as it stays with

167
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:28,159
you that your own sense of well-being

168
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:36,559
is something that can spread out across the land radiate from you in all

169
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:45,120
directions so that your wish for other people's

170
00:29:52,880 --> 00:30:01,399
well-being feels like a very satisfying important thing to do to wish people

171
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,640
well may all beings be

172
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:15,279
happy may all beings be

173
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:23,320
safe may all beings be

174
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,960
peaceful may all beings be free

175
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:41,039
and as I go through the day today may I

176
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:53,240
remember I'm capable of well-being myself I'm capable of being

177
00:30:53,880 --> 00:31:02,399
happy may I stay close to it so I can offer it to

178
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:15,469
[Music]

179
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,880
others thank

180
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,919
you e

181
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:09,880
so hello and welcome to this series on samadi delighted to be able to share

182
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:15,440
this topic in this slow way that we're doing it and uh we' been doing it now

183
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:23,519
for a few weeks and so as we're going deeper into it um please always remember

184
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:29,840
that it's good to start restart as a beginner whenever necessary

185
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:35,080
sometimes the art of meditation is to know when is it right time for that we

186
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:42,240
have to practice we have to apply ourselves in some way and when it's time to not apply ourselves but be more

187
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:50,440
receptive to be more allowing to um to in in a sense to rather than do doing

188
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:56,919
the practice uh when we are being practiced when rather than doing the

189
00:32:56,919 --> 00:33:02,840
walking on walk through the airport here in San Francisco you are now stepping

190
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:08,559
onto the conveyor belt that carries you um horizontally through the

191
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:17,279
corridor and you can stop walking you're carry it along and um so it the the nature of our

192
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:23,600
practice changes over time and at some point and this is one of the nice things about practicing

193
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,960
regularly for some time is that some of the ways in which we are practice some

194
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,840
of the ways that things are familiar and a homecoming and and the good feeling of

195
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:40,000
I'm I'm back now in a place I'm really comfortable in that that begins to open

196
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,159
up a sense of deeper Comfort a deeper feeling of the practice is doing me

197
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:50,919
meditation is doing me rather than I'm responsible for every every single little thing that happens in

198
00:33:50,919 --> 00:33:58,159
meditation and um and so to develop kind of a meditating meditator body which

199
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:04,760
means that it's such a familiar and comfortable and nice place to be that we

200
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:12,320
feel like we're it's doing Us in some way it's nice to settle into it and we can let go and relax and that takes a

201
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:18,240
while to develop and it's really worthwhile finding it and sometimes slowly over

202
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,720
time we begin to the body adjusts and changes and we find our

203
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:30,040
way and so at some point as we practice uh there comes a phase of practice when

204
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:35,760
we're before entering into this state of being called samadi that we're beginning

205
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,839
to approach it and classically it's called access concentration access Samar

206
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:48,000
I like to call it um approach the approach the approaching sumati stage

207
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,878
and uh this last summer I went back to um my hometown in Bergen

208
00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:00,800
Norway and um being driven from the airport back into in into the middle of

209
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:07,079
town where it's such a you know home place for me uh something very cozy

210
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:13,320
began happening in my body and felt very contented and and satisfied and like

211
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,720
something like just being just being here was enough just being in this Mo as

212
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:24,680
I moved got closer and closer um something began to open inside something

213
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:32,200
began feeling uh confident comforted and home and safe something uh just

214
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:38,520
approaching it and uh in the course of the days I was there I would come and go out of the

215
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:44,880
center of town and and each time I came towards the center I remember having this feeling or going visiting the

216
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:51,839
places where I had lived growing up and just oh it felt so good to um to even

217
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:57,920
approach it be there and so this approaching approaching uh where We

218
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:04,640
Begin feeling that uh we're not necess we're not the only one practicing our body is

219
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:12,720
practicing we're being practiced there's a sense of a state of being that's a little bit seus and Broad that feels

220
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:18,359
like it's a uh it's inclusive it's unifying it's holding everything of who

221
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:24,079
we are uh in its broad uh kind of bubble

222
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:33,079
of pleasure well-being Delight confidence calm

223
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:38,720
contentment peace spaciousness I offer all these words not

224
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,839
because any single one of them is right but rather that this approaching this

225
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:49,160
feeling of rightness this feeling of of that it feels like real this is really

226
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:54,640
good to be here in such a way I don't have to keep practicing I'm being

227
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:00,480
practiced uh it's almost like um uh a state of being where just to be

228
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:06,960
alive is enough and so the idea that we're the ones in the control tower engineering

229
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:13,359
the practice making the practice work shifts begins shifting as something else

230
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:19,440
now begins to be suus pervasive through the body through parts of the body maybe

231
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:27,560
the Torso maybe the front of the chest maybe down the arms uh maybe in the face or in the hand

232
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:36,560
hands or uh some place in the body that starts kind of maybe vibrate maybe glow

233
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:43,000
maybe feel more open maybe parts of the body in a very contented way just feel

234
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,720
like they disappear like there's no resistance there's nothing almost nothing there because it just become so

235
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:56,319
peaceful in that part of the body and um and so some of this will

236
00:37:56,319 --> 00:38:02,880
feel like just very nice pleasure some of it will feel like a joy

237
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:09,520
Delight that begins welding up some of it can feel like a very contented sense

238
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,880
of or satisfying feeling of happiness and

239
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:23,160
um that uh that we're just here and then what I talked about Monday this um uh

240
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:30,480
rhythm of applying attention and staying and resting and kind of settling again

241
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:37,200
and resting kind of like you know as I keep saying petting the cat and the pat purs

242
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:44,920
it's very nice and it's very comforting for the cat pet you're just doing this nice thing nice thing and it's almost

243
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:52,200
unselfconscious it's not trying to um provide the oneself or the cat with a

244
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:58,480
highest uh peak of human ecstasy and it just kind of just contented feeling

245
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,760
happy to be there so the same way with the the applying attention into the

246
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:10,319
middle of all this sense of wellbe with the breathing and the breathing is clear

247
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:17,040
enough it's kind of at the center of it but it's now begins to be feel F

248
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:23,800
feeling like this wider state is somehow the context of attention a Contex

249
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:29,640
context of awareness like awareness is Contin continuous with the state of

250
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:36,920
being as opposed to awareness uh being created and engineered from the

251
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:43,040
mind uh awareness becomes some maybe for sometimes becomes a diffusive or

252
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:49,680
diffusive feeling that it's more like a more like a diffusive feeling through the

253
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:55,160
body and um uh and maybe if you don't want to call it awareness that's okay

254
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:00,880
but it's kind of like the awar the feeling suus a feeling of well-being now

255
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,319
now pervades um our or influences or shapes

256
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:13,400
or or informs how we're aware how we're mindful how we're knowing the experience

257
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:20,800
we're knowing it now in a in an easy relaxed easygoing way and staying there

258
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:27,880
and um and and then so the art of meditation now samadi is to know how much effort to

259
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:33,720
make now when the mind is really distracted and really spinning out um

260
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:39,599
doing kind of a relaxed open peaceful calm awareness is not going to work we

261
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:47,520
want to practice the way with the amount of effort we put into practice uh is measured a little bit by

262
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,760
uh if we don't do it the alternative is worse so we have to do just enough that

263
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:59,480
it's a better than the alternative just enough to be present in an easy way way and then slowly things

264
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:05,240
settle in and we develop further and for further and as this we get into this

265
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:11,520
approach phase of practice um uh the amount of effort we have to make in some

266
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:16,720
ways diminishes there's less self there's less idea of attainment it's

267
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,040
almost like I don't doesn't matter if I go into samama it doesn't matter how

268
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:27,319
concentrated I get it doesn't matter if I attain anything or it what matter

269
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:34,319
matters is that just so good to lay there and be there in this contented way and um sometimes when I take a nap in

270
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:43,079
the afternoon uh I have I feel refreshed when I take a 15 20 minute nap but then

271
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:50,040
um sometimes I have no desire to get up from the bed uh I just feel so contented

272
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:55,200
and happy that just to be there and breathing and being alive feels like

273
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:00,240
it's enough it's good and there's no idea of attaining anything or proving

274
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:05,319
myself or having something something to show for myself or no idea of

275
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:11,960
nonattainment of getting away from anything just there so

276
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:17,319
um so to uh this approach St stage of

277
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:24,599
Fadi um is a uh is a time there come is it is when it comes to time when there

278
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:30,680
starts to be a shift between us practicing and being practicing us kind

279
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:38,960
of doing the focus and somehow feeling the awareness or the focus or the presence that we have is easy to do it's

280
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:46,800
almost like and there's some momentum happening something is holding us something is uh supporting us so that

281
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,839
practice is it feels more like it's being done from the inside out like

282
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:59,960
we're being carried now we're being supported now something is gathered something is unifying something is

283
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:05,280
holding it all so I apologize to offer all these

284
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:11,200
words BEC but I do that because no single word is going to work for

285
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:17,319
everyone and uh and some of this is very personal and so what I'm trying to offer

286
00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:22,359
here is offer you a little bit of the map so that if there's better words for

287
00:43:22,359 --> 00:43:28,599
you to describe how it is that um uh

288
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:35,960
uh then um please please go along with that but now we're at the approach

289
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:42,640
phase so um um so I hope that uh this

290
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:48,960
teaching uh even if it you don't exactly follow it or understand it um maybe it

291
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,559
brings you a kind of delight and confidence that this practice is good

292
00:43:54,559 --> 00:44:01,440
and uh and it's good to be part of it knowing that there's a wonderful um Map There's a wonderful

293
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:07,160
territory there's a wonderful life to move into and be part of in this

294
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:13,680
practice of meditation so thank you
