00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,940
hello and welcome

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:15,120
and here on Friday those of you been following these 7 A.M weekday sittings

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,600
for some time but recognize that often there's a unfolding a

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,880
pattern of kind of going more going deeper or

5
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,160
um by Friday kind of Step by Step taking a

6
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:41,700
step deeper deeper over the five days and today um

7
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,760
the simile that's going to be to I'll talk about later is um

8
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,920
very simple simile that on the surface is

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:01,860
just seems very ordinary and it's a simile for full Awakening

10
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:08,939
and so I want to highlight the ordinariness of it so when we do this meditation maybe

11
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:15,720
there can be for you um an emphasis on

12
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,540
seeing clearly what is obvious

13
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:29,939
what is ordinary here and in that seeing the ordinariness of everything

14
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:37,259
maybe something releases for you something relaxes the searching the wanting the not

15
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,360
wanting the fixing they're trying to understand

16
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,479
trying to have something special trying to recover some state of

17
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:55,200
meditation that you used to have just very simply a simple being with

18
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,780
what is so the simile is a person standing on the edge of a

19
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:07,500
lake the lake is very clear clearer than clear just

20
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,860
maybe so clear that you almost don't even know there's water there

21
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:21,840
and the person looks into that that Lake and seas on the lake floor

22
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,420
you see shells different oyster shells different kinds of shells

23
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:33,360
seize the Pebbles and the gravel that's there on the lake bottom

24
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:42,000
and see schools of fish both hovering still in the water not moving

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,720
and also gently swimming around

26
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:54,660
so the remarkable thing about this metaphor is the clarity of the water

27
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:00,900
but what we see in the water our natural phenomena

28
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:08,220
and maybe for that reason it's kind of special especially for people who are not connected to Nature so much

29
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:17,159
but very ordinary just the gravel at the bottom of a lake the shell that's down there the shells

30
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:22,980
and uh little fish in schools

31
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:29,819
swimming around peacefully so just to look at this

32
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:36,120
simple World natural world and let it be that simple

33
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:44,519
and what would it be like for this meditation where you are content

34
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:51,060
to be present here and now for what is obvious

35
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:57,480
what is it that obviously is clear

36
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:03,720
maybe what it is is you're confused you're not clear about that almost

37
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:10,220
anything except the fact that you're you are confused and you see that clearly

38
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:18,780
where things are not clear because you're agitated but what can be simple and obvious

39
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:24,180
is the agitation so

40
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:31,160
maybe with an emphasis on breathing what is obvious about breathing

41
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,419
what can you know with some clarity

42
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:42,120
don't worry about trying to see deeply or

43
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,300
don't worry about how you're not seeing clearly just be concerned about how you do seek

44
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:54,680
what you do see clearly would you feel and sense and experience

45
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:03,900
and let that be like looking into the Clear Lake

46
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:08,720
and seeing the simple natural phenomena that's there

47
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:17,220
the simile is a simile for awakening what is it about

48
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:23,880
this radical simplicity of being with what is obvious

49
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,940
independent whether it feels concentrated or feels like some great spiritual experience

50
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:35,699
what is it about just the clarity of knowing what's obvious seeing it as a

51
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:43,160
natural phenomena and letting it be that way what is it about that that's so valuable

52
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,979
so to take a posture for meditation

53
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:57,319
relaxing the Eyes by gazing down

54
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,699
and gently closing the eyes

55
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:21,199
and gently taking some deeper breaths

56
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,699
okay and longer exhales

57
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:38,180
relaxing on the exhales

58
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:15,139
letting the breathing return to normal and for a few more rounds of breathing

59
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:20,538
relaxing in the body relaxing in the mind

60
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:39,200
and then relaxing more deeply

61
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,320
maybe settling the attention on the body breathing

62
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:02,700
and maybe with breathing as a default where your attention lands and takes in

63
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:10,459
more than anything else for this sitting here

64
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:17,779
emphasize knowing what can be known clearly

65
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:24,839
what is obvious and appreciate the clarity of knowing

66
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:30,779
that if for example you're confused about

67
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:35,880
this instruction maybe what's known clearly is the

68
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,420
confusion

69
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:48,440
if it's a sound Outdoors that's known clearly

70
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:55,800
know that whatever is clearest most obvious

71
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:02,899
know it has a simple natural phenomenon

72
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,760
to emphasize the naturalness of it maybe you can have the little phrase

73
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,660
that goes along with it of course

74
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:24,660
of course this is what's here nothing to fight nothing to condemn

75
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:31,820
nothing to want just of course this is what's happening now

76
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:41,540
and in doing this way beginning to appreciate

77
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:51,440
Clarity simplicity directness of knowing

78
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:59,660
that is not encumbered by what is known

79
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:21,440
what is getting in the way of seeing what's obvious Here and Now

80
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:30,420
and if there is something getting in the way thoughts or something else

81
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:38,660
know that simply clearly as the obvious thing

82
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:21,360
whatever you're aware of how can you be aware of it as a natural

83
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:27,419
phenomenon where only what's obvious about it

84
00:20:27,419 --> 00:20:34,260
in the present moment how it is in the present

85
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:39,679
not what you're thinking about but just thinking

86
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:51,120
not the story of what you're feeling your emotions in the present simple awareness of the

87
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:57,200
emotion whatever it is

88
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:04,580
what can you know how can you know it with Clarity and simplicity

89
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,960
as we come to the end of the sitting

90
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:47,580
to settle back release any extra effort you're making

91
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:54,620
to be mindful in favor of seeing clearly

92
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:59,360
knowing simply

93
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:07,460
being present for what is obvious

94
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:14,840
without any tension or straining or wanting

95
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:25,700
and if straining and wanting is the obvious let that be what is known clearly

96
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:37,080
and to do this to appreciate simplicity

97
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,980
clarity

98
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:50,240
the ordinariness of being aware

99
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:58,440
and imagine offering this kind of attention

100
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,278
to others

101
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:13,820
not being aware of others with your desires and your aversions

102
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:23,220
not judging or without bias Prejudice without

103
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:30,059
preferences just the simplicity

104
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:36,679
naturalness of seeing clearly

105
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:44,720
letting each person that you see be someone natural and simple and

106
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,380
expression of nature

107
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:59,220
into through the medium of this Simplicity

108
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:07,519
and clarity to gaze upon the world kindly

109
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,980
gaze upon others with good will

110
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:28,220
gaze upon others with simple care ordinary care

111
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:34,639
that you care for them you wish them well

112
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:39,500
May others be happy

113
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:48,440
May others be safe May others be peaceful

114
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,700
May others be free

115
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,279
[Music]

116
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:26,899
thank you so on this Friday I offer my

117
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:33,679
Fifth and final Reflections on the Buddha's assemblies for meditation

118
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:39,600
and the previous similes all came from the

119
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:46,340
Buddhist discussion about the four absorptions and um

120
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:54,000
the um today's will be

121
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,539
um he's a analogy or simile for awakening

122
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:08,100
often following the absorb absorptions and it's a remarkable simile because of

123
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:13,919
its ordinariness the four absorptions are states of deep

124
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,919
meditation that are very satisfying and people have a variety of attachments

125
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:26,100
to them attached to wanting to have it when they don't and being upset when they don't

126
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:31,500
have these states of meditation wanting to have it again and some

127
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:36,539
sometimes desperate way if they have it once

128
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:41,760
sometimes they're a little bit frightening because they're so different than ordinary life

129
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:47,179
the ends of people pulled back and what was that and

130
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:53,840
and sometimes they lend themselves to a feeling of great certainly Bliss Rapture

131
00:31:53,840 --> 00:32:00,120
wonderousness amazement Delight they can be very healing there's lots of

132
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:05,520
benefits with concentration practice but they kind of are extraordinary

133
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:10,980
states of mind at least from the point of view of everyday life

134
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:17,460
in the middle of these uh some states of concentration if they're not too intense

135
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:22,620
it can feel like oh this is the natural mind this is a natural state

136
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:29,399
the Altered States Of Consciousness is everyday life of anger and desire and

137
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:36,419
confusion and all the stuff that goes on that when we're agitated in the mind

138
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:44,039
but the mind is settled and quiet and peaceful it can feel like this is that this is help this is natural

139
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:50,898
but in any case some of these states of concentration are kind of extraordinary in some ways

140
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:57,659
the simile for awakening comes back to something ordinary

141
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:07,320
and for all that Buddhism for all the ways in which uh Awakening Buddhist practice emphasizes not self

142
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,419
the the the assemblies for absorption

143
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:19,559
kind of involves a kind of Disappearing of the person and uh at deeper and deeper states of

144
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:25,440
concentration uh until the body disappears and

145
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:31,080
and um and they're kind of like the person is not quite there

146
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:36,299
not because discounting you as a person with meditation is just that the mind's

147
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:41,880
gotten so quiet and peaceful an assembly for awakening the person has

148
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:47,460
come back person is standing and the clarity it's in my mind of just

149
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:52,919
standing standing at a place here definitive location standing a person

150
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:58,500
standing upright and this person is looking into a very

151
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:04,980
clear lake and the person is looking into the lake and seeing

152
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:11,099
because it's so clear can look right down to the bottom to the lake floor and

153
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:16,260
the person sees there different kinds of shells the text translates that is

154
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:24,780
oyster shells that they're kind of in the in the water also sees uh gravel and Pebbles in the

155
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:30,720
water in the floor and sees schools of fish either swimming

156
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:37,320
around together or um or just kind of hovering still in the

157
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:43,858
water and these are seen clearly

158
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:50,000
so that's the simile and uh and there I think there's nothing

159
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,260
extraordinary symbolic that's supposed to be represented by

160
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:01,020
what these objects in the water because the emphasis here is on the

161
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:06,780
clarity of seeing and uh that when sees something so

162
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:13,320
clearly and so obviously that it seems like ordinary the mind isn't for or against is not

163
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:19,020
excited by it it's not uh you know making a self out of it not

164
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:24,960
congratulating oneself it's just the things there just the objects of nature

165
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,060
you know gravel and Pebbles you know we don't make much about them

166
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:39,060
shells maybe we don't make much of them but them unless we want to eat them and um and a little little uh I imagine

167
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:45,119
this in metaphor the schools of fish are very small fish so there's not you know any not like if

168
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:51,119
you want to fish them because you know they're way too small to to

169
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:58,440
um to eat so it's just kind of this the natural scene of in the water

170
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:05,460
and um and that ordinariness of Awakening

171
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:13,859
maybe there's something extraordinary about the freedom and the release of Awakening but uh of attachments but uh there's

172
00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:19,320
also something amazingly ordinary extraordinarily ordinary

173
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:26,700
and that we're seeing nature we're seeing what's natural we're seeing what's here as part of nature as in its

174
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:32,040
naturalness and this is part of the release we're releasing all the ways we

175
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:40,640
want extraordinary all the ways in which we attribute meaning and purpose and self and and

176
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:48,119
philosophies and all kinds of kind of layers and layers and layers of building cathedrals of

177
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:55,500
ideas and stories and meaning and self around experience those get released and freed

178
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:02,820
and what are we left with and uh we're left with Simplicity very simple

179
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:08,339
just standing seeing clearly seeing clearly as if everything is in

180
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:15,300
the naturalness of everything so now I want to read the simile so you

181
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:22,020
with that background that I and this is biker body's translation it's in the

182
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:27,480
39th discourse in the middle length discourses it's also in

183
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:33,839
the second discourse of the long discourses and um

184
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:40,200
so it goes to bigger body's translation goes like this just as if

185
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:48,599
there were a lake in a mountain recess clear limpid and undisturbed

186
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:57,599
so that a person with good sight standing on the bank could see shells gravel and Pebbles

187
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:03,078
and also shows a fish swimming and resting

188
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:09,960
and is and he might think that person might think

189
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:17,400
there is this fish swimming about and resting there is this Lake clear limpid and

190
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:24,359
undisturbed there are these shells gravel and Pebbles and also these Shoals of fish swimming

191
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:31,820
about and resting so

192
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:42,420
exactly how we are supposed to interpret this simile for awakening

193
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:48,720
can you know there's different choices and ways and certainly there's much more to be said about this

194
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:54,720
but uh what I'd like to do by ending this week is to emphasize

195
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,960
the ordinariness of it the ordinance of you standing still and

196
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:08,700
quiet and peaceful at seeing and seeing the ordinariness of life

197
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:15,720
seeing the simple things around you without the mind

198
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:23,339
wanting and needing and avoiding and building and fantasizing and

199
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:29,400
making up a self in relationship to it in the simile the person does not

200
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,560
disappear because sometimes that is a

201
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:41,400
extra this idea I'm not supposed to be here I'm supposed to be empty I'm supposed to be somehow vanish and have

202
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:47,640
no self here or I'm supposed to kind of be have a non-dualistic relationship with the

203
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:52,980
world where I disappear or just the world and and everything disappears or everything

204
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:56,240
is somehow

205
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:04,260
I'm interpreting a simile is just you're allowed to stand and be here

206
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:09,720
but if you're alone and the mountain is kind of in a safe wonderful cozy place and

207
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:14,880
looking at the water the many people just kind of they're

208
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,160
the self the social concerns that exist in urban settings living around people

209
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:27,420
kind of disappear just here and not needing identity not needing to

210
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:35,599
approve oneself defend oneself assert oneself not needing to be anything for anybody

211
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:42,060
just standing there looking into this calm peaceful Lake and seeing the most you know ordinary

212
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:49,260
things in it and um gravel shells

213
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:58,800
small fish swimming around and um so what would it take for you

214
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:06,680
to have trust enough that it's okay to be this way

215
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:12,599
to stand tall and confident in a certain way

216
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:18,900
the kind of confidence that looks confident from the outside

217
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:24,720
but the inside you're neither confident nor not confident

218
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:31,880
just be willing to be as you are

219
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:38,700
and be able to kind of gaze upon everything the world yourself

220
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:43,920
content to know what is obvious

221
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:50,099
not searching for meaning not searching for what's behind it the cause and the history and

222
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:53,720
fault and blame and

223
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:02,160
there might be time and place for those things but what is it to just sit stand there and

224
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:07,980
gaze upon things as if everything is just a natural everything obvious everything's seen

225
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:13,800
clearly as it is in the present moment whatever it might be it's just seeing it

226
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:20,000
as nature no greater lesser value than

227
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,960
gravel in the lake bed or

228
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:35,040
small little fish swimming around a Marvel of nature but

229
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,380
not something to get to appropriate or be greedy about or to

230
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:47,400
hate or to not something supernaturally phenomenal

231
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:54,780
and fantastic that you can write postcards home and say wow I had this amazing experience it was so

232
00:42:54,780 --> 00:43:01,440
far out and not to diminish the value of far out

233
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,520
experiences but

234
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:16,460
just the ordinariness of being here with clarity

235
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:22,020
so um so similes

236
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:27,180
so part of the value of similes is they can be interpreted under certain

237
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:33,359
different ways they can kind of uh sometimes like poetry maybe you don't have to always

238
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:40,740
understand the author's intent behind the similes but rather by exploring them and

239
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:47,220
interpreting them and seeing them on different days different months different years they might point to

240
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:53,640
something or speak to something or clarify something that is new and just

241
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:58,680
and sees the world in a new ways sees ourselves in new ways similes are kind

242
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:05,160
of have this wonderful power to reach deep inside of ourselves to understand new ways

243
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:10,380
and expand our senses and

244
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:16,619
because all of these similes have to do with meditation kind of the path of the Dharma

245
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:23,900
there is a place to try to understand what they mean dharmically what they mean as part of this path

246
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:30,540
and uh and how do they work together how do they unfold together

247
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:37,160
for the purposes of freedom a freedom that in the end

248
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:45,260
allows us to be ordinary

249
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:49,339
a glorious ordinary

250
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:58,460
where we're free from all the burdens that we carry

251
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:07,980
so thank you very much and um so as I said yesterday I want to repeat

252
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:14,579
the announcement that um it looks like I won't be here for the next four weeks

253
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:21,900
I'm teaching retweets three of those weeks and then I'm going away a family trip for Thanksgiving

254
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:27,180
and um and for the next two weeks I have guests

255
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:32,520
coming a wonderful it's a couple a wonderful

256
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:37,880
two people in the imc's teacher training

257
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:44,099
wise teacher trainees who are already great teachers and done a fair amount of teaching already

258
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:49,980
and um and uh they are I think they're the youngest

259
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:56,400
teachers in the teacher training or among the youngest and so it's kind of like the new generation coming along

260
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:03,180
which is kind of exciting and I'm very happy to introduce them to you this way and have them come and and

261
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:10,619
so I think you'll enjoy them quite a bit this coming week it's kodo Koto Conlin

262
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:16,800
and he's also a priest at San Francisco Zen Center so he has a similar background to me and that I was a priest

263
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:22,980
there and also trained to be the Persona teacher and um and then there's May Elliott who

264
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:30,839
is a long time vipassana student and also a student at San Francisco Zen Center and teacher there

265
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:36,000
um and um so and then the last two weeks I'm not

266
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:42,839
sure what's happening yet we're kind of a little bit dependent on having volunteers help with the technology for

267
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:49,140
broadcasting this and um we have to make a for people are not here at IMC we have

268
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:55,740
to make a zoom room for them and then uh had they they teach through the into the zoom room and

269
00:46:55,740 --> 00:47:00,960
that gets uh transferred over to YouTube so it's not clear we have volunteers to

270
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,540
do that and um so I'll still wait and see if we if I have teachers if I don't find teachers

271
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:15,660
to come then there'll be um we'll do replace and um and hopefully make a nice choice

272
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:21,900
from this huge collection now of the 7 A.M teachings we've done over these almost

273
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:27,300
three years so thank you very much I look forward to

274
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:33,420
coming back in a month I think it's on the 5th of December and um

275
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:40,020
and I hope that uh you take good care of uh your your 7 A.M

276
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:43,940
Sangha during this month thank you
