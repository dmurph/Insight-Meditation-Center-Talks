1
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,359
so continuing these

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,559
talks on anapanasati

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,760
mindfulness of breathing

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,640
um

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,920
we've entered into the domain

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,519
of mental activity and the

7
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,720
pali word is

8
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,840
chitta sankara so it's

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,040
usually translated as mind and sankara

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,000
is formations or calling it to this week

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,200
activities of the mind

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,520
and so

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,800
activities of the mind

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,160
it turns out that the mind is not the

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,520
container

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,320
for activities or the organ for

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,360
activities like

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,840
the brain that's maybe the organ for

19
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,680
you know what many of us the modern

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,040
world think of as mental activities

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,560
the cheetah is itself an activity

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,920
or it's the sum total of all the

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,680
activities

24
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,799
of the of what we might call the mind

25
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,439
it's the um or the cheetah is

26
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,080
all the activities of the mind as we

27
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,200
experience them

28
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,399
as we can know them

29
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,520
and so this idea that the mind itself is

30
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,920
an activity

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,400
is an encouragement not to take the mind

32
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,640
as a particular thing

33
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,320
not to kind of reify it or

34
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,439
treat it as a almost like a foreign

35
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,840
object

36
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,000
but rather all we have as human beings

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,119
really in the in the buddhist point of

38
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,159
view

39
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,360
is the activities that

40
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,840
are all operating together

41
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,399
to to make make us alive is when the

42
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,160
activities of life

43
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,879
are no longer here that we're no longer

44
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,319
alive

45
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,239
and one of those activities is the

46
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,160
activities of the mind

47
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,360
the mental activities and to start

48
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,480
becoming aware

49
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,080
of the mind appreciating it

50
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,440
uh is the task now in the middle stages

51
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,400
of anapanasati and it's very important

52
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,599
to appreciate it that it's um

53
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,360
it's uh it's kind of in the middle here

54
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,519
so that there's been a lot of emphasis

55
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,680
on breathing for sure

56
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,480
embodied breathing and but also being

57
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,599
rooted in the body

58
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,640
really feeling the whole body and then

59
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,879
also starting feeling a real sense of

60
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,160
well-being

61
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,800
a contentment in the body joy in the

62
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,440
body

63
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,280
and and spreading that contentment

64
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,959
throughout the body

65
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:04,400
and so there's a movement towards

66
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,280
becoming whole

67
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,280
or the classic language is becoming

68
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,319
unified

69
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,959
where everything's included and

70
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,400
and and so as we move through panasati

71
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,720
it's not so much that we're now starting

72
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,519
to

73
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,560
emphasize more the mind but

74
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,959
we're opening up wider and wider to more

75
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,640
and more inclusive

76
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,120
of this whole but if we're very s

77
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,280
quiet and still centered and in the body

78
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,680
the body begins to because it's taken

79
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,200
care of so well

80
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,440
because it's no longer a challenging

81
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,599
place to be

82
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,040
in deeper meditation that

83
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,200
the body begins to recede from

84
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,680
the central focus of awareness the

85
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,560
breathing tends to change its quality

86
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,480
and it's fascinating to watch as we go

87
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,840
through meditation

88
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,920
the different stages that breathing will

89
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,720
take and sometimes breathing will go

90
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,519
very quiet and subtle and still

91
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,519
sometimes it's so quiet the breathing it

92
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,000
seems like we've stopped breathing

93
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,360
the first time that happened to me in

94
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,840
meditation i was very

95
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,359
content and a lot of well-being and just

96
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,560
sitting there very still

97
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,520
and nope no trouble at all and then a

98
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,520
note i noticed i hadn't breathed for a

99
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,560
while

100
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,880
and i immediately gasped for breath with

101
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,759
fear

102
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,240
and i had this thought i'm going to die

103
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,280
and um

104
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,360
but you know there was no danger of that

105
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,280
to just that i'd never

106
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,560
you know you're not you're supposed to

107
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,400
be breathing all the time

108
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,479
and uh so this idea that the breathing

109
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,639
had seemingly seemingly stopped

110
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,040
was you know a little bit jarring for me

111
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,120
and then eventually i learned that

112
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,880
it seems like there's plenty enough

113
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,880
oxygen getting into the bloodstream

114
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,479
some way or other even when seemingly

115
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,400
the experience of breathing has gotten

116
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,039
so still that it's kind of stopped

117
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,639
and so the body and the breathing

118
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,400
sometimes recede

119
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,120
and so then this sense of wholeness and

120
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,240
inclusion

121
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,199
begins to include the mental activity

122
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,440
the mind itself

123
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,080
and and one of the things we begin

124
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,759
appreciating in this path this journey

125
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,080
is at some point it's possible to

126
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,280
understand

127
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,800
that the body itself

128
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,759
not the physical body but the body that

129
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,080
we

130
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,520
experience how we experience the body

131
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,960
is a byproduct or contingent upon

132
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,720
the mental activities we have so

133
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,680
if the mind is

134
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,880
really quiet and still

135
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,120
the construction of the body the the

136
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,880
making of the body experiences

137
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,360
and interpreting the body and focusing

138
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,800
the body begins to

139
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,240
recede as well and the experienced body

140
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,160
begins to become more porous

141
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,440
more transparent more translucent

142
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,120
until it also sometimes kind of

143
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,639
disappears

144
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,280
so this activity of the mind is part of

145
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:13,759
this

146
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,800
his incense all in

147
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,720
some forms of buddhism they say them

148
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,840
it's all we have

149
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,360
all there is consciousness is all there

150
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,880
is they're saying

151
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,600
but i don't think that the buddha would

152
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,560
say that

153
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,319
but he would say that most of what we

154
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,680
experience the

155
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,400
experience of life is very much

156
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,160
conditioned and affected

157
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,960
by the quality and the activity and the

158
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,800
of the mind itself of this cheetah so

159
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,479
this cheetah activity the activity of

160
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,520
the mind

161
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,840
is actually a very important part of our

162
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,479
hugely important part of our life

163
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,240
and it's how we construct ourselves

164
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,919
construct our world in the way that we

165
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,080
live in it and experience it

166
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,720
so to start becoming aware not of this

167
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,240
complicated idea that we're

168
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,400
constructing our own experience in some

169
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,319
way we're influencing it

170
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,960
greatly but to begin appreciating that

171
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,599
as the

172
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,919
that we can it's actually possible to

173
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,039
quiet the mind

174
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,319
still the mind soften the mind

175
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,039
not so much by necessarily doing it too

176
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,800
intentionally

177
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,240
but it tends to happen as we start

178
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,720
getting more settled and unified

179
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
less in conflict with things thus in

180
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,800
conflict with the mind or the heart or

181
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,240
the world

182
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,800
and there's kind of a less being for and

183
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,319
against things

184
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,919
the mind tends to become quieter

185
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,280
and the activity slows down and

186
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,680
and but slowing down doesn't mean it

187
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,800
doesn't mean we could be

188
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,080
we become slow-witted um it

189
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,879
it's like i said the last few days um

190
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,080
the mind actually

191
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,280
operates so much better clear more

192
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,120
creatively more intelligently more

193
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,759
wisely

194
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,360
when the less active energy or less

195
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,360
applied energy goes into our thinking

196
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,759
into the mental activity and the mental

197
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,120
activity is kind of like it's

198
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,599
begins coasting or it comes into a

199
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,560
harmony

200
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,960
where there's no resistance to anything

201
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,360
there's no

202
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,000
and so it just kind of begins to operate

203
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,280
in a very

204
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,479
harmonious deep way and almost

205
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,160
effortlessly

206
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,560
so this movement of quieting the mental

207
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,919
activity

208
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,518
so part of this is then to

209
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,680
recognize what it feels like

210
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,200
the mental activity the experience of it

211
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,519
and and that's how we can start becoming

212
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,399
aware

213
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,279
of how energetic it is how tense it is

214
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,040
how much pressure there's in it

215
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,480
contraction how much resistance there is

216
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,880
how much

217
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,680
agitation there is in the mental

218
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,200
activity

219
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,760
and then to hold that in awareness

220
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,399
breathe with that just be aware of that

221
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,920
and then when it's easy to relax

222
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,959
calm the mental activities not to do

223
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:15,360
that

224
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,160
too much not to make it a big project in

225
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,640
fact

226
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,320
the bigger project than calming the

227
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,839
mental activities

228
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,440
is just to get to know it step seven

229
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,360
we can't under i can't underestimate how

230
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,880
important it is for people who do the

231
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,399
pasta practice

232
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,600
to really just learn the art of just

233
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,360
knowing the experience

234
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,240
really well and knowing how to be with

235
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:38,720
it

236
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,800
without being for and against it without

237
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,080
being actively engaged

238
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,720
trying to do something with it and when

239
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,880
that's learned well

240
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,240
then it's a really good time to

241
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,480
actively quiet and soften the mind

242
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,640
the mental activity to let go of our

243
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,600
thoughts

244
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,440
to let go of our preoccupations too

245
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,440
and but not to do it because we have to

246
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,480
but because it's wise to do it not that

247
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,240
and not do it because we're expecting to

248
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,920
be successful

249
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,360
but just because you know

250
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,160
we're quiet and peaceful and calm enough

251
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,360
that why not

252
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,440
why not let the mind become even stiller

253
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,079
and quieter

254
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,000
and so appreciating the mind

255
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,040
as an activity activities

256
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,760
and and relaxing and calming it

257
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,760
and then also beginning to appreciate

258
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,200
and recognize

259
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,839
the ways in which the mental activity

260
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,760
has become calm

261
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,480
has become quieter and that's a relative

262
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,480
degree

263
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,959
if you're super agitated it's really

264
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:53,680
good

265
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,440
to appreciate that you've now you're

266
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,959
half agitated

267
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,920
and before you're 100 agitated rather

268
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,920
than feeling upset about the 50

269
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,440
agitation celebrate it

270
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,600
any movement in the right direction in

271
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,560
meditation

272
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,000
just be celebrated rather than to be

273
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,600
give yourself more material for why

274
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,680
you're not far enough along and

275
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,640
not doing better

276
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,000
and but then to appreciate the calmness

277
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,480
of the mind the tranquility of the mind

278
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,640
and for the buddha tranquility

279
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,360
begets tranquility extreme quick

280
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,399
tranquility you

281
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,959
actually use the word food tranquility

282
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,200
is the food or the nourishment

283
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,640
for more tranquility so as we

284
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,920
relax calm the mind as the mind becomes

285
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,399
calmer

286
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,240
nourish yourself with that calm

287
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,360
take it in enjoy it

288
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,320
let it spread let it let it be more part

289
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,200
of who you are

290
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,120
and appreciate it i've had situations

291
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,040
where i got calm enough

292
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,160
but the authority of my thoughts and my

293
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,399
things i my sense of responsibility were

294
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,440
strong enough

295
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,040
that i felt like i had to think about

296
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,279
things and not sit and appreciate the

297
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,600
calm

298
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,839
but tranquility is the food

299
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,800
for more tranquility so you're allowed

300
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,519
to

301
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,360
take in that food you're allowed to be

302
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,959
nourished by it

303
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,880
when it's there when it comes

304
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,279
so step seven is breathing in

305
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,720
one experiences mental activity

306
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,040
breathing out one experiences mental

307
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,639

up

315
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,079
an excited mind in opposition to a calm

316
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,040
mind

317
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,480

318
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,320
it's quite wonderful to be excited and

319
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,360
