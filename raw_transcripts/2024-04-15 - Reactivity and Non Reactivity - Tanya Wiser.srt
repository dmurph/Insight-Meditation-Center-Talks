10
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:11,320
yesterday as I was thinking about coming to teach today because I didn't have to tell anybody I was coming I didn't have

11
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,400
to arrange a place to offer the teachings I didn't have to pay for

12
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,759
anything I didn't have there's all this stuff I didn't have to do because of the way the center everything is freely

wall seriously the car all of it is Donna the building itself is

17
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,719

18
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:02,640
wanted you here so I'm grateful to the Buddha the Dharma

19
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:10,720
and the S including this s right so what I want to talk about today

20
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,200
is um reactivity and

21
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,319
non-reactivity [Music] um yeah this is to me this is a big

22
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,800
topic and it's tied to a lot in the Dharma but you know reactivity is pretty

23
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,840
unpleasant thing isn't it really

24
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:42,200
uncomfortable and uh you know I I I I feel very yanked around when I'm being

25
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:50,599
reactive and um you know it I'm inevitably walking away feeling

26
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:58,560
remorseful regretful you know when I've been reactive like why couldn't I

27
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,280
just be he still why couldn't I just meet this

28
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,040
moment without adding all this flopping

29
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:18,400
around and really this is uh why I came to the practice was

30
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,159
because I was not able to meet what was happening in my life it was too hard

31
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:30,840
things were falling apart and I kept you know it was just

32
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,159
too painful I kept reacting and reacting and reacting so I wasn't able to there's

33
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:43,840
so much I wasn't able to meet and I kept trying and I'd say Okay I want to do this I want to be able to calm and talk

34
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:51,280
about this or respond kindly and but it was just oh the feelings inside were

35
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,720
just so intense and um you know that was that

36
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,799
was true um and one of the relationships in my life that's really motivated me to

37
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:10,239
practice is my relationship with my kids and um now it's really important to

38
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:17,040
me I want to be a good Mom I wanted to be a mom that could meet her kid or kids

39
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,079
where they were to make them feel you know like I trusted them I believed in

40
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:28,479
them and uh I kept failing because my reactivity would get in the way of the

41
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,759
message I was trying to deliver so I I when I finally came to the

42
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,280
practice because of so much reactivity I was pretty darn motivated and I kind of

43
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:46,800
just Dove right in and was in on Retreats almost right away and I I just

44
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,479
over and over again it was just like there's a way there's another way to

45
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,960
meet this life there's another

46
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,639
way I was recently thinking about this um

47
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:11,960
and um I was remembering an image that I

48
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:20,280
had you know been taught from one of the sutas early in my practice and the image was of a fish

49
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,600
flopping around doesn't that just sound like

50
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,360
reactivity like a fish flopping around on the ground in a puddle you know like

51
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,880
that and that is exactly what for me I felt inside of myself was like this fish

52
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:46,000
that was just relentlessly flopping around and so I uh looked up the

53
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,600
sua again recently and I'm going to share it with

54
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,919
you um the suta you know the Su the Buddha

55
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:03,520
does an amazing job of providing writing these similes these images these

56
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,319
metaphors analogies for what we experience in our inner

57
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:15,919
life and um you know this is an example of one of those you know analogies or

58
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:22,680
similes that has just really stayed with me and there's something so visceral

59
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,560
about it and so for me the practice is an

60
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:35,599
experience to have to engage with so these kinds of similes um are are really

61
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:44,160
helpful because when I feel it I'm reminded of the Dharma so may may this suta be there

62
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:51,800
inside of you deeply connected to whatever your version of a f fish flopping around is you

63
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:58,319
know yeah put your mic closer because I'm not able to

64
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,840
internet sure all the

65
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:16,400
help is that any better doesn't S doesn't sound any better to

66
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,479
mezy still a little far it's still a little far how's that oh that felt

67
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:30,680
better right yeah okay okay so the Su is called the uh Aon

68
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:37,400
ATA Su and it's been interpreted by a number of poly Scholars um some call it

69
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:44,639
the rod embraced some called it call it arming oneself um another name is the thorn in

70
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,360
your heart and

71
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:56,039
um the this is um a suo that the Buddha

72
00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:02,400
gives when he's called to deal with a con conflict in

73
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,599
community and um

74
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:13,800
he he he shares a lot about his his own emotional response to conflict in this

75
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:21,240
suta it's really quite touching and the the while the suta is

76
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:29,800
about external con conflict right between people I invite you to feel into this as

77
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:36,000
the same as internal conflict and by that I mean um we can

78
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,479
take up arms against others but we also take them up against ourselves and we might not take up

79
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:50,560
physical arms against others but if we take up arms in my in my mind about somebody if I'm angry at

80
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,399
somebody we have an internal experience that

81
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:03,120
is results in suffering if I think about myself

82
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:11,640
critically there's a way in which my experience of this is that then my image of myself becomes

83
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:19,399
akin to an enemy that when I think about myself my physiology responds to myself as if I am

84
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:27,040
a threat my very own self because of my own view of myself in some

85
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:33,399
circumstance so please don't limit yourself s to thinking about this is only about those other people who fight

86
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:40,440
with other people if there's any degree of inner conflict inner criticism if you have an

87
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:47,639
inner critic which I imagine you all do this applies to

88
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,560
you when embraced so let me just I should say this first too there's so

89
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:03,640
many translations I have a number of different them that are mixed together here so if you go to look up the

90
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,920
suta you may find a different version or you'll see that I've mixed versions

91
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:14,079
together here when embraced the rod of violence breeds danger and

92
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:20,519
fear fear is born from arming oneself just see how many people

93
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:27,680
fight I'll tell you about the Dreadful fear that caused me to shake all

94
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:35,360
over this is the Buddha speaking I'll tell you about the Dreadful fear that caused me to shake

95
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,959
all over seeing creatures flopping around

96
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:47,360
like fish in shallow and water too shallow so hostile to one another seeing

97
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,880
this I became

98
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,160
afraid another translation of that little two lines is I saw this

99
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:07,519
population flounder like fish in a little puddle seeing them fight each other fear Came Upon

100
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:19,399
me the world around was Hollow all directions were in

101
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:24,440
turmoil wanting a home for myself I saw

102
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:31,079
nowhere he also says in another translation it trembles in all all

103
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:34,320
directions this

104
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:43,560
world seeing people Locked In conflict I became completely

105
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,760
distraught who here has felt distraught seeing the conflict in the

106
00:11:52,839 --> 00:12:01,200
world yeah me too I longed to find myself a place

107
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,920
unscathed but I could not see

108
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:16,040
it seeing people Locked In conflict I became completely distraught but then I

109
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:25,399
discern hear a thorn hard to see lodged deep in the heart

110
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:39,680
what does this bring up for you this idea of a thorn in the heart

111
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:10,000
typically it's greed hatred and delusion right it's craving

112
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:19,800
clinging it is only when pierced by this Thorn that one runs in all

113
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:28,279
directions right when we are you know really in the grip

114
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,440
when we're not in the grip we don't run in all directions and if that thorn is taken

115
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,399
out one does not run and settles

116
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:49,279
down there's another translation of when struck by that Dart you run around in

117
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:55,920
all directions and I like the dart image because it reminds me of the Aros

118
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:04,240
simile but when that same Dart has been plucked out you neither run around nor sink down and I like that too run around

119
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:11,839
or sink down because I have seen this too where there's this running around

120
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,759
reactivity and you know that is acting out and trying to escape and all these

121
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:23,480
things and then there's a giving up or giving in that is like a sinking down

122
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:31,040
like just a complete kind of sunken place it can happen

123
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:49,480
the um the one title of this is the rod embraced and the rod symbolizes taking

124
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,680
up arms right usually back then it was a

125
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,800
stick but the the simile should be understood to understand that the rod of

126
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:06,800
violence has three forms physical verbal and mental so this goes

127
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:14,240
to the words that we use toward others ourselves the way we treat ourselves

128
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,519
physically the way we treat others physically and the way we imagine things

129
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,440
the may we think of things the views and opinions we

130
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:32,040
create and one interpreter says um the cause of

131
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:40,519
this is the misplaced wish for security driven by

132
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:46,720
desire and the suta goes on to talk about the solution which is all the ways

133
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:54,240
we learn to let go in this practice all the ways we learn to let go

134
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:04,880
and you know these are pretty common things that you'll

135
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:11,160
hear and I'll just say a little bit about them but a sage should be

136
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:18,319
truthful overcome greed overcome the

137
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:26,920
hindrances essentially sloth and toror and among others should not sink into false

138
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:33,920
speech should understand and greed as a great

139
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:39,519
Deluge stand close to the truth develop

140
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:47,120
wisdom and transcend this desire for sensual pleas pleasure letting what is

141
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,600
gone be

142
00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:00,800
gone being free of Cruelty

143
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:14,038
and not seeing oneself as any of the following not seeing oneself as

144
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:22,280
equal welcome back baby I love the sound meditation this

145
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:31,000
morning so sweet so we we don't see ourselves as

146
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,679
equal inferior or Superior is that hard to

147
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:46,440
imagine what's that how do we what is the yeah I have

148
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,080
something that I learn from psychology but I've never heard anything from the

149
00:17:52,080 --> 00:18:00,039
perspective yeah well I can tell you how I interpret it Genie thank you

150
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,520
um so I think that I mean our language this language to me is quite binary it's

151
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:18,080
very you know um one way or another we we're you know this or

152
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:24,320
that and um when we think about equality or equal being

153
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:31,400
equal if we think about ourselves then you know we want somebody else to

154
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:38,400
be equal to it there's a real math equation here right there's this like sense of you can weigh two things on the

155
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:46,280
scale and they weigh the same but they don't we don't weigh the same our experiences can't be

156
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:52,679
commodified in that way so if we can go beyond this idea of mathematical

157
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:59,640
equations and we can just think about the uniqueness of each being that there's no

158
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:05,159
way to measure you know this this equality

159
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:10,960
thing not that one is more important or less important both are important and if

160
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,240
we can see people as unique as special

161
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,000
as kind of what that whatever it is they are we're going to be much more inclined

162
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:30,120
to be curious about what does make you you and what does make me me so is that

163
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:35,880
helpful Genie yeah great I'm

164
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,360
glad so I think that

165
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:48,000
um one of the teachings I grabbed on to when I

166
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,600
couldn't when I was more reactive more often maybe then

167
00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:00,679
I am now was just don't make it worse it's a really really good

168
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:07,480
teaching just don't make it worse I remember you know hearing um the

169
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:14,280
teachers talk about um to try and sit and be with whatever came up right like

170
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:19,440
turn towards your experience with curiosity you know don't try and change

171
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,440
it be with your suffering and um when I was first

172
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:33,159
practicing I I couldn't even be with my own mind for more than 5 minutes it was like 5 minutes was the

173
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:40,720
time that was the that was the minimum you know that was the the marker okay sit for five Tanya try and sit and I

174
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,320
believe it was hard to sit still it was hard to sit with what was coming up in

175
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,200
my own mind and not be flopping around like a fish I wanted to get away from

176
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:59,240
what I was feeling I wanted to feel calm I wanted to be at ease I wanted to be happy

177
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:07,080
I was not it was hard so the idea of not making it worse

178
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:12,840
was like okay can I just you know if I'm reactive this much can I just not make it worse not be more reactive right and

179
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:18,919
not react to my reactivity but the words while I

180
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:25,120
couldn't quite do them did wake something up in me and then this V Vision this idea of

181
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,840
this fish came alive in me and I started to feel the

182
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:36,000
fish more and more and I could feel the fish as something something that was

183
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,720
going on in me it was instead of it just being everything a feeling and in my

184
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:48,240
mind and my thoughts being everything my whole experience I could start to see oh this is this is something that's going

185
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,679
on inside and then there's reactivity to

186
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:03,039
it I'll come back to this but I I just want to say that it is really hard to

187
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:09,159
listen to be receptive and impossible to love when we

188
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:14,880
are flopping around like fish when we are trying to escape from what we're

189
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:21,679
feeling what's happening we cannot love because we're

190
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,919
our our Attention our energy is fully consumed with trying to get away trying

191
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:33,880
to change it and sometimes in life we're asked to sit

192
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:40,640
through things that are hideously difficult

193
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,200
and I want to love through those things

194
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:02,640
too I really [Applause]

195
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,159
do I'm just giving my heart a minute

196
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,039
here baa yeah

197
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,679
you know one of the crown jewels of the practice of the

198
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:48,600
teachings is developing wisdom understanding this heart mind

199
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:57,159
complex yep so understanding what's happening

200
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:03,080
will bring peace to the mind and once you understand how

201
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:08,720
precious the process is of being able to look and see and understand from the

202
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:17,320
perspective of what the Buddha teaches us joy becomes more possible and we feel

203
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:23,960
more and more motivated to keep looking so coming to understand what's

204
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:29,000
happening inside of us with this fish wiggling around jiggling around

205
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,440
trying to get air maybe the simplest way to understand

206
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:40,320
it and if you were here the last time I spoke you know a lot about how I feel about

207
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:46,520
Dua I wrote I I gave a talk a couple months ago called becoming a Dukat

208
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:51,640
tracker so if you're interested in hearing more from me about Dua listen to

209
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:59,760
the talk so Dua what is Dua for those of you who don't know Dua is the poly word for

210
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:06,880
suffering so the you know it is said the Buddha said he taught suffering and the

211
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,760
end of suffering the whole

212
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:20,159
Continuum and so suffering can be translated in this huge

213
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:28,640
range from very subtle like just the slightest like you know

214
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:35,440
fabric that rubs a little bit on your skin creates a little bit of tenderness

215
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:42,559
maybe there's a little bit of a a rub to maybe this idea of fish flopping

216
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:48,799
around in a war huge amounts of suffering and pain

217
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:56,520
so this great big scale so this is duka and I like to use

218
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:02,080
the word duka because it has a different um context for me than the word

219
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,919
suffering which I don't really like maybe because I don't like to

220
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,600
suffer but there's also um a couple other translations that can be useful

221
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:19,240
one is stress right another is

222
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:25,159
pain which I like too and then uh one teacher Lee

223
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:30,240
brazington suggested the term bummer

224
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:38,320
which I happen to love because it communicates our attitude toward the

225
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:45,120
suffering so when you find yourself that's a bummer oh I'm clinging there's

226
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,240
something here I don't like

227
00:26:50,279 --> 00:27:02,158
right it's also described you know um well the Cause right the cause of Dua is

228
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:09,279
clinging so for me I'll just say quickly Dua itself is not really for me it's I

229
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:14,679
am so grateful for my Dua I am incredibly grateful for my Dua

230
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:20,640
and in fact I was thinking this morning wow who am I to think that I should take anyone's dooka

231
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:28,360
away who am I I needed my Dua I have needed that that stress that

232
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:33,840
suffering that pain that to to wake me up to what I've been cleaning

233
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,600
to so may I let you all have your

234
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:54,640
daoka so the cause of Duca is something that is incredibly helpful to understand

235
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:04,278
so speaking of growing wisdom we grow wisdom when we start to understand understand that Dua itself is for me a

236
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:10,640
guide Dua itself is pointing to the fact that I'm

237
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,799
clinging it is a symptom of clinging when I cling It

238
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:25,320
Hurts So if I can see Duca when I feel that pain that hurt the discomfort the

239
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:30,760
stress I can stop and look in the mind heart

240
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:36,240
body to ask myself why do I want to be different right

241
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:43,120
now what am I what am I clinging to what what is going on here what is it you

242
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,240
know what I a view I have an opinion I have a belief I

243
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,960
have what's going on and the Buddha taught you know in one

244
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:59,240
of his teachings three kinds of clinging so I'll just name them to help us

245
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:07,440
because it's helpful right to sort of look oh there's sense clinging to sensuality feeling good food tasting

246
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:14,640
good like oh bummer this dinner sucks okay clinging to wanting it to taste better right very simple probably not a

247
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:20,360
huge amount of daoka in that unless maybe you know you're serving the dolly

248
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:26,720
llama or something you know and and it there's a

249
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:33,559
natural you know amount of wanting to be comfortable it's really

250
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:39,320
okay it's really okay that we want Pleasant things and we want to feel okay

251
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:47,480
and not be in pain it's it's really fine I was thinking about um babies

252
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:54,720
probably inspired by our guest and um about how from from

253
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,760
birth you know babies know what they want and what they don't

254
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:07,360
want they go toward what they want and they cry and push away what they don't

255
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:15,480
want like this is just part of being a human an animal even right living all

256
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:23,080
Liv even in amoeba you know like they we all go toward what feels good so you

257
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:28,440
know okay we're human beings we're living beings this is how we survive

258
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:36,200
this is how we get through life so clinging to sensuality wanting to feel pleasure wanting to enjoy life and feel

259
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:42,240
good welcome to the world right it's when we start to really

260
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,799
cling we get in trouble the other is clinging to

261
00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:53,600
becoming what does this mean clinging to becoming it's sort of like I want to

262
00:30:53,600 --> 00:31:00,799
become you know a world athletic Olympic swimmer at

263
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:08,240
56 right How likely is that to happen not at all but I I have this Vision this wish I wish I could be

264
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,799
this and and we imagine it and we fantasize it and we get kind of caught

265
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:17,880
up in this idea of becoming

266
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,600
something and it triggers a lot of mental kind of fabrication a lot of

267
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:31,440
story making I want to be the this there's a lot of clinging that can get going in

268
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,559
this and and the opposite of wanting to become is clinging to non- becoming and

269
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:45,679
this is really painful if you have social anxiety you go into a room and you you don't you want to you know

270
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:52,279
disappear you don't want to be there or you feel suicidal you don't want to you don't want to be alive anymore this is

271
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:59,279
clinging to non- becoming not wanting to be not wanting to be the person that makes this mistake

272
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:06,840
or does that thing or isn't this right so these are three of the ways that we

273
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,760
can look for how we might be

274
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:21,159
clinging so um this is not to

275
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:27,559
say that I shouldn't want to become a great swimmer it's not to say you shouldn't

276
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:37,080
want to become a great meditator or a good Buddhist or whatever it is you want to

277
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:41,960
become keep your desires get rid of your

278
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,679
Cravings hold it all

279
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:58,679
lightly there's a way in which um in the poly canon in the Buddhist teaching

280
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:06,159
there are a lot of analogies that talk about this Paradox of you know don't cling don't

281
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:12,399
have desire you know get don't get caught up in sensual desire but we need to have our desire we

282
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:18,240
need to want to do things we need the baby needs to want to eat right it's

283
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,919
okay and one of them is this teaching on um the

284
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:29,080
raft the Buddha talks about building a raft to cross the floods of greed hatred

285
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:37,080
and delusion to get from the shore of suffering to the shore free of suffering I want to I want to be over there but to

286
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:42,480
get there we have to get ourselves across and essentially my view of it is

287
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:50,480
we build this through creating um a mental

288
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:56,760
state that allows us to stay present aware non-reactive to put enough energy

289
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:04,518
into getting across to have Clarity and we cross the

290
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:10,358
stream and then he says when you get to the other side what do you do with a raft that you use to get

291
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:17,158
across you put it on your head and carry it around with you everywhere you go no you leave it on the

292
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:24,118
shore because you've crossed over you used something to get where you need to go well the same is true with you

293
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:29,919
know the desires that we hold we we need them to to want to meditate we need to

294
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:36,079
want to meditate right it takes commitment and effort and some hope some

295
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:42,800
Faith hopefully confidence to do this practice it's not an easy

296
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:58,280
practice there's a roomy um quote the hurt you Embrace becomes

297
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:05,640
Joy call it to your arms where it can change that

298
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:12,800
sweet yeah I'll read you the whole whole poem it's a couple lines longer than

299
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:21,880
that the hurt you Embrace becomes Joy call it to your arms where it can

300
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:28,640
change a silkor worm eating leaves makes a cocoon each of us we leaves a chamber of

301
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:35,800
leaves and sticks silk worms begin to truly exist as they disappear inside that

302
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:44,079
room without legs we fly the hurt you Embrace becomes

303
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:51,160
Joy call it to your arms where it can change Gil will talk about practicing

304
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:59,160
with Open Hands allowing whatever it is that we're working with face like a bird

305
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:05,960
you know letting it sit here and then when it's ready to go it goes and we're not holding on to it and trying to keep

306
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:11,880
it but we're giving it this nurturing space to come in and do what it needs to

307
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:19,800
do and transform on its own so when we stop fighting the way

308
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:25,560
things are we have access to love the joy

309
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,880
when we block parts of our experience when we try and

310
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:41,240
resist difficult emotions or difficult experiences that are

311
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:46,480
happening we end up blocking both the difficult and the

312
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:52,520
Beautiful the joy and the anger

313
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,760
so when we stop fighting the way things are we have access to

314
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:11,119
love pemin says fear is a universal

315
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:18,119
experience even the smallest insect feels it we wait into tidal pools and put our

316
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:23,520
finger near the soft open bodies of seeing enemies and they close up

317
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,760
everything spontaneously does that it's not a terrible thing that we feel fear

318
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:33,920
when we're faced with the unknown is part of being alive something we all

319
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:40,280
share fear is a natural response to moving closer to the

320
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:47,720
truth and she goes on to say embarking on the spiritual journey is like getting into a very small boat and setting Out

321
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:54,560
on the Ocean to search for unknown lands with wholehearted practice comes

322
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,640
inspiration but sooner or later we will ALS Al encounter

323
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:05,160
fear for all we know when we get to the Horizon we're going to drop off the edge

324
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:11,200
of the world no wonder there people thought the

325
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:18,800
world was flat right like oh yeah if you're venturing off and you really have no idea you're probably afraid you're going to fall off oh there that that

326
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:25,400
that's how that idea came about like all Explorers we are drawn to

327
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:34,560
discover what's waiting out there yet knowing if we have not knowing if we have the courage to face it and this is

328
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:42,240
this is big there's 10,000 Joys and 10,000 sorrows in this life we can't block the Sorrows without

329
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:49,190
blocking the joys we don't get to just have the joys it is a crazy ass ride out

330
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:55,240
[Laughter] there yeah we're just depriving

331
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:00,720
ourselves really if if we try and control it it's not possible

332
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:09,560
anyway so how do we just sit down and buckle up put that resolve take resolve to just

333
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:17,400
be there and open to what's happening in our lives even when it's not what we want

334
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:24,599
even when it's what we're terrified of who am I to take

335
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:30,680
away somebody's suffering who am I to take away that which could liberate

336
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,400
someone with if they have

337
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:45,839
wisdom the moment you accept what troubles you've been given the door will

338
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:54,119
open this is Mor roomy welcome difficulty is a familiar

339
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:59,160
comrade comrade joke with torment brought by the friend Sorrows are the

340
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:06,760
rags of clothes and jackets that serve to cover then are taken off that undressing

341
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:12,160
and the beautiful naked body underneath is the sweetness that comes after grief

342
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:19,720
the hurt you Embrace becomes Joy maybe we can learn the value of

343
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:26,800
staying present engaged and available to life we can learn how to welcome more

344
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:32,800
and more aspects of Life the beautiful and the difficult and this is how we

345
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:39,240
don't make it worse this is how minute by minute

346
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:43,640
moment by moment just don't make it

347
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:51,599
worse there's time for one last poem maybe if you can hang in there this is

348
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:58,960
by Rosemary wola traumer it's called skiing Into the Storm

349
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,359
I love the days when it feels right not to turn from not to turn from the storm

350
00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:10,960
but to move deeper in when the body doesn't shy from the cold and wind when

351
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,720
the smile arrives as the storm magnifies and a whoop rises from the lungs like a

352
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,800
Fierce and Hearty bird what is in it what is in what is it

353
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:28,280
in us that feels more alive in these moments

354
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,880
thank you for your kind attention
