1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:07,839
hello everyone and welcome to this Monday morning meditation and I come to you from having

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,080
taught a retreat at our Retreat Center in Santa Cruz I see some of the names

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:20,960
are people who are there and so for this

4
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:28,400
morning I'd like to uh suggest that you take The Road Less

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,720
Traveled two roads diverged in a yellow

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,200
wood and I took the one less traveled and that made all the

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:48,360
difference and so the road that I suggest today is as you're being mindful as

8
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,960
you're present for your experience take the road where there's

9
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:00,519
no comment no comment we live in commentary we live in

10
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:06,439
judging we live in stories we live in planning the future remembering the past

11
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:13,040
all those are either disconnected from the present moment or

12
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:20,680
is some way that we're trying to manage the present moment but there is another way the RO

13
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:27,119
the way less traveled the way of being aware in a

14
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,159
very simple way without comment without telling

15
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:39,040
ourselves something what it means telling us what it's

16
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,840
about telling us where it's going the expectation without needing to judge

17
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:52,159
what's happening come to conclusions about what's happening where there's a emphasis on a

18
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,920
radical Simplicity to what is happening and the reason why this is a

19
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:05,280
great road to take is that there's much more happening

20
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:13,519
within you than you can be thinking about that you could be commenting

21
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:19,840
about and too often we live in the commentary and we believe it and

22
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,480
sometimes of course it is true but we're still living in it and it interferes

23
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,560
with something deeper unfolding some something more precious something more

24
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,760
valuable to it's almost like having no

25
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:42,480
comment gives room for something deep within us to

26
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,640
show itself to come and so as we sit

27
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:55,599
today the second kind of phrase that you might want to keep in mind is that of

28
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:02,159
breathing room we are giving when we bring attention to

29
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,200
breathing we're giving room for breathing room for breathing

30
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,720
to manage itself to leave it alone to breathe the

31
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,280
way we do no

32
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:25,879
comment and if we're aware of other things as we meditate each Act of awareness each Act of

33
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:34,159
mindfulness no comment and no comment includes not being for or

34
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:41,799
against it neither accepting it or rejecting

35
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:52,720
it so no comment so to assume a meditation

36
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:03,680
posture and to somehow adjust the [Music] arms the

37
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,920
Torso the head on a neck maybe maybe tipping the head back

38
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:17,519
and forth or gentle circle with the head loosening up the

39
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:26,280
neck maybe circling the shoulders a little bit just kind of wiggling the shoulders

40
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,840
a little bit so they can relax

41
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:37,120
and maybe swaying the whole torso back and forth

42
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:44,080
sideways finding a relaxed

43
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:58,560
midpoint adjusting your legs a little bit if that helps

44
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,120
and breathing

45
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:18,478
in maybe not a deep breath but but for you is a comfortable full breath

46
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,520
and if breathing is

47
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,039
uncomfortable to be in your

48
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,160
body and then letting the breathing return to

49
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:55,160
normal and with a normal breath to continue to relax the

50
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:01,639
body soften in the face

51
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,800
soften in the

52
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,639
shoulders soften in the belly

53
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,520
and as you exhale to imagine you're giving breathing

54
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:49,599
room for the commenting mind the thinking

55
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:55,160
mind give it space as if

56
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:01,520
it's all the space outside of your head is offered

57
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,960
to give breathing room to the thinking

58
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:20,240
mind and as you exhale Relax The Thinking mind

59
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:43,199
and then for a few moments here see if you can do almost nothing

60
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:53,440
next to nothing just be present be in the present be with the

61
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,680
present without directing the attention without

62
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:09,520
directing towards something without receiving anything in Awareness just be for a few

63
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:23,680
moments and whatever you're aware of no

64
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:34,839
comment whatever you're aware of allow it to have breathing room

65
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:41,440
space to be itself without you being

66
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,440
involved e

67
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:51,360
and if a breathing is the center of attention if breathing

68
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,480
Rises what's it like to breathe knowingly

69
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:08,720
with no comment No Agenda simply awareness of

70
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:22,480
breathing and as you continue take the

71
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:29,600
time take all the time in the world all the space in the world

72
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,720
to be aware with no

73
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
comment

74
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
for

75
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
for

76
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

77
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,160
e for

78
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,079
e e

79
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,759
no comment

80
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:31,319
including no commentary about make making

81
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:39,800
comments of course the mind will be involved in

82
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,720
commentary from time to

83
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:53,079
time no need to make commentary about that each

84
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:58,639
moment taking The Road Less Traveled

85
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,199
the road that's

86
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
quiet

87
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

88
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840

89

91

for e

102
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,600
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

103
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:06,919
to consider taking the road that is less

104
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:17,320
taken in a world where that does not know the difference between wholesome

105
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:25,120
and Al UNH wholesome maybe may we be

106
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,240
wise and not diluted in

107
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:39,440
in a world where the choice is between hatred and

108
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,559
kindness may we choose

109
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:50,440
kindness in a world where there is

110
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:55,559
greed may we choose generosity

111
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:07,080
and in doing so in a world where people are often

112
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:14,640
self-centered may we be may we care for

113
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:23,200
others may we be wise and kind and generous to nourish

114
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,480
ourselves and to benefit this world we live in

115
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:36,639
may all beings be happy may all

116
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:42,519
beings be safe may all

117
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:48,240
beings be peaceful may all

118
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,480
beings be free

119
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:07,730
[Music]

120
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,740
thank you [Music]

121
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:59,679
hello on this Monday morning in from in California and and

122
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:06,880
um the series of talks I'd like to give today little very much based on what uh

123
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:14,159
the theme of this My Last Retreat weeklong Retreat that ended yesterday teaching with Andrea

124
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:19,360
fella and uh some of you who heard that will recognize some of

125
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:30,039
it and I'll call this The Road Less Traveled and uh in Buddhist practice

126
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:35,320
uh there's often the emphasis on a path path of

127
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:43,480
practice and um and every time in every step there is a fork in the path there's

128
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:49,679
a path Less Traveled and the path that is

129
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:57,200
um that is um commonly traveled all too easily

130
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:03,600
traveled and in Buddhism we choose the path Less

131
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,919
Traveled sometimes it's called um going against the current um if you're

132
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:15,840
swimming up against the current of a river it's hard to or if you put something in the river it just floats

133
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:22,360
down it doesn't go against the current and um but in the commentary in

134
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:28,720
the in the um in the path model we take the path that is

135
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:35,039
wholesome there is the um uh UNH wholesome and the UN wholesome

136
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:42,080
very simple division and so things like um

137
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:48,039
lying is the UN wholesome Direction being honest is the honest is

138
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:54,760
the wholesome Direction being mean is UNH wholesome being kind is

139
00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:00,840
wholesome and because of this kind of pairing that can happen and it can seem that almost like it's just one or the

140
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:08,519
other it's kind of like a pairing of things which are of equal weight or equal something or coming from the same

141
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:13,639
place inside it's a choice in thinking or intentionality or something that's

142
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:19,880
kind of all occurring at the same place but in fact in the Buddhist teaching um

143
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:26,600
there are two different operating systems and that's my language for the Buddhist teachings but there's two

144
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:32,159
radically different ways of sources within us for

145
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:38,279
behavior and there's one whole operating system for the UNH wholesome and there's

146
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:44,639
a a completely separate operating system for the wholesome when the wholesome

147
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:50,039
arises out of the wholesome if the wholesome arises out of a

148
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:55,600
decision the the source of the UNH wholesome can be where we live with a

149
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:02,200
lot of thinking and concerns and stress and there can be a logical understanding

150
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:08,480
of consequences and what's going on and a decision there can be made to do the

151
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:15,760
wholesome thing but there's a it's it's not that kind of I I point up is not the

152
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:21,440
operating system in the control tower but rather the operating system

153
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:28,200
that's a from a deep Source within and so The Road Less Traveled uh

154
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:36,799
in this week I'm going to talk is less about a particular choice to do the wholesome thing over the UN wholesome

155
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:44,120
but the choice or the capacity to uh be connected to a deep Source inside that

156
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:52,320
is the source for the wholesome and and to not take the road the Common Road that is the source for

157
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:58,679
greed hate delusion the source for stress the clinging tension

158
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:05,880
and um and uh and we see in the Buddha's teaching repeatedly this dichotomy

159
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:12,159
between these two different modes of being without it being named uh so in in

160
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:18,320
a clear way that it's highlighted that's what he's talking about the

161
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:26,320
um uh but he does talk a lot about wholesome and UNH wholesome and uh and so one of the

162
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:32,919
distinctions is appear when he talks about the feeling tones of experience how things experience can be pleasant

163
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:40,240
unpleasant or neutral he talks about those feeling tones that are more on the

164
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:46,919
surface that have to do with how we are in contact with the world uh or how the

165
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:52,080
world is in contact with us so if um

166
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:59,000
there is um uh you know a called cold

167
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,320
wind uh the body feels cold and then

168
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,720
based on that uh we react we think that's unpleasant and now I don't want

169
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:16,280
it I want to change to get do something different um and um but it's the outer

170
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:22,878
World which is affecting us or we're oriented towards the outer world and what the outer world will do to us so

171
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:28,440
for example eating good food getting pleasure being nourished feeling lonely and thinking the world's going to

172
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:36,440
provide some some some reassurance by just eating a lot all kinds of issues that ways in

173
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:42,760
which we are counting on the world out there to be the source of our joy or

174
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:48,398
pleasure or wellbe or everything's going to be okay if the world is okay our

175
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:54,839
experience out there and so um this is is an outer

176
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:59,880
orientation um pleasure pain of the

177
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:05,560
world then there's the inner and the in inner is deep inside doesn't have to do

178
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:11,599
with how our senses pick up the outer World it involves a deeper connection

179
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:17,560
that to capacities within that in Buddhism maybe would be called sometimes

180
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:25,359
when they people translate this word that Buddha uses for that they call it spiritual I like to call it uh the kind

181
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:31,320
of inner Source inner um place for our inner

182
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:38,160
well-being and uh and so to uh know the difference between living a life which

183
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,839
oriented towards our happiness being provided by the the

184
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:50,480
world versus an inner life or happiness is provided by some deep Source within

185
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:56,079
that has been set free that has been opened up that is allowed to flow and

186
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:01,119
that deeper Source can't flow if we're living in the control tower of

187
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:07,520
reactivity uh to the world and and the world is not only the external world we

188
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:14,160
internalize the world in our thoughts and so it's some people's inner world is

189
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:22,440
completely shaped by the outer world if we're com thinking about um the past and

190
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:28,640
reviewing the difficult things in the past that would also be called being concerned with the outer world even

191
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:34,119
though it's the inner world that's thinking about it the control tower or

192
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:39,760
if you have wonderful thoughts about how to do great things in the world it might

193
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:45,319
just be more of the same might be the ego driven control tower the conceit

194
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:51,319
World which um and uh and to find a deeper way a

195
00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:57,760
deeper place of connection inside the and in this two different

196
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,800
modes that the Buddha one way or the other is talking about often uh he has

197
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:09,720
different metaphors for them and that's I want to talk about the metaphors today before go tomorrow going on with this

198
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:17,400
idea for this uh this uh UNH wholesome Source inside of us and it might all not

199
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:25,119
always be seen as UNH wholesome because sometimes our attachments are clinging or greed which are UNH wholesome uh can

200
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:30,359
can bring us beneficial things sometimes they're successful in getting

201
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:36,160
pleasure if um if I want to um if I'm lonely and want to go to the

202
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:43,520
refrigerator to eat to kind of sometimes the refrigerator might have some really good food and I'm successful and feel so

203
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:49,760
good and uh and so we can't see necessarily that it's UNH wholesome what's going on because we don't see the

204
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:56,560
underlying Drive of the UNH wholesome and how taking that road creates habit

205
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:02,359
that road takes reinforces this control tower operating

206
00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:08,960
system so this control tower operating system is um or this UNH wholesome

207
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,119
operating system if you may um the Buddha uses a lot of

208
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:19,920
metaphors to describe it and what stands out in those metaphors is they're all

209
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:27,200
things which are constructed by human beings and um and so for example he uses

210
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:33,920
the the idea of a house that's been constructed wooden house that's been built and um there's nothing wrong with

211
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:40,760
the house but except that it is built by a human being it's constructed and with becoming awakened

212
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:46,319
the Buddha said he had uh he said house house Builder you are seeing your

213
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:51,880
Rafters and beams have been destroyed never to be rebuilt again it's a a

214
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:58,280
little bit of a violent idea but uh but the context of that is that that instead

215
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:04,280
of living in the constructed World we're now going to live in in an organic world

216
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:10,520
the wholesome uh Source within is a source that's much more organic or maybe

217
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,800
biological and for that he uses um natural

218
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:22,160
metaphors and one of the common one is that of a plant growing a tree growing

219
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:29,319
it there's a seed that seed inside uh germinates it's Sprouts it grows it

220
00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:34,640
becomes a large tree it flowers and then it produces fruit and Awakening

221
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:40,200
sometimes is called the fruit of practice and um and the language that he

222
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:47,079
uses for uh what we call in English practice spiritual practice in poly in

223
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:52,280
ancient language was a word that had to do they're closer to Growing we're

224
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:58,319
growing something bavana uh often it's translated as cultivation and and they

225
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:04,280
think of it as cultivating like a gardener cultivating a plant a farmer cultivate doing

226
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:09,760
cultivation we don't construct the growth of the plant we support it to nourish

227
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,800
it and so over and over again the Buddha uses these uh metaphor of the

228
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:20,240
constructed things that human beings make to represent how we get caught in

229
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:25,800
another place he uses the word he uses the idea of a a trap that that a tra

230
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:31,599
that a a hunter uses to trap deer and again a trap is something we construct

231
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:38,800
and sometimes we build our own mental constructions me we build these thought constructions that are made of fantasy

232
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:45,319
of stories that are not accurate and um and or only partially accurate and then

233
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:51,280
we live in the story and sometimes when two people meet but they don't realize they're both living in this thought

234
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:57,960
construct that they and sometimes their thoughts constructs are similar enough that they can relate and sometimes they

235
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:03,319
completely miss each other because of they're not really listening from this deep

236
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:09,480
place but they're listening through the filter of the constructed world of stories

237
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:15,119
ideas that uh that we paint reality with world of projection is a metaphor we use

238
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:20,359
in the modern world we're projecting onto other people and um and it's not

239
00:41:20,359 --> 00:41:27,440
who they are but it they are we're seeing them through the lens of our projection so thought constructs

240
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:35,440
and so um the idea of a trap the idea of a of a uh the other thing that humans

241
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:42,880
build is if you want to tie two uh oxen together so they can both pull a plow

242
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:48,440
you build a yoke and then the two are tied together so the Buddha describes

243
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:53,800
how human beings in their attachment become yolked not to each other but

244
00:41:53,800 --> 00:42:01,079
sometimes to each other for sure but yolked to uh their what they're attached to and so you know you can't really get

245
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:06,319
away you it pulls you along and um and so again the

246
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:12,839
constructed World represents this and now it's the the uncon the world that's

247
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:18,440
not constructed that's within us that which is biological that grows that

248
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:25,200
flows and sometimes the Buddha uses the metaphor from the natural world of um a

249
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:33,359
river or stream flowing to describe um the the how how Dharma

250
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:39,079
practice how the Dharma begins moving through us and our job is to stay in the

251
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:46,680
river stay in the current so it can flow along and um so in the beginning of

252
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:53,319
practice the natural metaphor that's used over and over again is to walk a

253
00:42:53,319 --> 00:43:02,119
path to walk the path and uh you don't uh and and uh path maybe you make a path

254
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:07,599
sometimes by clear making a clearing but it's emptying something not constructing

255
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:12,920
something and then uh you walk the path and as you walk the path something grows

256
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:19,119
you get stronger and you're walking you become more fit for example if you and

257
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:24,480
then at some point uh you don't walk the path anymore but rather you're in the

258
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,559
river and you allow yourself to flow with the river so these are metaphors

259
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:34,800
that Buddha uses for this deeper operating system the wholesome operating

260
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:41,160
system and uh and that'll be the theme for this week uh The Road Less taken the

261
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:47,599
the road taken from this deep Source inside the wholesome operating

262
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:55,960
system so uh thank you and I hope that uh hearing this uh inspires you that

263
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:01,640
there is within you a wonderful capacity wonderful potential

264
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:12,480
uh natural potential in a sense that uh can support you and guide you through your life thank you very much
