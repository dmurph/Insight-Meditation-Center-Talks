1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:09,160
so good morning everyone welcome and for today I'd like to begin

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,599
by reading a Buddhist prayer for

3
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:20,680
peace it begins this piece with a quote from the Buddha and the quote

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:26,039
goes hatred never ends through

5
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:34,600
hatred by Love Alone does it end this is an ancient truth the

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:41,360
Buddha so the prayer goes begins this way Only

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,920
Love Can end the pain of hatred may all beings everywhere be

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:56,800
freed from the sufferings of War violence and hatred May those who are injured be

9
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:04,478
healed May those who have lost their homes and Country countries become guests in every home in every

10
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:12,240
country May th those who are devastated be fed clothed loved and

11
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:20,439
elevated May those who are scared be given safety May those who fight learn that

12
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:28,360
killing an enemy does not create peace it makes enemies for future

13
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:35,159
Generations May fight Fighters learn to fight with truth love

14
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:41,439
and respect which is how lasting pieace is possible

15
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:48,360
love is the best way to kill enemies because then they are

16
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:54,560
transformed into friends may we do what is more complex

17
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:01,399
than War may we create peace through intelligent and strategic nonviolent means

18
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:09,119
may we call on all our goodness and Good Will to contribute to the end of War

19
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:16,440
everywhere may we contribute to everyone's welfare and happiness with no

20
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,239
exceptions so by the end of this talk I'd like to

21
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:28,599
address the situation in gazam and maybe I'm addressing it already with this

22
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:35,760
prayer and so maybe the whole thing is but to explicitly be kind of near the

23
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,159
end and

24
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:47,200
um the um so I grew up

25
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:55,239
in living in many countries many places moving around quite a bit I went to

26
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:00,360
change schools 12 times in my first 12 years of school

27
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,840
and um but one of the consequences of that was and I'm I was then I was a

28
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,680
Norwegian Citizen and my wish when I was 11 or 12

29
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,840
was to have a not be a Norwegian citizen or an American citizen but I wanted to

30
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,879
have a United Nations passport uh because I wanted to belong

31
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,920
to the whole world I didn't want this thing of being you know it seemed kind of too narrow or too restrictive or too

32
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,920
nationalistic just to belong to a country that way and that was my

33
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:41,840
wish and uh and I love the idea of living in a Cosmopolitan area with lots of

34
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,599
diversity of all over the world and when I moved to uh San

35
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:56,319
Francisco area here uh in my 20s uh it was a lot less diverse than it

36
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:02,400
is now I mean certainly there was plenty of but but uh you know I think it's changed

37
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,840
dramatically and certainly this area of the peninsula Silicon Valley has become

38
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:17,479
dramatically more diverse place like Fremont and different places of the bay and uh I treasure it I find it's

39
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:23,639
fantastic this is the case and uh I kind of I have myself love the idea that

40
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:30,199
immigrants from all over the world come here to this country and find their way and are included and I'm know those

41
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:37,919
right so of course I would I kind of like that but um but then as uh what happens

42
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:44,360
when there's so much diversity from all over the world it's also a recipe for more

43
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:52,080
conflict and uh I was asked to somehow address an issue

44
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:59,960
that happened recently with um um right here in our neighborhood not

45
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,039
here but in in San Jose at the

46
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,479
uh State University of San Jose I don't know if some of you saw the news a few

47
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:16,360
weeks ago that uh the police were needed to be there for Professor who was going

48
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:23,840
to give a public talk a professor of Jewish studies who was going to talk about um the little history of the

49
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,160
conflict there and and the history of a two-state solution and someone who was

50
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:36,960
oppos to the violence that they're now in Middle East but it seems that there was a a

51
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:43,240
call out from Hamas to uh that there should be this should

52
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:50,280
be disrupted right here in our neighborhood and so that was that were

53
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:56,000
people were informed about this ahead of time and they um so the police were

54
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,600
called in and to be prepared and they decided to change the V menue of where the talk was going to be

55
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:09,360
given and uh in fact there were 100 people who came who to demonstrate and

56
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:16,039
and the way it was reported to me by people who were there there was calls for uh killing

57
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:22,440
Jews and uh then it was impossible to give the talk and the people who were

58
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,479
the speakers of the of that had to be taken out um under police escort there's

59
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:33,479
a large group of police and City Police at least waiting nearby because of they were expecting that there was going to

60
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:39,800
be some problems so I mean the Middle East Gaza

61
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:46,360
is not just in Gaza what's happening in this International world we live in it's

62
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,479
spilling over and the divisiveness of the Middle East is also becoming

63
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:57,080
divisiveness in our communities here and

64
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:04,360
uh and uh so somehow you know it's coming home I

65
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:10,960
felt like oh it's here in our communities as well and so how do we address it how do we live with

66
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:17,620
it how do we take it into account how do we understand it and

67
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:23,639
[Music] um the um so one way to understand

68
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:29,599
this and I don't want to diminish the the the suffering intensity difficulty

69
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:35,000
of this but there is an analogy that's used that comes from

70
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,479
Sports and that is that uh there F fans of teams that are playing a sport like

71
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:47,199
baseball or football where there are referees or umpires who have to make the

72
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,639
call when someone is you know done a foul or stepped offline or

73
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,960
something and uh sometimes the people making that called referees umpires make

74
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,479
a bad call or sometimes it's a little bit ambiguous maybe depending on the angle which you

75
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:11,800
see it or something and the phenomena is that if the umpires make the wrong

76
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,280
call the opposing team the fans get

77
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,440
furious even if it's ambiguous they're Furious if it's against their

78
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:30,400
team but the the team that got a favorable ruling you know that's the nature of the

79
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:38,279
game you know it's you know that no they they didn't really do it you know that was some you know the umire got it right

80
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:44,519
and you know there's never and never never you it's always kind of allowing for it or forgiving it or it's okay you

81
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:52,519
know and so there's this bias against the opposing team that elicits a kind of

82
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:58,200
anger but there's a kind of hypocrisy in that because for the home

83
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,839
team one's own team that people are willing to forgive them more or see it differently or don't see it it's not as

84
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:12,480
a big deal or it's not so serious it's not an ethical thing so much so this happens with uh politics it

85
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,480
happens with war between countries and people and there the issues are much

86
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,120
more intense because it isn't just simply the winning and losing of a team but it t ties into people's core

87
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,480
feelings of safety core feelings of identity of who they are as of people

88
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:37,519
core in issues of the suffering that they have gone through for maybe

89
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:45,320
Generations my father-in-law uh who uh was in the Nazi

90
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:53,079
concentration camps Jewish man who was a teenager was in the camps and with his parents his

91
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:58,120
parents didn't survive but uh he survived Bergen Bergen

92
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:04,360
bsum and uh barely survived and

93
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:10,600
um and that was pretty challenging for him the rest of his

94
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:16,040
life and he died 70 years or so after being released from the

95
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:22,800
camps and um I knew him right up to the last day of his life and the intensity

96
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,360
of that experience was with him 70 years later it was it carried it with him to

97
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:34,279
his death so the suffering that goes on and you know and I don't know how much it's

98
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:40,760
carried over into his children my wife um my my children have a grandfather who

99
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:46,079
was in the camps I wonder sometimes I wonder if it's more intense for them to

100
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:52,480
have heard the stories than it is for me because he I married into the family they're it's maybe a little different I

101
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:59,440
don't know if it's a little different or not but and my kids are relatively young so this the suffering uffing that

102
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:06,720
we carry for so many years and so the suffering of Jews in Israel I think you

103
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:14,360
know the the what happened in Germany now it's what 80 years ago and more is

104
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:20,920
still alive but the suffering of the Palestinians for now for maybe almost as

105
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:26,839
long in in some ways is very alive and one of the as I've told this story

106
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:33,040
before one of the formative experiences of my was being at the Zen Monastery where we

107
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:39,920
were isolated kind of deep in the Los Padres National Forest here where the the news was always late back then there

108
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:46,120
was no internet there was just the newspapers would come in and news magazines would come in and they'd

109
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:52,360
always come in to you know some days late and it was very interesting to get

110
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:58,240
uh old news because um fresh news is is

111
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:05,040
alarming but if you get if you read the news two or three days later it has a very

112
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:11,040
different feeling and it's more like uh it's not it doesn't elicit in me at least the

113
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,399
same level of present moment alarm it's like it's serious but it's has a

114
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:23,920
different feeling but anyway there was a Time magazine that came in and and I was in

115
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,959
the middle of a three Monon Retreat so I was pretty open quiet receptive in a

116
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:35,959
very different way than you are running around town and um and I opened up the

117
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:41,800
Magazine and there was um a spread of

118
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:48,959
photographs like I don't know four or five pages of the magazine of the Israeli bombing of a

119
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:56,000
Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut and I told that story here once

120
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,199
and a man who was sitting over in that corner turned out that he lived across the street from the refugee camp at that

121
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:08,920
time and he was one of the first people who responded to bury the dead and help

122
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:14,720
the wounded these things are not so far

123
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:21,760
away and um and uh innocent people were killed

124
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:29,639
children were made orphans that was 40 years ago and so

125
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,680
you know that suffering in that you know in Palestinians is still

126
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:41,560
there and that's just one own example and there's examples on both sides they're pretty dramatic so the idea that

127
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:48,440
you know you're rooting for your own team and willing to overlook what your team does I think makes more

128
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,199
sense uh when uh the stakes are so

129
00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:00,759
high and um so

130
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:13,920
and I've been to Israel and I was

131
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,000
stunned to hear the animosity that the Israelis

132
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,519
some Israelis had for the Palestinians stunned I went into the government

133
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:32,480
tourist agency in Jerusalem and the person behind the desk called

134
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,639
Palestinians dogs wow could this

135
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:43,480
be and I've been stunned by the hostility of Palestinians

136
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:50,199
and Arabs towards the Israelis it's just unbelievable that

137
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:57,240
people carry so much hatred and hatred doesn't

138
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:03,959
work hatred produces more hatred when you hurt

139
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:11,519
people through violence they will hate it's so easy so

140
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,720
so obvious you know as almost as a way of protecting oneself and or wanting

141
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,720
revenge and so it continues the cycles and I think the Middle East isn't

142
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:29,600
that the representative of for centuries Millennia of the cycles sometimes I'm so

143
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:37,160
surprised that they haven't learned the lesson it doesn't seem to have worked violence it just goes on and on

144
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:42,680
you know and and um so is there an alternative to

145
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:48,560
hate is there an alternative to demonizing other

146
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:55,519
people and and as long as people buy into this demonization that the politicians do

147
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:02,959
that societies do you you can't really find a way forward it's not going to be

148
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:09,360
possible it means you just keep it's in Annihilation pushing people

149
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:16,279
away so this you know and so this phenomenon the sports

150
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:23,319
phenomena I've done this thought experiment in my mind of wondering if the Palestinian somehow or

151
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:30,680
other magically had the upper hand right now and we're doing to T aiv doing to

152
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:36,639
Israel what Israel is doing to Gaza I think many people in United

153
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,800
States would be absolutely horrified and angry and upset would probably be

154
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:47,680
justifying the United States coming in uh with soldiers and

155
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:54,120
defending Israel and but the level of alarm among the general population of

156
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,560
what's happening the level of violence in Gaza is pretty Hamp

157
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:05,720
down given you know that you know just a phenomenal I mean it's just unbelievable

158
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:11,798
that over 30,000 people and civilians have been killed and they say that something 40%

159
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:18,199
of them maybe are children it's unbelievable I mean that's like

160
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,360
astounding and um so that's the context of where we're

161
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:31,640
at right some somehow so what does Buddhism have to say say about this like I I I study the

162
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:38,679
teachings of the Buddha and very interested in it and he has some things to say about

163
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:44,160
beauty and um and then he has this interesting statement that um what is

164
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:51,080
more beautiful than beautiful that doesn't make sense right but what's what's what's the what's

165
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:58,520
things are some certain things are beautiful but what's even more beautiful and the contrast for that is

166
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:04,080
what is harmful and what is more harmful than

167
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:13,200
harmful so what you know that's a kind of interesting statement and so um the

168
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:21,679
um so so this is what he says what is

169
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:27,720
harmful killing taking what is not given sexual

170
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,600
misconduct speaking falsely speaking

171
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,120
divisively speaking harshly speaking speaking

172
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:47,919
pointlessly being avaricious having hostility these are all

173
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:55,200
harmful and what is more harmful than

174
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,679
harmful encouraging others to kill encouraging others to take what is not

175
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:09,080
given encouraging others to involve be involved in sexual misconduct have others speak falsely

176
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:15,919
speak divisively speak harshly speak pointlessly be greedy be

177
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,960
hostile so any encouragement being a catalyst support for other people to be

178
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:27,679
this way that's more harm even more harmful maybe because the harm grows and maybe even expands exponentially some

179
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:35,360
point so then the Buddha said what is beautiful and the word for beauty kalana

180
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,640
also can mean excellent certain kind of but it's more it's a moral Beauty it's a

181
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,159
moral Excellence that's being talked about you'll see now so what is

182
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:53,799
beautiful abstaining from killing abstaining from taking what is not given abstaining from sexual

183
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:59,280
misconduct from speaking falsely speaking divisively speaking harshly

184
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,880
speaking pointlessly being greedy and being

185
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,039
hostile so that's so now you know probably what what's more beautiful than

186
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:17,880
beautiful um abstaining from killing yourself and prompting others to abstain

187
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:24,840
from killing abstaining from taking what is not giving and prompting others to abstain from taking what is not

188
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:31,480
given and so forth so this idea the prompting others encouraging others the

189
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:38,919
Buddha is kind of championing this so that Buddhism sometimes is seen as a non-violent religion that's often

190
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:44,200
interpreted as being a passivity but this is not

191
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:49,679
passive what's the best thing to do is not just to be ethical yourself but

192
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:57,159
encourage others to be ethical there's nothing in here about prizing Buddhism like what the best

193
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:04,880
thing you could do is make people people Buddhist the Buddha over and over and over again emphasized being ethical not

194
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,480
causing harm that that was a high highest value for this tradition this

195
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,679
religion for what the Buddha was about over and over again that was the reference point when he talked in public

196
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:22,559
to people and um and one of the important things about

197
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:30,039
being ethical this list is not being divisive

198
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,679
people who are are um div he describes that wrong

199
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:41,760
speech is being divisive speech where people love affectional ISM they love

200
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,799
creating divisions between people what the Buddha wants is a

201
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:52,080
language which is unifying that brings people together and supports those who

202
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:59,440
are already unified to be more unified so how do we do that

203
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:07,200
when I talked to about Kaza here in October I I spoke a little bit about it

204
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,080
they offered kind of a bu Buddhist point of view which was not to take sides but

205
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:24,279
offer kind of I don't know if a middle way is the right language but offer an alternative way that didn't involve taking sides I got um um emails from an

206
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:31,600
uh Israeli and a Palestinian remarkably they both had almost exactly the same

207
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:38,320
language to each other the the Palestinian criticizing me

208
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:45,559
for what I had said and the and the Israeli criticizing me for what I said and I thought wow I think I hit the

209
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:51,120
sweet [Laughter]

210
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,960
spot and um and so you

211
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,240
know and you know maybe what was at play there was the sports analogy right that

212
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:09,159
these people hear it different way and you know and are waiting to hear something that's for their side really

213
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:16,360
explicitly but is there a way of not taking sides is there a way of U and I talked

214
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:22,279
about back then about uh the example of tick nadan who was a peace activist

215
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:29,400
during the Vietnam war and he wouldn't take sides and' be in the in the division itally geographically between

216
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:36,360
the two opposing war sides Northern and South Vietnam and neither side trusted him

217
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:43,000
neither they were all angry with him thinking that basically thinking that he was part of the other side if you weren't with us then you're not if

218
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:50,159
you're not with us then you're against us and so this it's so hard to have this middle line when people

219
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:57,279
have think they have a tremendous need for to maintain the division so that to

220
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:02,799
really defend themselves or protect themselves or to or to be able somehow

221
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:08,840
defeat the other and

222
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:19,480
um the Buddha said somewhere else he said among the types of beneficent

223
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:25,360
conduct among the best is prompting settling and establishing an unethical

224
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,799
person in ethical Behavior

225
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,279
so again this emphasis on being ethical so in terms of

226
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:46,520
Gaza and uh many people are calling for a ceasefire some people are demanding

227
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:54,399
it and um I think of course we want the killing to stop of

228
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:59,679
course there's another way of course something else can be

229
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:06,679
done of course all these people should stop being killed but can we ask for a ceasefire

230
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:12,520
can we encourage it not as a demand but in such a way that the

231
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,960
Israelis become inspired themselves they realize this is not a good deal there's

232
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:24,240
a better way of doing it because to come down with the demand

233
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,840
it's maybe more of the divisiveness So I myself would not like

234
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:36,799
to would not like to be in a situation people have asked me to sign things and stuff that more like

235
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:42,880
demands and um that's not what I think I want to do but of course they should

236
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:49,120
stop doing it I have no doubt about it I want to encourage Israel to stop but the

237
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:55,240
way that how do we do this in a way that is effective maybe for the long term or

238
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:02,679
effective for the short term and um the

239
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:09,200
um and so but it's an act you know it's for

240
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:16,039
some people it's very difficult to imagine an alternative way the the the

241
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:21,679
imagination it it it uh challenges the imagination that there's any other way

242
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:29,600
besides VI violence for some people that's the only way you can get your way and it has to be that way

243
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:36,200
and is it that really the case and is it to degree the violence to the degree

244
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:42,640
that's what we're seeing it is in Kaza right now I mean these are really important questions it's really

245
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:49,520
important to look at ourselves what we defend what we feel is right what we how we buy into some of

246
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:56,640
the rhetoric um and what's motivating us to take sides for example where does our

247
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:03,399
sides come from and what is our belief system what's understanding about social change and what's our understanding

248
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:11,840
about impact that violence has in our societies do you know maybe Israel will

249
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:19,200
get something of What It Wants by destroying Gaza my

250
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,760
father-in-law was impacted for 70 years rest of his life by what happened in

251
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:31,600
Germany what's going to happen to the Palestinians and how long many years are they going to be impacted by this and

252
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:38,480
not forget and

253
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:47,440
um so calling for peace of course we should do

254
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:55,360
that but we shouldn't just do it we should also be available so in this situation at San

255
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:02,600
Jose State University I was asked to write a letter to the president of the

256
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:09,480
university and I did je Jewish man asked me to do

257
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:18,080
it and so I wrote but I said to him you know I'll write the letter but I don't know if if it's what you what you

258
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:26,440
want but I'll show it to you first and um and

259
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:33,720
um and then you know the short version of what I said was I asked the president to

260
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:41,200
um to uh not be uh to be asked her to be

261
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:47,360
impartial to be concerned for the welfare and happiness of everyone on her

262
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,960
campus and including the ones who she hadn't been caring for

263
00:28:52,960 --> 00:29:00,279
yet and then but then I said um I presented myself as a local

264
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,840
Minister and um and I said that

265
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:14,480
um um and if I could be of help to you for this process let me

266
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:21,120
know so how do we help what do we do the final thing I'll say about this

267
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:27,360
is that um there's been uh times very important

268
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:34,360
important moments in my life that I was changed by what happened in the world in fundamental ways so the time at tasahara

269
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:39,880
when I saw the bombing of the refugee camps in Beirut that was a huge impact

270
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:45,799
on me partly because I was in the monastery on Retreat partly because I had been to

271
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:51,519
Beirut as a child so I knew the place partly because I grew up part of my

272
00:29:51,519 --> 00:30:00,880
growing up my cosmopol and moving around was I lived on the edge of the Mediterranean in Italy and um and so

273
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,799
it's just down the corner around the corner you know with Beirut and you know it's just part of all the same

274
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:13,799
world so to see my own world being bombed was was such a big impact on me

275
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:21,320
and and uh and it changed me and part of that change is why I'm here today it

276
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:29,159
part of that change was I decided I was going to use my life to to address suffering in this world through Buddhist

277
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:36,799
practice and I thought this was the for me this was the way that I wanted to do it because I felt the it's the only

278
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:42,519
thing I knew in my life that touched the root causes of suffering in a human

279
00:30:42,519 --> 00:30:50,399
being and I was going to do other things to try to support the world but I felt that um I did the other things I

280
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:56,120
wouldn't actually be able to touch the very root of suffering in the human beings and I didn't think I'd be

281
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:03,000
effective as a Zen priest then monk but at least I was trying to address the core issues of suffering the attachment

282
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:10,679
the deepest attachments we have so that that took took me in this direction before that the big impact on me was

283
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:16,720
when I went to first two years in college was at the University of California of Santa

284
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:22,720
Barbara and I was there right after there was this huge oil spill one of the biggest maybe one of the first biggest

285
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,399
oil spills in the country um and um

286
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:34,039
and that had a big impact and going to school right after that and taking classes enironmental studies had a big

287
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:41,159
impact on me and that was a catalyst for me to really want to live a life adult life of trying again try to address some

288
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:46,200
of the problems of our society and I was going to become environmentalist I got a

289
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:54,480
little bit sidetracked a different kind of environment and then um the next one

290
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:01,399
that had similar impact on me was 911 and um so this is what I I want to tell

291
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:07,399
you this for a particular reason is that um so that was huge for

292
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:15,360
the country for those of you who remember it it was huge a big big impact and and um I'd seen similar things not

293
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:22,279
of that magnitude happen um where kind of seemed like everyone went back to business as

294
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:29,559
usual you know things things didn't really change and I thought you can't with this can't happen this time this is

295
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:35,080
so big that I have to be different something has to change I I felt like I

296
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:42,399
would do a violence to myself if I wasn't changed by 911 so I spent about nine months

297
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:50,519
thinking what what how how am I going to be different what am I going to do is different and then I decided that uh

298
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:57,600
what we would do would we would create a Buddhist chapy training program didn't

299
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,519
address the issues directly of you know 911 but it addressed uh the issues of

300
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:09,240
the issue of addressing suffering in our society in a very different way and so the Sati Center of Buddhist

301
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:15,679
studies that I help founded in 1997 was um mostly doing classes in

302
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:23,200
Buddhist history philosophy practice he said that's not enough we have to do something addresses the conditions of

303
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:31,480
our society so we created a Buddhist japany program and that it's been going on now for 22 years and we've traded

304
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:37,600
hundreds of people in Chaplan SE and I call it a pyramid scheme for

305
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:44,559
Joy because all these people go out into hospitals and prisons and hospices and

306
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:49,799
homeless situations and do this wonderful compassionate work it's really

307
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:57,240
really a great thing and that's growing and been very successful it's actually doubled in size in the last year and and

308
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:04,279
that's going well so that was a change the reason I'm telling you this story is because for me personally I feel what's

309
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:11,200
happening in Gaza right now is of the same magnitude and I feel I have to be I have

310
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,480
to be changed by this I can't respect what the impact and the value of this

311
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:23,040
and just go back to but I don't know what to do and I can give a talk about it

312
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,398
now but that's not enough so I'm wondering so it it took nine months last

313
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:36,398
time to know so people are demanding that you know some people demand that I do

314
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:42,638
things and um and that's not how I

315
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:50,720
operate but uh but so I don't know I'm I'm watching listening being present for

316
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:56,720
all this seeing what is what what will I do how will I be different what will I

317
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:02,760
what what has something has to change

318
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:09,800
so now you know what's more beautiful than beautiful maybe it's

319
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:16,040
complicated ethically what's going on in Gaza for many of us for many of

320
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:22,200
you and exactly what the ethics of it are and how you understand it is maybe a

321
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:28,799
difficult thing to sort out and figure out but

322
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:35,880
even so the Buddha thought that the most beautiful thing to do more beautiful

323
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:42,200
than being ethical is to promote ethical life for in others to encourage it to

324
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:49,560
support it not to demand it not to prosze for it not to make anyone feel

325
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:55,160
belittled by it but it's much more difficult

326
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:01,359
work the work of somehow inspiring others to live ethically I think that's

327
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:08,680
the movement for the Buddha he was never in a position to demand anything of people or assert or be aggressive about

328
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:15,440
it but how do we Inspire it more ethical world that we live

329
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,520
in and um I think it can be done but it

330
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:26,119
I think it's a very sophisticated thing to do it takes intelligence it takes

331
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:35,319
strategy it takes care and but most important if we want to inspire ethics

332
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:40,200
and others we have to be

333
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:47,079
ethical if we want to have an ethical world that we live in we have to feel

334
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:52,920
that this is important and one of the biggest ethical

335
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,319
principles in Buddhism is to avoid causing harm

336
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:05,400
and this contrast here between the most beautiful versus the Widow doesn't say what's ugly

337
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:12,319
and what's more ugly than ugly he talks about what's beautiful and more beautiful but what he says is what's

338
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:18,240
harmful and what's more harmful than harmful in another place where he talks

339
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:25,880
about similar contrast he uses a different word for beauty for good states of mind but for bad states of

340
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:33,040
mind and the on prompt on unethical activity he calls them

341
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:40,319
unskillful so it's very polite you know because you know not trying to create division not make anybody feel bad about

342
00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:45,960
themselves and how do we do that how do we really Inspire goodness in all of us

343
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:54,079
how do we Inspire some different way how do we disp Inspire uh unification Unity

344
00:37:54,079 --> 00:38:02,240
how do we Inspire other people who respect each other each other dare I say love each other how do we inspire people

345
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:09,440
that they don't want to spend their life hating what does it

346
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:16,319
take so I I'll read that to end I'll read this the poem by the

347
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:25,119
Buddha hatred never ends through hatred by Love Alone does it end this is

348
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:31,200
an ancient truth so may you

349
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:38,440
love may love be at the center of our practice for yourself for others and

350
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:45,520
even for your enemies and this prayer I think is very powerful statement for me that yes if

351
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:52,480
you want to fight and kill your enemies there's a way of killing

352
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:58,920
them you love them so much they become your friends they're no longer enemies like the enemy

353
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:04,359
has been killed but you didn't kill the person you transformed

354
00:39:04,359 --> 00:39:10,400
them may we transform our enemies into our enemies into our friends in this

355
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:16,599
process so thank you
