00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:12,480
hello everyone welcome to this beginning of the week

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:20,760
meditation and I want to begin with a little saying

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,980
cliche that I like to say but to say it for for the purpose of

4
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,500
this meditation and that is uh

5
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,960
Buddhist practice mindfulness practice does not work

6
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:47,879
if you don't do it and this simple idea that we have to do

7
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,879
it is actually at the heart of what's necessary to engage and to think about

8
00:00:53,879 --> 00:01:00,360
to be involved in but what I'd like to propose today

9
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:08,340
is as you're meditating from time to time you'll notice you're not practicing

10
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:15,540
you're lost in thought or you've drifted away or something fallen asleep

11
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,960
and when that happens then um

12
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,560
you can um not just kind of then Gear Up and

13
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:35,880
tighten up and really do the practice but rather to appreciate that

14
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:44,159
recognizing that you weren't doing it recognizing you're not doing it that is mindfulness that's that you're

15
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,220
actually doing it when you're recognizing you're not doing it

16
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:56,720
and why that is why that's useful to see it this way is it that simple recognition hopefully

17
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:03,619
relaxed the first initial see oh I'm not doing it

18
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,119
that is kind of clear but relaxed

19
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:16,080
it's not forceful there's no strain there's no tension hopefully in that simple recognition

20
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,900
oh I'm not doing it and rather than then

21
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:29,520
buckling up gearing up to do the practice build on that continue in that kind of

22
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:37,400
ease that kind of simplicity to begin again with your breathing maybe inviting your breathe breath back in

23
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,920
and there's something about this relaxed but then diligent attention diligent doesn't mean

24
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,580
straining but it means that we keep doing it

25
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:56,120
so relaxed awareness of the present

26
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:05,340
where the effort is made to keep that relaxed awareness as continuous as possible

27
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:11,220
and we know it's not possible to really stay continuously continuous

28
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:16,620
so when you the continuity has been interrupted

29
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,780
you'll have an opportunity again to recognize oh I'm not doing the practice

30
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:28,640
and so it begins again so

31
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:38,580
establishing yourself in a meditation posture

32
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:46,159
that supports both alertness and relaxation

33
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,459
gently closing your eyes

34
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:15,360
into real relax your body take a few long slow deep breaths

35
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,600
feeling whatever tension there is in the body as you inhale

36
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:27,919
relaxing whatever can be relaxed in the body as you exhale

37
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:03,180
letting your breathing return to normal and with a normal breath on the inhale

38
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:10,199
feel your thinking mind and on the exhale

39
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:15,440
see if you can calm the thinking mind

40
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,860
let it settle

41
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:21,139
and then settling into your breathing

42
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,460
noticing if there's any ways in which your breathing is tense or held

43
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,620
there's a resistance to either bringing breathing in or

44
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,220
breathing out

45
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:50,000
and if there is can you lighten up ease up

46
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:55,400
any tension associated with breathing

47
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:22,979
and then settling into mindfulness of breathing

48
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:30,620
as if you're going to do it for the Long Haul each breath

49
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:38,400
is a breath to be aware of in a relaxed

50
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,599
diligent way

51
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,819
and if your mind wanders off and you're not doing the practice

52
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:57,900
when you eventually realize that I appreciate the Simplicity of that

53
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:03,860
realization the earliest inklings of it

54
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:11,580
and if it's relaxed let that be the basis

55
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:18,560
for relaxed awareness that begins again with the breathing

56
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:48,019
how are you doing the practice

57
00:13:51,660 --> 00:14:00,300
or might you be doing the practice half-heartedly with your attention divided between

58
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:08,779
kind of being present for the breathing but mostly involved in thinking

59
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:20,700
and if there's a kind of aware of breathing appreciate that

60
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:26,700
and then put more attention into that

61
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,079
focus on breathing

62
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,300
all right foreign

63
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,700
all right

64
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:21,960
if you can identify relaxed awareness of breathing

65
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:29,760
relax to mindfulness add to that the effort

66
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,380
for it to be continuous

67
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:46,740
where you don't lose the relaxed quality but there is a heightened attention

68
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,760
to hanging in there with it staying with it

69
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,559
being settled on it

70
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:34,919
and then gently to almost Savor the fullness of

71
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:40,020
breathing breathe in slowly

72
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:48,659
and deeply a long inhale to reconnect more fully

73
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:56,159
with your body a long exhale to settle your body in

74
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,140
preparation for ending the meditation

75
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:14,000
long deep inhale to feel

76
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:23,539
Your Heart Center to feel whatever capacity you have

77
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:32,000
for tenderness warmth kindness or love

78
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,919
for yourself for others for the world

79
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:46,880
letting your breathing return to normal

80
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,940
we're bringing it now to mind the world that you'll go back to

81
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,520
or enter into and you finish the meditation

82
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,380
and to wish that world well

83
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:10,279
appreciate how wonderful it would be wonderful it would be

84
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:17,520
if people were safe and happy

85
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:23,039
their lives could be peaceful safe free

86
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:28,399
unburdened with no oppression

87
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:36,260
and wishing that extending that

88
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,419
wishing that your life can contribute

89
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:48,059
to a better world may all beings

90
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:55,880
be happy may all beings be safe

91
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,640
may all beings be peaceful

92
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:06,500
may all beings be free

93
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:20,489
[Music]

94
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,340
thank you

95
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:56,760
hello everyone and today we'll begin a new series five

96
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:04,080
part series and this week it'll be right effort

97
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:10,260
I gave the talk yesterday morning on this topic so some of this will be repeating it

98
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:16,460
and um but I've been appreciating lately quite a bit uh renewed

99
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:22,440
understanding of right effort that value greater appreciation for it

100
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:30,960
and uh the importance of it and uh there is a bit it's a right effort

101
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,659
the word effort for some of us at some point at least for me at one point was

102
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:47,700
probably something I didn't care for or worse because I interpreted effort as being uh somehow

103
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:53,640
a strain so you have to kind of apply more effort than it's needed if you're

104
00:30:53,640 --> 00:31:02,000
making effort and um I'm a person who enjoys doing

105
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,620
kind of a lot of things I do physical work I enjoy doing and mental work I

106
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:14,820
enjoy doing and the doing of it I don't think of as effort the word or didn't used to the

107
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:20,220
word effort to me means you do it but then you do it with more more Force

108
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:26,279
and uh which causes a strain or being tired so I historically I didn't have a very

109
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:33,720
kind of much relationship to this um what's the sixth factor of the Eightfold Path

110
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:39,779
because of the word effort was being used um I value when one I heard a teacher

111
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:44,880
talk about right effort being right engagement then I had a better feeling

112
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:51,899
for it this is how you engage what you engage in and sometimes it's called a right

113
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:58,200
endeavor and that means uh that kind of interpret that to mean this is the right activity

114
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,600
so what's the right activity and it's my right effort has to do with mind what's

115
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:11,659
the right mental activity that we're involved in when we do meditation and these alternatives to effort uh

116
00:32:11,659 --> 00:32:16,860
engagement endeavoring activity

117
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:24,840
they for me kind of protect me from straining or making forceful effort

118
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:32,220
but I'll use the word right effort and perhaps this series should go coming along with

119
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:37,460
a big you know warning that says warning these teachings

120
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:43,020
might cause over efforting so

121
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:52,500
um hopefully with that warning we you know we don't interpret it that way but there is something in this Buddha's

122
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:58,440
teachings on right effort that is uh

123
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,779
um you know very determined very clear like this is what we do

124
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:10,020
and that Clarity and that kind of uh emphatic nature of the teachings

125
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:15,299
um should be taken a little bit as we understand there's a intentionality a

126
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:23,279
resolve a even a commitment to staying present and I love the word commitment because

127
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:29,580
apparently it comes from the Latin root like the same as Mitten to hand or to

128
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:36,000
touch and so um to uh to touch something to stay in touch commitment is staying

129
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,279
in touch with your breathing to make that commitment to stay there with the experience

130
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:50,519
okay so uh in in the teachings of right effort there are four right efforts and

131
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:55,620
many years ago I heard that there was a meditation practitioner who heard these

132
00:33:55,620 --> 00:34:02,820
teachings and came up with uh kind of an alternative or kind of came up with an example she said but you heard the

133
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:09,720
teaching oh um I kayak off in the in the open ocean in

134
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:15,240
Alaska and this is exactly how we had the effort we have to make when we're up there

135
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:25,320
and she then uh listed as you said when you're kayaking in the ocean and stay out of danger

136
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:32,060
if you're so that's the first effort so stay out of danger make the effort to stay out of danger

137
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:38,040
the second is if you're in danger get out of the danger

138
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:45,378
the second effort the third effort for a Kai actor and the kind of dangerous situations potentially

139
00:34:45,379 --> 00:34:51,960
is learn good kayaking skills and the fourth effort is to maintain

140
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:57,359
them keep them going so in the Buddhist terminology

141
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:03,839
it's danger is unwholesome states of mind so unwholesome activities of the

142
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:09,420
mind that in and of themselves are afflictive and we don't always see it's

143
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:14,940
if they're afflictive because like for example resentment really hurts the

144
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:22,500
resenter probably more than the person were resentful towards but we don't see that because

145
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:27,780
we're so focused on the object of resentment in mindfulness practice we turn the

146
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:33,660
attention around 180 degrees and we start seeing feeling the cost oh this is

147
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:40,560
actually painful for me so the unwholesome is always hurting the person who has them but we all we don't

148
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:46,440
often know that and it's afflictive it's called so the

149
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,540
um so that's what the character called being in danger so avoid being in danger

150
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:57,540
avoid um unwholesome states of mind

151
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:03,740
the second is if unwholesome states of Mind arise

152
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:10,760
let go of them abandon their languages abandon them and I'll talk more about that tomorrow

153
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:17,160
and then the third uh the uh the skill part the

154
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:24,540
[Music] the learn skills evoke wholesome states of

155
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:31,440
mind and um and you know generosity and goodness and mindfulness and Equanimity

156
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:39,060
patience there's a whole slew of things that we can call upon and develop and strengthen the paramis the ten paramis

157
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:47,579
for example the the seven factors of Awakening and um and then so developed uh you know

158
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:54,480
bring them on evoke them learn those skills and then maintain them

159
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:00,420
but actually we'll see we talk about this fourth right effort it's more than

160
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:06,839
just maintain them it's to expand them grow them help them to

161
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:15,480
flourish within us and um so avoid

162
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:23,220
abandon evoke and and maintain

163
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:29,940
these are the four kind of Endeavors engagements activities we're doing with

164
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:37,079
the mind so it requires mindfulness it requires a mindfulness and and the

165
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:44,760
skill my mind mindfulness of really recognizing what's going on in the mind and the skill one of the wholesome

166
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:51,540
mental qualities the ability the wisdom to see the difference between mental

167
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:57,119
States activities thoughts that we have that are afflictive

168
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,640
to ourselves that are somehow undermine us or debilitate US and those which

169
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:09,560
benefit us and this includes being able to navigate

170
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:15,060
the strong lawyers in the mind or the strong uh

171
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:21,660
debate champions in the mine that have the ability to argue the case for why we

172
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:28,920
should be resentful the person deserves me to be resentful or to be angry or to be spiteful or to be greedy and to have

173
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:34,380
more of something that we can get kind of enamored in this

174
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:40,140
world of the unwholesome so we don't see and feel how detrimental it is to ourselves

175
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:46,140
and we might not know and people who don't know that there's a much better alternative in the wholesome side of it

176
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:51,900
all um including better ways to take care of ourselves and protect ourselves

177
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:57,720
will often feel like it's Justified or required to continue down the route of

178
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:05,220
the unwholesome and um but it's uh not required in fact

179
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:10,560
uh if we take so some people it takes a long time to appreciate how much they're

180
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:18,000
undermining themselves they're at a dead end that doesn't go anywhere um and um you know sometimes we have to

181
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,339
kind of redo the same unwholesome behavior many many times to finally

182
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:31,400
darling us this is not really working are not working well enough for not working in the way that's helpful

183
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:37,140
so uh the first one is to avoid

184
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:44,040
having unwholesome states of Mind arise and um and whether that you know so

185
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:52,260
agreed hate and delusion Envy conceit covetousness contempt cynicism

186
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:57,660
the you know they maybe insolence all kinds

187
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:04,640
of things that includes and um and to avoid so how do we avoid them

188
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:10,260
first uh as we become more mindful of ourselves what's happening really

189
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:16,320
staying in touch with ourselves then we start recognizing uh when we're in

190
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:21,480
unwholesome states of Mind are not present and so with this heightened sensitivity

191
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:28,380
to seeing when the stressful States arise so so then we you know then we can let

192
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:33,560
go of it which is a second but also we start recognizing

193
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:40,260
behavioral things that we do that might be the condition for these unwholesome

194
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:46,200
states to arise if someone's addicted to something on

195
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:51,500
the web certain kinds of you know drives

196
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:57,380
then maybe stay away from websites that support that addiction

197
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:07,020
otherwise you know it gets stronger and stronger get pulled into its vortex if if uh you know just something as

198
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:13,560
simple as if you walk down a street that has a lot of stores in it and then you start thinking about you know all the

199
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:20,180
things you want to buy and then you find yourself in a store or buying things and you tend to buy things too much then or

200
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:27,000
impulsively then maybe don't walk down that street if you know you have that tendency if they take the long way

201
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:33,359
around the block or something if there are certain people for whom you find yourself you know becoming

202
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:40,500
increased having increasingly unwholesome States arise when you're with that person then be very careful how you are with

203
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:47,880
that person maybe always show up well rested well fed well hydrated

204
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:54,359
um come show up in a good state of mind so you can kind of withstand the example or

205
00:41:54,359 --> 00:42:01,020
the atmosphere of someone who is always angry and it gets you angry or something

206
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:06,480
and um or limit how much time you spend so you've noticed that if you spend half

207
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,420
an hour with the person an hour it's okay but more than that then you get grumpy and then once you're grumpy

208
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:18,420
things start going downhill so you know be careful monitor yourself at the input

209
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:25,200
what you do the behavior you have and make sure you get enough sleep be sure you get you know the basic

210
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:31,560
healthy things you do for yourself and exercise whatever it takes so that

211
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:37,859
you are protecting yourself from the arising of unwholesome states of mind

212
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:47,460
and uh might I say also one of those things is to meditate that meditation is a protective uh

213
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:55,619
means that meditating every day really can protect you from getting swept away

214
00:42:55,619 --> 00:43:02,400
or cut up or even even um you know in unwholesome states of

215
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,560
mind so it takes it takes some this is so on

216
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:15,180
one hand there's mindfulness and then there's the right effort to avoid unwholesome States

217
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:20,640
to arise and that avoidance involves using your intelligence

218
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:27,599
it does involve thinking it out and planning and considering and reflecting how did how is it that these unwholesome

219
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:34,859
states arise in me and what behaviors what conditions what context does it does this happen and

220
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:40,920
what can I do to change my behavior to change how I live what I do to protect

221
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:46,920
it and um so a wise Dharma life is one that

222
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:53,940
actually reflects in a good healthy beneficial way the kind of behavior we're doing and

223
00:43:53,940 --> 00:44:01,859
what behaviorally what can be changed if we're only relying on mindfulness without changing our Behavior we're

224
00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:07,400
probably not giving ourselves the full opportunity of what this practice can do

225
00:44:07,819 --> 00:44:14,460
so uh so you might over this next day

226
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:21,359
consider this first right effort the effort to avoid the

227
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:28,859
arising of unwholesome unskillful unbeneficial states of Mind activities

228
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:34,380
of mind and now see plan ahead now if you are

229
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:40,800
think about the rest of the day for a few minutes and what do you think would be a good way to go about your day

230
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:46,800
is to optimize that avoidance what are the contacts and conditions

231
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:54,859
that bring it about and what can you do what can you change behaviorally so for this day today there's less chance for

232
00:44:54,859 --> 00:45:02,099
unwholesome States arise and it might be as simple as if you're going someplace

233
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:07,980
that you give yourself extra time to get there so there's a much less chance that you

234
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:13,020
feel hurried or angry at the traffic or whatever it

235
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:20,099
might be because the extra time built in that kind of ease and to the whole

236
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:25,200
Endeavor so giving yourself lots of time to do what you have to do

237
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:33,300
is one way to do this avoidance so thank you and uh

238
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:39,740
tomorrow we'll do the second factor of right effort thank you
