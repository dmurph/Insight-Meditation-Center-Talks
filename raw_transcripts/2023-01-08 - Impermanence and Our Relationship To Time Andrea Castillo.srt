1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:03,720
so good morning everyone

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,899
the title of the talk today is

3
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:08,820
impermanence

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,098
and our relation to time

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,619
so I want to begin with a chant in Pali

6
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,600
that maybe some of you know it's a

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,520
beautiful short chant

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,020
that

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,460
with just a few words captures

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,279
what impermanence is for us in the

11
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,859
Dharma

12
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:33,920
and as you listen perhaps you want to

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,760
keep in mind how this chant has been

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,879
chanted for centuries and countless

15
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,940
Generations that have been born and died

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,040
have been chanting it and as we hear it

17
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,280
or chanted we're connected to all these

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,140
people that go all the way back to the

19
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,360
Buddha that have practiced

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,399
and

21
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,020
try to face this reality of impermanence

22
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,940
so if you happen to know the chant feel

23
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,739
free to chant with me

24
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,100
foreign

25
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,240
Domino

26
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,680
tea

27
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:29,159
testamental so cold

28
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,220
possible translation would be all

29
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,159
conditioned things are impermanent

30
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,600
they arise and they pass away

31
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,180
understanding this deeply brings the

32
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,520
greatest happiness which is peace

33
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,259
so with this talk we want to

34
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,899
explore from one particular perspective

35
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,540
and permanence impermanence is such a

36
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,360
big big topic it's one of the three

37
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,299
Universal characteristics

38
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,459
and it's so big that we have to come

39
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,500
back

40
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,959
over and over again and from different

41
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,060
perspectives

42
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,300
this makes the our journey to get closer

43
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,459
to this concept much more interesting

44
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:26,040
and then also understand that it's not

45
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,780
just the concept it's something that we

46
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,000
have to embody that we really have to

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,599
intuitively know

48
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:39,959
the first time that

49
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,280
um I came in touch with impermanence in

50
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,980
a long retreat a three-month retreat

51
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,739
the way that I would describe it the

52
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:54,180
sense that I got was desolation

53
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,800
and

54
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,840
that's why we have to come back many

55
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,000
many times because

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,019
it takes a lot of practice to be able to

57
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:07,620
be with impermanence and not fall into

58
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,500
desolation so that was kind of like the

59
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,400
beginning to just touch this enormity

60
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,159
but as we go along and that has also

61
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,500
shown in my practice as we go along and

62
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,080
touch again into impermanence in it in a

63
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,540
deep way not just not just in a rational

64
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,220
way

65
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,519
then we begin to be in touch with that

66
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,879
luminosity in immensity that comes with

67
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,519
the understanding of impermanence

68
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,760
so you're talking about impermanence

69
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,640
through our relation to time for me is

70
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,659
like breaking this immensity into

71
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:57,260
manageable bits

72
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,500
and to me as I was thinking about it

73
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,879
this topic is uh particularly Rich

74
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,980
because it is as much a spiritual

75
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:11,640
question as an existential one and also

76
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,519
a practical one right I mean it's so

77
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:17,519
important how is it that we relate our

78
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,199
time from day to day

79
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:25,740
in a group of teachings that maybe some

80
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,919
of you have heard called the abhidhamma

81
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,080
found it interesting that time is

82
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,320
described as a mental phenomenon whose

83
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,060
purpose is to separate and Order events

84
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,280
so this is interesting this is separate

85
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,919
and Order events you know it's very

86
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,460
useful for us to be able to choreograph

87
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,360
our lives in community

88
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,780
but this definition also points by

89
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,940
saying it's a mental phenomenon that

90
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,280
we're dealing with something abstract

91
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,280
so in no way we're going to

92
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,620
Define what time is we're just going to

93
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,479
probe it a little bit here a little bit

94
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,780
there

95
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,940
because just thinking of time in terms

96
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,419
of seconds minutes hours I see it as our

97
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:18,780
feeble attempt to bring order

98
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,479
and control on something that we have no

99
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:24,259
control at all

100
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,720
Jorge Luis Borges the Argentinian poet

101
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,919
writes time is the substance of which I

102
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,180
am made of

103
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,259
time is a river that sweeps me away

104
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:40,460
but I am the river

105
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,120
so we can say that we are time we are

106
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,419
change

107
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,880
time you can also say is the span

108
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,740
allotted to us

109
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,080
from the time of our birth

110
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,780
to the time of our death

111
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,000
time is also understood in terms of

112
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,500
space

113
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,199
that is we visualize time

114
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,900
as a space that can be filled with

115
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,000
activities we plan how many things we're

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,400
going to fit in in a particular amount

117
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,840
or span of time

118
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,639
we look at time also as a commodity and

119
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,940
and something we own you know we speak

120
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,120
of I have time

121
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,000
but the Dharma teaches us otherwise the

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,280
Dharma teaches us

123
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,319
we only have the present moment we

124
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,800
really don't know if we have one year or

125
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,500
two years whatever time in our lives

126
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,460
so one way that I want to look at how is

127
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,460
it that we relate to time is how is it

128
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,620
that we have been conditioned it's

129
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,419
really quite an interesting question to

130
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:52,740
ask

131
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,120
ourselves how was I conditioned by my

132
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,819
family my culture

133
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:03,419
and as I asked myself the question the

134
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:05,280
memory came back

135
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,620
when I was a kid growing up in Mexico

136
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,860
City my mother was a ballet teacher and

137
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,199
every afternoon before she would go off

138
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,000
to teach her ballet classes she would be

139
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,160
running down the hall

140
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,259
right in front of our bedrooms and she

141
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:21,840
would call out one last

142
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,960
Direction use your time well because you

143
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,560
will have to give an account to God

144
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,940
I heard that every afternoon

145
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:34,800
so what did that say about me

146
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,740
I've had to realize that when we have

147
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,460
that relation to time

148
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,800
what she really meant is don't spend

149
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,139
your afternoon playing daydreaming which

150
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:48,780
is what I love to do

151
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,720
and so some of us grow up and have to

152
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,039
relearn how to play

153
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,960
and by play I mean just you know this

154
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,960
this frolicking just for the joy

155
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,919
of doing whatever it is

156
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,560
not every moment has to be filled with

157
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,300
striving

158
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,000
with producing or self-improvement

159
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,940
do we know how to rest just for the sake

160
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,220
of resting do we give ourselves

161
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,020
permission to just rest

162
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,880
in Retreats I have found that it is very

163
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,479
common to Find Yogis who have a hard

164
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,539
time giving themselves permission

165
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:43,020
to just be in the retreat and not to be

166
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,240
producing something

167
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,080
is as if we've been taught you have the

168
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,380
right to exist only if you're producing

169
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,519
does that sound familiar

170
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,860
so this is something many of us have

171
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,680
internalized in Western culture

172
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,220
but not all cultures have this attitude

173
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,100
for example in indigenous cultures in

174
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,260
Latin America they have a very different

175
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,779
relation to time

176
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:15,420
and a friend of mine was telling me of

177
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,720
this anecdote of um the he went to an

178
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,160
indigenous Market

179
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,899
and he saw this woman who was selling

180
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:25,380
beautiful hands woven baskets and so he

181
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,420
asked her would you would you sell me

182
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,980
all your baskets

183
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,940
and much to his surprise she said oh I

184
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,440
won't sell them all because what would I

185
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,019
do the rest of the day

186
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:39,600
so for us it's kind of a little bit like

187
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,620
well

188
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,839
but for her she enjoyed this this sense

189
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,380
of smelling seeing talking to people

190
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,600
being in her community

191
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,660
being the whole day in the market that

192
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,760
was an experience for her

193
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,420
and to me that conveys a certain kind of

194
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,040
contentment

195
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,240
that some of us

196
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,300
don't have because we're so busy rushing

197
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,680
from one activity to the other

198
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,019
the writer Oliver Berkman describes

199
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:19,380
that many of us are productivity Geeks

200
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,380
and I certainly was one with endless

201
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,339
to-do lists

202
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,700
so

203
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,339
most of us have the belief consciously

204
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:35,640
or unconsciously that if we only had

205
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,920
enough discipline

206
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,560
an organizational skills

207
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,920
that we would be able to do all we want

208
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,220
to do

209
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,600
therefore it is not surprising that

210
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,560
there are thousands of self-help books

211
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,560
to help you manage your time better

212
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:01,079
and all these books promise

213
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:04,440
us that if we manage our time well we

214
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,100
will once and for all get done all we

215
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,740
want and that we will have some control

216
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,560
over our lives

217
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,880
but

218
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,459
I think

219
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,980
you're here because in some ways you've

220
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,980
noticed that this keeps escaping us and

221
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,120
that that's not the way

222
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:30,959
there is one book that has been

223
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,060
published recently

224
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,360
that offers A New Perspective

225
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,660
this book was written by Oliver Berkman

226
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,300
and the title is 4

227
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:46,920
000 weeks time management for Mortals

228
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,140
so this is not a Dharma book this is a

229
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,000
book for a general public some of you

230
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,640
might maybe already know about the book

231
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,260
but what I really like is that from the

232
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,500
get-go he lets you know

233
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,500
we have only fourth in average four

234
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,440
thousand weeks to live

235
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,320
and we are Mortals

236
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,079
for the general public that's quite an

237
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:14,160
affront

238
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,980
to remind people that we have limits and

239
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,600
that we're Mortals

240
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,880
but I think this is precisely why this

241
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,399
book is so important for us

242
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,779
foreign

243
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,200
it was always already the case

244
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,060
that you would never experience a life

245
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,540
of perfect accomplishment or security

246
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,579
and that your 4 000 weeks have always

247
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:50,660
been running out

248
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,940
so this is the kind of honesty that we

249
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,880
are accustomed to in the Dharma but not

250
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,260
necessarily the General Public

251
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,440
the German philosopher heidega

252
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,399
describes succinctly with three words he

253
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,139
says

254
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:16,139
being towards death

255
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:19,440
sign Toda

256
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,740
and for me this expression with three

257
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,660
words is saying if you live your life

258
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,639
aware of your mortality

259
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,240
you will live a life that is much more

260
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,399
conscious

261
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,200
much more wholehearted

262
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,880
and you would let go of all kinds of

263
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,300
petty things that we get trapped

264
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,560
over and over again

265
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,940
so now I want to talk a little bit about

266
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,040
this very mysterious

267
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,279
aspect of

268
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,519
how subjective it is of the of how we

269
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,480
perceive time

270
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,420
I think we've all had a very intense uh

271
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,560
experience of that during covet lockdown

272
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,079
where many reported that they were

273
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,019
feeling like time had disintegrated for

274
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:35,459
them

275
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:38,579
and to me it felt that way because all

276
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:42,959
of our routines came to a halt and so

277
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,680
our relation to time really shifted

278
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,899
it's also interesting to notice in more

279
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:58,199
extreme cases like when we get

280
00:14:58,199 --> 00:14:59,820
the news

281
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,899
of somebody close to us that has died

282
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,380
something very interesting happens with

283
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,360
our perception of time

284
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,880
I don't know if you've noticed but the

285
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,120
way that I tried to explain it was that

286
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,579
perhaps we can imagine that our life is

287
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:21,000
like a film strip that is just flowing

288
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,760
and the events that organize our life

289
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,279
are are like the frames of the film

290
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:29,480
strip and when we get like shocking news

291
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,240
it is as if it falls

292
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,060
in between those frames it falls into

293
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,440
another dimension

294
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,899
and we feel as if we're floating in a

295
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:46,339
different space

296
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,260
I found it fascinating that the Greeks

297
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,920
actually had a term for this

298
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,980
they called it cairos

299
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,740
they also had the term for Chronos and

300
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,660
Kronos is what we are familiar with

301
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,940
that's measuring time according to

302
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,540
minutes and hours and weeks and a

303
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:11,100
calendar schedules that's Kronos

304
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,100
but Kairos is when we have this

305
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,160
experiences that are like Watershed

306
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,420
experiences that have a before and after

307
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,540
and I read you the way that Krista

308
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,199
Tippett describes cairo's time she says

309
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:29,940
it is a moment

310
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,180
that disrupts everything that came

311
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,300
before everything you thought you knew

312
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,420
cairo's moments are these pivot Points

313
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,880
when the questions you are asking

314
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,199
holding living actually change life is

315
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:49,980
suddenly unalterably defined separated

316
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:55,160
into a before and after

317
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,139
I think it's wonderful to have a word

318
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:03,180
for that

319
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,058
it's powerful to be able to name our

320
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:10,079
experience in our practice we know that

321
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,959
in meditation when we are observing the

322
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,160
mind

323
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,860
if we are able to come up with precisely

324
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,418
what's happening in the mind in the

325
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:20,520
moment there's a shift

326
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,839
it's like

327
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,678
we wake up

328
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,780
so there are many ways that in many

329
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,919
perspectives that we can talk about

330
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,100
of why is it that we perceive time

331
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,980
differently but I'll share one that I

332
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,140
think is important that Workman mentions

333
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,700
in his book

334
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,940
and that has a lot to do with our age

335
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,600
and he says our brains encode the

336
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,360
passage of time based on how much

337
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,120
information we process in a given time

338
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,400
interval

339
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,340
so for example in childhood when we have

340
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,700
endless new experiences

341
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,280
a year if you remember when you were a

342
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,000
child seems like an eternity

343
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,200
but as we get older life becomes more

344
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,620
habitual if we are not careful

345
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,900
we live in the same place we have the

346
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,000
same job we have the same relationships

347
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,160
and the sense of novelty diminishes

348
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,100
so then we have this sense that the

349
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,380
years are just kind of running like

350
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,760
water through our fingers

351
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:46,799
it is as if the texture of our live

352
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,320
loses its relief

353
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,020
and the days and the weeks and the

354
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,200
months filled with

355
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,280
unfortunately stale routines blur like

356
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,960
in a shapeless mask

357
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:05,460
the psychologist William James writes

358
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,100
and then it seems that the years grow

359
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,820
Hollow and they collapse

360
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,980
I found this when I read it it's like

361
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,400
the images it's shocking and sad

362
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,039
we don't want that

363
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:22,919
and and this practice gives us a

364
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,120
fantastic tool which is Sati mindfulness

365
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,960
which allows us to stay awake for every

366
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,280
moment

367
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,039
and if we practice now before we get

368
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,660
really ill

369
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,660
and are unable to have exciting

370
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,280
experiences

371
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,160
then we will be prepared and we will be

372
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,460
able to Delight in little details like

373
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,520
how the Sun is suddenly shimmering on a

374
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,660
little piece of foil paper

375
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,400
but we have to we have to really take it

376
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,179
seriously now

377
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,700
so if I sum up just to a couple of ideas

378
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,460
of what Berkman presents in his book I

379
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,919
would say

380
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:17,220
that he says accept that you can't do

381
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,580
everything

382
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,200
very important

383
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,880
and then

384
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,820
once you clarified what are the things

385
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,160
that are important important to you I

386
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,860
mean really take the time and clarify

387
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,740
this is what is important to me then you

388
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,679
go and do them wholeheartedly

389
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,860
and all the other things that you cannot

390
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,260
do because you'll recognize your limits

391
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,600
you put aside

392
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,700
and you're free of guilt

393
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,799
so you can see that when you look at

394
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:58,440
this this way it has a lot to do with

395
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,020
renunciation that we talk about a lot in

396
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,500
the Dharma

397
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,299
renunciation because you are accepting

398
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:10,140
from the get-go that you can't do it all

399
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,660
and you let go of the things that

400
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,280
you know you can't get to it

401
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:19,620
and Berkman says it is about

402
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,480
transforming

403
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,679
what he calls the fear of missing out on

404
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:26,820
something

405
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:32,039
to the joy of missing out on something

406
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,320
not interesting the joy of missing out

407
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,179
on something

408
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:38,640
and this to me connects very nicely with

409
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,220
the way that we Define renunciation in

410
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,679
the Dharma

411
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,880
you give up

412
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:52,260
a lesser joy for a Greater Joy

413
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,500
so how would this letting go

414
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,720
give us

415
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,900
this greater happiness in this context

416
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,059
we can see that when we clarify what's

417
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:09,020
important for us

418
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,860
it's an expression it's it's an

419
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,460
expression of our values

420
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,460
this in turn

421
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,820
gives you is a result of clarity which

422
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:28,039
will give you confidence and joy

423
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,840
will also experience a sense of

424
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,240
lightness of lightness of not always

425
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,000
carrying this big load of you know we

426
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,799
think we have to get all these things

427
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:41,960
down and it weighs us down

428
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,380
so the last

429
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,179
um idea that I want to bring up with you

430
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:51,600
is is something that Berkman calls deep

431
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,740
time

432
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,840
but for us the equivalent would be

433
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,179
mindful time

434
00:22:57,179 --> 00:22:59,159
so

435
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:02,460
it's really the ability of just be to be

436
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,280
as present as possible

437
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,100
but what I found interesting is that as

438
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,799
he writes about deep time

439
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,820
he describes in a very candid way how

440
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,640
for himself somebody who's done a lot of

441
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,980
study and also meditation around this

442
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,380
topic of the of time

443
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,039
how it is difficult to be to remain

444
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,419
present

445
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:30,419
and he writes

446
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:33,900
the more you try to be here now to point

447
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,419
at what's happening in this moment and

448
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:39,720
really see it the more it seems like you

449
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,500
aren't here now or alternatively that

450
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,659
you are but that the experience has been

451
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:49,100
drained of all its flavor

452
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:53,039
so then he goes on to describe how he

453
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,620
went on this Arctic trip

454
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,740
and he prepared

455
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,039
um a lot to what was going to be a peak

456
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:04,679
experience and that was to witness the

457
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:06,240
Northern Lights

458
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,640
and he comments I was determined to

459
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,980
relish the exhibition which the next

460
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,900
morning the locals would describe as

461
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,600
particularly impressive

462
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,720
but the more I tried the less I seemed

463
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,120
to be able to do so

464
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,240
much to his dismay you found himself

465
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,320
thinking oh the northern lights look a

466
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,640
little bit like one of those

467
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,200
screensavers

468
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,559
foreign

469
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,260
that's kind of that's kind of sad isn't

470
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:37,919
it

471
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,440
to go to almost at the end of the world

472
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,000
and then think about your screen saver

473
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,179
so just briefly

474
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:52,440
where wherein lies this why is it that

475
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,679
in moments like this in Peak experiences

476
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,559
we're not able to be there fully and we

477
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,720
feel as if we have a glass in between

478
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,900
the experience and ourselves there's

479
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,320
much that we could say but we don't have

480
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,120
much time left

481
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,640
so

482
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,340
of course for us in the Dharma the

483
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,679
ethics part is essential to to be able

484
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:19,320
to be calm and to be present

485
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,659
but I think in this situation what's

486
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:25,380
going on in the the and what Berkman

487
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,340
describes it's more like right effort

488
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,919
from the noble hateful path

489
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,000
now this ability to be able to monitor

490
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,860
our mind constantly to recognize this is

491
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,640
an unskillful mind State I want to let

492
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,179
go of it I want to weaken it or ah this

493
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:51,120
is this is a a wholesome one I want to

494
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,740
cultivate it

495
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:57,480
it takes years to fine-tune what we call

496
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,380
this effortless effort

497
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,960
and this is something that little by

498
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,059
little will allow us

499
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:11,720
to remain more and more fully present

500
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:17,279
so I want to finish

501
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,260
with um

502
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,360
a haiku

503
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,520
by the 18th century Japanese poet Issa

504
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,580
it says on a branch

505
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,700
floating down river

506
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,419
a cricket singing

507
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,640
on a branch

508
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,520
floating down river

509
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,179
a cricket singing

510
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:47,580
this image

511
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,820
for me summarizes all what we have been

512
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,559
talking about

513
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,220
the sense of impermanence

514
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:00,059
the river moving changing

515
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:03,299
that we are the river that we are the

516
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:05,720
change

517
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,960
it also captures the

518
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,960
vulnerability of our human fate the

519
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,720
precariousness of our life of the

520
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,460
Crooked balancing on top of the branch

521
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,860
and yet

522
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:26,100
if we are able

523
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,100
to embrace this reality

524
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,840
wisely

525
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,600
we too will be able to sing like the

526
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,700
cricket

527
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,778
thank you very much

528
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:47,580
and so let me just close our eyes for a

529
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:51,260
moment and let the word sink in

530
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:17,220
thank you

531
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,460
so I understand that
