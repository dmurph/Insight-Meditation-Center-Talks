1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,920
you're already recording okay um

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,859
so tonight the we'll talk about effort and the first thing I'll say about

3
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,680
effort is um absolutely everything we do requires effort

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:30,720
everything and so I'm going to kind of try and pull some finer detailed attention to how how

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,620
we're making that effort um and so the one of the primary ways

6
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,780
I'm going to do that is actually through a guided meditation and um

7
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,960
my invitation is to you know sort of just be curious be

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,620
interested in your own effort in the reflections I offer and and then we'll

9
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,199
you know be talking about it together um

10
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,920
afterwards so I think we can just sort of move right

11
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,220
into that um so finding your posture

12
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,260
your meditation posture so a position that you feel like you can

13
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,500
stay in for probably 25 minutes or so

14
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:31,040
a position that allows the spine to be upright

15
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,439
and allows the the chair and the floor the Earth to hold

16
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:46,100
your weight so you can give your body to the chair to the Earth

17
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:53,340
and with your next inhale maybe feeling it rise up through you and

18
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:59,179
lifting your spine tall toward the sky

19
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,420
and just taking a few deeper breaths

20
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:37,519
and for a moment just whatever your anchor is if it's not the breath

21
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,319
just connecting with your anchor an anchor is

22
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:50,239
something that you can use to help your awareness

23
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,340
stay here In This Moment

24
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:02,280
ever-changing moment so the breath is moving in and out and

25
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,560
can be an anchor to help us keep our mind in the present

26
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:14,519
with awareness sounds can be an anchor or Sensations in

27
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,540
the body as well

28
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,680
and so just in this we're already making effort

29
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:37,700
deciding to sit bringing awareness into breathing

30
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,319
and just noticing how easy or difficult it feels to feel your breath at this

31
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,260
moment does stay with the experience of breathing

32
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:02,580
and just just for experimenting try a little harder for a minute

33
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,099
try a little harder to stay with your breathing

34
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:31,639
and notice the impact of that effort trying a little harder

35
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:38,820
and now try a little less not

36
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:45,000
not intending to follow your breathing

37
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,800
but maybe somehow do it a little more lightly a little more easily

38
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,100
and now maybe try

39
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:43,020
thinking about a three breath Journey just taking it three breaths at a time

40
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:48,360
just seeing if you can be intimate and connected and aware

41
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:54,020
of three inhales and exhales in a row

42
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:26,060
and then maybe three more breaths three breath turning just three

43
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,639
feeling the rising of the body with inhale

44
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,120
the falling or the letting go with the exhale

45
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:13,319
now just sort of let go of your effort sit down a little bit more on your sit

46
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:20,039
bones and I'm going to offer

47
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:28,400
three similes I just want you to feel into the simile

48
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:36,060
and see if any of them resonate or if you have your own arise

49
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:41,880
that somehow captures the energy the effort

50
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:48,680
that you were putting into being with your anchor or your breath

51
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,800
so the first image I'll call to mind

52
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:02,699
is of a dancer someone who is really embodied

53
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:09,180
maybe moving not too quickly imagine how they lift their hand and

54
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,699
their arm and you can feel them

55
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:20,120
their presence their awareness in every move

56
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:28,319
even maybe subtle subtle movements

57
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:35,899
they make they're very committed to embodying

58
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:47,660
and maybe even you can see how they're aware of the people around them that are moving in your mind's eye

59
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,680
while being connected to their own bodies

60
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:02,120
they make it easy look easy perhaps

61
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,740
and here's the second simile

62
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:17,060
imagine a clown how they move

63
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:26,100
that kind of sloppy moving the way they tend to fall and or slack

64
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:32,760
in their bodies how they seem to be very focused on one

65
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,399
thing and missing so many things around them

66
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:56,240
or maybe imagine something entirely different the movement of a wrestler

67
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:05,040
they're very embodied and they derive their energy into their

68
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,600
movement all of their energy goes into their movement

69
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:20,480
so those are three different similes

70
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:27,380
of how effort in our bodies can appear

71
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:35,640
and there's many many more just taking a moment to see

72
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:43,200
which one or which one in your own mind feels most like the energy or the effort

73
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,380
you brought to your sitting down here tonight

74
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:58,620
as you kind of connect with your own effort even now maybe

75
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,019
you can tune into the tone

76
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:10,459
it can be friendly but it could also be

77
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:16,800
apathetic or belligerent the tone in your own mind

78
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,940
could be neutral respectful

79
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:24,899
kind-hearted

80
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:35,540
what would it feel like to have an internal tone that feels respectful

81
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,700
kind-hearted

82
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,600
we can also consider our confidence

83
00:11:54,899 --> 00:12:01,800
we may feel quite confident right now being aware of our breathing

84
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:07,140
or we could feel extremely insecure uncertain

85
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:17,060
I'm just seeing if you can find that trusting confidence

86
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:24,120
to be with your breathing as best you can

87
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:29,519
to be mindful as best you can without

88
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,600
being forceful

89
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:47,160
it's just also this quality of commitment commitment to staying

90
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:56,420
staying aware and noticing if you have a sense of

91
00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:02,300
weak mild commitment or a strong commitment

92
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:13,380
a dedication or a devotion versus a controlling effort

93
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,760
controlling commitment

94
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,959
another quality to notice is a sense of generosity

95
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:41,600
is there a sense of generosity with yourself with your mind with your experience with your body

96
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:53,519
what would it be like to be patient with whatever is happening inside of

97
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,560
yourself right now

98
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,000
creating room

99
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:34,320
now I want to invite you to imagine you're just sitting down to meditate

100
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,560
again

101
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:47,579
and as you sit and you come into your posture I want you to reflect on what

102
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:51,740
is your aspiration for practice

103
00:14:53,160 --> 00:15:00,540
what inspires you what is the reason you're here

104
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,639
what is the reason you meditate

105
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:18,620
and seeing if you can't just hold that aspiration

106
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:25,500
lightly with care and try saying

107
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:31,639
may this practice support me in this way

108
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:42,320
like a a wish an invitation

109
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,820
that you're dropping into the system the body the mind

110
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,220
trusting it knows how to respond

111
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:02,699
and then there's this idea of trust faith

112
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:10,199
belief faith in the practice

113
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:13,639
faith that it's possible

114
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:32,459
maybe reflect on the Buddha the Dharma

115
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:35,600
or the Sangha

116
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,360
what do you have faith in

117
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:52,399
vited to come into your heart into your mind's eye

118
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:03,199
invited to sit beside you

119
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:17,480
maybe imagine your ancestors around you supporting you if that's supportive

120
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,798
or your spiritual friends

121
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:36,019
maybe imagine being at the time of the Buddha sitting with other monks and nuns

122
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,100
feeling their support

123
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,860
feeling into each other here

124
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:16,700
in a moment I'm going to invite you to practice again just with your breathing but as you turn back towards your breath

125
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:23,220
bring this inspiration aspiration or the

126
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,799
what you have faith in with you

127
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:36,500
bring a sense of curiosity of not knowing

128
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:45,780
and the sense that something really important is happening right here

129
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:53,280
in each Breath You Take in your body here in this room

130
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:59,100
it's important whatever comes up

131
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:05,760
it's important not that we need to engage with our thinking

132
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:13,580
we can just let it be it's okay the thoughts can come

133
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:24,799
witnessing it all being surprised by it all

134
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,120
you're watching your own Karma

135
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:33,559
that's amazing

136
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:50,480
though nothing needs to happen nothing needs to be done

137
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:58,500
just placing value on knowing just the knowing doesn't matter what you know just

138
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:06,140
knowing your experience with a kind heart

139
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,539
one breath at a time

140
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,600
just knowing

141
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:28,279
and softening around that knowing

142
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:29,520
one breath at a time patient

143
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,140
kind-hearted

144
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:53,039
and when I ring the bell just see if you can't Witness

145
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:59,820
without moving what happens in your body

146
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:06,619
your mind [Music]

147
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,690
[Music]

foreign is anybody willing to say a few words

149
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,880
about what they noticed about how

153
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:15,059
or maybe a minute I don't know I'm with it and then I'm out of it and then I come back to it it's just a constant

154
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:21,960
here yeah yeah and did you notice um were you able to play with how hard you

155
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:29,360
were trying or less hard well the only thing I noticed is that it's a

156
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:35,279
it's it's always a try it's always trying it's always trying that's heroic

157
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:43,140
yeah it's heroic if you think about how many times you're saying you keep having to come back that's yeah that is an

158
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:49,260
incredible devotion then yeah you know

good evening everyone hi Tanya uh

163
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:24,179
um you know the part where you mentioned like the three type like the dancer the

164
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:31,559
clown and then the wrestler I thought I had all three like the mind was a bit of

165
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:38,580
like uh the clown in that in some respects because I was all over the place in terms of like

166
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:44,760
a wrestler very like trying to get at it I felt like I was kind of tense in that

167
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:54,120
respect up here in the head trying to force things at times but the the dancer

168
00:26:54,120 --> 00:27:01,020
part was just being still and present and kind of at ease and I felt that so

169
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:07,380
it was there was a contrast you know this up here can be kind of tense but

170
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:12,779
then other parts so I'm like let me try and focus and there were times as Ben

171
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:18,539
had noted uh I was daydreaming and I noticed that I was like very much so I'm

172
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:26,179
like oh why am I thinking about the coke that I bought earlier let me go back to the breath so it's just focusing or just

173
00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:32,700
recognizing it more that sounds I'm just going back to the breath I love that you could tell too

174
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:39,000
that you know you were having different experiences at the same time too that you could find

175
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,539
the settledness in the body even if the mind was being a clown or a wrestler

176
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:49,580
yeah that's beautiful thank you thank you

177
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:03,900
yeah I was the effort um the similes that you mentioned

178
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:10,919
was interesting to know notice that um I was somewhere between a dancer and a

179
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:16,140
wrestler and that definitely not as smooth and

180
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:21,360
continuous as a dancer but um

181
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:27,960
somewhere in between there um and the thing that was interesting for me is that I

182
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:33,000
compared it to what I was like before

183
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,320
and I think I was definitely a wrestler I think even a boxer like it was just

184
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:46,980
very abrupt and yeah I'm just under chain there's a change I see I I

185
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:53,940
realize a change um yeah and that it got harder

186
00:28:53,940 --> 00:29:01,919
um at the end because I was waiting for it to end yeah and it was harder to be

187
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:07,919
smooth and I noticed so much even my heartbeat increased thinking that it's gonna end and

188
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:13,919
that I wanted to end or yeah amazing so that all was there yeah

189
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:20,658
that's great thank you Mitra Tracy did you have your hand up I'm not sure if you did

190
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:32,399
I became so the dancer and the clown became one

191
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:39,120
in the same I would like to think of myself as a very graceful dancer but in reality

192
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:49,140
probably more like the Clown um so it kind of Teeters back and forth uh

193
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:57,179
and the the more effort I try and put into it it

194
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:07,140
seems like things get farther and farther away and the less effort I put into trying to

195
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:15,720
don't think too hard basically is what I'm trying to say the more effort I put into it the harder it became yep and the

196
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:21,720
less effort the the easier it became I'm so happy to hear that happy to hear that

197
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:29,279
yeah yeah and I'm also just so um I'm happy you could each feel into those

198
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:34,440
different kinds of effort in your own being and see that it can shift and

199
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:40,980
change and you know maybe there's sometimes you do need to be a wrestler you know but it's certainly not

200
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:48,419
sustainable to stay in that space and and you're all dancers too you know

201
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:53,940
I don't know um Sage Nemo or Mustafa if you guys want to

202
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,278
add anything here yep Nemo

203
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:06,779
thank you my insight had to do with the difference

204
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:13,740
between the breath as such and breathing through

205
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:20,100
the similes and usually I would only focus on the

206
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:25,919
breath in a neutral way and it's almost like a white light

207
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:34,620
conscious of itself but with the similes I was noticing that

208
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:40,679
it was less effortful to focus on the breathing

209
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:45,899
but the quality and Rhythm of the breathing was changing

210
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:52,919
so as I was breathing through the dancer through the thought it was almost like

211
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:59,640
two like a color like almost like the awareness

212
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:06,360
had a different color with each simile and that was affecting the rhythm of my

213
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:12,840
breath absolutely and I could tell the wrestler was a little agitated and I and

214
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:19,500
if I was not aware of it I can see how I would stop it like it was I would just

215
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:24,799
jump out of that oh I can't meditate or too much effort

216
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:32,460
but because I was aware of it there was still the white light and the color

217
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:38,220
um and and I it was easier to keep doing it

218
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:44,159
um because it was almost like it I was not possessed by it yeah

219
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:50,399
it was a powerful experience oh good I think you know it there's something

220
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:56,279
about putting and uh finding similes that help us recognize

221
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:03,299
our experience and recognizing our experience helps us be with our experience and not be

222
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:08,880
carried away by it right or um you know they're just all of a sudden

223
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:17,039
there's room or something around it um is the way I would describe it for me as well you know this ability to oh this

224
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:23,039
is what this is what it feels like yeah Mustafa I know you're new but is

225
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:31,980
there anything that you would like to add or okay Sage did you want to add anything okay

226
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:37,039
anything else I mean yeah great Mitra

227
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,100
I also when you said that it's three breaths that we're going to think of it

228
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:50,940
as three breads I found that very helpful yeah that it's doable for me I can do three Breads and then another

229
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:57,779
three breaths and it's not as a bigger task yeah so your confidence

230
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:04,019
level went way up right and when you have confidence so that's one of the qualities we you know I was sort of

231
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:11,520
suggesting we check in with is that if we feel confident things are a lot easier because we're not anticipating it

232
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,980
to be hard right we have the sense of confidence

233
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:23,158
and um so how about when I kind of asked you to

234
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:28,679
think about your aspiration for practice and faith in the practice the Buddha the

235
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:37,200
Dharma did that change the the experience or the feeling of being present

236
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,658
yeah I think for me I I thought about my aspiration as in in life why I'm doing

237
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:48,960
this is to find some ease in whatever it is that I'm doing

238
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:55,679
and I thought that um I also thought again about the changes

239
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:01,980
that I see during my meditation that there's more ease a little bit more ease in that and I

240
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:10,880
thought it's I mean on the right path and I felt that the faith and the

241
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,040
yeah and that's that is something that um

242
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,380
you can do when you go to sit you can take a few minutes to reflect on why

243
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:27,660
you're sitting your aspiration for sitting bringing to mind the Buddha the

244
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:34,079
Dharma a quote but it can help so initially I didn't give you much to

245
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:40,020
start right I intentionally didn't give you a lot of instructions to just sort of see what happens if you just kind of

246
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:48,420
plot down and start sitting you know sometimes I'll give a lot more help kind of okay let go of the day you know

247
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:53,640
um but I kind of wanted you to experience what would happen if you just start

248
00:35:53,640 --> 00:36:00,599
meditating versus if you take a little bit of time to help arouse a sense of

249
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:06,180
aspiration confidence patience you know these qualities that

250
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:11,280
if we have them in our minds they can come with us into the meditation and

251
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,740
support us in our practice yeah and

252
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:23,599
um Sage did you want to say anything Tracy

253
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:39,119
the reason so when I'm meditate okay life builds up on itself right so

254
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:47,099
I I find that my intention for meditation is to kind of re-balance uh

255
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:54,960
myself try and step out of the Rat Race that is so easy to get wrapped up in and

256
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:01,079
just spend time with myself being quiet yeah

257
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:08,240
that that is my intention for meditation yeah Sage is nodding her head over there

258
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:13,920
two thumbs up she says yeah yeah and

259
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:22,338
so when you connect with that that that's your aspiration how does it change how you feel about meditating

260
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:28,500
meditation becomes most important

261
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:35,339
uh I I have a hard time staying mindful

262
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:41,300
during everyday life so in order to rebalance myself

263
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:48,359
re-calibrate things it's very important for me to meditate otherwise it just builds up and builds

264
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:54,240
up and how does knowing it's important to you in this way support you're doing

265
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:02,700
it knowing the results that that I'm going

266
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:13,560
to get uh makes makes me seek it out nice uh just

267
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:19,619
to quiet the mind it's so hard to get that during everyday life unless you

268
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:26,640
really know how to do it um it's much easier for me amongst people

269
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:32,640
here yeah in the quiet where everyone has the same intention it becomes much

270
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:37,740
more powerful and easier for me to do it here yeah

271
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:43,079
yeah yeah it's very it's a really powerful thing to have the gift of meditating

272
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:45,859
with others

273
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,040
thank you Tracy

274
00:38:55,619 --> 00:39:02,220
Roseanne and Rose I I also feel like

275
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:08,220
oh when I seek something or I put too much effort in whatever it is

276
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:14,940
it kind of drifts away or but then sometimes I wonder if it's a

277
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:21,480
what do you call it the thing where it just ends up happening because you will it to but then maybe in this sense

278
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:27,420
with meditate what I really like about meditation is there is no from what I've

279
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:33,180
learned I don't have to feel bad if I'm not doing it right if I feel like I'm not or

280
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:38,220
if I'm doing it wrong or if I had a really bad day today at work which I did

281
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:44,760
I can still come I can still come here and try to be present and it's okay

282
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:53,040
because I've made that effort so it's just just all those things and I can go about

283
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,520
my life feeling like a clown one day but the next seeming like a dancer through

284
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:07,079
this practice and Well on most days like a wrestler or a boxer but I just it's

285
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:14,940
it's just nice the just being here and experiencing uh Sangha with everyone I

286
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:20,339
and hearing what everyone has to say I'm like oh I'm not the only one

287
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:25,560
really powerful really feeling that way so

288
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:29,119
thank you thank you

289
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,440
yeah Ben please

290
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:46,140
yeah um in terms of

291
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:51,740
aspiration um

292
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:58,400
um years ago when I started to practice

293
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:07,320
um I know that at some point in the future if you stay

294
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:13,040
with this you become blocked more aware

295
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:21,780
my desire was to

296
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:27,720
be so aware as much as I can that

297
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:34,619
I can see what's going on I can understand what's going on I can be present to

298
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:40,440
what's going on and I have all my faculties ready

299
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:46,560
and awake to absorb and to do what's

300
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:54,780
needs to be done so and maximize those moments

301
00:41:54,780 --> 00:42:02,579
I mean I can count maybe the instances fleeting instances that something

302
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:11,420
happens and you all there oh yeah and you all see so

303
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:18,060
that's those those things those moments are magical yeah as for

304
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:23,839
the effort um

305
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:31,320
yes it's hard it's always been hard it's it's still hard it's probably going to remain hard

306
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:36,900
but gradually slowly

307
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:42,300
there's a shift that happens very subtle

308
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:50,480
shift that happens and you stop you thought

309
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:56,700
sort of cleanses your language cleanses your

310
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:05,160
um attitude cleanses if there is a but it's a it's

311
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:10,500
very slow very slow process

312
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:16,740
yeah anyway that was beautiful then really beautiful what you shared

313
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:20,599
all of you really beautiful

314
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:29,880
I think um I just want to stay a little bit with

315
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:35,640
this um the different kinds of effort for a minute and then I'm going to talk about the the four kinds of effort that

316
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:42,319
the Buddha taught right um but I think um

317
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:50,460
one of the things that I'll I'll say when I feel like I have that the energy or the effort of a wrestler

318
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:57,780
I feel like my my awareness gets really small I don't I can't take in very much and

319
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:03,900
things get tight um and so I lose connection a lot with the

320
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:09,780
joy of life and that when I'm in that kind of efforting place and you know I

321
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:14,819
some I was thinking what are the things that are the hardest you know when do we

322
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:20,660
have to work the hardest when do we need the wrestler energy effort

323
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:26,220
and I don't know what what thoughts you have but one of the things I thought about was oh you know I think sometimes

324
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:32,819
I see people it's that hard when they're trying to go against their conditioning when they're

325
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:39,180
trying to resist strong strong conditioning that that's almost when the

326
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:44,640
mo there's no sweat and effort in in that kind of way you know and whether

327
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:52,380
you're on the cushion or in life that that um resistance of the momentum of a habit

328
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:57,960
a pattern a conditioning a flow of karma can

329
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:06,420
really require this courageous intense amount of energy and it's finite how long we can do that

330
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:14,520
and it becomes to me brittle or um like I said I lose the joy I lose

331
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:20,838
connection you know um

332
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:27,599
and you know sometimes we're trying harder and so we're working harder but

333
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:33,300
I think you know some Tracy I don't know who said it but would like oh actually

334
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:39,480
if I don't try so hard it's easier right there's it's it becomes easier to

335
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,940
stay and so that's the other thing sometimes we're putting in more effort than we a

336
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:50,220
lot of times I think we're putting in more effort than we need or maybe we're

337
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:57,119
trying the wrong kind of effort and so this is the other part of what I was kind of trying to point to in

338
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:02,760
the practices actually there's effort in getting ourselves to the cushion

339
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:08,520
there's effort in inspiring our hearts making ourselves feel comfortable and

340
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:13,740
safe there's effort in making sure we're comfortable enough

341
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:19,619
right or that we didn't overeat before we came to sit you know like these this

342
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:26,880
is all effort that happens before can happen before we come to the cushion

343
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:32,339
and actually the more you practice I think the more the effort is in your

344
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:38,040
ongoing awareness of your mind and what Ben was talking about slowly this

345
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:43,920
cleansing of your attitude slowly this cleansing of your word slowly this

346
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:49,560
cleansing of your your aversive anger that you want to you know

347
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:56,220
say these things that are harsh those things start to dissipate you know

348
00:46:56,220 --> 00:47:02,839
um but it uh

349
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:10,619
it's good to know what kind of effort you're making and play with it be curious

350
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:17,520
and sometimes you'll find your mind is not acting the way it normally does it's different and so it needs a different

351
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:24,900
kind of effort so it's good to have practices and rituals and routines but it's also

352
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:31,980
good to keep tuning in about whether or not it's actually working in the moment meaning working to help you be present

353
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:39,660
with whatever's going on so the four kinds of effort that the

354
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:46,920
Buddha talked about are essentially in two groups one has to

355
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:55,200
do with unskillful and the other two have to do with the skillful so with the unskillful if we notice that

356
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:01,980
we're being unskillful we want to stop it right so if we're being harsh or

357
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:08,520
critical or we're trying too hard in our meditation we're being a wrestler

358
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:13,800
we want to try and stop it and then once we stop it we want to

359
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:19,200
prevent it from happening again those are the two sides of of working with the

360
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:25,920
unskillful with the the skillful we want to cultivate the skillful

361
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,960
and then maintain the skillful and actually that's all you need to do in my

362
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:36,000
view mostly it's really about cultivating because

363
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:42,720
to to stop the unskillful we're not trying to wrestle with the unskillful

364
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:49,680
if we fight with the unskillful we're feeding the unskillful we're giving it

365
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:55,619
our life precious awareness and energy and it keeps it going whether it's

366
00:48:55,619 --> 00:49:01,040
because we're angry at ourselves or it or whatever but we're we're still

367
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:07,500
directing this energy this awareness this is our life energy toward the

368
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:14,040
unskillful if we're trying to get you know I stop it by suppressing it or stomping it

369
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:19,700
out now sometimes I have to say when it's something like

370
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:27,119
really your awareness just goes oh no I'm not going to say that it's so pretty clear like easy stop of the unscaleful

371
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:32,160
it's like nope not gonna go there you know that's pretty clean

372
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:37,380
so that's great you know and then like okay how do I want to kind of support

373
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:43,560
myself and not having that happen again and and reflect on maybe how yeah I

374
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:49,260
don't really want to go that way I don't really want that in my life so is there something I need to do to support myself

375
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:55,200
around that but for me a lot of my work is around

376
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:02,220
the cultivation of skillful and that as it grows the unskillful just

377
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:07,800
Peters out there's just less and less of it

378
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:13,440
so it's knowing what do you want to cultivate how do you want to you know how do you

379
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:20,220
want to direct your energy in a skillful Direction and then maintaining it so how do we maintain what is skillful

380
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:28,020
for me one of the biggest practices is to appreciate to recognize to have gratitude to

381
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:34,740
appreciate to respect not take it for granted that these are things that help support

382
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:42,119
it and maintain it but that can change too our minds get bored

383
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:48,480
I mean they get distracted they get caught up in other things so we have to keep adjusting what we're doing and this

384
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,940
is another part of effort you know I mean I feel like sometimes

385
00:50:53,940 --> 00:51:00,059
um when I'm on a longer retreat I feel like I'm constantly having to adapt my

386
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:05,819
effort constantly having to shift what I'm doing to help myself maintain this

387
00:51:05,819 --> 00:51:11,819
balance because I'm you know you the awareness everything gets magnified so you get

388
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:18,359
more and more sensitive to what's happening it requires more and more refinement I

389
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:25,740
think so okay one more little thing to share with

390
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:31,260
you um and then um and then we'll do either a group or

391
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:36,780
small group discussions whatever you guys want to do so I'm I'm just making this this part up

392
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:43,319
right the dancer simile that's my making it up right that's not from the Buddha these four efforts those are the

393
00:51:43,319 --> 00:51:52,079
Buddhist teachings okay this part I'm going to add now I'm making it up okay and so this is um just uh I like

394
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:57,540
acronyms that I find them helpful so and it's not perfect my acronym is

395
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:02,940
not perfect please enhance it make it better for yourselves but the idea is

396
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:09,000
Grace with our effort Grace with effort Grace with effort

397
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:15,300
so if we use the G with the grace like grounding G for grounding right

398
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:21,140
orienting to Here and Now this is the beginning of a really important

399
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:28,200
mindfulness practice right grounding here and now the r recognizing right and

400
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:35,520
respecting the results of the effort of just grounding recognizing what's happening

401
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:42,720
this is effort right and there's the a acknowledging appreciating

402
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:50,880
whatever there is to be appreciated see courage courage to turn toward the

403
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:58,020
suffering instead of doing the habitual trying to get away from it trying to change it

404
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:03,180
trying to deny it trying to talk ourselves out of it trying to argue

405
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:11,540
about why it's really the other person's fault and not my fault now it's this courage to go oh okay

406
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:19,980
it hurts simply purely it hurts and to be with that takes courage and we

407
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:28,079
need to know our limits how long we can sit with something right sometimes it's gonna be short

408
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:33,720
but it is there can be it's that moment a magic moment of courage in the mirror

409
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:40,440
like you know I'm there I see you I can't stay with you but I'm here and I

410
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:47,339
see you that moment can be enough and respecting our capacity in the

411
00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:52,980
moment to be and stay with the suffering or needing to turn away but doing it with

412
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:58,140
Choice doing it with wisdom like recognition

413
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:04,440
gra see courage r remember and recommit

414
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:10,800
right and receive so whatever our effort is like we try too hard or we didn't

415
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:15,859
didn't go the way it was remember what you did

416
00:54:15,859 --> 00:54:23,400
recommit to to staying you know intentional receive whatever there is to learn from

417
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:28,440
it even if it's bad news even if you don't like it

418
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:35,160
right and recognize the value of whatever was

419
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:40,859
skillful don't miss that too so remember right remember all these

420
00:54:40,859 --> 00:54:48,559
pieces and the E exhale release the unskillful reactions

421
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:55,819
exhale don't make a self out of the effort a good meditator a bad meditator

422
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:01,980
forgive learn right exhale Letting Go letting go

423
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:07,220
right not creating more

424
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:12,780
suffering so that's my little acronym Grace with

425
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:19,319
effort and then I'll read you this quote Gandhi said freedom is not worth having

426
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:26,880
if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes and Jack cornfield says don't be afraid

427
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:32,400
of making mistakes step out fly even if you get burned you can fall back to

428
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:39,599
Earth and start again it's never too late to start over he said zen master Dogan laughingly

429
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:44,940
called Life One continuous mistake yes

430
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:51,780
there is the fear of looking bad but later when you review your life will you wish you had held back probably not

431
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:57,359
Texas all right

432
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:02,819
so would you guys like to do two groups of three small group just talking and

433
00:56:02,819 --> 00:56:09,500
reflecting in your small group about um effort and Reflections maybe sharing

434
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:14,880
uh you know what kinds of efforts you bring other ideas you might have other

435
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:22,800
similes yes okay great so why don't you go ahead and make yes

436
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:29,040
for oh yeah well actually probably will you participate Richard

437
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:36,800
are you going to participate you're not going to plan on it okay and

438
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:44,220
well Sage Sage will participate so yes so we can have one group of four one group of three

439
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:51,540
um well but but I think the group people might need to migrate some people need

440
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:57,180
to migrate yes Mustafa you you're not gonna stay

441
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:00,740
okay are you okay

442
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,260
so Sage will join you guys Ben

443
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,760
foreign

444
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:35,480
I just want to

445
00:57:39,059 --> 00:57:46,980
I just want to say one one little thing we talked about mindful speaking and listening last week and just how

446
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:52,440
um we can bring our practice into these little small group discussions

447
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:57,540
so you know just being kind of staying connected

448
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:05,460
with your physical experience is really powerful keeping keeping more awareness if you

449
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:10,559
can internally then externally even when you're listening sort of staying with

450
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:16,260
your yourself so I think about um if I had a gauge

451
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:22,380
that would show me how much of my awareness is external versus internal most of the time it's probably mostly

452
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:29,460
you know a lot of it is out right so maybe just feel in what does it feel like when my awareness is equal in and

453
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:34,800
out what does it feel like when it's more in you know that's sort of the mindfulness

454
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:41,160
meditation and when we're listening to others it's very easy to get lost in the out

455
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:46,920
so trying to just kind of keep that in mind and you know being being aware when you

456
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:52,260
speak whatever you notice is fine right just we want to invoke a sense of comp

457
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:57,720
you know confidentiality it's safe to say you're what you share won't be taken

458
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:05,280
out of here you know shared with others and that there's a general sense of loving kindness you know caring in the

459
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:10,980
group so I just wanted to to invite you all to connect with that and then I

460
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:16,140
appreciate your introducing yourselves and do you need more instructions or are you

461
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:23,579
okay with just talking where you seems like you're okay right I

462
00:59:23,579 --> 00:59:31,400
yeah effort ideas about effort effort you've tried you know yeah yep great

463
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:36,558
so you guys can talk for like 10 minutes

464
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:05,219
just taking a pause thanking each other and I made a little circle for us for

465
01:10:05,219 --> 01:10:10,620
this last bit if you don't mind um sitting part of the circle if it's if

466
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:17,900
it's a problem no problem but if it's okay

467
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:32,600
and yeah I said you want to pull the camera back okay

468
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:41,719
does it feel too weird are you too close to each other I

469
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:49,380
don't know okay great

470
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:55,280
and Wednesday what's wrong I brought him over already yeah

471
01:10:56,340 --> 01:11:01,860
yay yeah so um

472
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:08,159
and just the flow I'm thinking of and I'm open but is

473
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:14,640
um to invite you all to just share your takeaways from your discussion any

474
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:20,460
questions or Reflections so that we can all benefit from each other's

475
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:28,620
conversation where the camera's zoomed out so people on Zoom can see the the full group and

476
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:34,340
the microphones will allow them to hear and for things to be recorded so we're

477
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:39,380
connecting with our broader Sangha in this way

478
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:44,760
um so does anybody willing to share

479
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:50,640
something that came up that they would be willing to

480
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:55,159
donate to all of us

481
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:04,460
and then maybe we can just pass the mic in a circle after you start

482
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:09,840
I want I want to thank sage and Ben for

483
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:18,800
their kind and careful attention as I was sharing my bad day I tried not to

484
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:25,320
Tanya I I had the privilege of being a Starbucks barista over the summer but

485
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:30,840
these past nine years I've also been a middle school teacher oh my goodness and

486
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:38,940
this year is really challenging and I was just telling them about my day and Ben had said you know humans are like

487
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:46,800
razor blades in order to have that fine point they must be cooled and sharpened and Sage said well you mentioned should

488
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:53,820
a lot but remember you said there's no right or wrong and I really liked how how she had

489
01:12:53,820 --> 01:13:00,719
how she and Ben had noted that I I can just be okay and not try so hard but

490
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:08,770
hit so hard sometimes and I just I think you thank you [Music]

491
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:17,100
um thank you and Rose [Music]

492
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:23,580
yeah yeah we're right here and Sage is

493
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:30,239
getting you some kleenex if you wanted yeah I can't imagine being a middle

494
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:37,020
school teacher oh my goodness oh my gosh

495
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:44,400
really really what's that maybe maybe should yeah

496
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:50,460
I I feel that it's rather heroic to be especially a middle school teacher a

497
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:55,860
teacher of any grade these days but especially a middle school teacher those

498
01:13:55,860 --> 01:14:01,820
kids are really trying to figure themselves out and

499
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:10,679
they're not always the nicest about it and as a teacher you have to

500
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:16,560
be the one in charge and the one that you know is the adult and everything but

501
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:22,800
sometimes they're just not nice and I'm sure that's hard and I'm

502
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:28,260
I admire you actually thank you for your service to our world

503
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:35,360
it's the job you're doing is it's very important job oh my gosh

504
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:42,840
thank you yeah so Tracy you have the mic is there any

505
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:51,678
any little tidbits you would like to share so I appreciated finding out that

506
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:58,560
it's it's not that everybody needs to put in the effort to get here I felt

507
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:04,320
like I might be the only one who just wants to stay in my bed and you know

508
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:13,320
cuddle up with the cats and not go out but I found out that I am not the only

509
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:19,440
one that that feels like that and it it it uh

510
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:26,280
it makes me feel even more part of a group that I that

511
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:31,679
other people are having to put in that kind of effort too just he rode his bike

512
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:36,840
here all the way from Palo Alto for crying out loud and he's caught her right home back in the dark so oh my

513
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:42,659
goodness that's a lot of effort and and so it just

514
01:15:42,659 --> 01:15:49,140
uh reinforce the importance of of being here and doing this

515
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:55,679
and what a gift your effort is to each other to me to each other the effort you

516
01:15:55,679 --> 01:16:01,199
made to get here is huge and hugely beneficial for all of

517
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:05,300
us thank you

518
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:30,840
I want to jump in but first I need to ask a very critical question of Nemo which is like

519
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:37,580
do you think you could fit your bike in my car because I'm going back to Stanford as well so

520
01:16:38,699 --> 01:16:45,659
I was actually trying to make it into like a practice I was telling them I was like I want to see the difference uh

521
01:16:45,659 --> 01:16:51,659
maybe I'm I'm not saying no by the way in my mind I was like maybe I'll see the

522
01:16:51,659 --> 01:16:58,980
difference of at first getting here and then this gap of meditating and being

523
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:04,260
with myself um or groundedness I like that word a

524
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:10,140
lot like being grounded because I'm in motion coming here yeah and then I'm

525
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:17,520
grounded and I can share the ground with others that are like me and have that we have a

526
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:23,040
similar intention and then I was like and then be back but

527
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:25,699
there's not enough

528
01:17:31,219 --> 01:17:37,219
so uh the running theme for our group I think was um

529
01:17:37,219 --> 01:17:43,199
training or like repeat effort like what does effort look like when you

530
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:48,840
can't just get it all done in one like solid move and um

531
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:54,239
Ben was telling us a little bit about his his running and training and how

532
01:17:54,239 --> 01:18:00,260
it's the repeat effort they get to like big differences

533
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:08,760
um and yeah well I brought this up but like I think it's very common to like know

534
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:16,020
when you're talking about repeated effort like like loud sound the dodging like talking about these giant

535
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:22,140
Boulders that have like been in place for like a thousand years two thousand years like there's nothing you could do

536
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:27,960
to smash them apart like at this time but like a like reveal it like a little stream

537
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:34,440
like given enough time I'll like cut it so yeah that's I think that's what we're

538
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:39,780
getting into like how do you do what needs to be done over and over

539
01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:47,460
and over again and I know the struggle about getting out of bed from underneath lots of cats to come

540
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:54,500
here very very well solution that I found is

541
01:18:55,440 --> 01:19:00,600
the solution that I found is volunteer because then you're like obligated and

542
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:03,440
then you have to go

543
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:10,158
that's great you can hand it to Ben

544
01:19:11,699 --> 01:19:17,640
um actually I arrived at the end he mentioned the book she she mentioned a

545
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:25,080
book you're sorry my apologies I I always mix up this is nothing is my person we don't have he or she isn't

546
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:31,980
that cool I think that's something we always mix up I mean I'll always mix it up sorry

547
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:39,179
um yeah so she mentioned the book uh what was it called

548
01:19:39,179 --> 01:19:46,260
oh did you I've never heard of that thing anyway so about the the how

549
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:51,840
big boulders are shaped by little streams of water makes a lot of sense yeah

550
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:57,300
uh I I totally believe in that there's always all there is only a small effort

551
01:19:57,300 --> 01:20:03,440
there's never a big effort beautiful a beautiful guy thank you

552
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,600
foreign

553
01:20:11,699 --> 01:20:17,340
to the first many few years of my meditation practice

554
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:23,940
on high um my effort was the two extremes I was

555
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:28,820
either and I am still mostly either

556
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:36,800
um too much effort very intense and very um

557
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:43,140
um or just the opposite of just too exhausted to make any effort and that

558
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:49,080
was really um not productive at all and I was thinking

559
01:20:49,080 --> 01:20:55,800
we were talking about how that for me I felt like that I'm that's been the effort that I apply

560
01:20:55,800 --> 01:21:02,159
throughout my life not just on the cushion that I either do

561
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:09,600
too much or or exhausted to do anything and just now starting to learn that there is

562
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:16,860
a right effort Grace and effort Grace and effort Grace and effort so I need

563
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:22,820
to learn that beautiful can you hand to Richard

564
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:35,300
so I think I'll just chime in a little bit even though I wasn't in the groups um

565
01:21:36,179 --> 01:21:41,640
sort of seeing and being a sort of having a perspective that I'm watching

566
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:47,280
you guys relate and the things that you've shared tonight and

567
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,280
um

568
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:59,760
it's very touching to me to see you guys all come here

569
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:05,100
some of you for a long time Ben and Mitra you know quite a number of years

570
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:11,760
and other folks sort of just showing up and picking it back up again after a while

571
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,539
in the moment

572
01:22:18,239 --> 01:22:25,500
and Anne you know just steady steady at it you know and so I practiced

573
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:31,980
a long time in relationship to you guys and but I had to start

574
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:39,060
you know and I've been at it for close to four decades now and I don't

575
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:45,239
miss many days of meditation just to say I I'm probably

576
01:22:45,239 --> 01:22:50,820
maybe one or two days in all those years where I've like I didn't meditate you

577
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:57,060
know like actually sit down and formally meditate and I think it's a kind of a maybe it's

578
01:22:57,060 --> 01:23:03,540
something to share that's important to recognize that these heavy Boulders once you get them

579
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:10,260
moving right they have a tendency you know I'm sure there's a thermodynamic that explains it

580
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:15,659
but you know the momentum of practice does occur kind of like what you were

581
01:23:15,659 --> 01:23:22,260
describing Pat that sense of oh yeah it's not as hard

582
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:29,100
you know that doesn't mean it it's not hard to get up you know and come and get up and

583
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:34,099
come down but um

584
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:41,699
it's huge it's really a huge thing like matanya said it's important

585
01:23:41,699 --> 01:23:48,060
it's really important and it's important to recognize how hard it is

586
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:54,360
it's you know I used to stress this a lot I used to teach basic here years ago and

587
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:59,580
I used to always tell everybody that just showed up to learn to meditate this

588
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:05,460
is really really a difficult practice and you have to give yourself a lot of

589
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:11,340
compassion for doing it you have to recognize hey this isn't

590
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:18,659
easy right but I'm going to continue and so my advice is to all new

591
01:24:18,659 --> 01:24:24,900
practitioners we're all practitioners don't quit that's the key

592
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:31,380
just keep doing it and pretty soon you'll be two decades one decade you

593
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:37,380
know four dick it doesn't matter it becomes you it becomes you as a human

594
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:43,560
being it's it's not something that you're doing

595
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:48,600
you're just being this and I just encourage you

596
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:53,699
just you know no matter what your mood is in that moment it's okay

597
01:24:53,699 --> 01:25:00,420
just be with that mood you know so that's all I'll say thank you for

598
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:06,840
coming and practicing and supporting me with your practice thank you Richard

599
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:14,640
Nemo did you want to say anything else that was such a perfect closing note I'm not here okay

600
01:25:14,659 --> 01:25:21,480
so I have a um a new it's a new practice we'll see how it

601
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:28,620
goes but the practice that is um for the dedication of Merit

602
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:34,440
what I'd like to do is invite each of you if you want to name

603
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:39,780
you know the benefit of our practice is for all beings without exception right

604
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:46,560
and that is the absolute wish and intention and sometimes we forget about some of

605
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:51,900
the beings that are part of all beings and sometimes we're aware of beings that

606
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:57,480
are suffering and could really use being named

607
01:25:57,480 --> 01:26:03,199
so uh without you know talking a lot about whatever

608
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:10,980
animals or beings or causes that are on your hearts that you

609
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:16,139
would like to name as part of all beings to dedicate the Merit of what we are

610
01:26:16,139 --> 01:26:22,739
sharing here please do so Nemo if you have anyone you could start and just pass the mic around

611
01:26:22,739 --> 01:26:29,699
and and this is just part of helping us remember and connect to all beings everywhere that are suffering

612
01:26:29,699 --> 01:26:35,820
because all beings are suffering and how we hope that our Ben our

613
01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:42,360
practice benefits them I think I would like to dedicate it to

614
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:47,940
all the drivers I passed coming here all especially in traffic oh it is amazing

615
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:53,219
it actually is a practice like biking around is

616
01:26:53,219 --> 01:26:59,460
being aware is almost like externalized yeah and just being stuck somewhere

617
01:26:59,460 --> 01:27:05,219
and you can't move and there's a red light and there is also compassion there's so

618
01:27:05,219 --> 01:27:10,739
many times people would let me pass that they didn't have to or would acknowledge

619
01:27:10,739 --> 01:27:18,840
that I am letting them pass and there's even compassion in those moments so I I have compassion for them and I

620
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:25,920
would I dedicated to the ones that were frustrated at the traffic and the ones

621
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:31,158

the practice to all middle school students wanting

624
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:49,380
wanting to feel belonging instead of forcing this whole concept of fitting in

625
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:55,940
may they know that they are fine as they are

626
01:27:57,060 --> 01:28:02,780
so I want to recognize the teachers

627
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:10,199
honestly my children are grown very grown adults and so I hardly ever think

628
01:28:10,199 --> 01:28:15,980
about teachers anymore but you have reminded me

629
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:21,620

630
01:28:21,620 --> 01:28:28,199
