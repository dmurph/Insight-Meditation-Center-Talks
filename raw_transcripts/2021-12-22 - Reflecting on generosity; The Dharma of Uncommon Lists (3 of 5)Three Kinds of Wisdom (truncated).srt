1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:08,320
okay so we'll go ahead and get started nice to see everyone there

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,080
welcome so just settling in for

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,560
today's meditation yesterday we talked about

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,760
four qualities that are the basis of spiritual friendship

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,039
and are also forms of inner wealth and so i'm going to pick out one of

6
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:37,040
those today to provide some of the background for our

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,040
meditation at the beginning and then we'll settle in again with a period of silence

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,680
so we're going to focus on generosity but first let's just

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,160
begin by settling in closing the eyes

10
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,120
allowing the attention to come inward

11
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,880
sensing the posture that you're sitting in or maybe lying down in

12
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,360
and just checking in that you're in a balanced posture

13
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:31,520
if you're sitting upright it's one where you don't have to exert a lot of effort

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,280
the body feels naturally upright and straight

15
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,360
relaxed if you're lying down you can still have

16
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,759
a sense of straightness in the body balance in whatever posture you're lying

17
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,079
down in

18
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,320
it can help to sense where you're sitting

19
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:12,000
what's supporting you and just you know even rocking back and forth a little bit or forward and back

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,120
just to find that middle point where you're the most balanced that you

21
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,000
can be in this posture

22
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,680
you can even think of resting in your sitting spot

23
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,959
as a way of giving yourself to the support

24
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:55,360
instead of trying somehow to do it all ourselves hold ourselves up

25
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:04,040
give your weight to what you're sitting on and ultimately to the earth

26
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,239
let it support you

27
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,400
and then softening into this balanced posture

28
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,440
softening the eyes and the eye sockets often looking at a screen you can get a

29
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,840
little tense in the eyes

30
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,599
even softening behind the eyes as if we could relax

31
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,040
a muscle in the head

32
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,920
relax the brain

33
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,720
softening the neck and letting the shoulders drop

34
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,639
releasing down the arms and hands

35
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,410
and just inviting some openness through the chest and the belly area

36
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:51,759
[Music] checking in while you're there if you

37
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,560
have any sense of tension

38
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:06,360
make background emotions just to know how you are

39
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,960
inviting some eaves

40
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,879
i'm releasing any bracing in the legs

41
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:42,840
just letting the legs be natural the muscle's soft

42
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,720
letting the in-breath encourage a straightening

43
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,440
of the central part of the body and letting the out breath encourage a

44
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,560
softening forward way around that straight center

45
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,160
just in a gentle way

46
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,360
so i'm going to drop in a short quote from the

47
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,520
tsutas from buddhist teachings

48
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:04,240
and the invitation is just to let it resonate inside like

49
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:11,199
ripples in water or like an echo and there will be

50
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,639
some ripple and then you can just let it fade out naturally and go back to the

51
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,759
breath or the body

52
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:32,000
so the buddha said if beings knew as i know

53
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,599
the results of giving and sharing [Music] they would not eat without having given

54
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:45,840
even if it were their last morsel their last mouthful they would not eat without

55
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,960
having shared it if there were someone to share it with

56
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:24,479
and as it fades out just turning the mindfulness back to the breath

57
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,840
the body

58
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:05,040
so we'll have two more brief connections with generosity

59
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,560
and the second one is just a simple reflection

60
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:18,959
in the mind so i'll ask you to recall

61
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:24,959
a time of simple unentangled giving

62
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:34,720
when you were able to give something just simply it was easy it was natural

63
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,800
it flowed i'll just remember that time and how it

64
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,800
was

65
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,079
you could let images arise in your mind

66
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,880
or a recollection of the feeling you had or how the person looked when you gave

67
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,279
something

68
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:18,760
and maybe notice how it brings some joy into the mind

69
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:45,040
and you can also let that fade away let the mind settle back into

70
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,480
your usual mindfulness

71
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:36,240
and now the invitation is to feel directly and deeply into the

72
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,360
body how it is when the mind is imbued with

73
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:50,399
the quality of generosity so you can re-evoke memory

74
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,880
or you can recall the quote

75
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,880
that beings would not eat their last morsel without giving

76
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,480
if there were someone to share it with

77
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,839
and really take that feeling deeply into the body where we have the

78
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,680
direct experience of a body and mind imbued with

79
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,639
generosity and rest in that feeling

80
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,079
what is the energy of generosity like

81
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,360
does it move

82
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:05,959
does it have lightness heaviness

83
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:15,920
certain location [Music] does it extend outside the body

84
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,720
there are no expected answers to this just

85
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,920
getting to know that quality

86
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,199
through our own experience

87
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,920
so we've encountered this quality of generosity through

88
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:20,399
hearing the teaching on it through

89
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,600
reflecting thinking about how that matches our own

90
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:32,880
experience through directly sensing

91
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,880
that quality in the mind the experience of it

92
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:45,240
these are different ways to encounter equality like generosity

93
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:53,839
so now we'll have a period of silence sitting for a little while

94
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:01,519
just allowing it to resonate settle out move into your usual mindfulness

95
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,519
practice

96
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,960
foreign

97
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:01,760
so as we continue to sit for a few more minutes

98
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:11,279
we may consider how wholesome qualities

99
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,279
feel in the body in the mind

100
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,880
how even the thought you know thinking the thing that we

101
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:35,120
think isn't so good during meditation but even thinking about wholesome

102
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,559
qualities has a certain impact on the body

103
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,080
different from thoughts that are

104
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,480
less good

105
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:01,679
thoughts of generosity have an easier impact on the body than

106
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,960
thoughts of anger for example

107
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:15,600
and how even hearing passively hearing a quote about

108
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,640
a wholesome quality something that we might resonate with

109
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:27,679
impacts the mind-body system so we can start to be

110
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:34,480
wise maybe sensing internally how these

111
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,600
wholesome qualities feel so that when we're doing actions out in

112
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:47,440
our life acts of giving [Music] or more neutral acts of speaking or

113
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,279
preparing food walking around we can notice

114
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:59,120
how that feels in the mind and the body so that we can keep our

115
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,840
mind directed well throughout the day

116
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:13,840
and also in a more nuanced way if we are

117
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:20,000
giving something or sharing something there are ways that we can

118
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,159
do that from a mind that isn't totally wholesome

119
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:33,120
for example it's possible to give out of fear or give out of a sense of duty or

120
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:40,799
obligation with some heaviness and we'd be able to feel that

121
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:47,200
we would be able to feel that it was different from that very simple unentangled giving that i asked you to

122
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:54,480
remember so our direct experience can also

123
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,760
help us throughout the day

124
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:06,000
to do things from the most wholesome intention that's available at that moment

125
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,519
it's a very practical skill

126
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:17,200
so this might be an interesting thing to remember as you go forward today is

127
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:25,679
how wholesomeness feels and how just tuning into that naturally

128
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:31,039
quietly simply can help others

129
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:39,158
through the way that you talk and speak and hear and act

130
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:54,039
always helpful to include that internal dimension when we can

131
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,339
[Music]

132
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,880
hmm

133
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:56,880
okay so today we are continuing

134
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:03,519
with the dharma of uncommon lists and so that means that today we will

135
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,880
explore a list of three and

136
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:17,440
i want to talk about the three kinds of wisdom that are mentioned in the suttas

137
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:24,159
wisdom is such an important quality in the buddhist buddhist teachings that maybe it's not surprising that it's

138
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:29,200
considered multi-dimensional and

139
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,320
these three are sometimes mentioned in dharma talks but not often in much

140
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:40,240
detail and usually the first two of them are minimized

141
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:48,320
but i like to think of these three kinds of wisdom as forming a kind of ecology in the heart

142
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,600
and mind where we need each one to support the others

143
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:59,840
so all three are important there is one that of course is more liberating than the others that's why

144
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:08,399
the other two get minimized but i see them as an ecology that are that are all of them should be there

145
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:15,440
so the first is called the wisdom of hearing or listening

146
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:21,200
so this is a kind of understanding or wisdom that comes from

147
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,399
listening listening to teachings generally so it's good to

148
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:31,440
listen to things that are worth listening to for at least part of our day

149
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,279
so you know that means here in the dharma we can listen to audio dharma

150
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:43,440
we can come to talks like this in these days i think listening probably

151
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,519
includes reading where we take things in also through the linguistic part of our

152
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:57,840
mind um and we can also maybe include talking with wise friends as i'm hearing

153
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,960
listening to what they say so sometimes people want to discount the

154
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:09,039
wisdom of hearing or listening as you know just the first step you know

155
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:14,799
but nonetheless hearing the dharma is actually listed as one of the factors

156
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:21,279
for reaching the first stage of awakening it said that we need wise attention and

157
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:26,480
the voice of another so i assume that means we need to hear the dharma most of

158
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,600
us so this form of wisdom is called

159
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,840
sutamaya panya panya being the word for wisdom and then

160
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:43,200
suta that's not the teachings the sutas that's s-u-t-t-a

161
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:50,880
this is s-u-t-a it's a different word and it it means what is heard

162
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:57,600
so suta means what is heard and in other contexts this word suta

163
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:03,600
is used to mean learning or one who has learned

164
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,960
so it has to do also with learning i think that's kind of interesting because

165
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:14,878
anything that involves thinking tends to get short shrift in the dharma

166
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:21,358
world and certainly it's true that we you know spending a lot of time thinking on the

167
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:28,480
cushion is distracting but across the teachings it would be hard to ignore that the buddha did

168
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:35,118
emphasize the importance of learning and so i want a quote from a suta that

169
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:41,280
talks about learning as a form of wealth it says this way

170
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,440
and what is the wealth of learning here a noble disciple has learned much

171
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:53,760
remembers what they have learned and accumulates what they have learned those teachings that are good in the

172
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:01,359
beginning good in the middle and good in the end with the right meaning and phrasing which proclaim the perfectly

173
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:06,480
complete and pure spiritual life such teachings as these they have

174
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:12,720
learned much of retained in mind recited verbally mentally investigated and

175
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:19,680
penetrated well by view so that's kind of a lot
