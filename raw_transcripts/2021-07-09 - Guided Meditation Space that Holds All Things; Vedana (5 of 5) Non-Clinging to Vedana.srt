1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:10,480
so welcome to this meditation session and

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,279
andy unequivocally here we are

3
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,640
to acknowledge

4
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:35,280
the location that you're sitting in to acknowledge what is supporting your

5
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:43,680
weight where the pull of gravity meets us

6
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:51,120
a surface and to really feel that you're here

7
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,840
and one of the

8
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:10,840
opportunities in meditation is to recognize the space that's around

9
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,960
everything that whatever we sense whatever we feel whatever we

10
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,798
experience whatever we think

11
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:32,240
that there's a way of seeing it in its own uniqueness as a particular manifestation

12
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,560
and we with around which is the space of

13
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:47,439
awareness around which it can exist just in itself as it is in a way that can be

14
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:53,040
seen as respectful for the uniqueness of it for the momentariness

15
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,040
of it but also allows us to

16
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,159
not get involved or caught in it

17
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,080
allowing each things to exist like a star is allowed to exist in the vast night

18
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,640
sky so different sensations and different

19
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:24,480
vedana feeling tones and thoughts and whatever there's a way of being open relaxed with

20
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,160
awareness to see it by itself

21
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:37,840
just without diminishing its value you can add the word just

22
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:47,760
it's just a feeling just a sensation it's just a thought it's just a sound

23
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:55,040
and that just maybe is to allow you to recognize that whatever

24
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:02,640
in unique situation event comes into awareness there can be

25
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,800
the space of awareness around it

26
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:16,400
there can be a gap between what we are aware of

27
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,239
and how we react how we react to it

28
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,959
how we

29
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,640
think about it how we feel about it

30
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,680
that gap that space between them is a space of freedom

31
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:51,040
the gap and freedom the space between the way in which we identify

32
00:03:51,040 --> 00:04:00,000
with stuff or assume there's a self makeup idea of me myself and mine

33
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,159
maybe it's okay that you do so but there's a space

34
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,760
a gap a pause between each thing

35
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:20,000
and each thing is independent free of the self-making we do

36
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:43,840
so gently closing your eyes and taking a few long slow deep breaths

37
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,919
relaxing as you exhale

38
00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:00,160
if you take a deep inhale maybe your torso chest expands out into the space around

39
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:11,840
you and inhale it recedes

40
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:30,320
letting your breathing return to normal and on the exhale continue to take a few

41
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:39,680
moments to relax the body

42
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,639
softening in the face the shoulders the

43
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
belly

44
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,039
and then becoming aware of the simplicity of breathing

45
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:24,639
that whatever sensations are present in your breathing

46
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:35,840
exist in surrounded by the space of awareness

47
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,440
they exist as particular points of sensation

48
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:48,319
places of sensation outside of which

49
00:06:48,319 --> 00:07:03,840
those sensations are not seen or felt

50
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,880
the sensations that make up the edges of your body

51
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,560
beyond them their space

52
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:45,840
in a certain way kind of way inside of them there is space

53
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:59,840
and you might be thinking about what's happening

54
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,919
but there is a space or a gap between your thoughts

55
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:14,479
and the experience it's possible to know the experience

56
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,080
in its own simplicity

57
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:27,840
as distinct from thinking thoughts

58
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:55,839
the space around each phenomenal experience

59
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:09,839
might also be characterized by silence a sweet silence

60
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:23,839
or a stillness

61
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:09,439
and as you breathe perhaps breathe through and into

62
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:19,120
the spaciousness here the silence that's here

63
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,720
this stillness that's here

64
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:34,399
so you don't deny anything but each thing each experience

65
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:44,480
can exist within the space of awareness as

66
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,839
itself

67
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:25,120
if you focus on the objects in a room you might not notice the space

68
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,480
that's in the room if you focus on your thoughts and your

69
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,000
feelings and sensations you might not notice the space that

70
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,160
holds all that

71
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:48,000
we tend to not notice the space

72
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:57,920
but that's where we can find freedom

73
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,320
notice the space around things

74
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,519
breathe with it

75
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,839
relax into it

76
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:41,839
let the space help silence the mind

77
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,360
as we come to the end of the sitting

78
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:37,760
to open the space in your mind in your heart

79
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,520
to take in this vast wide world of ours

80
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,840
a world of suffering a world of joy

81
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:59,519
a world of oppression and a world of people who care to end depression

82
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:07,919
a world of poverty and sickness and those who work hard

83
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,398
to alleviate poverty and sickness

84
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:20,960
it's a huge wide world young the old

85
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,278
those who are alone and those who are together

86
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:33,679
and to make uh have our heart be wide enough and spacious enough

87
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:43,360
to allow each of them to be held uniquely in our hearts so there's lots of space

88
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:51,520
for people to be known and listened to and seen

89
00:28:54,559 --> 00:29:00,159
may it be that we cannot maintain or find

90
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:06,799
a heart fullness mind fullness

91
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:14,720
that allows us to meet others and care for others for their own uniqueness

92
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,679
for their own personal circumstance

93
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:27,840
may it be that this meditation supports us

94
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,158
to live for the welfare and the happiness of others

95
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:41,600
may that be an extension of what we find in meditation

96
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:47,360
may all beings be peaceful

97
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:54,960
may all beings be safe

98
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,200
may all beings be happy

99
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:09,840
and may all beings everywhere be free

100
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:19,630
[Music]

101
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,749
[Music]

102
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:37,440
so this will be the last talk on vedana the feeling tones the effective quality

103
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,240
of our experience that all things

104
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:48,840
have among all the different qualities that things have experiences have all the different characteristics of

105
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:56,000
them they have they have they have either have they're pleasant

106
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:03,440
or unpleasant or neither pleasant or unpleasant and uh and we're kind of focusing on the

107
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:10,240
real specificity of one of a moment of experience of something in the complexity of life

108
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,279
and many things happening in a kind of swirl of or complexity there could be a

109
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:21,760
combination of all those that we can identify but when you get quiet and still and really kind of tune into the

110
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:30,840
details particularity of what it is then um the um the

111
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:36,240
um you know they're pleasant unpleasant or

112
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,159
neutral and now one of the really fascinating

113
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:49,919
teachings of the buddha is that people's uh philosophies

114
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:57,519
people's view of life people's maybe he doesn't say this but even though maybe their politics have at

115
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:05,360
their base or at their at their root somehow uh a reaction

116
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:11,840
to what's pleasant unpleasant or neutral and the very sophisticated philosophies

117
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:19,279
very sophisticated justification for political political systems or views might have its beginning

118
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:25,360
in a reactivity to things that we find pleasant and unpleasant

119
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:31,840
and and this idea of pleasant and unpleasant that we're talking about here is not the

120
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:38,080
raw unpleasant and pleasantness of experience there is no such raw thing because

121
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,600
almost right away things arise pleasant unpleasant with

122
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,640
our perceptions our evaluation our associations with it

123
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:55,440
so that this pleasant unpleasant sometimes in in is referred to as liking and disliking

124
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:02,480
so this movement of liking and disliking being for or against is so deep and it's kind of amazing that

125
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:10,320
uh if we really trace back our where the basis of how we react in the world is

126
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:19,679
then we have this

127
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:27,279
you know trace it back you know it all begins with pleasant and unpleasant and this is what i said earlier

128
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:34,240
so anyway the teaching of the buddha is that the the all these philosophies and ideas of

129
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,279
you speculation speculative views about life the nature of life

130
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:44,960
can have their roots in this simple thing pleasant and unpleasant and the one that's most significant for

131
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,000
many people and who would interested in becoming free is the way in which

132
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,000
ideas of self identity can have their roots the way we not not

133
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,080
identity that we are born into or that other people assume about us or you know there's a lot of identities

134
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:08,520
which just come with being human being that uh with but um the act of

135
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:15,358
identification the act of latching on to an identity and and these all these different

136
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:21,118
identities that we swirl around in kaleidoscope are relevant at different times if we

137
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:28,638
latch onto it cling to it hold on to it then we'll suffer and this clinging to identity clinging

138
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:35,679
to ideas of self it has at the root of it this concern

139
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:44,638
with pleasant and unpleasant pleasant and unpleasant can be a very deep conditioning for this movement towards

140
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:51,839
me myself and mine and one way it takes its shape is um when we say when we identify

141
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:58,079
with the feelings themselves when uh the feeling tone of experience uh

142
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:04,160
when things are pleasant it's like this is i'm the one who's experiencing the pleasantness or i'm the one who

143
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,200
experienced the unpleasantness this is my pleasant experience this is my

144
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:15,359
unpleasant experience and um on this very close kind of wrapping

145
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:20,800
ourselves around clinging and having a sense of self in relationship to

146
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,000
feeling tones is one of the great sources of suffering and one of the great kind of

147
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,839
possibilities of freedom is to allow the kaleidoscope of

148
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:39,280
feeling tones of how things appear and disappear as pleasant and unpleasant to just come and go and kind of float in

149
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:47,440
them or or make room for them or be spacious around them and and so

150
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,720
uh and feeling these feeling tones are something that if you really tune

151
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,839
into them and really get close and feel them they're not stationary they're not fixed

152
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:04,640
they're actually quite fluid and changeable and the analogy that buddha gave for them is

153
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:11,839
um that they when there's a big rainstorm and

154
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:17,680
the rain is formed uh falling raindrops are falling on a lake there's a spell the spatterings and

155
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:24,079
little bubbles and spatterings of of uh you know a splashing of

156
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:30,000
flake water from the drops and those appear ephemerally they're there for brief moment and then they

157
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,920
dissipate and so the feeling tones whether things are pleasant unpleasant or not neither

158
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:42,800
have that kind of ephemeral quality to it and if we can really settle back

159
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:49,839
and open up in the spaciousness of the mind to feel intimately that kaleidoscope of changing

160
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:54,880
sensations that's where sometimes we can loosen up the grip of self

161
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:01,280
around the sensations themselves and to let go and it's not meant to let

162
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:07,359
go of necessarily let go of to philosophical views ideas of what self

163
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:15,200
is at the core what this buddhist tradition is about is letting go of clinging any kind of

164
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:22,400
clinging and one of the means to do that is to be aware of the pleasant and unpleasant

165
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:29,760
and neutral uh quality of our experience and if you could kind of tune into the

166
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:38,400
the changing impermanent inconstant nature of those feeling tones you'll be well on your way to not

167
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:44,800
to appreciate that clinging to it doesn't really work and that sometimes

168
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,240
we cling to is not the pleasant and unpleasant but rather the concepts and ideas we

169
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:56,320
have of pleasant and unpleasant and uh and that makes them stationary seem like they last longer than they

170
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:01,599
really do and um more constant than they really

171
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:08,320
are and um and so this idea that um

172
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:15,440
and so to discover non-clinging through feeling tones

173
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:22,800
discover freedom to feeling in feeling tones and one way to do that is to appreciate

174
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:29,280
the space around each feeling tone the stillness the silence within which

175
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,079
the raindrops are splattering and

176
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:41,760
so feeling tones pleasant unpleasant and neutral and becoming aware of the ephemeral

177
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,800
nature of them and if they don't feel ephemeral they don't feel you don't see them or sense

178
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:53,680
them as somehow changing maybe flashing in and out of existence so there there's continuity over time with some

179
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:59,839
sensations but they are actually in the moment they're kind of flashing in and out of existence in a

180
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:05,200
certain way if you don't see it that way chances are that you're living

181
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:10,960
in your ideas of them your thoughts of sensations your thoughts are pleasant your thoughts

182
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,560
are what's unpleasant and but if you really turn the lens of mindfulness around

183
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:22,760
carefully to the thoughts themselves you'll see that thoughts too are

184
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:28,880
insubstantial thoughts too are like raindrops that come and go and are there for a moment

185
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:34,960
and then they fade away unless we're holding on to them or unless we somehow

186
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:41,599
in the clinging are stringing a whole series of them together so they look like they're

187
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:47,680
constant but in fact there's actually a lot of

188
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:53,280
space between thoughts between ideas

189
00:39:53,280 --> 00:40:00,800
if we don't string them together if we should allow each thing to be there in its own uniqueness

190
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:11,839
and in that space there can be freedom freedom of the mind that does not cling

191
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:18,880
so those are my thoughts on this topic of

192
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:25,119
vedana and i look forward to being back in a little over a week

193
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:31,119
and i hope that your weekend is pleasant and in the

194
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:36,960
pleasantness you see the inconstant nature of pleasantness

195
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:45,519
not holding on to it not clinging to it but learning how to

196
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:50,480
enjoy with no clinging whatsoever

197
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:57,119
so thank you all
