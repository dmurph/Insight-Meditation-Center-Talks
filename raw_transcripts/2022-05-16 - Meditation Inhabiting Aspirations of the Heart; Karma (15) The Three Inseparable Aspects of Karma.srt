and what is my moment-to-moment intention for this engagement

22
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,680
letting your intention be felt not in your head as a thought but in your body

23
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:07,169
in your heart as a conviction [Music]

24
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,400
as a bright light

25
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:24,080
as an inspiration that lifts you up keeps reorienting you every moment when

26
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:31,200
you get lost in thought there is your intention yes i do intend

27

to be here to be present to be kind to myself and others

28
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,519

30
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,600

41
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,600
releasing softening

42
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,720
whatever emotions are present is okay

43
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,759
it's all okay

44
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:44,800
nothing is a problem in this moment to be treated as such to make space to make space

45
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,400
the heart more expansive than we realize

46
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,599
releasing releasing the abdomen

47
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:17,840

breathing breathing

54
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:25,639
breathing on its own we don't have to consciously breathe

55
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:35,719
trust trust the body

56
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:21,680
and at any point if you find yourself lost in thinking it's okay

57
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,040

58
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,320

59
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,320

calming soothing breath

68
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:34,920
it is helpful to reconnect with our intention now and then

69
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:48,120
here here let the intention be the guiding

70
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,639
north star

71
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:22,000
and yet right here so close in our hearts inhabiting

72
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:30,639
this better angel here and now in this moment

73
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,120
not too far

74
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,920
the angel out ahead is closer than we think it's right here

75
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:13,839
stepping into and inhabiting

76
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,079
in this moment

77
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,480
are better angels

78
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:41,639
just a mind moment of intention away right here

79
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,000
what is your intention in this moment

80
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:52,600
what is the intention of the heart not in a tight graspy way at all

81
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:04,200
but in a beautiful loving perhaps even devotional way

82
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,760
what do you want to give your heart to in this moment of awareness

83
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,080
right here

84
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,480
what do you want to cultivate in this

85
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:38,158
short human life in this moment of it in this passing moment

86
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,960
it's already here just recognize it

87
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,840
with relaxed easy

88
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:03,080
soft gentle heart mind body

89
00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:00,080
and one invitation for an exploration

90
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,080
for some the word intention is just fine

91
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:13,120
and for some it might be too dry too heady

92
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:22,440
you're welcome to experiment in your heart and your body with an alternative

93
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,399
how about the angel within

94
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,240
aligning with the angel within

95
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:57,520
or whatever frey's idea is embodied and inspires you

96
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,640
physically see how this might shift my invitation

97
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:09,440
if you like it how it might shift something for you open something

98
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,480
inhabiting inhabiting the angel within

99
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,919
hmm

100
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:29,120
maybe so you sit a little taller a little more with ease

101
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:38,158
vibrations of warmth goodness kindness

102
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,760
reverberate see for yourself

103
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:52,960
and as we move to bring this sitting together

104
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,480
the sitting to a close together

105
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:13,840
let the inhabited felt expansive angel within

106
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:22,000
to appreciate that you showed up that you have practiced

107
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:29,120
and for them to let go to be kind towards

108
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:34,159
anything that quote-unquote you didn't like

109
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:40,640
sleepiness distraction it's all okay

110
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,520

111
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:54,440

to have sat with sangha in this moment in time

114
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:15,760
they don't take it for granted to have sat with other angels

115
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:21,600
in this moment in time oh so much goodness

116
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:28,159

00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:28,159
so lovely to practice together so lovely

128
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:35,760
not taken for granted it's i have this image of

129
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:42,000
us in different places and so i so appreciate the

130
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,760
the words and chat coming through and the different places you are in the world

131
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,960
so we appreciate feeling your presence all of us together

132
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,240
powerful powerful thank you

133
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:06,880
so so today i would like to

134
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,399
speak about

135
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,480
this teaching this concept this

136
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:25,760
practice that's often misunderstood in the west

137
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:33,118
not perhaps so much by buddhists but maybe by us too at times

138
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:39,520
but it this word has been co-opted this teaching has been

139
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:48,200
co-opted by the popular culture and misrepresented misunderstood so

140
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:56,000
so this teaching i'd like to talk about today is the beautiful profound teaching

141
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,839
of karma karma so

142
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:08,079
in the west it's often thought of as

143
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:14,480
an inheritance and it's often bad like oh what have i done or what has

144
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:20,400
this person done in their past life that they deserve this or they must have

145
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,520
done something terrible or i must have done something terrible and

146
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:32,880
basically using the um the teaching of karma

147
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:39,040
as as flagellation as a way to flagellate

148
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:45,078
either cell flagellate or flagellate others so

149
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,800
it's not a helpful and it's not actually it's not a useful

150
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:59,920
way to use this practice to interpret this practice to to understand this practice

151
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:06,160
so i want to speak a little bit about that and actually to the profundity of what

152
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:13,040
karma means here and now for us and it's not this magical

153
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:19,680
um thing this idea that we don't quite understand and it's weird and it's in

154
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,960
some other dimension

155
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:30,320
so so not to think of karma as destiny or

156
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,680
as fate as it is often thought of but it's

157
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:42,079
again it's really a distortion to think of it as fate it's a distortion of the buddhist

158
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:50,560
teachings it's definitely a distortion and and i love the words of um

159
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,838
of andrew oldinsky

160
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:04,320
saying their name properly olensky who says

161
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:10,880
that karma is has unparalleled unparalleled profundity

162
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:19,359
and significance i love that unparalleled profundity the concept of karma in the teaching so

163
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:28,000
so let's do away with let's do away with this magical this weird thing that we

164
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:36,560
don't even know um you know fate destiny let's do away with that understanding all together but instead

165
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:43,440
consider first of all the word karma simply means action

166
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:51,839
and it's derived from the verbal root vector which means to do to make in pali

167
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:57,760
to do to make you already get the sense right to do to make is different from something you

168
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:05,839
inherit something magical and weird right so to do to make

169
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,960
and there are three distinct senses of the word here there are three

170
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:20,640
distinct senses of this word here and yet these three distinct senses which i will

171
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,920
describe in a moment are inseparable

172
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:34,640
inseparable aspects of the same process of karma okay so here are the three aspects

173
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:42,000
so the first one is the decision to do something

174
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:47,920
it's the intention is the decision to do something okay that's the that's

175
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:54,560
the leading edge the second aspect is the action

176
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:01,720
that actually carries carries the thing out is the action

177
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:09,599
and the third aspect is what we make what we make thereby

178
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,800
as the result of that action so there are these three distinct

179
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,960
aspects so let me repeat that so the first is the decision or the

180
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:28,000
intention to do something the second is the action that actually carries it out and the third is the

181
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,280
result of the action what we make

182
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,560
and karma is actually all three of those they're

183
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:44,480
inseparable they're distinct but inseparable not just the intention

184
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:51,200
not just the action itself and not just the results it's all three of them

185
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:58,560
which is so beautiful and profound it's right here right now

186
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:05,440
so the buddhist understanding is that these three parts are the same whole

187
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,440
so the intention being the leading edge of karma

188
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:17,200
which leads which directs the activities

189
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,640
of the mind speech and the body all of those are

190
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,160
considered actions notice that the mind thoughts are considered actions

191
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,200
in buddhism actions of the mind speech is considered action of

192
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:38,480
speaking of course and the body is considered action so all those three so

193
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:46,400
again intention is the leading edge of the karma of karma which directs the activities

194
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:52,160
which then which then on the trailing edge it

195
00:40:52,160 --> 00:41:00,240
accumulates the karmic formations of the karmic dispositions karmic dispositions it's our disposition

196
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:07,440
if we just drop the word karmic it's our dispositions it's how we show up it's how we

197
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:14,079
ourselves are made up of those dispositions which also is the intention the actions

198
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:21,319
and the dispositions so

199
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:27,440
so in other words actions is preceded every action

200
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:34,000
the mind of action of the mind speech and body is action is already preceded

201
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,040
by some doing right by some doing and that doing

202
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:44,640
is where the decisions are made is the intention is the doing of the oh

203
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:50,079
intending the volition the aligning or not aligning it's that

204
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:58,400
there's some doing before the action and then there is a result in the making

205
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:04,480
in the making of our unique personality of our dispositions

206
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,599
so so the main idea behind karma is the

207
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:15,280
relationship between what we choose to do and what we

208
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:22,880
make of ourselves what we choose to do and what we make of ourselves

209
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:31,839
let me just pause here wow to me this teaching is so profound it's

210
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:37,520
not about faith oh poor me what have i got it's actually

211
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:46,640
a powerful empowering teaching of what we choose to do and what we make

212
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:54,400
make of ourselves so powerful so powerful i i

213
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,440
love this teaching and every time i'll just share with you

214
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:05,760
as i come to this and many teachings over the years over time there are more

215
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:12,319
nuances there's more beauty maybe when i was younger my early years of practice there was

216
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:18,240
some level of understanding and the more i come to these teachings there is

217
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:24,079
a newer level of appreciation for the beauty for the profundity

218
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:30,000
of these practices so i invite you to see them with their fresh eyes even if you're a

219
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,520
practiced experienced practitioner don't hear the word karma and go yeah yeah

220
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:42,079
yeah i know i've studied this appreciate it as if with fresh eyes

221
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:48,400
in your practice in in your heart and mind in this moment

222
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:54,960
so one last thing i want to say and there's more i want to say tomorrow so

223
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,200
there is this expression in pali

224
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:09,359
sankaram api sankarito sankharam apa sankarito

225
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:16,800
which are many ways that can be translated to english and again according to andrew olensky

226
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:23,960
could be translated as one forms formations or one constructs

227
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:29,599
constructions or one creates creations

228
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:37,400
one fabricates fabrications so

229
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:45,359
the an action both involves the activity as well as building something as the

230
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:52,079
product of it and an image that is used in the suttas

231
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:59,359
often is the image of a potter on a pottery wheel a potter is engaged

232
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:05,760
in the creative process of shaping forming the clay and making something to

233
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:13,599
his will with his intention with his desire with his actions so intention actions

234
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:20,400
is forming the clay forming the clay and then when the pot is done

235
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,760
it's put in a kiln and it's fired it's put in the fire

236
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:32,880
and then it's an enduring it's an everlasting artifact this pot so think

237
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:40,720
of ourselves our characters our personalities our very self quote-unquote self

238
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:48,240
as this again olenski puts it beautifully ossified karmic relics

239
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:54,880
ossified or rather as a gallery of ossified karmic relics

240
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:00,560
the accumulated residue of earlier dynamic processes of intention and

241
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:08,160
action i'll close by reading that one more time what we take to be our very self

242
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:17,040
is viewed in buddhist thought as a gallery of ossified karmic relics the accumulated residue of

243
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:22,319
earlier dynamic processes of intention and action

244
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:28,160
there's so much more here to say but just to end and say think of karma as an

245
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:36,560
empowerment as an empowering teaching that one we can change we can change anyway

246
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:42,400
we're out of time so much more to say but we have time together tomorrow well

247
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:48,079
maybe life is so impermanent and unpredictable but

248
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:54,880
if all maybe we'll see each other tomorrow take good care looking forward to practicing

249
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:59,880
together be well
