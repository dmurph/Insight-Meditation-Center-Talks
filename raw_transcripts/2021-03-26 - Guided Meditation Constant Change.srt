1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:12,400
so good day everyone and welcome to this meditation session

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,440
and one of the functions of buddhist meditation

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,880
is to place ourselves

4
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:30,400
squarely fully into the vibrant

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:37,360
and dynamic pulsing [Music]

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:45,440
experience of life of being alive that um

7
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,440
all the sensations that you experience whatever they might be pleasant or

8
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,840
unpleasant they come and they go they're dynamic they vibrate they

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,559
are flashing in and out of existence moment by moment

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,240
that all the experiences sensations that you have you have because you're alive once

11
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,240
you're dead your body is no longer energized or

12
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,439
animated with the whatever the life force is within us

13
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:29,200
there are no sensations whatsoever and um and the sensations we experience

14
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,640
are proof of the living livingness in us the dynamic and active

15
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,680
quality of the natural world the energies of the natural world that how they flow through us and manifest in

16
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,640
us and so to sit in the middle of our body and with

17
00:01:50,640 --> 00:02:00,000
anapanasati and uh to be able to be centered unified collected

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
um liberated from distractions and really here be here to feel and

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,080
sense and be intimate with the dynamism

20
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,319
of change dynamism of the the coming and going appearing and

21
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:25,200
disappearing of phenomena everything to be called experience

22
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:32,879
in a certain way what it doesn't change are concepts platonic concepts of

23
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:40,319
things which their ideas of them which stay constant ideas of self ideas of others

24
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,720
ideas of what has happened to us and even some kind of funny way what will happen to us

25
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:53,360
these ideas give the semblance that things are continuous maybe in some things are in

26
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:00,480
certain kind of way but to drop into the flow of experience

27
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,959
to the direct direct immediate perception knowing experiencing

28
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:14,400
of life as it flows in that little window little kind of

29
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:22,640
where they vast past and vast future of you know coming and going

30
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:29,840
we have this idea i think in in english sometimes that we're moving into the future and i think

31
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,760
in ancient india they had the idea more the idea that the future was coming towards us

32
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:44,239
and this river of you know just time just flows and when it and we know the future

33
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:52,480
only in the experience as it becomes the present and as we know it it already vanishes

34
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,000
there's something about the immediacy it already vanishes here

35
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:06,000
so assuming a meditation posture a posture to

36
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,400
embody inhabit the lived experience of the moment

37
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,799
and perhaps to close your eyes in order to

38
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,320
be inside to sense and feel inside your life

39
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:40,840
your body sometimes with the eyes open we're looking at things externally and pulled into the external

40
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,160
world the eyes close the idea is to

41
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:55,600
come into this intimate world of our physical embodied experience

42
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,280
in the immediacy of here

43
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:11,600
and to gently maybe lovingly kindly slowly take some deeper breaths

44
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,120
maybe three quarters full

45
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:25,520
taking deeper breaths so slow and careful enough that you almost like you're savoring and enjoying

46
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:38,880
this the feelings in your body of the chest expanding the belly expanding

47
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:45,120
and then a longer exhale than usual not so much maybe that you're forcing

48
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,320
the air out but you let go you release

49
00:05:50,320 --> 00:06:07,840
the muscles around your diaphragm your chest so that the exhale extends itself

50
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:20,960
as you have these long exhales also relax other parts of your body

51
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,120
relaxing into your body

52
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,800
and then again lovingly gently

53
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:42,560
allow your breathing to return to normal without the need for any

54
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:49,120
clear idea of what normal is just allow your breathing to breathe

55
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,599
itself

56
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:08,080
and also continue this relaxing softening the face

57
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,840
softening the shoulders

58
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:31,840
releasing the belly

59
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:45,919
and somehow maybe even releasing all the holding the global holding of the body

60
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,240
holding it all together no need to in meditation

61
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,599
to relax release

62
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:06,639
releasing into this body to feel and sense

63
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:13,840
the immediacy of our lived life

64
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:27,840
the experience of sensations

65
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:41,839
and then kindly gently maybe even tenderly

66
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:50,560
and determinedly center yourself on the experience of

67
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
breathing

68
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:08,080
breathing is often taken as a sign of being alive

69
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,240
and the inconstant shifting changing sensations of breathing

70
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,000
sensations of breathing in are different than breathing out

71
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:28,880
sensations of breathing in disappear so that sensations of exhale can begin

72
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:37,839
and vice versa

73
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,640
regardless of how pleasant or unpleasant your breathing is to feel it

74
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:19,360
and experience it to center yourself in it

75
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:33,839
is to enter into the intimacy and of being really here with our lived life

76
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:32,880
and then as you're with your breathing and maybe that's mostly what you do

77
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:43,839
to feel the inconstancy of all the sensations that flow through that appear and disappear

78
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:51,040
and perhaps as you do so you relax and open all everything around

79
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:58,959
the breathing and perhaps as they get more and more

80
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:06,480
intimate there will be some experience that everything

81
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:13,360
is shifting changing arising disappearing

82
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,759
in the immediacy of how they are felt and experienced

83
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,839
if we recede into thoughts and ideas of things

84
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,519
we begin projecting ideas of constancy and

85
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:40,800
permanence but as a thinking mind gets quieter

86
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,519
we just feel and sense experience

87
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,240
breathing in and breathing out

88
00:12:51,519 --> 00:13:07,839
with all the inconstancy of things coming and going

89
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:33,679
so the experience of thinking

90
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:41,440
if we intimate with the actual experience thoughts are also inconstant they come

91
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:50,320
and they go rather than being involved in thoughts

92
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,880
to settle further in and just see thoughts as

93
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,280
arising and passing coming and going

94
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:11,840
individual words or images that appear come and they go

95
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:20,960
in the intimacy of the moment everything

96
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:39,840
is part of a field of appearing and disappearing phenomenon

97
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,480
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

98
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:02,880
there's something about being at rest

99
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:09,600
in the middle of change settling back as if we're sitting in an

100
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,440
easy chair allowing everything to

101
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,720
move and change and appear and disappear

102
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:26,799
freely without us interfering with them

103
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:34,480
feeling safe and comfortable just letting the things everything come

104
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,158
and go everything

105
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:50,880
it can be uncomfortable to do this but it also can open up

106
00:27:50,880 --> 00:28:00,000
the barriers to feeling tender love and kindness

107
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,919
to feel compassion care

108
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:13,120
for this changing buzzing flowing world

109
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:21,440
because what gets in the way of our love is something we're holding on to

110
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:27,600
something that we are that blocks or covers over

111
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:35,600
but when everything is buzzing and changing and but we're at rest with awareness

112
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:44,000
there can be a greater capacity for compassion for all

113
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,240
this

114
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:59,840
to be still and gaze upon everything kindly

115
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,000
to be still in the middle of all the

116
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:18,320
change and to feel compassion for

117
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,360
the challenges that everyone has in this changing world

118
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:32,399
to feel the joy buddhita that because things change things also

119
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,600
get better for people

120
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:46,799
and because we're not holding on to anything there can be kindness

121
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:58,080
may all beings be free of suffering

122
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:09,600
may all beings celebrate

123
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,440
their capacity for freedom

124
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:25,600
may all beings live in a world of kindness and friendliness

125
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:37,840
may all beings be the kind and friendly ones

126
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:50,559
may all beings be peaceful

127
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:58,960
and may all beings contribute to the peacefulness of this world

128
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:09,600
may all beings be free and may all beings

129
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:19,840
support the freedom of others

130
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:28,320
may we all share in love and kindness and friendliness

131
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,278
in living this buzzing changing

132
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:47,840
impermanent life that we find ourselves in

133
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,840
this
