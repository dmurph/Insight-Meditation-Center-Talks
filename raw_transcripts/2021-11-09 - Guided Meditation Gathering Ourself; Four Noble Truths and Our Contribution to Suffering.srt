1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:06,879
so good evening everyone and as we come here today

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:14,080
uh for me uh a few things that come to mind one is that it's been it was 20 years ago just about now that

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,560
we bought this building so it's kind of a little bit of an anniversary it's also the

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,760
first time for me to come back teach here with people here in uh

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,199
you know for a year and a half or more and before that almost 30 years i taught

6
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,760
almost every single monday so like that kind of was a big big big gap so it's kind of a big

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,120
wonderful to be back monday evening and i'm so happy to see some of you that

8
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:49,920
all of you that i know they're here thank you and those of you on youtube are watching

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:58,360
thank you for being here and i see the names in the chat and it's lovely to see the ones i know

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:06,000
so i'll say i'll do a little bit of beginning to the meditation and then we'll sit quietly

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,119
and then one of the ways of understanding meditation

12
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:18,880
is that initially it's preparing the ground so that we can see

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,759
in some clear way and so we're preparing ourselves to be able to have that clarity of insight

14
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:32,079
clarity of seeing and so we're kind of we're the variety of things we do at the

15
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,119
beginning are kind of settling in some people like the language of

16
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:43,680
settling in letting go and kind of doing less just being and some people like the language of

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,159
constructing like we're constructing our temple we're gathering together organizing ourselves in such a way

18
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:57,200
that we're kind of here in a qualitative at identifiable way like i'm really here

19
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,799
i'm not wandering off not thinking about the day anymore i'm really here

20
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,319
and uh and that and that ability the higher the greater the ability to really be here in

21
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:13,680
the present moment that opens the door to see in a new way

22
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,440
and i'll talk about that in the dharma talk so in a sense this meditation is a

23
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,520
preparation for the seeing that will be emphasized in the talk

24
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,400
so to let this body of yours

25
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,360
be the become the meditation hall

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,080
the real meditation hall is here in your body

27
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,560
and to take a few long slow deep breaths in order to begin

28
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,920
establishing yourself here

29
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,120
and letting your breathing return to normal

30
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,560
and for many people the beginning of this process of arriving here

31
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,760
is to relax and not just relaxing them up the

32
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,360
muscles and face shoulders and belly

33
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,040
but relax into this time and place now

34
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,159
settling into being here

35
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:05,120
and in a gentle loving way perhaps caring away

36
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,799
begin gathering yourself together so you

37
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:19,120
collecting yourself here in this time in this place and if the mind wanders off

38
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,639
gently lovingly unhurriedly

39
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,919
invited back bring it back collect the mind

40
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:37,520
bring it back here with the body in the present moment

41
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,440
bring the mind into the body so the mind is not wandering off in

42
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,280
thought just here

43
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,880
slowly steadily gathering yourself collecting yourself

44
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,160
here at this time at this place moment by moment

45
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:46,000
as we come to the end of the sitting

46
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:55,119
one of the descriptions of meditation practice

47
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:02,800
is collecting ourselves here into the present moment

48
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:09,040
and gathering together all of who we are

49
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:14,960
so it's all together here in a singular package

50
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:21,040
of presence of attention and one of the advantages or

51
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:28,319
opportunities with this is when we're gathered together and not scattered and

52
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:34,800
distracted disconnected from ourselves

53
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,560
there's more of us to meet others

54
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:50,400
there's more presence embodiment

55
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:57,200
more receptivity a greater capacity to listen

56
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:03,200
to attend there's more of us gather together to

57
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:10,880
care and to be kind respectful of others

58
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:17,839
there's more of us here to love

59
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:28,760
and it's a gift to give more of ourselves over to be with others

60
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:38,000
so others can feel met seen heard known

61
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,680
respected and cared for

62
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:49,920
may it be that this meditation we do this evening

63
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:58,160
supports us so that we can bring ourselves more into

64
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:04,880
a full human connection with others at a time when people many people still

65
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,279
feel very disconnected and isolated and

66
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:15,200
may we bring ourselves to greater

67
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:22,960
kindness and support for this world of ours may all beings

68
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:30,640
be happy may all beings be safe

69
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:36,640
may all beings be peaceful

70
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,400
and may all beings be free

71
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:57,419
[Music]

72
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,400
thank you

73
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:19,640
could you turn that one down that went down to one

74
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:04,720
so good evening again and i'm delighted to be meditating with people

75
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:12,240
in the same room and for the last year and a half i've delighted with sitting with people

76
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:18,240
who were on the other side of the camera and i appreciated also also we're going to

77
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:24,000
see their names and greetings and chat and that was quite lovely but it's also very nice to be here with you all thank

78
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,119
you for coming and uh it's the beginning of uh

79
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:35,040
you know hopefully beginning that we'll continue now to develop that we can open up and people start gathering together

80
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:42,000
as a community so the idea is to for us to

81
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:49,760
continue on mondays being open the way we are with people who are registered and signed up to come

82
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:56,240
and uh and then diana who's been teaching this holding down mondays throughout the pandemic

83
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:02,000
thank you diana and the idea for the next while is that

84
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:08,880
we'll also alternate uh teaching here so diana will be here next monday and i'll be the following

85
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:14,920
and so on for a while that's kind of the general plan

86
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:23,280
so thinking about a talk for today i thought that

87
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,560
this is kind of a new beginning here that i thought that a really good place

88
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:35,119
to begin is with the four noble truths they're considered kind of a core teachings of the buddha

89
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:40,560
and it seems pretty symbolic to start with that pretty

90
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:46,560
evocative for me to kind of start with as they say that all the

91
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:51,760
buddhist teachings can be subsumed or held within the

92
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:59,280
four noble truths the ancient analogy that they come from india just like of all the animals in

93
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,720
the forest their footprints can be held inside the footprint of an elephant

94
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:10,560
this is big enough to hold it all so the four noble truths are big enough to hold it all

95
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:15,760
and down through the ages there's been many understandings or interpretations of the

96
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:21,760
four noble truths and uh there isn't like a singular understanding in fact the buddha

97
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:27,920
suggested that he said there are innumerable explanations for these four noble truths

98
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:33,760
they're very rich and and evocative and and now rather than taking them as being a

99
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:40,160
singular thing that there's only one thing we learned the basic idea of it

100
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:48,240
and then we learned to apply it to ourselves into our lives and discover you know how it means for us

101
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:53,680
there's a mahayana buddhist teaching that in this universe of ours there's lots

102
00:47:53,680 --> 00:48:01,680
and lots of uh kind of world systems with people who live on planets all over the uk cosmos

103
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:07,599
and all of them have the four noble truths and then they go through a long list of what those how they they talk

104
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:12,960
about the four noble jews and all these different world systems it's like a long long long text

105
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,880
and that's mostly just a list of all the different formulations of these four that could could exist

106
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:24,000
so this idea that there's many so i'll offer you you know one one of them which

107
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,920
is based on the early buddhist tradition and uh

108
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:37,119
and you'll see if it's nice for you and that's an introduction to it

109
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,960
um if

110
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,200
if you

111
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:53,839
say you rent an apartment someplace and you you day to move in and everything in

112
00:48:53,839 --> 00:49:01,040
apartments all good except in the corner of the living room there's an old radio

113
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:07,599
that's uh that's really grimy someone must have spilled food on it long ago and

114
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:13,280
it's not very nice but but you know someone forgot it or left it curious you said what's that doing

115
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:18,400
here and uh the thing is it's on and it's on some

116
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:24,160
really kind of the kind of radio station you'd never want to listen to and it's on

117
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:30,240
and so you look at it and say wow this is not right and maybe you get angry at the people there

118
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:36,960
before or maybe you feel spread a self-righteous letter to the to the landlords and

119
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:42,400
and say you know this this radio was left here and it's a real problem or

120
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:49,040
maybe you should go out and buy a bigger radio to put in front of it to hide it or maybe you should uh

121
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:54,800
find another apartment or all these thoughts and that goes on for days and weeks you know trying to figure out what to do

122
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:00,720
about this radio that's on all the time and then one day you finally decide you realize

123
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:07,359
you know i could just turn the radio off and you know at least you don't have to hear that terrible radio station all the

124
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:12,880
time so it's possible to

125
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:18,960
have all see all kinds of things wrong in our world in our society

126
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:24,240
or with ourselves and miss that there's a little button

127
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:29,520
where certain things can be turned off and maybe that's a little bit too

128
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:36,240
dramatic of a story analogy but uh but maybe uh it's worth kind of

129
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:42,480
preparing for what i'm gonna say that what we're looking for in the four noble truths

130
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,839
we're looking for trying to understand ourselves to see what

131
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:52,960
what we can do to stop suffering to turn off the button

132
00:50:52,960 --> 00:51:00,640
of our suffering and what and to do that we have to understand our contribution to it

133
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:07,119
what are we doing to attribute to the radio being on and where can we turn it off

134
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:13,520
and there's lots of things that are wrong with having the radio there and they left it there and it's dirty they didn't clean and

135
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:20,000
it's the wrong station and you know what was the landlord thinking and you paid a deposit and this is what you get

136
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:27,359
so you can do all those things but the radio still blares and you can turn it off

137
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:34,240
the fact that you weren't treated nicely or respectfully by the previous tenants or someone may be still true

138
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:41,599
not to be denied but if you want to sleep at night you want to turn the radio off

139
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:47,520
so the four noble truths are a means it's like a little four

140
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:52,559
four like a little uh description

141
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:58,880
of four steps or four areas by which we can understand our life

142
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:05,520
to help us understand what is our contribution to our suffering to our distress

143
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:11,680
what are we doing that's adding to it not to diminish you know necessarily taking care of

144
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:18,240
things in the world but what is our contribution and because your contribution to your

145
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:24,000
suffering that you have some ability to do something about

146
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:30,559
whether you can change the world around you is maybe you can maybe you can't

147
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:35,760
and some people will spend an ordinary amount of time trying to change the world around them

148
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:42,319
changing their family changing their work their boss their co-workers their

149
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:48,559
friends trying to get them all to behave just right and their neighbors or whatever

150
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:54,800
and sometimes the track record the success record of doing changing the world to accommodate

151
00:52:54,800 --> 00:53:01,280
ourselves and make it all right is not so high and it isn't that it shouldn't be

152
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:08,079
done but if it overlooks where we can make a difference it's a

153
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:13,920
little bit sad and so the art of it all is to look where can i make a difference where can

154
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:21,040
i change something and this has to do what i call our contribution to our suffering

155
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:26,240
and so these the schema of the four are are offering perspectives to get us in

156
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:31,920
the territory so we can begin understanding what our contribution is

157
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:40,079
so the four are the first one is a very simple and uh it just says that

158
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:45,920
it's the noble truth of suffering that's how it's translated into english

159
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:51,599
the ancient language buddhist language the word suffering literally means painful

160
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:58,240
and so it's saying that there is there is what is painful there are painful things in this world

161
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:04,400
but it's uh what we're looking at now is where the suffering is so where is the emotional pain what's painful

162
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:11,599
emotionally where's the distress and now the second noble truth is stated

163
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:19,119
very simply it's the arising of this painful thing the rising of this suffering

164
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:27,040
the third is the cessation of it the ending of it and the fourth is uh that there is a way

165
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:32,640
to the ending of that suffering the middle two the arising and the

166
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:38,000
seizing are uh it's a very important to see

167
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,920
because this is where we understand that our suffering is not hardwired in

168
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:50,000
it's not like we're born with this suffering and therefore we're gonna they can't do anything about it

169
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,839
it's something that comes and goes it appears and disappears it might seem like it's constant

170
00:54:55,839 --> 00:55:00,960
and seems like it's solid and unchanging but in fact in in its uh

171
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:07,440
his essence or something in its own nature it's actually something that's arising and passing and coming

172
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:14,400
and going and that's the good news because if it was solid and unchanging then

173
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:20,079
there's no hope but if it's something that comes and goes then we have some possibility to do

174
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:26,960
something about it we have some possibility to to find it another way

175
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:34,079
so the first noble truth is just an acknowledgement that there is things are painful

176
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:39,280
and all kinds of things are painful uh you know so let me and then the list

177
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:44,319
that the classic texts give are things like birth is painful

178
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:49,599
old age is painful sickness is painful separation from our loved ones is painful

179
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:55,200
non-separate not being separate from the you know people who are difficult is painful

180
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:02,160
there's all these things that are painful so there's acknowledgement yes there is this pain in the world

181
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:07,599
but the second noble truth says and then where what is the suffering

182
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:12,880
that is arising that appears in you

183
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:18,319
and that's the idea of your contribution where is the suffering that appears within you

184
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:24,880
that has its genesis in what you're doing or where you where you left the radio on

185
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:30,799
what is it what is that and it and then that the text points to

186
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:36,000
that it has to do with the suffering that you can do most about

187
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,280
is a suffering that is craving and the word is usually called it's

188
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:47,040
usually the classic the original word is uh thirst which is meant to kind of like a thirst

189
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:52,319
for power or something this drive or this compulsion

190
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:57,680
by which people are not free we're so driven by something that we have to have it

191
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:03,359
and this driveness that where we can't put something down

192
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:08,720
we can't stop what we're behaving is the genesis of what's this the

193
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:14,079
suffering that we can do something about that's where we contribute to our own

194
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:20,880
suffering so that's what we want to understand we want to understand

195
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:28,240
the craving the thirst the drive not only because it brings about

196
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:33,440
suffering but it is suffering it's painful to be caught in the grip

197
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:38,640
of these of this you know craving of thirst of

198
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:44,160
things you can't put down and i think meditators have developed a pretty good sense of this

199
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:50,079
because it's one thing to kind of just go about your day and feel like you can't put something down

200
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:57,920
but you sit and meditate and you see the mind just kind of churning away with its preoccupations concerns and drives

201
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:04,000
is i say wow this is powerful this is suffering sometimes the promise of getting what we

202
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:10,880
want the imagine and the imagination of imagination of it hides that it's that it's actually

203
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:18,000
distressing and uncomfortable to be under the under the the yoke of compulsion

204
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,760
of craving because but but it's hard to see it if you're focusing so much on the thing

205
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:29,680
you're going to get if i can get if i only win the california lottery i have to win the california lottery then everything's

206
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:34,880
going to be okay and i can just imagine i'm going to build a swimming pool if i get a california library it'll be so

207
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:42,720
great with three temperatures you know and it'd be so great but you don't see that that drive

208
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:48,400
maybe is a kind of uh desperation it's kind of comes out of maybe loneliness or even

209
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:56,160
fear and security all kinds of things that it comes with as we meditate we start seeing this

210
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:01,680
and at some point we see that it's not solid

211
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:07,280
it's not fixed it's something that it has is porous

212
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:13,680
something that's inconstant something that comes and goes but in order to see that we have to be

213
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:18,799
somewhat quiet and gathered and collected and have the ability to really

214
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:23,839
see and that's why i made it one of the functions of meditation

215
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:29,839
is not to sit down and right away just see what's going on and have insight in some deep way

216
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:36,000
but meditation is partly to settle us enough quiet us enough just enough not dramatically

217
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:41,440
but enough so we can really start seeing that the porousness of our suffering

218
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:46,400
the inconstancy of it the coming and going of it

219
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:54,400
and as we see that more and more we see that there is possible to be without it

220
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:59,440
it is possible to bring it to an end that it can cease

221
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:05,440
and uh because we we taste that very fleetingly perhaps but we say wow

222
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:11,359
i've had this this resentment for two years

223
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:18,079
and i thought it was solid it's like a mood that i carry around with me everywhere but now i see there's flickers of times

224
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:24,480
when it's not there wow it's not always there

225
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:32,160
and to the in the buddhist practice the idea is to appreciate those flickers appreciate those moments it's not there

226
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:38,160
and that's that can be hard to do because an absence like that doesn't count for much

227
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:44,400
and because the um the drive the craving the wanting the

228
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:50,000
ideas the stories we tell ourselves come so quickly

229
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,920
that they override the flickering moment of peace the flickering moment of their something

230
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:01,200
what got quiet and wasn't there though it's not like these waves that

231
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:08,079
come and they come and because they come so much we don't see the small little gaps small little

232
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:14,160
pieces go on but as we start this meditation practice that at some point

233
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:20,880
we start seeing there are gaps it's it's porous

234
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:26,079
it's not so solid it's not so constant as i thought

235
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:31,440
and it can give a lot of hope a tremendous amount of inspiration comes then

236
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:36,880
oh there's another way and at some point those little gaps the flickers

237
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:43,920
begin showing us that we can be at peace there's little peace here there's a little bit of ease here

238
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:49,280
even though it's only there a flicker it's there i know it's there i feel it

239
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:55,280
now the task is to begin to grow it to recognize it more

240
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:00,720
and the task for doing that with mindfulness meditation is to just do the same thing over again

241
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:07,760
just keep settling keep looking keeping present but know where to look

242
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:13,839
if you're still writing letters to the landlord about the radio you're looking in the wrong place

243
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:20,400
you won't see that the switch to turn it off if you are

244
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:27,119
so so you need to look and learn how to settle and turn the attention here to

245
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:34,799
yourself and i like to think of that as turning around to become intimate with yourself

246
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:40,640
get really close and intimate get to know yourself well feel yourself sense yourself

247
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:46,079
allow yourself to get collected and gather together it's like a wonderful thing to do for

248
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:52,880
yourself to feel yourself gathering together collecting unified

249
01:02:52,880 --> 01:03:00,160
where the mind and body and the heart are all operating together at the same time in the same place

250
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:06,000
and primarily that's the task of the mind to come into the place where the body is

251
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:12,799
because the body is always in the present moment and so the mind is often not

252
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:19,520
and so it's a task of the mind to come back here be here and it's possible to do that

253
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:25,760
that job of mindfulness of gathering yourself together it's possible to do it with lots of love

254
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:30,960
lots of care lots of compassion lots of generosity to

255
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:36,880
oneself that each of us counts each of us is important

256
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:42,000
and so so much so important so valuable that it's worthwhile

257
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,520
being here for yourself gathering together collecting yourselves settling here

258
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:53,920
becoming more embodied more present more more yourself in a sense

259
01:03:53,920 --> 01:04:00,000
in this process that begins quieting the mind and the gaps

260
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:06,720
become longer the porousness gets bigger and we start feeling more and then just

261
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:13,200
flip more than more of more than just flickers of peace of well-being

262
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:21,599
but becomes you know moments the moments become minutes the minutes become hours and they grow

263
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:27,359
so life is life is painful in all kinds of ways

264
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:32,960
turn the attention to understand where that painfulness is here in yourself

265
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:39,599
and you'll notice that craving attachments clinging is a whole slew of words that buddhism

266
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:47,119
uses that move those movements those activities are painful

267
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:54,240
and it's hard to appreciate that they're painful if we're too focused on what we're clinging to what we want or what

268
01:04:54,240 --> 01:05:00,400
we don't want so the art of turning the attention 180 degrees around

269
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:06,400
to feel and sense hear be with yourself and feel like this is where

270
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:11,440
this is where my contribution is to my suffering this is what i'm adding

271
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:17,200
is that craving that thirst that resistance that hatred

272
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:22,559
and we said oh that's what it is and then we feel it

273
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:28,160
and then it's be with it breathe with it sends it embody it a certain way

274
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:34,640
let the mind get quieter with it and you start seeing its porous nature

275
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:41,440
it's flickering nature the gaps you see the rise you see that appears and disappears

276
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:46,960
and one of the great moments in this whole process is that

277
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:52,240
you're sitting around minding your own business and

278
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:57,760
maybe a thought of some intense something you're very attached to arises you can feel the attachment come along

279
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:03,119
with the thought but you didn't have it and now it comes

280
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:08,319
and you see it wait a minute you watched that happen oh wow

281
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:15,599
look at that it wasn't and now it's come into existence and you are wiser than it you've now

282
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:23,039
been watching it without identifying with it and being caught in it you see it arise there it is

283
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:29,200
and then you might also see that it disappeared and then if you're interested in that

284
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:36,000
process interested in extending those gaps discovering more and more about how to

285
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:44,480
bring this craving clinging to an end then you come to the fourth noble truth

286
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:51,680
and the fourth noble truth is the truth of the way to that cessation that we're not just

287
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:56,960
the small little gaps but a really you know qualitatively significant way

288
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:02,319
in which something really drops away and

289
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:08,640
and the classic description of that is the eightfold path

290
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:15,680
which is a a set of eight practices that are meant to encompass our whole life

291
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:22,160
all of our life because if you really want to make this four noble truths

292
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:27,280
really deep really thorough and complete so not just flickers or momentary

293
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:35,839
it should be something that relates to how you live your whole life so how you speak how you act

294
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:42,400
what kind of work you do how you live with your own mind how you pay attention

295
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:47,760
how you be focused what attitudes you have as you go through your life

296
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:53,920
and what understandings you have that through which you see

297
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:59,599
how to behave and how to live in this life so eightfold path is right view right

298
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:05,599
understanding right usually says right intention or right attitude

299
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:12,319
right speech right action right livelihood right effort

300
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:21,920
right mindfulness and right concentration and so to begin be it to be inspired

301
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:28,080
maybe only if you're inspired but inspired by this possibility of bringing the suffering to an end

302
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:33,359
right make these flickers last longer then it helps to create a bigger

303
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:39,758
foundation to gather yourself together to be collected and really show up for yourself and be here

304
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:45,838
and that's what the eightfold path is about to live that faithful path

305
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:53,359
so that freedom is not just a flicker but becomes uh you know

306
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:59,278
a um you know something that's more regular in fact that that's what becomes

307
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:07,839
constant at some point the sense of the freedom from clinging the freedom from this contribution we make

308
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:15,359
so a simple way of asking yourself this question is what am i attached to right now

309
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:20,798
so if you're suffering we ask where am i attached right now that's one of the questions that turns

310
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:26,960
the attention around 180 degrees and then not only what am i attached to

311
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:32,480
but where is the attachment where do i feel in my body and my mind

312
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:37,520
and my heart the contraction the clinging the tightness

313
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:46,159
that we can do something about and if you in the long term learning

314
01:09:46,159 --> 01:09:52,560
to understand your contribution to your suffering and learning to end that contribution

315
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:58,719
is the most reliable thing you can do in the dharma and it'll it'll you'll learn it well and

316
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:04,560
you it's phenomenal how it changes one's life the confidence it gives the ease it

317
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:10,000
gives the peace it gives and the wisdom it gives for how to navigate and

318
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:15,400
and work to where this life and live this life

319
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:21,920
so we're interested in our contribution to our own suffering

320
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:27,920
and i think it's a very mature thing for human being to take that take up that interest and really study that and look

321
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:35,840
at it and not enough people do it too many people i think are looking outside of themselves

322
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:41,280
for how the world contributes to our suffering which is certainly a worthwhile thing to

323
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:48,719
do sometimes but if that's the only thing we do then we gonna live for a long long time

324
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:56,920
with that terrible radio station blurring and it's nice to turn it off

325
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:05,440
so those are my thoughts for this uh beginning and um

326
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:12,719
so there are other dharma talks to be given the four noble truths that are possible and other

327
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:18,000
interpretations other takes on them but that's what was here today

328
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,840
hopefully it was a fit for you to give you something to think about in orientation

329
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:30,480
so thank you very very much and uh i look forward to seeing you more and
