1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,799
welcome welcome nice to see you

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:15,480
all here on a Monday night on a rainy day well it was rainy

3
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,720
earlier so I'd like to start uh tonight's talk by sharing a short little

4
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:30,480
story that ended up having a big impact on me and I didn't quite appreciate

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:37,160
the magnitude of the impact until quite some time later this was uh back when I was

6
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:43,800
working in Corporate America and I remember like just being upset or angry

7
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:51,039
or you know I don't remember the details but I just remember being upset about something that you know somebody had

8
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,719
done and I was telling my friend I was complaining and I was

9
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:03,760
saying yeah well you know this person said this and and because that person

10
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,040
doesn't like this other person then they sent this email and because that email

11
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:16,960
happened then this other person came to my office and you know like all this kind of stuff you know all this like stuff happening cuz said this happened

12
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,280
that happened and you know this and I had a whole story of why it happened

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,960
well this person thinks that they know everything therefore they did blah this other person never pays attention

14
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:38,079
therefore they did blah or you know some I was kind of like attributing like you know all those uh motivations or

15
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:46,680
something like them something like that to these individuals and why I was being you know poor me poor dieta this bad

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:53,399
thing happening and my friend like bless her

17
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,840
heart she said wow that's quite something

18
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,840
Diana so let's see if we can come up with another story that's the same facts

19
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,200
this person said that you got an email and somebody was in your office I'm like

20
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,080
what do you mean another story no this is what happened is the truth it's not a

21
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,319
story this is what actually happened she said okay make three other

22
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:29,080
stories of what happened I'm like I don't understand she said well let's just make it up how do you know that

23
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,959
that person didn't send you an email because uh they had just got really bad

24
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:42,519
news from home and they were upset because somebody in their family is really sick and that's not maybe that's

25
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:48,440
why they sent you that email not because somebody had said this and didn't all that kind of stuff I thought

26
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:55,959
oh I didn't really think about that I was kind of thinking I had it all figured out like why something it

27
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:02,760
happened and just this recognition of like oh yeah there are like we could say facts there are events measurable

28
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:09,159
objective events that happen but then we try to make meaning out of them we weave

29
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:17,760
them together of course we do this is what humans do of course we do and U there's this person Kim Hamlin

30
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,440
Hart she's a life coach I don't know her she has something written on the

31
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,760
internet that I thought was really great and I'd like to share this she talks

32
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,879
about the same thing about uh how we can like make different

33
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:39,239
stories that uh based on you know our

34
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:47,560
experience so again this is Kim Hamlin heart it's not me but she says let's assume the fact

35
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,280
that my mother Kim hlin Hart's mother um was distant and unhappy that was just

36
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,519
her experience of her mother while she was growing up her mother was distant and

37
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:05,360
unhappy and and She lays out okay well what are some different stories that she can make about

38
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:12,280
this and here are how it goes my mother was distant and and

39
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:18,919
unhappy she didn't love me and because she didn't love me I am

40
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:26,440
unlovable this is a story we could make my mother was distant and unhappy she

41
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,360
was broken and incapable of giving much love and I didn't get the type of love I

42
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:38,160
craved but I am worthy of love and I'm worthy of

43
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:45,560
belonging regardless of my mother's inability to love me it's another

44
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,919
story here's the third one my mother was distant and unhappy it was because of

45
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:57,759
something I did I am responsible for her unhappy

46
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:04,120
life I need to do everything I can to make her and those around me

47
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:10,440
happy another story that could be said here's a fourth

48
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:17,840
one my mother was distant and unhappy I didn't get the love I

49
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:25,400
needed she ruined my life I can never be whole or happy

50
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:32,880
because the love I was denied as a child another way we could interpret

51
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:39,000
this my mother was distant and unhappy because I didn't have a model of

52
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,840
how to interact emotionally I can't get in touch with my emotions and express them in a healthy

53
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,960
way and I can't

54
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:58,199
change here's another story my mother was distant and

55
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:05,520
unhappy because because I didn't have a model of how to interact emotionally I struggle with my own

56
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,560
emotions however I can learn and grow and figure out a way to get in touch

57
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:19,680
with my emotions and express them in a healthy way let's see how many of these are

58
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,759
there's one two three four five six wait did I last count here six or seven six

59
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:34,240
six different ways to interpret this like one thing my was distant and unhappy I just love this right because

60
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:41,520
we probably all know people maybe we are one of them that like have kind of like adopted a story around their what

61
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:48,599
happened to them when they were younger and this recognition of like oh yeah the same facts quote

62
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:53,198
unquote we could make a whole bunch of different

63
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,919
stories and there's something terrifying about this and there's something

64
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:07,160
beautiful about this I would say and so I'd like to talk

65
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:15,240
about this idea of you know stories and making stories and this one of like this list

66
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:21,240
of however many stories I said we don't want to say that one is right and one is wrong that's not at all what we're

67
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:28,919
talking about here that's like irrelevant whether right or wrong they're just something that we might a

68
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:35,039
away we might interpret to make meaning of our experience and some of them are more

69
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:41,000
helpful than for us to have a big full Rich beautiful life and some of them are

70
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,360
less helpful in that helpful unhelpful there we're not talking about right or

71
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:52,879
wrong I don't want to go that direction but I think there's a way in

72
00:07:52,879 --> 00:08:02,560
which whatever story that we adopt whichever story that we believe becomes the truth for

73
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,639
us it's a way in which we view the world in which we interpret our other

74
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:14,919
experiences the way that we um expect some cap our own capabilities what we

75
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:23,639
are capable of what we're not capable of what we can do what we can't do whether the world is safe it's unsafe or these

76
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:29,319
types of things and so we might ask a little bit

77
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:35,240
well what what is this uh stories and there's a way in humans we

78
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:42,479
are there's a way in which we're kind of like driven to make sense to make meaning of our emotions and our

79
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:49,920
experiences this is what humans do and I remember being on a long retreat many

80
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:56,320
months and uh just the mind getting just really quiet and just starting to see

81
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,560
like oh yep there'd be a thought and then like maybe like a physical

82
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,920
sensation maybe like like another like physical sensation and then I could just

83
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:12,839
kind of like watch how oh yeah I was tying all these things together to make

84
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:20,600
it mean something but I also noticed that that making the meaning is

85
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:27,120
extra actually it doesn't have to happen we feel this uh we feel pulled to do it

86
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,480
and I'll talk a little bit about why but it's actually we don't have to do it we

87
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:39,200
don't have to uh make a meaning and then believe it and hold on to it and say this is

88
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,240
true instead we can say well this is kind of what makes sense to me right now

89
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,160
this is my provisional understanding this is my hypothesis this is what makes

90
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,040
sense to me at this moment as opposed to saying this is the truth this is how it

91
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:03,399
is and then not even thinking about it just assuming that that's the truth and then you know continuing on just with

92
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:08,959
that assumption that might not be so helpful for

93
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:15,680
us so there's a way in which we want to make meaning and these meanings are

94
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,839
expressed as our beliefs our perspectives our attitudes our biases

95
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:27,959
our mindsets our views all these things kind of get influenced by these stories

96
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:34,440
the ways that we're we knit together experiences to make a narrative and we

97
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:42,120
might say that these stories that get created and that turn into beliefs and perspectives and Views are a way in

98
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:50,680
which we are how we like evaluate or judge experiences things

99
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,880
people the way that we justify our behavior all of these are from the

100
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:01,320
stories that we have so there's this way that uh the

101
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,760
stories kind of have implicit like this is good and that's bad this is better

102
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:13,959
that's worse and so much of our life might be constricted by this idea of this is good

103
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:22,279
and that's bad I can do this I can't do that I'm good I'm bad and not recognize that those are

104
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:28,079
based on experiences that we had and I'm

105
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:35,040
using this word story that we created this meaning that we created out of it and I would say that much of what we

106
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:41,680
take as you know culture and civilization is about these stories because this is what humans do it's not

107
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,320
a like I said it's not a problem so there's a way in which you

108
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:54,920
know our personal stories but we also have societal cultural stories this a big part of what we can

109
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:00,839
say maybe what civilization or culture is is part of this collection of

110
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:06,720
stories and we might even say that like these

111
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,440
days in these uh modern contemporary times there's a way in which we are

112
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:20,120
often kind of like stuck in our stories the way is we as a maybe even as

113
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:26,639
a culture where we could say that we are as committed to our stories as ever maybe even more like we are holding on

114
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:34,040
to them so tightly refusing to even uh entertain the idea

115
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,079
that in fact they might be stories but in some ways we're so involved with uh

116
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:47,519
our stories and we can see this showing up in so many different ways the ways in which social

117
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,720
media is uh a some people what they post right with there's platforms

118
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,639
specifically designed for this so you can have a curated story that people

119
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:07,680
think think about you and there's a way in which you have this story about yourself that you're going to show the world in order to be a good person or

120
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:14,160
valuable person lovable person I need to curate what I'm going to show and therefore this is what's uh going to be

121
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:21,199
there and I'm going to put on social media or maybe there's this way in this conspiracy theories these days right

122
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:26,920
that's a way in which people make stories and try to make sense of

123
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:32,680
events in a way that makes I don't it makes them feel better in some kind of

124
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:38,800
way and then these conspiracy theories like even though there are different uh

125
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,880
conflicting information somehow these conspiracy theories really can take a

126
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:49,800
hold and people kind of like you know issue things uh that doesn't support

127
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:55,120
them identity politics is a part of this

128
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:02,839
too we versus them US versus them me versus you I'm like this and you're

129
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:08,360
not like this you're like that I'm like that you're like this

130
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:16,040
whatever it is it's part of this way in which we as a community as a culture these days we're really tied um holding

131
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:21,839
on tightly to our stories and maybe I don't know maybe it's partly because we

132
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:28,759
get are getting exposed to so many different stories maybe there than earlier than we did I'm sorry did

133
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:34,000
differently than we did like if we think about 100 years ago I mean just the

134
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,800
internet didn't exist so we weren't as exposed to so many different stories and we probably were just um surrounded More

135
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:47,959
Often by people that were similar to us to the whole idea of story maybe

136
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:53,199
didn't even make sense but there's this way in

137
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:59,880
which the story promises like truth and certainty

138
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:07,440
which kind of like promises like some security like oh yeah okay this is true I can rest here knowing this I don't

139
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:15,199
have to have any doubt I don't have to wonder about things I can rest here I can feel secure I can feel safe here in

140
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:21,839
this story and so we want like big stories that like explain

141
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,600
everything it's kind of frightening to think like this doesn't make

142
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:34,880
sense wait I I thought things were this way and turns out they're another

143
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,480
way again I can speak from my own experience many of you know I'm trained as a scientist I worked as a scientist

144
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:48,399
for quite some time spent my days in a research laboratory wearing a white coat gloves test tubes the whole

145
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:54,600
thing and then you know I had like some glimpses of something that that uh some

146
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:01,120
and some meditative experiences I'm like oh that doesn't fit in my

147
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:08,279
worldview and it was a little bit uncomfortable not a little it was very uncomfortable like wait hm how how do

148
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:13,440
how do I hold this how does this make sense and you know here I am these years

149
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,839
later I'm no longer working as a scientist but here as a Dharma teacher

150
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:24,639
but it's uncomfortable so we want stories that promises truth and

151
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:32,639
uncertainty but you know these the promises never deliver they never deliver because this

152
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:39,639
truth and the certainty that we're looking for doesn't isn't showing up in the way that we would like

153
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:47,480
it we want things to be like constant and reliable and always there

154
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,519
and things change we all know this there a part of

155
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:02,240
us always know this but there's nothing that's like always reliable somehow we want like to know

156
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:09,438
the master story that's the one true story that's going to explain all the other

157
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:19,120
stories and we might even say that essential to this master

158
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:25,280
story is the denial that it's a story that's like integral of this

159
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,400
master story like no no no this is the truth it's not a story

160
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:38,120
and then so what is the story that Buddhists have about

161
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:46,440
stories of course Buddhists aren't immune from the either it's bunch of humans so the stories that Buddhists

162
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,919
have about stories is that you shouldn't be deluded by stories that's the story

163
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:57,400
that Buddhism has that is don't

164
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:04,240
uh don't believe everything that you think and in fact there's a way in which

165
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,799
we can see through the beliefs we can see through the subtle

166
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:16,679
narratives and the obvious narratives and Buddhism talks about and

167
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:21,720
especially in this tradition talks about right some of you

168
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:29,360
may have heard this really story that gets uh told a lot which I actually really like where the bu says well the

169
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:36,559
Dharma that is like the teachings is like a raft it can take you from if you're here

170
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:44,039
on this shore of this water where it feels uh scary and

171
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:52,080
uncertain and you can have the sense that over there on the other side of this raging River or whatever body of

172
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:59,760
water might be is will be some safety and you have this sense like okay if I just get over there it'll be safe

173
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:06,799
safe and the Buddha is saying there is some safety it's not the way that we

174
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:12,039
think it is but the Dharma is a raft that we can carry it or sorry it carries

175
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:17,559
us the other side but when we get

176
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:24,120
there do we think like wow this raft was really helpful okay I think I'm going to take

177
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:30,640
this with me wherever I go and we put it on our shoulder and just carry this raft around wherever we go on the land you

178
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,600
know carrying the raft right no that would be silly so this recognition that even the

179
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:44,400
Dharma takes us to the other side but even something like that we can't really we can't hold on to it's not the their

180
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:51,880
always in a stable constant way that we may sometimes

181
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:59,200
wish and there's a way in which recognizing as I said earlier that

182
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,919
things are stories that we have narratives or views there's a way in which this can be really frightening but

183
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:12,039
it also can be really liberating there's a way in which it can

184
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:19,280
help bring us some freedom because this there's a way in

185
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:26,640
which we have this um some of the stories that we use are

186
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:33,559
like who I am as a person I'm the one that's like this I'm

187
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:37,000
the one that's not like

188
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,000
that I said that I was trained as a scientist and I worked as a scientist that's a little bit different than

189
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,200
saying I am a Scientist so this sometime I used to definitely think I was a scientist

190
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:57,120
through and through but then to recognize no I was trained and I lived that life and you

191
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:04,200
know but that's different than just taking it on board or that I'm a Dorma

192
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,679
teacher sometimes I sit here on Monday nights give Dharma

193
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,279
talks other times I'm not a Dharma teacher I'm a grocery

194
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:22,919
Shopper dishwasher vacuumer these types of

195
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:30,559
things so we all have um identities that shift and change some of them move shift

196
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:36,158
uh really slowly over time maybe some of them shift really

197
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:44,240
quickly but there's a way that um David ly who is a zen teacher he

198
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:51,799
writes one meaning of freedom is the opportunity to act out the story I

199
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:57,360
identify with one meaning of freedom is the

200
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,760
opportunity to act out the story I identify with I appreciate this very

201
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:09,080
much I identify this way and this is how I want to show up in the world right there's not everywhere in

202
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:16,240
the world where you can do that but that's a one type of freedom to be able to do

203
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,679
that another type of freedom is the ability to change

204
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:28,760
stories and my role within them so this ability to move from like a

205
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:36,080
scripted character to a way in which kind of like the co-author of my life and who are the

206
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:43,240
other authors kind of like society and our communities so another way of freedom is

207
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:50,880
to ability to change the stories and then here's a third type of

208
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:57,120
Freedom these are all freedoms a third type of Freedom that this is what the

209
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:03,799
Buddhists are pointing to that results from understanding how

210
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:10,600
stories construct and constrict my possibilities the

211
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:17,480
possibilities that I think for myself they construct and

212
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:23,640
constrict sometimes we might think well I'm a person like this therefore I can't do that I'm trained as a scientist

213
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:32,360
therefore I'll never be a great artist who knows I haven't tried it

214
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:41,960
yet there's a way in which the you know the stories we make them as I was talking to earlier based on facts things

215
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:47,120
that actually happen but sometimes they are constricting Us in ways that we

216
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:54,159
don't even recognize and so there's real freedom to recognize oh yeah there's a story that's

217
00:23:54,159 --> 00:24:01,440
getting created and maybe it's a story that helps support me but maybe there's also

218
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,559
a way in which it constricts me so we just hold them lightly we just told them

219
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:14,440
lightly instead of insisting that they are the truth because the truth is very often the stories don't really help us

220
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,760
in the way that we want them to I mean they might help us to keep our like life

221
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,960
on Keel or or in an even Keel or something like

222
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:32,399
as we're making sense of our experiences but they seldom offer like new insights

223
00:24:32,399 --> 00:24:38,360
about how to understand the world or stories seldom offer greater

224
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:45,679
Clarity instead it's just you know a story that we made up about something sometimes they do but

225
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:53,200
sometimes they don't offer much well-being there's just a way that they

226
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:59,240
there's a way it's kind of like diminish us and there's a way in which stories

227
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,880
they really Bubble Up or they really kind of make themselves known or get created or constructed in a way when

228
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:11,159
we're feeling agitated when we're feeling unwell or

229
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:17,080
bothered or disturbed stories show up when we act

230
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:26,640
out of habit well I need to do this because I I will always be like this cuz my mother was unhappy and didn't love me

231
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:33,799
or something like this but here's something that when we get lost in the content of our stories we

232
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:39,320
stop being present for what's actually happening here stop being present for

233
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:45,480
the experiences that we're having right now and there might be a way in which

234
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:53,360
we're thinking like okay well I'm waiting for some experience to be worthwhile to pay attention

235
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:02,360
to why not this moment why not pay attention at this

236
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:08,760
moment it turns out real freedom is here if we're always waiting for the perfect conditions or as soon as that other

237
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:18,000
thing happens just right now it's good

238
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,799
enough there can be some real ease and freedom that arises if we are just paying attention this moment and this

239
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:29,600
moment and this moment

240
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:35,880
so what are some ways in which we can see these stories that I'm pointing

241
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:42,919
to there's a few ways one if you're doing a meditation

242
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:50,960
practice do mindfulness of breathing this is a common practice A lot of people do I do this I often teach

243
00:26:51,880 --> 00:27:00,520
it there's a way in which we often can um have this feeling like I'm breathing

244
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:07,039
and it feels like this like this is just there's a sense of like I'm

245
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:12,799
breathing as opposed to the sense of breathing is

246
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:20,640
happening there's a way and sometimes we say like it's raining but we don't really say what is raining we just say

247
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,799
it's raining that's a kind like the way we're describing the weather

248
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:31,320
pattern so is there a way instead of putting a self at the

249
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:39,360
center can we say it's uh breathing is happening instead of saying I'm

250
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:45,760
breathing this is a subtle difference that I'm playing with language here but it can be really

251
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:54,320
powerful and there's this story that um was trying to remember this uh Jack

252
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:01,720
petrer that he is quoting uh some somebody else when he's talking about this idea of how the stories that we

253
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:08,360
make so often have ourselves at the center and the selves at the center

254
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:16,278
turns out not to be as it tends to be one of the ways in which we constrict

255
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:24,360
ourselves so as I said dck Pat traner um points to something that's a

256
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:32,799
naturalist Barry Lopez and he was on this Journey with some indigenous people up in the north and he's describing how

257
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:39,120
he uh would work with a an event versus the indigenous

258
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:46,000
people if my companions and I for example were hiking and encountered a grizzly bear feeding on a caribou

259
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,039
carcass I would tend have focused almost entirely on the

260
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:57,559
bear my companions would focus on the part of the world of which at that

261
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:04,159
moment the bear was only a fragment my Approach was mostly to take

262
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:11,960
notes of objects in the scene the bear the Caribou the tundra a series of dots that

263
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:17,159
I would try to make sense of by connecting them all with a single rigid

264
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:22,200
line my friends in contrast had situated

265
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:28,799
themselves within a dynamic event there approach was to let it

266
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:36,840
continue to unfold to notice everything and to let whatever significance was there to

267
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:44,080
emerge on its own so you can see how the person who's

268
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:50,039
speaking here Barry Lopez he's like here observing the bear the carcass the

269
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:55,840
tundra like he's located himself in one location everything else is out there

270
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,919
whereas the indigenous people are we're just this this whole thing is

271
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:07,600
unfolding themselves were part of the experience was unfolding and they were allowing what

272
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:13,559
was significant to emerge like this is this is what's happening right

273
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:19,399
now as opposed to saying making a story and like okay that bear killed this

274
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:25,519
caribou and that happened or that happen and kind of like removing themselves but there's a way in which removing

275
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:33,080
themselves is also the way in which they make themselves the center because everything is like from a distance to

276
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:40,480
the self that be instead of this experience that Caribou instead of

277
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:47,919
whatever is happening here in the future if anybody's listening to me rather than uh watching

278
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:53,159
me with my hands what I'm saying this I'm trying to like

279
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:59,279
gesture I don't know like how would I describe this like a including my

280
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:04,480
physical body as well as all the space around me is kind of like this as

281
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:10,080
opposed to there's only this physical body and everything else out there is

282
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:17,679
separate so one way we can notice how we tend to do this is even with our meditation

283
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:26,159
practice just to play around with language and just to say like breathing is happening and to just notice the

284
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:33,679
experience instead of having this real sense of I'm breathing I better meditate how how I've

285
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,880
uh how am I doing I've been doing this for 10 breaths I used yesterday I only did it for eight breaths so I'm doing

286
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,960
better you know something like that just to be with the

287
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:50,080
experience and maybe there's a way in which um because sometimes we might say

288
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:57,840
and I teach this way sometimes because it can be helpful but it also can trip us up like sometimes to have the sense of

289
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,880
like okay I am going to place my attention on the breath but that again

290
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:10,320
is kind of like making a self at the center so that's one way we can notice

291
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:17,080
the stories is just uh notice a subtle ways in which we can we make ourselves a

292
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:22,679
center and often how we're doing that is making things be objects where here's

293
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:30,159
this the self is the subject and others are the object another way a very different

294
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:37,720
way is there's a way in which stories have this uh linear temporal continuity

295
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:43,240
that is you know a led to B led to C led to d That's a way in which kind of like

296
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:48,720
stories unfold this is part of what makes them delightful and fun and gives

297
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:55,638
us maybe a little sense of security but if you look at your

298
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:02,120
experience experience I'm not talking about thinking about it I'm talking about

299
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:08,960
experiencing you'll notice that let's say let's come back to like this idea of

300
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:15,000
breathing notice a breath notice another

301
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,960
breath oh yeah I have to remember to take the clothes out of the washing machine so that's little thing about the

302
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,799
future and then uh oh yeah a breath another breath not like that time I left

303
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:35,600
them in and got all M Dey and that was horrible and the little flash to the past and then you know breath the he

304
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,760
breath so if we are TW if you can get a little bit settled and pay attention

305
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:48,480
you'll notice that our experience actually is filled with the past the future the present I'm talking about

306
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,519
experiences right I mean logically if you were to talk about of course you know we would say this one person is

307
00:33:54,519 --> 00:34:00,000
moving through time in a linear way but but our experience isn't really that

308
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,399
way and if you really pay

309
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:10,919
attention you start to notice all these discontinuities and that kind of like

310
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:18,638
starts to poke holes in this idea of a continuous story and it can be fun and interesting

311
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:24,638
to even just notice like oh okay that was a past wow that was in the future all that

312
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:29,878
planning I did wow I was doing that for 20 minutes planning that thing and or something

313
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:35,158
like that and then but now I'm back here in the present so just to notice kind like the

314
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:40,839
shifts in between past present and future that

315
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:45,079
happens in these minds of

316
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:53,878
ours and there's a way in which looking at uh even this whole notion what I'm

317
00:34:53,879 --> 00:35:02,040
talking about story making even to consider it or think about it or

318
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:08,400
practice with it is really different than any other practice that we might do

319
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,560
I shouldn't say any other practice but often with meditation practice we have this idea okay we're going

320
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,960
to focus on settle on an object it's

321
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:28,160
often how we talk about it the breath a sound bodily sensation there's

322
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:35,119
a way in which we like focus on this but learning to engage with and notice with

323
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:40,440
the stories that we are inhabiting is not so easy it's not the

324
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:46,880
same kind of way it's not a way in which we can focus to it instead because stories are complex and

325
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:55,560
multi-dimensional there's a way in which um encourages us to just engage with our

326
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:01,359
life and and to notice kind of like these little

327
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:08,319
quiet thoughts that are happening I notice some of these

328
00:36:08,319 --> 00:36:13,800
repetitious um ways in which we are

329
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:19,599
constructing keep on using this word stories views and

330
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,800
beliefs so it requires more of like an openness and rather than trying to

331
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,040
search and find them it often can just an openness and recognizing oh yeah

332
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:35,960
there is this recurring way in which I consider myself or consider

333
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:43,560
others or which I'm trying to make sense out of my life what happened

334
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:51,079
earlier it's not easy to do this it's not something that happens

335
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:58,000
fast it's not something that oh okay that was interesting I'm going to try it and I expect I'll get it to tomorrow

336
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,720
tomorrow morning or you know just if next morning I next time I

337
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:13,680
sit but this is where real freedom is to notice and to see

338
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,760
through the stories that we have the beliefs that we have the

339
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:25,599
stories about ourselves about the world about others how things should be how they

340
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:31,000
are again I'm not saying throw them out I'm saying hold them

341
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:37,920
lightly be curious about them are you

342
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,400
sure how sure are you about all these stories that we have

343
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,680
just here's just an invitation to plant a little seed of

344
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:57,520
doubt about our stories and it's quite something because in some ways we might say Buddhist practice is

345
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:05,680
need to have enough like faith we might use this word faith or confidence to do the practice listen to dorat talks

346
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:11,480
meditate whatever it might be and we need to have enough

347
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:16,599
doubt that we're not like holding on to everything like yes finally I found the

348
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:24,720
truth I'm going to be happy from now on I got it I know when I first got introduced to

349
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,359
the the poly Canon it's kind of like the Buddhist literature early Buddhist

350
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:36,160
literature scriptures I was so convinced like okay if I could just read enough and here I

351
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,240
will find all the answers I even like learned paully I started translating I'm

352
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:48,000
like okay I'm sure the answers are in here somewhere the answers weren't there the

353
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,599
way that I thought they would be they were there because I don't know

354
00:38:53,599 --> 00:39:02,039
there was something that just made me happy to be looking at them what was in there and there was a way in

355
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:08,839
which when I started to see that things weren't neat and tidy I realized oh yeah

356
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:15,319
this idea of neat and tidy that's another story I have that things need to be neat and tidy I need to understand

357
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:20,160
them they need to be completely

358
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:28,079
comprehensible there's a way that unsticking from our stories

359
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:36,480
is a path to Greater ease greater well-being greater peace just unsticking from them not

360
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:43,040
completely abandoning them but being open to new stories different

361
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:49,560
stories and with that I'll end and I'll open it up to see if there's some

362
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,800
questions or

363
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,400
comments

364
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:08,240
hi um it's kind of a comment I've thought a lot about the stories I tell

365
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:16,480
myself and for some reason when I think about the I I have some happy what I

366
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:23,480
consider important stories that I tell myself and when I see those as just

367
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:32,280
stories it it really it feels very light and I I still like those stories

368
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:37,520
and and I don't know it's sort of a Gateway

369
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:43,520
for me to see my other stories which you know I have some stories I really cling

370
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:49,440
to more negative stories um so anyway that's all yeah

371
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,760
thank you thank you for sharing them and also right just because we're making stories doesn't mean that the emotions

372
00:40:54,760 --> 00:41:01,200
aren't real or the events aren't aren't real or those types of things so the happiness that we experience right

373
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,480
that's real those are real experiences I just um I neglected to say

374
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,599
that earlier and then when you were saying I thought that uh you were going to say when you think that there's

375
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:17,720
stories it makes you sad but you saying that so you're touching into maybe feeling like the

376
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:24,760
lightness less less clingy yeah less clinging thank you it's fantastic thank

377
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:30,319
youse anybody else have a comment or

378
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:40,800
question I think we can move the microphone down yet there we go thank you excuse me how can

379
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,359
we in a word how can we stop telling ourselves stories

380
00:41:46,359 --> 00:41:53,240
and start to see things as they really are I don't think we can stop telling

381
00:41:53,240 --> 00:42:01,720
ourselves stories this is what humans do we try try to make meaning of our experience think what we can do is hold

382
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:07,240
them lightly and so part of that is um maybe

383
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:14,160
I'm trying to remember there was this phrase that um somebody told me a long time ago that I used to use that was really helpful something like uh

384
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:21,440
something along the lines of am I sure or do is that right is that true like at

385
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:27,559
the end of each statement that we see just like and just asking that question

386
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:33,839
we might not know the answer but asking that question kind of like opens it up like okay yeah it seems like this right

387
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:40,640
now but I'm not 100% sure so that's one way thank

388
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:50,400
you maybe a completely awakened person doesn't make stories as soon as I'm completely

389
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:57,720
awakened I'll let you guys know

390
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,359
