1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:06,399
good evening my name is Maria strotman and

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:13,320
I'm here for Diana tonight and I'll be here next Monday night

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:21,119
also so I'm happy to be here seems strange to hear my voice that

4
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:30,678
bill caught me by surprise so um tonight

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,320
uh I'm going to start in the middle of the story so this is what occurred to me this afternoon as I was thinking about

6
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,719
what I was going to talk about is that all Dharma talks kind of start in the middle of the

7
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:48,760
story because practice practice is hard it's hard to

8
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:54,680
pull the pieces apart you know everything is related to everything else and so as soon as I say well I want to

9
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,480
talk about this piece well yeah but then I have to talk about that piece and if I talk about that piece well you're not

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,080
going to know what I mean unless I talk about that piece and pretty soon it becomes totally

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,320
Tangled and really what I want to say is look here look here look at this

12
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,280
thing and pretty soon I'm sitting there full of doubt and

13
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,520
if I'm not full of doubt I'm full of arrogance what's going on here and

14
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:32,520
that's that's what practice is like we're always in the middle middle of the story we don't get to start at

15
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,600
the beginning and plan it and then you know the control all the outcomes and

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,960
all of the conditions life is full of

17
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:50,640
conditions the vast majority of which we have no input to much less control

18
00:01:51,920 --> 00:02:00,799
over the temperature in the room did you get sleep last night did you have time for dinner

19
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,039
did someone in your family just die we're not even talking about the

20
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:12,800
topic yet there are so many conditions so many conditions that

21
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,760
affect what's happening in this room but what's really happening in this

22
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:26,000
room is life we are living we are practicing we are meeting the moment or

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,840
not meeting the moment we're missing our lives

24
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:40,040
so tonight what I'd like to do is try to weave a little pattern just a tiny

25
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:47,280
pattern of everything and I already know I can't talk about everything we only have a few

26
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:55,360
minutes here for this everything will not fit in a few minutes but everything is in those few minutes

27
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:01,360
everything we don't get to cut out anything

28
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:12,159
life is happening life is happening and that's the good news so so my talk is

29
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,720
about intention mindfulness and the journey sounds simple right intention

30
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:25,200
mindfulness in the journey or we could call it intention immediacy and

31
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,400
persistence or we could say suffering impermanence and no

32
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:39,480
self because suffering gives rise to intention and impermanence is what

33
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:47,120
immediacy is all about why we care about it at all and no self gives rise to the

34
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,360
need for persistence arises out of

35
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:02,040
impermanence but we're not going to talk about those three we're going to talk about intention mind fness and the

36
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,959
journey so if we're going on a journey we have to have some idea of where we're

37
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:14,560
going or we're not going to get there I mean you can wander

38
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:23,320
aimlessly but that's what you're doing wandering aimlessly and even that is an intention aimlessness is an

39
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:29,759
intention so you have to have an idea of what you intend what's my intention I

40
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:38,199
want to do X it's the motivation for what you're going to do it's the inspiration the

41
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:45,880
aspiration I want to do I want to go I want to be I want

42
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:53,478
that it's a leaning towards something so we have to have some kind of

43
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:00,400
intention and once we begin we need that intention before we begin

44
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,400
maybe not chronologically but somewhere there is something that gets us on the

45
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:13,320
journey we take a step because we're going

46
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:20,880
somewhere that intention is extremely important because it's the source of motivation it's also the things that

47
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,440
provides the persistence the one that allows us to take the Second

48
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:35,440
Step it's also the thing that provides the faith that allows us to go it's not only

49
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,919
I'm going to do this I know what I'm going to do so I'm going to go do this but it also allows us to take that leap

50
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:47,160
of faith that says Yep this is the direction I'm going to go this is the

51
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:55,240
method I'm going to take this is the this is the way I'm going to do this that intention is extremely

52
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:03,720
important sometimes we set out and we're not really clear about that intention we have a very vague notion of the

53
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:15,440
intention but as we go along our experience bolsters that intention and

54
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,360
the intention strengthens through that experience and the faith becomes

55
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,880
stronger and our ability to P persist become stronger and more uh confident we

56
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,919
become more conf confident and doubt is less likely to

57
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:41,000
undermine us but it all comes in the first place

58
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,080
from that intention when I began practicing I had

59
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:53,919
a really Grand intention and it was to develop loving kindness in my

60
00:06:53,919 --> 00:07:00,280
life and I so it was I was going to be my my primary intention was to be

61
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,520
openhearted that that's good it's a good

62
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:11,199
intention and over time I decided I finally heard myself

63
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,599
say it a number of times and and I realized that I could just sort of stop

64
00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:22,360
with be open and eventually I got to the place

65
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:30,039
where I could just be because as I examined that intention over and over again I realized ized that

66
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:35,759
the intention was really about the absence of protecting myself the need

67
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,639
for all of those things I had in front of myself to protect myself from harm

68
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:47,120
from being hurt and that that initial intention was

69
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:54,039
really masking what I really wanted which was to feel safe and

70
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:59,919
loved and safe in going out and connecting with other people

71
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:08,199
and it was only through the years of practice I was able to see that and to eventually feel more safe

72
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:15,199
and to develop a willingness to be vulnerable and to develop develop

73
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,759
vulnerability and to just show up which it turns out is what the

74
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:27,840
intention was all along so it isn't that you have to know an intention and stick with it forever it's something that

75
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,039
develops along with you that changes with you but you have to be aware of it

76
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:39,240
it's incredibly important it really guides you across the

77
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:47,959
way and it informs your practice whatever the practice is it changes with

78
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:52,880
you it's a living thing this this

79
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:03,279
intention it is the thing that provides the energy to your

80
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,360
practice you you you notice that I have this intention I'm getting started I'm

81
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:18,079
starting to see this sort of this sort of makes a difference to me and then you say oh okay yeah and you

82
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:23,839
get kind of excited you know so when I was when I was doing this

83
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,920
talk I at one point decided I wanted to look up something and the next thing you

84
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:35,760
knew I had you know four or five Books open and my husband came in and wanted to ask about something truly mundane and

85
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:43,640
I said oh no but look you know I've got this and I'm looking at that and I'm looking he said look at you you're so

86
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:50,279
excited I I it's been a long time since I had multiple Books open on my desk researching this and researching that

87
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:57,040
and looking at the other and I was excited and I was excited because I was

88
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,920
realizing that the last time I had this Books open I was quite

89
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:11,959
different and there was a different person looking at those books and reading those lines and examining those pieces of of

90
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:18,079
information and that was exciting to me it was

91
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:24,160
motivating it was interesting you know sometimes we get

92
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:31,079
kind of bogged down in how hard we're working on something and we forget that why we're

93
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:38,519
doing it in the first place why am I doing this what's it

94
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:45,000
about and that there's real delight and joy in changing your

95
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,920
mind and doing something different and maybe modifying the

96
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,920
plan adapting

97
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,240
and it turns out that the way that we practice you

98
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:18,279
know there there are the there you know Buddhism has all kinds of lists so one of the lists that ended up being one of

99
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:23,360
those things that came into my grab bag was the five powers you know the five

100
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,600
faculties the the things that help you get through practice and the first three

101
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,639
are Faith energy or effort and mindfulness which see how nicely they

102
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:41,320
fit in with the topic right so the first three the faith that comes from from

103
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:48,480
experiencing what's coming out of your intention the energy that's generated from that and

104
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,920
mindfulness which is the key to all of it

105
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,480
mindfulness mindfulness mindfulness is the thing

106
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:06,200
that tells you where you are you know we we often think about mindfulness as I

107
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:13,560
have an object and I know the object right I'm following my breath I'm following sound I'm following whatever

108
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:20,639
is the object of your mindfulness or I have expansive mindfulness where I'm

109
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:28,199
mindfulness of whatever arises but the mindfulness I'm talking about is the mindfulness that says

110
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:34,480
What's Happening Here what's happening here what's going on

111
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,240
right now mindfulness that says here I am right now in this

112
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:48,199
moment I am registering my awareness with whatever it

113
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:55,480
is you know the the important thing about mindfulness is you have the object and you know the object and you know you

114
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:04,480
know it that's the awareness part it's the awareness the being cognizant and

115
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,600
registering I know I'm following this I know I'm here I know that I'm breathing

116
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,480
I know that I'm sitting I know that I'm s that I'm hearing I know that I'm

117
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,600
smelling I know that I'm walking it's that knowing part it's the

118
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,120
awareness that mindfulness that constantly brings us back to here and we

119
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:34,320
can say what do I I know now what am I aware of now and that

120
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:40,639
registering what do I know that's the key that tells you where you are what's

121
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,800
going on here what's going on

122
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:51,759
now it doesn't have to be a grand thing it can be a trivial

123
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:59,680
thing a trivial thing so let me pause for just a second here

124
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:10,279
okay so we want to be able to

125
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:16,560
notice what's happening right so when we're sitting in meditation we can

126
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,839
notice I'm following my breath I'm following my breath the mind wanders off

127
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:30,639
we notice the Mind comes back like oh the mind has been gone that's the very moment when we're really aware we're

128
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:36,600
here great Rejoice we're here

129
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,959
yes it doesn't have to only be then it can be anytime so I'm going to tell you

130
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:49,320
about something uh that's truly trivial that happened to me today and use it as

131
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:57,040
an example for how this might work so uh I met somebody this

132
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:03,800
morning and this person said uh would you like a bottle of water and I said no

133
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:10,360
I've got my coffee here in my in my thermos and I haven't had any time yet for even a swallow of coffee I can

134
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,839
hardly wait and this person immediately began telling me how terrible coffee was

135
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:22,399
and they had never drunk coffee and it stained her teeth and it really tastes bad and how bad coffee was and she was

136
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:29,040
so glad that that they never had coffee and on and on and on about a coffee so

137
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:35,360
my reaction to this was immediately I I reacted you know and

138
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:42,440
I I I felt the reaction I could feel the the pulling back I could feel the

139
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:49,959
resistance I could feel a kind of tension and twisting I felt the wanting

140
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:56,240
to defend myself and then I stopped I mean there

141
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:03,519
were a lot of things happening this is somebody that it's easy easy for this person to trigger me so I'm always

142
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:09,000
prepared you know so there's certain topics that I'm really ready and so

143
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,519
there's no way this person's going to trigger me I was not prepared to be triggered by the coffee so here I was

144
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:22,399
and so I I see I feel it all happening and so I just stopped and in that moment

145
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:29,440
I said I don't have to be the person who reacts to the coffee I don't have to be

146
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:36,600
whatever is happening here whether it's I have to be right I'm reacting to feeling diminished I'm reacting to I

147
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,639
thought this was um a friendly gesture we're going to get together and talk

148
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:50,120
about how great it is to have that first swallow of coffee uh you know whatever the source of my reaction is is not

149
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:57,240
important I don't have to be the person who reacts it's stopping it's

150
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,839
noticing caught

151
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:10,280
stop the reason is not important here later you can analyze it but in the

152
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:16,640
moment just stop I don't have to be the person who reacts to

153
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:24,839
this the chattering is still going on I'm still hearing about how bad coffee

154
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:31,240
is but I've stopped and in at

155
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:38,320
stopping I am no longer Enchanted by my

156
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:46,360
role I have become dispassionate about it who cares who

157
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:51,520
cares I'm going to drink the coffee she's not going to drink the coffee it doesn't really

158
00:17:51,520 --> 00:18:00,200
matter who cares suffering ceases

159
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:07,640
there is no argument here there is nothing now in that

160
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:13,880
moment I can go back and try to figure it out which is retelling the story and

161
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:21,120
immediately it can come up again or I can say I wonder she's still talking I

162
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:27,840
wonder what she's thinking is she thinking why is she telling me about the coffee I offered her water she could

163
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:34,039
have accepted the you who knows what she's thinking so now I can expand my

164
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:40,039
awareness to wondering about something outside of me I don't have to make it

165
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:45,520
about me it can be another story that comes

166
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:52,320
up now I'm telling my a story about her but now it's she's no longer the bad guy

167
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:58,039
now I'm wondering there are an infinite number

168
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:04,000
of things that can happen about what which one can be

169
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,559
mindful about over which one can introduce suffering or the end of

170
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,720
suffering over a thermos of coffee and a bottle of

171
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:22,799
water doesn't have to be a big thing but what happens is you become used to

172
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:29,440
noticing tension letting go

173
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,919
Freedom release in that moment relief in that moment even if it comes right back

174
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:42,600
you can stop again and you can stop again and you can stop

175
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:52,080
again the Buddhist said right intention right intention is renunciation or not

176
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:59,159
clinging harmlessness uh he had three things

177
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:04,280
right wise intention is

178
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:09,720
harmlessness not clinging

179
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:13,440
and his third

180
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,840
thing those are the two I'm thinking about right now it'll come to me in a moment my mind

181
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:29,240
is not clear and I refuse to feel bad about it

182
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,679
it'll come when I don't need it and I have clearly walked away from

183
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:40,880
my talk here on the paper

184
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:54,240
so yeah it's okay it'll come but the two that that I can address

185
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:02,000
directly not clinging and harmlessness not clinging renunciation not clinging not clinging

186
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,280
to who I need to be who I might be who the better me

187
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:15,360
is not clinging to being right just

188
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:22,440
stop just stop not clinging to be

189
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:29,880
openhearted just stop practice that in the

190
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:35,799
moment the mindfulness of just being aware of what's happening in the

191
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:39,158
moment in the

192
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:49,200
moment disenchantment dispassion sensation that's that's the

193
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,720
process to do that you have to be mindful you have to see what's happening

194
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,960
right now

195
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:15,639
this is quite irritating that I can't find that but there it is I can't find

196
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:25,880
it one of the one of the real traps that we get into is the Trap of needing to be

197
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:32,400
better than we are needing to be a better person needing to

198
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:39,000
be clear more clear than we are one of my favorite quotes is from uh Suzuki

199
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:47,080
roshi who who noticed that a lot of his students were really uh extremely self-critical and

200
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:52,840
what he said is you know you're perfect just the way you are and you could use a little

201
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:58,559
work and the reason I like that is it's it's very clear that you really don't

202
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:06,960
have to be other than you are and you should not stop working you should not stop following

203
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:13,799
that intention toward being non- clinging and

204
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,799
non-harming that leaning toward freedom in the

205
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:28,720
moment that should not be let go of

206
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,720
that should be reinforced that should be cultivated in order to do that we have

207
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:41,799
to be willing to be to let go of all the opinions we have about what's going on

208
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:48,080
now we have to be able to see what's going on now it's seeing it clearly so

209
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:55,240
that we can say oh I don't have to be all the things I don't have to react

210
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:00,799
to I don't have to I I can

211
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,520
stop it's not easy I don't want to claim it's easy and

212
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:15,200
it kind it can come right back but being able to feel what it

213
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,760
feels like when you can stop and be free

214
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:26,000
of that passion to feel that passion go

215
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,960
allows you to feel what it feels like like for a moment of

216
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,880
freedom and I personally just want to add those

217
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:46,039
up and become used to seeing that so that I can be aware of that in any

218
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:53,919
moment in more and more moments of my life when the surge in reactivity slows

219
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:59,039
down then I can reflect on what was going on where did the mind go

220
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:05,559
what did the mind what was the react what was the form of reactivity what did that look

221
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:12,080
like I should be careful about that I should be aware of that that's a mind

222
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:18,640
habit I should be aware of but in the moment the important thing is

223
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:26,240
stop just stop feel the puffiness go out of the

224
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,320
out of the moment feel it

225
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,960
deflate I don't have to understand everything in the moment I can just

226
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:45,000
ah so one of the books I had open was uh Joseph goldstein's one Dharma and then

227
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:55,279
the nice thing about this book is he in it he talks about the various forms of Buddhism that he has practiced and how

228
00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:01,120
while the practices are different the song they sing is pretty

229
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:06,760
similar and so uh what he I have a quote from him that

230
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:14,080
I particularly liked he said faith in the possibility of Awakening confidence in the moments

231
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,480
experience and in the nature of awareness itself trust in the direction

232
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:25,960
of Our Lives all of these settle doubt confusion and

233
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:32,679
agitation they create an inner environment of clarity Stillness and

234
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:39,080
Beauty let me repeat that faith in the possibility of Awakening confidence in

235
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:46,039
the moments experience and in the nature of awareness itself trust in the direction of Our

236
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:51,440
Lives all of these settle doubt confusion and

237
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,240
agitation they create an inner environment of clarity Stillness and

238
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:05,000
beauty that sounds really attractive and it really goes back to

239
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:12,440
knowing your intention practicing with your intention revisiting your intention and being

240
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,840
mindful of that persisting in being

241
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:23,760
mindful persisting in just seeing being aware being

242
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:30,480
here ah this is what's happening this is what's happening not judging what's

243
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:37,200
happening this is what's happening seeing it as clearly as you possibly can

244
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,640
oh this is what's happening I'm reacting to that oh look

245
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:49,240
at that see that not this is good this is bad this

246
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:55,919
is more this is less see it see

247
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:01,840
it the quote from him I was looking for is this

248
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:09,679
one he he was talking about Enlightenment or Freedom

249
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,960
Liberation and uh he was quoting Renee deal in Mount

250
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:21,760
analog keep your eye fixed on the way to the top but don't forget to look right

251
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:27,120
in front of you the last step depends on the

252
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:34,760
first don't think you you've arrived just because you see the summit watch your footing be sure of the

253
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:41,240
next step but don't let that distract you from the highest goal the first step

254
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:48,159
depends on the last you begin with your

255
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:55,440
intention you have a goal don't lose sight of the intention but it is the intention that

256
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,039
sets you off on the first step

257
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:09,759
and that first step leads to the last step which is the next step that you

258
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:16,360
take and then step after that and the step after that and the step after

259
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:23,640
that live it live that step not the one you took 20 years ago not the one you

260
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:30,679
haven't taken yet this step this is the only one that you can

261
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:36,159
affect right now and this is the one that you can

262
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,600
know about

263
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:46,880
so what you get from that the promise

264
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:54,919
this is a poem by Jane hershfield mysteriously they entered those few minutes mysteriously they

265
00:29:54,919 --> 00:30:00,480
left as if the great dog of confusion guarding my heart who is always

266
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:07,360
Sleepless suddenly slept it was not any Awakening of the large not so much as that only a

267
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:14,919
stepping away from the petty I gazed at the range of Blue Mountains I drank from the stream tossed in a small Stone from

268
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:21,279
the bank whatever Direction the face of my life might travel I trusted even the

269
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:28,480
greedy Direction even The Grieving trusted there was nothing like to be

270
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:35,919
saved from Bliss nor danger the dog's tail wagged a little in his

271
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:41,480
dream it was not an Awakening of the large not so much as that only a

272
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:46,960
stepping back from the petty as if the great dog of confusion

273
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:54,200
guarding my heart who is always Sleepless suddenly slept I wish you all to have Sleeping

274
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:59,320
Dogs of confusion thank you

275
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:05,919
so if you have any questions comments I'd be happy to entertain them

276
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:11,559
yes so I was really hang on a second experience

277
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:19,799
about the coffee coffee yeah cuz I have recently had a coffee experience

278
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:26,399
too and I stopped drinking coffee I think what I'm not going to give you a lecture about coffee but 50 years ago

279
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:32,559
for various reasons and I had some friends coming and I know they're big coffee

280
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:37,919
Drinkers and I made sure that I could find the coffee maker and all the things

281
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:43,720
you put in CU I'd forgotten how to make coffee and I was sure to show them and

282
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:48,799
wanted to make sure that they felt comfortable staying with us to make their

283
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:56,919
coffee and I didn't realize till they started making coffee I was really trying hard not to react that I didn't

284
00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:03,600
like the smell of the coffee that had permeated the whole

285
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:09,279
condo and saying to myself this is their vacation and this is a coffee experience

286
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:18,880
for me that I haven't had in 50 years and what am I going to do with it and I just tried to flow with it and

287
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:26,320
I didn't make any comments about the smell except of course to my husband who doesn't drink coffee either and

288
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,639
controlled myself from saying about why do you just drink coffee and they went

289
00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:36,880
all day long with only drinking coffee so I'm pausing and I'm watching and I'm

290
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:43,679
thinking it's their vacation and it's their time away so I don't want to give a coffee

291
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:50,720
lecture you know I really controlled myself and then I started asking myself

292
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:57,840
why am I reacting so strongly to the smell we haven't had a talk about coffee

293
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:04,159
there's been no lecture right there's been absolutely no judgment verbally but

294
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:10,880
in my head I can't get over the smell and they're with us you know for two

295
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,360
weeks so after the third day I looked at myself and I said you're going to learn

296
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:23,679
to like that smell and not let it spoil your day because I was thinking about the

297
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:30,960
smell after they would leave and really thankful when they came back that they didn't and do more coffee and after the

298
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,960
third day finally I was at peace and I said just let it go you know just

299
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:45,919
release it clear it it's just coffee you know and then I

300
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,840
guess the second week I started thinking about why I stopped drinking coffee because I hadn't thought about it for a

301
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:58,760
long time you know and I was really happy

302
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:04,320
that I wasn't drinking it anymore but there was no judgment about why I

303
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:09,520
stopped so I think it was really good that they came and they drank the coffee

304
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:16,200
because it helped me to release I think a very subtle reaction that I was still

305
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:21,839
having to it that it was maybe not so good to be drinking it

306
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:28,280
but not for them but for me so thank you for your story I don't think it was trivial at all all and I

307
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:35,118
think it helps you to know that even little tiny subtle things so

308
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:41,638
small can cause a reaction they can and I I thank you for

309
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:49,040
that I think it's also important to realize that it it was unpleasant for you you don't have to pretend it was not

310
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:55,560
unpleasant it was unpleasant it was uh there was there was a poem uh it's not

311
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:02,560
in this book but it is a Jane hershfield Book and it's um a poem uh and I I wish

312
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:09,280
I knew it completely but it it basically is U

313
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:17,280
it's called Cedar something and she the the the idea is I do it I still every

314
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:23,040
morning wash my face in cold water to remind

315
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,400
myself that it's okay to be with something that's really unplan

316
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:36,200
Pleasant oh I like that yeah and um I like I like the idea of it also you know

317
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:41,280
it's unpleasant and it's it's uh you don't have you don't have to push it

318
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:47,040
away and you don't you don't have to do it in the spirit of I'm tolerating this

319
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:53,440
necessarily either it's it's just unpleasant you know and it sounds like over the course of the three days you

320
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:59,599
got to the point where you just said it's just unpleasant and this is something I'm giving my guests is I'm

321
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:04,880
willing to be with and then as a side you learn something about yourself but

322
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,319
we don't have to pretend it's it's not unpleasant it's unpleasant for you so

323
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:18,359
you know that's that should be acknowled follow up about harmlessness I was happy that I didn't

324
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:24,160
really do much harm to them in any way by lecturing about it yeah but when I

325
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:30,880
finally accepted it the harm that I was doing to myself didn't feel as

326
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:37,000
bad it felt less so I love that part of your

327
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,920
talk I'm going to find

328
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:50,800
that third oh non-ill will yeah non- clinging

329
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:59,280
non-ill will and and harmlessness duh thank you

330
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:05,200
yeah does anybody else have something

331
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:14,319
yes uh thanks for the talk um I do want

332
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:20,480
to go back to the concept of not clinging um particularly like uh when

333
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:27,839
I'm at work where I typically get very engaged in like you know conversations at work um

334
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:34,480
and sometimes I get like too impassioned about the topic you know

335
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:42,280
and there are moments where you I catch myself feeling that way and I'm

336
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:48,000
present um and I tell myself okay just like let it go it's okay you don't have

337
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,599
to be right you don't have to like prove a point um and and you know you can like

338
00:37:54,599 --> 00:38:00,319
listen um I I think like uh when when that happens for me though um

339
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:08,040
I typically go the polar opposite and I go like full not full but like a big

340
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:13,599
disengagement from the topic um almost like a sense of apathy which I also like

341
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:20,400
don't want to necessarily give off right because like there is like the the the golden mean I guess in between like

342
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,520
clinging and apathy yes um or disengagement so I guess like my

343
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:35,040
question is um how do I uh like what's a what's a good way to be in that golden mean um

344
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:41,920
especially when when you're able to like actually catch yourself um which which is very pleasant right like you're catching yourself okay I can like

345
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,160
correct course but then like how do I you know like balance between like being

346
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:53,359
very impassionate about it versus being just um totally like

347
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:58,599
disengaged so I think there that that's a great great question and I think that

348
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:06,400
that an important thing to consider is how important is what's involved right

349
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:13,440
so I deliberately chose coffee and a bottle of water because you know nobody's impacted by this nobody is

350
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,240
harmed by this nobody's there are no great decisions tied to this uh had I

351
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:25,880
chosen something like uh where where my husband and I are going to go on

352
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:33,440
vacation now now there there's more uh there's more invested in that

353
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,720
discussion right so so if uh I remember

354
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:44,000
in a previous marriage I felt like I won every battle and lost every

355
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,119
war which would be the same sort of thing I I I would win the battle and

356
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:58,640
then I'd let him have his way right because I I was into uh uh

357
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:08,520
being a debater you know it was important to me to to have the the uh to be

358
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:17,040
right but I didn't want to but I felt like Pro protecting the

359
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:22,920
relationship required me to give in you know and somehow that was totally

360
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:29,400
misguided way of thinking so it was very destructive to the relationship so that's a case where that just doesn't

361
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:34,480
work at work um you have to make similar sorts

362
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:40,280
of decisions you know so is what you're trying to is what you're

363
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:46,760
discussing uh something that has import or is it a case where you just

364
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:54,560
want to be right or is it a case where somebody's being bullied intellectually bullied right and you can see that's

365
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:01,200
happening then you decide am I being bullied am I stepping away

366
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:08,839
from being bullied by this person how important is that is that affecting my standing or is that just affecting how I

367
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:14,720
am with this person what's what are the consequences of giving in to this person

368
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:20,040
so so you kind of have to measure that

369
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:25,280
in the discussion how you deal with speech is

370
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:32,359
you know is is it true is it useful is it timely is it

371
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:39,079
kind you know so you can answer those questions but in terms of this broader

372
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:44,240
question of apathy versus

373
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:50,280
argumentativeness that takes that's in the realm of how do I

374
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:58,920
establish personal space personal space I'm going to call it

375
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:05,160
and in an appropriate way how do I have an appropriate personal space here and

376
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:11,520
that's something that you kind of have to measure by by Honest

377
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:20,440
reflection and consideration of whether the the situation you're in

378
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:26,920
is appropriate for you overall you know you want to keep the job you like the job you have to get along with this

379
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:34,319
person it's your boss it's not your boss you know um are there other avenues is this

380
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:40,440
something that happens all the time is this a person that does you know is it one person that's a problem or lots of

381
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:47,800
people that are the problem you know there are all kinds of questions so I don't think it's a simple answer but I

382
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:56,160
think you do have to look at uh you it is not necessary to become the

383
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:02,240
person who always gives in that's I don't think

384
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:09,480
appropriate but seeing what's happening is extremely important and not

385
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:16,440
automatically behaving in a certain way so what I hear you say is um their

386
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:23,480
response is really based on the context um and there there are things where we have

387
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:30,040
to like speak up and as long as it's true um timely useful and kind um those

388
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:36,920
are like good thank you for that by the way good like I guess like compasses um to speech um but there're also like

389
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:42,800
things that are the grander scheme of things trivial um and those are of

390
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:50,480
moments where we can choose to kind of just like soften a bit and and not like be so you know like combative about or

391
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:59,039
or argumentative about stuff so choose your battles yeah no I appreciate that thank you so much yeah

392
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:12,400
yes thanks for your talk and um

393
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:20,319
um what uh I my practice lately is about being

394
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:28,480
aware wherever I am whatever I do and what and then I've become

395
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,480
by being mindfulness and um not not just a

396
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:39,839
sitting you know mindful of everything that go goes on around

397
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:47,280
me and uh I've and I'm track I'm practicing this

398
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:53,079
mindfulness in to be effortless because in order to

399
00:44:53,079 --> 00:45:02,079
be mindful you have to set your you have to pause you have to look at it and then

400
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:08,359
decide put the intention to do the right thing or say

401
00:45:08,359 --> 00:45:13,920
right thing and all that and

402
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:21,839
then it's effort it's some effort to put in order to do that yeah so I'm

403
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:28,040
practicing a lot to be really more mindful of my life and

404
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:34,000
then I noticed that most of my reaction

405
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:41,200
is from outside world some some interactions someone says something

406
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:51,079
someone does something so I I kind of react to anything that goes on that I

407
00:45:51,079 --> 00:46:01,000
hear or I see it these five senses that I'm using to to get the to pause and

408
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:08,160
look at my my reaction mhm so

409
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:17,920
um and it it has really helped me and I just feel like you know doing

410
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:26,960
that without that effort that pause sometimes it just come right out

411
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:33,160
with no with some reaction that is not based

412
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:38,880
on mindfulness and say okay this is this

413
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:47,800
is the process and this is knowing and so on so that's where I like to be clear

414
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:54,040
that there that that quick reaction there there's a

415
00:46:54,040 --> 00:47:01,960
lot so uh uh it could be asking a lot of yourself

416
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:07,680
to have total Insight when there's a lot

417
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:15,599
happening you know in the midst of uh a conversation at work you can't be aware

418
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:20,720
of everything you have to choose what you're going to be aware of and

419
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:26,119
so sometimes it's uh

420
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:36,400
one of one of the points I tried to make earlier is I didn't try to analyze what was what my reaction was only that I was

421
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:41,720
reacting and that I would stop so that I didn't try to decide how should I be

422
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:48,720
reacting I ju how should I be reacting I just stopped so that I didn't have to make

423
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:54,079
all those decisions because I didn't have time to analyze it in real time and

424
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:59,680
figure it all out to be wise there wasn't an option to be wise all I

425
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:05,040
could do was stop okay and then later I could think

426
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:10,400
about what was going on and then I expanded my awareness and said okay

427
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:16,599
what's going on with her it's too complex to figure out what's going on with me but rather than making her the

428
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:24,040
bad guy why don't I ask myself what's going on with her as a way of not

429
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:31,079
re-entanglement because we can become too focused on

430
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:36,359
figuring out my stuff and just makes it more

431
00:48:36,359 --> 00:48:42,119
complex so uh so that's the only thing I would say about that you you want to

432
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:49,839
practice mindfulness to the extent that you feel like you are inhabiting your life but not that you're cluttering

433
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:55,720
it if you're cluttering your life you you're you're doing yourself a

434
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:01,839
disservice choose choose pieces

435
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:07,960
because you don't want to make your life into a project you want to live your

436
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:16,040
life thank you thanks so uh so we need to end if

437
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:25,079
anybody else has anything else I'll hang around for a while thank you very much may you be well
