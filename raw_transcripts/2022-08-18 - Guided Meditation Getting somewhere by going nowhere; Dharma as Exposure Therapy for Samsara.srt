1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:07,600
so welcome welcome folks uh it's nice to see your names and chats over there

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:14,639
um yeah

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:22,240
okay so um yesterday i i began with that that

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,119
formulation that um

5
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,880
a certain kind of um

6
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,840
the complications of goals yeah that we we have goals they give our life

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,680
meaning we don't achieve them it's not great we do achieve them we

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,680
lose the meaning giving function of the goal

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,120
itself there's a different way of characterizing maybe

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,320
unsatisfactoriness that um

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,640
wanting something is always different than getting it

12
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,920
and so the response to that

13
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,799
is to turn meditation not into a goal-directed pursuit we see this in whole lineages you know

14
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,840
just embody the buddha or something like this

15
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,439
and that's real that's real to sit without any

16
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:44,000
sense of going or getting somewhere it's it's an atylic activity meditation

17
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:51,040
but meditation is also a telic activity to use that the

18
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,360
language from kieran sataya that i mentioned yesterday

19
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,880
it's also structured by goals the goal of

20
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:10,800
being free or more free but the interesting thing about the way

21
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,200
we make our way to that goal is we do we we make our way to that goal

22
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,599
in an atylic kind of way yeah we're not pretending not to have goals

23
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:31,760
exactly but there's a sense of actually surrendering the goal-making mind the striving

24
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:39,519
the sense of being sandwiched in time between the past and the future

25
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,959
we make progress towards goals by giving up

26
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,480
that orientation yeah and so we're aware we're

27
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,760
cultivating lots of spiritual faculties and

28
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,239
cultivating the steadiness of mind samadhi cultivating

29
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,040
uh a million things yeah

30
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,480
but um we do it all one moment at a time and that moment is

31
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,760
free of grasping and engineering and

32
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:27,599
uh the desperation that we usually have around striving and goal making

33
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,360
and uh so let's uh that's it see what happens

34
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,120
in the most general sense our goals are

35
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:32,720
wisdom compassion and to use technohands language

36
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,160
understanding and love

37
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:06,639
whatever progress we make towards the actualization of those goals

38
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,840
we can be happy with

39
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:24,880
so we just begin with a sense of the depth of aspiration

40
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:34,880
the reverence for those who

41
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,240
have manifested understanding and love

42
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,240
in the sense of ourselves finding

43
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:02,280
finding ourselves here in this stream this lineage

44
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,039
of understanding and love

45
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,199
and so there's an aspiration

46
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,039
but no urgency

47
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,800
we let go of our need to get anywhere

48
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,240
and in this way we get somewhere

49
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,839
just pouring your awareness into your body

50
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,720
and blessing your whole body with awareness

51
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,760
blooming and buzzing the constellation of sensations

52
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:11,079
all infused with the intimacy of awareness

53
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:28,880
all phenomena have liberation as their core

54
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,040
just the buddha

55
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:12,000
every phenomena every sensation and thought

56
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,480
sound

57
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:25,160
are a kind of invitation to know everything

58
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:55,360
but grasping [Music] striving

59
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:03,000
towards goals makes things solid

60
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,520
gives everything a solid core

61
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:23,000
not a core of liberation

62
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,440
and so we relax everything

63
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,679
clinging always experiences a kind of friction

64
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:13,639
tension we relax everything

65
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:47,520
we practice being a monastic

66
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:59,280
in the sense that finally

67
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,440
we're privileging awareness

68
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,158
over our life

69
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,000
over the relentless struggle

70
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,440
to get our ducks in a row

71
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,480
me

72
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:56,080
thank you it's good to good to sit with you

73
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:12,960
so on tuesday said um

74
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,480
that a core core mechanism of action

75
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,640
uh in dharma is attention attention therapy

76
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:30,320
and um and yesterday said uh the the dharma is a kind of

77
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:36,720
cognitive therapy and they interact attentional stability

78
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,399
makes the learnings sink in deeper

79
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:50,000
and today the characterizing the dharma as an exposure

80
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,320
therapy moving towards that which we

81
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,679
habitually avoid and

82
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,960
virtually every therapy psychotherapy

83
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,000
group approaches no matter what its name has exposure

84
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,159
as a core component and that is a function of the pervasiveness of

85
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:25,600
experiential avoidance defined as the unwillingness to remain

86
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,880
in contact with unpleasant thoughts memories emotions other private internal

87
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:37,919
experiences and taking steps to alter aversive experience or the event that

88
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,639
elicited that experience

89
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:49,760
and experiential avoidance is is known as a

90
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:56,399
a trans diagnostic risk factor it's across a wide range of

91
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:03,440
psychological distress um there's experiential avoidance

92
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,518
so this is um hey is 1996.

93
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,120
many forms of psychopathology are not merely bad problems

94
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:20,320
they are also bad solutions based on a dangerous and ineffective use

95
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:26,159
of experiential avoidance strategies instead of encouraging people to use

96
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:32,880
more clever ways to fight and win this war with their own thoughts feelings and bodily sensations

97
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,720
the ubiquity of problems associated with experiential avoidance

98
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:44,640
suggests that it might be safer to help people step out of this war

99
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,440
altogether

100
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:58,159
experiential avoidance we often talk about it implicitly in the dharma world but it

101
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,200
manifests in different ways been characterized and is not a

102
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,559
definitive list but been operationalized as

103
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:15,039
procrastination distraction behavioral avoidance

104
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:20,240
difficulty enduring distress aversion to distress

105
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,600
and repression denial and so

106
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:32,320
exposure therapy in the psychotherapeutic world involves the deliberate approach of anxiety provoking

107
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:39,360
stimuli people activities places other internal experiences

108
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:47,279
with um the ultimate goal of changing emotional and behavioral responses to

109
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:52,640
to life's experiences and

110
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:58,159
we do this to habituate become desensitized to the

111
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:05,200
fear to disconfirm catastrophic beliefs around the feared

112
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,878
outcomes if i feel this if i do that if i encounter

113
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:17,839
to to de-catastrophize and to develop new learning to actually

114
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:24,240
form associations between the feared experience or object

115
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,000
and the experience of safety

116
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,720
and in clinical situations you kind of create a hierarchy of

117
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:42,000
exposures so in like a snake phobia just to be very simple as the example i

118
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,599
usually give give a kind of rationale for the treatment and develop some access to

119
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:57,359
tranquility to ease and then gradually introduce more and more anxiety provoking experiences so

120
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:03,040
first you're writing the word snake and then seeing a picture of a snake and then

121
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:09,440
walking past a pet store and then you know getting close to the snake and holding the snake and then then you kind

122
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,560
of graduation day is the boa constrictor kind of wrapped around your shoulders or

123
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,079
whatever and you're at ease yeah it's called systematic

124
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:25,200
desensitization and

125
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:32,880
the dharma is unsystematic exposure therapy

126
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,000
the dharma is exposure therapy

127
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,359
for samsara for this realm

128
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:50,640
exposure therapy for samsara because we know as practitioners that um

129
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:56,400
anything that can disrupt our peace will yeah

130
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:03,440
that is the logic of the dharma anything that can disrupt our peace will

131
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:11,359
and that means that this is the path of purification

132
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:16,560
and freedom is the uprooting often characterized

133
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:24,400
enlightenment as the uprooting of greed hate and delusion but that entails a deep intimate contact

134
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:33,200
with those forces we cannot live in fear and obedience to the forces

135
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:41,839
of greed hate and delusion but that means we're going to have to feel our way through them

136
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:47,760
and so every time i get hungry i can't eat every time i'm angry i can't yell

137
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:54,280
every time i'm anxious i can't ruminate we practice

138
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:03,280
new strategies we have these familiar ways we neutralize aversive experience

139
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,640
and in dharma we expand

140
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:15,280
with relinquishing the usual ways we neutralize and soothe aversive

141
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,320
experience and so purification

142
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,839
is its own kind of unpleasantness but it's wholesome unpleasantness yeah you

143
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:31,920
can taste taste the relief in it

144
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:38,720
yeah the unpleasantness is it's there the unpleasantness of

145
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:45,839
purification for sure is is dominant but you can also sense things getting

146
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:51,040
lighter one of my teachers shinzo young says we

147
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,839
develop a taste for purification

148
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:04,480
university college london survey published a

149
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,320
prominent journal 1200 meditators researchers were

150
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:16,000
assessing un unpleasant experience in meditators

151
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,400
and in this survey they found that 26 of meditation practitioners reported

152
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,839
particularly unpleasant experience associated with meditation

153
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:34,000
and they found strong evidence for an association between particularly unpleasant meditation related

154
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,640
experiences and retreat yeah um that's funny

155
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:48,640
that's funny to me 26 yeah unpleasant experience and the very obvious question

156
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:57,000
is what on earth are the other 74 doing

157
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:06,079
as our attention stabilizes um

158
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,400
we get bigger and bigger doses of

159
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,640
of suffering or suffering and

160
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:23,359
samadhi the attentional decide the samadhi lubricates the mind

161
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:29,599
and so where it goes it really goes we see this very clearly in retreat

162
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:36,960
where it goes it really goes and our peace

163
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:44,640
at some point gives way to purification yeah whatever happiness or ease tranquility

164
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:51,760
that gives away and we move from the mode of abiding in some peace

165
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:58,560
to purification and in purification we're called to make

166
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,920
peace with primal forces that disrupt peace

167
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:12,079
and sometimes really intense high affect states of rage or

168
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,318
terror helplessness

169
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:25,200
and we just keep making peace with our conditioning

170
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:30,480
we just keep making peace with our conditioning

171
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:37,359
this is the exposure therapy dimension of dharma

172
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:44,720
and in that exposure we change our conditioning

173
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:52,760
we develop new understandings more degrees of freedom

174
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:02,160
michelle mcdonald who speaks so beautifully about all of this says

175
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,520
we develop a relationship with everything so that we're not afraid of

176
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,000
anything

177
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:21,359
read a um a story story about a mathematician

178
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:27,760
a kind of kind of very major impact on the field and then kind of vanished and

179
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,040
vanished into some some loops of isolation pain

180
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:40,000
not totally clear but um something from one of his his journals

181
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,160
yeah reminded me of this theme today

182
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:53,599
i know that there is nourishing substance in everything that happens to me whether

183
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:58,960
the seeds are by my own hand or by others

184
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:05,839
it is up to me to eat it and watch it transform into knowledge

185
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:12,480
i've learned that in the harvest however bitter there is substantial flesh

186
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:20,640
which is up to us to nourish ourselves with when this substance is eaten and has

187
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:27,599
become part of our flesh the bitterness which was only the sign

188
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:34,880
of our resistance to the food intended for us has disappeared

189
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:46,800
it's a dharma dharma as a exposure therapy for samsara

190
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:55,040
offer this for consideration and pick up what's useful

191
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:02,160
leave behind what is not so thank you uh thank you all happy to

192
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:08,400
uh be be with you and um we'll keep going

193
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:15,440
tomorrow yeah have a lovely lovely day whatever that means

194
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:21,119
