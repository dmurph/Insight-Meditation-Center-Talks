1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,160
happy to be here with all of you and this gathering of

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:13,599
people and also gathering of our of our minds of our attention

3
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:19,279
so um when i was uh living in the zen monastery

4
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,560
i had been there for maybe about nine months or so

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:31,199
and content to be practicing and doing the meditation that was a regular part of that life

6
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:38,160
and then one day they told me that i was going to be assigned to the kitchen and to be one of the cooks

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,160
i never really cooked before so and i'd come for do a lot of meditation i knew that the cooks didn't meditate a

8
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,960
lot so i was a little bit uh dismayed by this

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,600
but any case i went into the kitchen the first day i was supposed to be there and i walked in i was alone in this kitchen

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,760
a monastery kitchen and and i looked around

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:11,080
and the kitchen seemed kind of

12
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,520
huge like overwhelming for me exactly a year later when i finished my

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,200
stint in the kitchen i had i had just found myself in the same situation alone in the kitchen

14
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:33,759
and it seemed very small and the first day i it seems it seemed big

15
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:40,479
and i seemed small the last day the kitchen this building hadn't changed but now it felt small and

16
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,799
i felt large so there was a kind of shift of perception that went on partly with my

17
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,399
familiarity and my confidence of being there so a little bit something like that can

18
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,240
happen in meditation as well and other things begin happening that are we experience start

19
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,079
experiencing our minds differently it's perceived differently and some of it has to do with

20
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:11,200
familiarity with it and comfort with it where the mind starts feeling big

21
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:18,560
in a confident way and in a certain kind of way the world seems not i don't know if not as big but

22
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,120
not as daunting or difficult because the mind is big enough to hold it all

23
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,640
or as the mind as we begin to become a little bit freer in meditation

24
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:38,560
and less devoted to um to our thoughts devoted to our ideas

25
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,599
devoted to our emotions and devoted also in a negative way kind of devoted to being aversive to it or

26
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,280
reactive to it or all this complicated way we have with our our lived experience

27
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,560
as we start stop stop being so glued to it so committed to it

28
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,360
it actually frees up the space in the mind and the mind starts feeling large

29
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,599
or awareness starts feeling spacious expansive

30
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:16,480
and when i first started studying zen they talked about big mind and as we practiced this experience of

31
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,159
having this big mind in this early tradition that we're practicing out of

32
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,599
the buddha had the similar term that could be said big mind and

33
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,120
might sometimes it's called an expanded mind

34
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,319
but the word is a big or large maha and uh

35
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:44,640
and so this maha great mind and so as mindfulness

36
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:52,879
meets experience but it doesn't the attention doesn't get narrowed in some kind of

37
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:01,200
it doesn't get contracted around it or gets lost in it but gets relaxed around experience

38
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,519
then um things begin the mind begins to open up it's kind of like

39
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:14,319
if my if my i bring attention to my left hand with my attention can be like a little laser

40
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:20,799
like this it gets all wrapped up around it or attention can be like a big wide open

41
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:27,360
hand and it just it has lots of space for the experience of the other hand there's lots of room

42
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:34,800
for it to roam around and be experienced so something begins shifting

43
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,400
in the mind or with attention that it starts feeling large or spacious

44
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:47,040
open expanded sometimes as if it has no boundaries

45
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,280
it's not it's larger than our body in a sense larger than the some people have the experience of their

46
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:00,160
attention has a certain kind of funny way where it's larger than anything that's known within

47
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,800
it so of course you know here i'm sitting in this room here and of course the room is bigger than me

48
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,840
but i only know the room through the

49
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:19,039
medium of my awareness of it and so it's it's uh

50
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,080
the seeing the awareness of it is kind of a way in which perception is constructed

51
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,880
in the mind and then we know what's going on so in a certain kind of way awareness is larger than the room

52
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,240
and uh it can feel that way and and not that this is accurate for what

53
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,240
the mind is who knows what the mind is but it's how it's experienced when the mind

54
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,440
starts getting relaxed and spacious and not caught in things

55
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:54,320
so to sit quietly now to see if

56
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,160
you could notice how large your mind is

57
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:07,479
how small it is how much space there is an awareness

58
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,638
so to take a meditation posture

59
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,240
and close your eyes

60
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,360
and without anything more right now

61
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,000
what's if if you had to kind of

62
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,840
notice the size of your mind or the size of awareness

63
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,080
how large is it as large as your skull

64
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,759
smaller than your skull larger than your skull

65
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,840
for some of you maybe this question doesn't compute

66
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:01,120
it's perplexing but what is it that knows being

67
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,840
perplexed

68
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,319
that which knows

69
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,240
does it have any boundaries edges

70
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,800
so now taking a few long slow deep breaths

71
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:41,319
and as you exhale let all things settle

72
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,319
relax

73
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:05,440
letting your breath return to normal then gently

74
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:11,919
relaxedly on the exhale

75
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:20,319
further do some further relaxing of the body of places where things are held tight

76
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,919
softening in the face

77
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,159
softening in the shoulders

78
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,919
softening in the belly

79
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:58,480
and also as you exhale to soften the mind

80
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:05,680
especially any physical sensations connected to thinking and

81
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:14,240
trying to figure things out or any tension

82
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,760
pressure contraction in the mind in the brain

83
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,120
as you exhale imagine that the

84
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,040
mind spreads out horizontally like a vast

85
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:36,920
large still lake of water

86
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,240
and without knowing exactly or even approximately

87
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,600
what your mind is

88
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:07,600
does your mind have any boundaries is there an edge to the mind

89
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,880
is there that which is inside the mind and that which is outside the mind

90
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:25,000
and if there is what's the shape of that boundary

91
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:42,079
and if you relax the mind further relax trying looking seeking

92
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,160
just allowing your mind to relax and be

93
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:02,399
allowing awareness to be and does your awareness have enough

94
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,920
space in it to become aware of your breathing

95
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:39,480
and as you exhale to let there be a quieting of the mind

96
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,000
so the mind is pulled pulled or settles towards

97
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,360
an inner silence quiet

98
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,360
and as you inhale

99
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,440
let there be a receptive quality receiving the inhale

100
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,959
receiving the inhale and the vastness of the mind

101
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,519
and if there are thoughts and feelings and body sensations

102
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:06,480
that become predominant experiment with knowing it

103
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,720
in the vastness of the mind

104
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:19,760
know it with an awareness that has large

105
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,839
unpreoccupied

106
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:35,639
the less reactivity the more we experience the mind

107
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,279
as something that's open and relaxed

108
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:49,040
perhaps vast the vast mind

109
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,680
which has space for all things within it

110
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:11,839
the mind becomes larger when it's not limited by our concerns

111
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:17,678
it doesn't when it doesn't become narrow with our

112
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:24,558
trying to get something or make something happen or figure something out

113
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:36,320
letting the mind relax letting awareness be relaxed

114
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:47,039
open wide and clearly receptive

115
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:54,039
for the meeting between awareness and our experience

116
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,440
and coming to the end of this sitting

117
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,159
what has shifted in your mind in the course of the sitting

118
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:35,440
not in terms of the content of the mind the concerns

119
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,639
but the state of your mind

120
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:47,278
is there more calm or subtleness

121
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,080
are things quieter

122
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:09,760
is there greater understanding or clarity about

123
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,279
what's going on in the mind

124
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:27,440
does the mind in any kind of way feel more expanded larger

125
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:34,159
does the metaphor of space relate to

126
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:40,399
maybe feeling spacious in the mind

127
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,640
or a spacious awareness

128
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:59,840
and whether you feel it or you can imagine it imagine your mind is

129
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,480
as large as the room you're sitting in

130
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:15,200
imagine that it's as large as the building you're in

131
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,080
imagine it's as large as the

132
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,720
town you might be sitting in or the area you're

133
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,559
in imagine that your mind is vast and open and

134
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,919
extends out into the world

135
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:57,840
and in the vastness of the mind there's a room for all things

136
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,640
and so too in your mind's eye imagination imagining

137
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,679
some way the whole world with all its beings and

138
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:21,120
all its joys and sorrows lots of room in your mind or your heart

139
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:29,760
that you welcome all things you're ready to be a witness

140
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:36,559
to be a safe presence for all things in your mind

141
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,720
relaxed open receptive

142
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:55,679
and perhaps allowing this openness holding all beings

143
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:05,360
to gaze upon it all kindly to gaze upon all of it

144
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:11,640
with a feeling of caring and compassion

145
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:20,158
kindness and love or a friendliness

146
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:27,840
that wants if once the wants the welfare and happiness of others

147
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:38,640
may all beings be happy and may whatever benefits that come from

148
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:46,159
this meditation may it support that happiness of others

149
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,919
may all beings be safe

150
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,960
may all beings be peaceful

151
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,440
may all beings be free

152
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:12,080
and may that safety and peace and freedom that others can experience

153
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:21,960
may it begin in my own mind may they exist peacefully in my own mind

154
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:28,399
safely safe from me peaceful with me and free

155
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:34,559
with me may all beings

156
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,840
be free

157
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:52,710
[Music]

158
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:05,760
so here on the fourth talk on mindfulness of the mind mind state

159
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:12,080
um kind of a little bit now maybe trying to explain a little bit more about what

160
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:18,960
that guided meditation was about so the

161
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,159
when the buddha teaches the classic teachings on mindfulness practice the four foundations of

162
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:29,279
mindfulness the third foundation has to do with mindfulness of the mind

163
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:35,200
the state of mind in that description of how to practice that

164
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:41,600
there's the instructions to notice eight pairs of mental states

165
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:47,120
and the first four have a lot to do with noticing the presence of

166
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:54,159
how we relate to the world how we get involved in the world so there can be desire greed there can

167
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,200
be ill will or hostility hatred there can be delusion

168
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,799
and also there can be ways of relating that without those and so the mind somehow is still in

169
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:11,600
involved in in the world and thoughts and feelings and all this and uh and it's possible meditation to

170
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:18,159
feel that that shifts and changes that the contractions of and the tightness the tension of great

171
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:24,880
hatred delusion begin to abate and a whole other motivations come how to relate to the world generosity and

172
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,720
love also um in how we relate to the world or

173
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:37,039
confused about the world or begin kind of not quite knowing whether to be involved in the world or

174
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:43,279
connected and preoccupied or not the mind goes through a transition where sometimes it just doesn't know

175
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:48,960
whether to collapse and get tired and fall asleep or doesn't know to get over excited and

176
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,960
doesn't know where to land or what to focus on but it's agitated the mind can get kind of contracted in

177
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:01,440
itself so i can get it get get scattered in all kinds of ways but it's still kind of a mind that's concerned with things

178
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:08,320
in some way as mindfulness gets stronger as our ability to be present and rooted and

179
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,519
here in the present moment as we not so inclined to get caught in our thoughts

180
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,960
and preoccupations then the experience of the mind shifts

181
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:25,440
to a kind of mind state kind of mind way of operating that's not so

182
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,960
incessantly concerned with relating to things

183
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,080
if you're involved in thought swept away in thoughts you're relating to the thought to the ideas of the

184
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,200
thought if you're preoccupied with your feelings uh

185
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:48,080
you're you know then the mind is kind of involved in that and focused on it so so when we stop focusing on this

186
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:54,159
stuff then the mind starts to become freer from its preoccupations

187
00:33:54,159 --> 00:34:00,240
and then we start experiencing the mind more as its own thing its own state

188
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:06,000
it's very hard to talk about what the mind is and so to call it a mind state or

189
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,320
something i've been calling a state of being the quality of our inner life some people might call it the heart the

190
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:18,398
quality of the heart and you know exactly what the mind is we don't know

191
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:24,638
but we don't have to know for the purposes of meditation we just have to recognize something

192
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:30,158
about how awareness consciousness feels what we might call

193
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:37,760
the gestalt the totality of our mental activity the state of our mentality

194
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,599
this inner kind of world of knowing of being conscious of being

195
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:49,440
aware of mindfulness and start feeling the quality of it this

196
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,040
and when it's no longer preoccupied with things then the mind starts feeling

197
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,800
um more peaceful more calm and one some people find the mind feels

198
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,160
more expanded and uh it feels large large mind big

199
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:12,000
mind expanded mind and and uh

200
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:19,200
and it's a little bit you know it's possible it's a little bit of an imagination because you know what the mind is in part

201
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:25,440
is a reconstructing apparatus it takes in all the data

202
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:31,359
that comes in from the senses and from our memory and all kinds of places

203
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:39,839
and it kind of shapes it constructs it in some kind of way um understands it it's an understanding

204
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:45,599
apparatus that we have and so whether there's actually space in the mind

205
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,800
that we're making or just feels that way we close our eyes and just feels like

206
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:57,520
there's a vast kind of maybe luminous darkness or light that might be there

207
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:05,119
or just uh without a sense of seeing just a felt sense of perception

208
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:10,839
being expansive and taking in things that are beyond the edges of our

209
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:17,200
body um not in some telepathic way but just kind of like the sensing that awareness is

210
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:23,680
open uh it and and it's not like focusing on anything at

211
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:30,560
all it's the absence of being concerned with anything that awareness the conscience still operates

212
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:37,359
but it's not eclipsed by our concerns

213
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:44,160
and so the mind that's not always relating to things is a mind that starts feeling

214
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,760
qualitatively different there's a deeper level of peace deeper level of calm

215
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,280
ease spaciousness stillness silence that

216
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:01,520
starts to be a shift when the mind is not always incessantly relating to something

217
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:08,079
and so to learn to recognize that shift and for each person will be different and so hopefully giving enough different

218
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:15,200
words that some of you will find different words work better than others but there is a shift

219
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:23,520
from uh from to something that feels more healthy more satisfying more free partly because

220
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:30,240
a lot of the unhealthy not all everything but a lot of the unhealthy ways in which the mind

221
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:36,320
operates the ways that we suffer and feel anxiety and feel

222
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:42,240
you know caught in desire and ill will and confusion

223
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:49,440
a lot of that the condition that makes that happen is our rumination our preoccupation and

224
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,359
things and it kind of we're spinning tales stories ideas

225
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:59,599
telling ourselves things that are kind of uh

226
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,480
deflating to tell ourselves things these same things over and over again and

227
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:13,760
reminding ourselves of stories that are painful and ideas that are painful but when we stop doing that

228
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,359
stop being in the world of thoughts and ideas and aboutness

229
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:26,960
then the mind doesn't have that stress anymore and it turns out the mind without stress

230
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,560
feels very satisfying very peaceful nothing has to change in the world

231
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:40,240
except how we relate to everything and um and how we hold things

232
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:46,320
in the mind in awareness so there becomes a radical shift as we begin recognizing the quality of the

233
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,359
mind at some point we can recognize the quality of the mind that's not

234
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:56,480
preoccupied not focused on things and being always relating to things

235
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:02,560
and this mind then is some people say it's receptive open receptive mind open

236
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:08,960
mind open awareness the the mind now is maybe not the mind

237
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:16,880
people say it's more like awareness more like consciousness more like um you know

238
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,000
and they can feel boundless they can feel like it has no limit

239
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,200
so the buddha says one can know that the mind is large

240
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:34,320
or we could know that it's not large but that it's that it's small still maybe because it's preoccupied but at

241
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:41,200
some point you can actually watch it sometimes uh oscillate between becoming large and we're not stable in that

242
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:46,560
settled mind and so then we some wonderful thought arises and we

243
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:52,800
get involved in it and then when there's a wherewithal you can actually feel and see how things got contracted and narrow

244
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,720
again maybe some people even find it darker the light goes out as we get involved in these thoughts

245
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,640
but if we're pretty settled it might be easy to let go of it and then we come back to this larger more luminous and

246
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:10,880
spacious mind as this develops further

247
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:17,839
the buddha says that in its instructions he talks about a mind that is

248
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:24,400
that that feels as if it has some it's with a ultimate feeling

249
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:30,960
kind of ultimate state it feels this or maybe the ultimate maybe not the right word but it could also mean higher

250
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,880
now we're into a higher state of being a higher state of mind something that's really

251
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:43,119
exalted or special or maybe special is good and now it's with something special

252
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:50,400
and um and and the mind feels really good and we know it there's a clear knowing of that wow this is there's a

253
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:57,440
purity there's a clarity there's a crispness there's a freedom there's a piece here that is qualitatively

254
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,560
different so now this this is a mind with a high quality

255
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:08,000
however with how the traditional understanding of this is there can be a

256
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:14,079
wonderful feeling sense that as as high as quality of mind as

257
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:20,960
this is it's not the highest potential and the highest potential is a mind

258
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:26,400
which is called unsurpassable and this is when

259
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:32,839
when there's no duality or no separation between

260
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:38,000
knowing the mind is special and

261
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,480
and and no separate from the knowing of it and the special mind itself they become

262
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,680
one and the same almost that the knowing is so special and is no different than

263
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:55,040
what the mind is so all this ability in the third

264
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,160
foundation to really get into it it's a

265
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:07,119
it's a description of what happens when the mind is settled and concentrated and mindfulness is

266
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:12,880
strong and so uh don't feel like you have to be there or this is you you're you know

267
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:18,400
you're you're a poor meditator if you don't know what i'm recognize what i'm talking about

268
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,760
but it's good to know the description of the of the map of what can happen in meditation

269
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:30,720
because some point you might touch into something like this oh this is what the text is talking about ah now i

270
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:37,119
understand now i i see it rather than being like what's this and what do i do with this

271
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:43,839
so the mind the heart consciousness

272
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:50,880
it's one of the precious things and the the our whole there's a paradigm shift

273
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,800
in how we live fully and completely in this life when we know

274
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:03,920
there's a new game in town the old game was always to be concerned about things and always relating to

275
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:10,000
things as if that's the only game in town it's a fine game at times and we're not rejecting it

276
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,400
but now we know there's another game there's another paradigm of how to be and it's possible to be

277
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:24,640
a mind that's receptive aware conscious for sure but it's not locking into things lobbing on it's not

278
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:32,240
organizing itself to be focused and relating to things all the time but it is receptive and can still know

279
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:39,280
and it allows for some deeper response from within than can happen if we're only responding

280
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,240
from the paradigm of relating relating and relatedness

281
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:51,280
so uh hopefully this makes sense and if not just store it away and someday maybe it

282
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:57,119
will and so we'll have one more day on this teach buddhist teachings on the third

283
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:02,160
foundation and i look forward to our time tomorrow

284
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,318
thank you
