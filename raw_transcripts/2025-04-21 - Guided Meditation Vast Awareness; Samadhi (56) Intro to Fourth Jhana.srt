1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:07,960
so hello and welcome to this uh meditation

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:15,960
session and as I as we begin a few words of introduction that

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,720
uh there are various perspectives that come into play

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:29,199
in samadei the deepening of practice and different states of mind bring to bring

5
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,280
to mind different images different

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:42,280
sensibilities and different images can evoke or give us a feeling

7
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:50,960
for what uh different states of samadei meditation are like and today uh to introduce this

8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:58,120
week's uh topic which is the fourth jam the image I'd like to offer

9
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:04,360
you is uh being in some place in nature maybe on a

10
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:13,920
mountaintop maybe on a vast expanse of plains maybe on a hilltop or something

11
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:21,479
where maybe the vast plateau um seems to go almost to the

12
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:27,200
horizon and um and uh it just feels like

13
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:35,400
there's tremendous space tremendous openness tremendous uh

14
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:41,799
clarity and uh and some there does something to many

15
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:49,600
people's sensibility that it's captivating it's interesting it's uh something very

16
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:56,439
special happens when we get a sense of the grander or the majesty the

17
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:04,799
expansiveness of some part of this earth that we live in um maybe it's somewhat akin maybe but

18
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,399
different I believe to looking deep into the night sky and imagining the vastness

19
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:16,640
of the stars and the universe the difference is that uh from a

20
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,560
mountain type kind of over overlooking a vast expanse of the earth with the space

21
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:31,920
above there's a maybe a feeling of um of being part of this earth maybe a feeling

22
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,000
of kind of a lucid awareness uh that almost doesn't call attention to

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
itself because the vastness the majesty of the of the vista

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,280
is what frees the mind frees the the eyes

25
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,560
from staring at any one thing the mind doesn't get preoccupied

26
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:01,879
by anything but rather the eyes float gently in their sockets and just

27
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:07,040
roam taking in the vastness certainly seeing the distant

28
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,080
mountains the distant plains the clouds

29
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,640
the birds but there's a way in which the eyes get very

30
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:24,840
soft easeful relaxed with nothing being fixated

31
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,840
on a kind of lucid awareness so with that as an

32
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:38,000
image to sit in a meditation posture and feel

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,400
yourself imagine yourself sitting like a

34
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,040
mountain or if you're lying down

35
00:03:52,040 --> 00:04:00,159
imagine that you are on a laying on the on a high

36
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:06,680
mountain ridge you are the

37
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:13,120
mountain mountain ridge solid and

38
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:24,320
stable feel the stability of your body against whatever surface is

39
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:32,479
holding it up and to gently close your

40
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:42,080
eyes and then in harmony with some inner

41
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:52,479
stability weight the substantiality of this

42
00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:00,720
body in a speed and a fullness that's in harmony with it all gently take a few

43
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,199
fuller breaths and as you exhale relax and

44
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:15,560
settle into this mountain settle into the stability of here

45
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,560
and letting your breathing return to

46
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:50,160
normal and on the exhale continue a process of

47
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:57,639
relaxing softening in the body

48
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,280
to be on top of a mountain in a strong wind is not so

49
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:25,880
pleasant but the winds can quiet and even stop

50
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:34,639
and to let the winds of the mind become quiet and slow

51
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:47,280
down the energy and activation of thinking the tension associated with

52
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,639
thinking the movements in the mind that is thinking

53
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:07,479
As you exhale softening relaxing the thinking mind

54
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:34,520
as you sit quietly soften your

55
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,599
eyes as if the eyes could rest in their

56
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:54,280
sockets freeing the eyes in whatever way that they want to float

57
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:59,000
and in their eye sockets

58
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:21,599
and settling the awareness into the body

59
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:37,360
breathing the movements of the body as you breathe the sensations that appear and

60
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,320
disappear as you breathe

61
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,880
and let your awareness of the shifting changing sensations of

62
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:09,480
breath be relaxed soft as if you're on a great

63
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:17,440
mountain watching but not fixating on anything

64
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:28,000
floating or you're looking at a flowing river and the eyes again are soft

65
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,160
relaxed not focusing on anything awareness floats and dances on

66
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,080
top of the river of breathing

67
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,479
and breathing [Music]

68
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:18,640
occurs surrounded by a space spaciousness openness

69
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:25,560
surrounded by kind of a lucid awareness

70
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:51,000
even if there are thinking going on there's something else that's more

71
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,360
important than whatever you're thinking

72
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:02,360
about this the broad

73
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:11,240
view lucid a awareness of the body

74
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,240
breathing of the relaxed

75
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,800
awareness that is not defined by anything it's aware

76
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,320
of but roams and

77
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:43,040
floats gently touches is whatever comes into

78
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:52,640
awareness and that floating can be on the river of sensations associated with

79
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:58,800
breathing or it could be broader

80
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:02,800
wider where the whole

81
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,120
body becomes the field

82
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,000
of awareness

83
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,440
one breath at a time

84
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:09,760
in gazing across a vast vista from a mountaintop or the edge of

85
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:16,360
the shore of the ocean the eyes roam

86
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:23,720
and open to take the vastness

87
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:30,399
in without being for or against anything that's there in the

88
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,519
eyesight in the majesty of

89
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:43,160
this overview of vast space of the

90
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:50,720
earth the details of what's happening recede from the judging mind

91
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,600
preoccupied mind

92
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,440
vast space vast

93
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:07,360
view taken in an elucid

94
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,959
awareness where it's all part of nature it's

95
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:24,880
all seen without for against without wanting and not wanting

96
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:32,480
all things are allowed to be

97
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,920
appreciating relaxed open

98
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:49,079
awareness in which all things come and go

99
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:03,120
if you are thinking feel your way beyond the edges

100
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,600
of your thoughts

101
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:16,679
just feel your way to the spaciousness the

102
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:22,720
openness that's beyond the narrowness

103
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,480
tightness of

104
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:31,919
preoccupation

105
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:47,120
feeling the spaciousness or openness on the edges of your

106
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:58,840
body a spaciousness openness which contains no thinking

107
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,720
even if there's thinking in the

108
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:14,399
background and feeling in your

109
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,640
body the silence in which the body

110
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:27,120
operates even if your mind is thinking thoughts let them be in the background

111
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:34,279
fading away each thought allowed to

112
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:41,840
fade as it appears but centered on the silence of

113
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:48,158
the body the awareness which is silent

114
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:59,039
nonverbal a silence that saturates permeates the

115
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:12,760
body a spaciousness that saturates permeates the body

116
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,039
allowing your awareness to gently float or

117
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:31,600
roam in the spaciousness in the silence not picking up anything or

118
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,480
fixating on anything

119
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:03,080
and even if your mind or mindfulness is not so

120
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:11,480
clear is there a way in which there's clarity ity in spaciousness in the

121
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:19,039
silence the stillness that's here in which awareness

122
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:36,320
floats perhaps a field of lucid

123
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,960
awareness an awareness that in and of

124
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:52,200
itself is not reactive not for or against

125
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:58,840
allows all things to be

126
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:05,640
themselves as the sky allows a cloud to be itself

127
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:28,559
and then coming to the end of the sitting maybe

128
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:36,960
imagining awareness is a wide field that extends way beyond the body

129
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,039
so that with awareness with your

130
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:48,960
imagination you consider how to be with

131
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:54,919
others that radically fully allows them to be as they

132
00:28:54,919 --> 00:29:01,039
are in the way a sky allows a cloud to just be

133
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:06,840
itself not wanting anything from it

134
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:18,520
not reacting to it and an awareness with which you're

135
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:27,159
independent free of others vast awareness that holds all

136
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:31,600
people in the space in the

137
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:45,039
stillness that can be the medium for your care your kindness your

138
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:52,440
love that's unruffled unafraid

139
00:29:56,039 --> 00:30:05,080
unresisting wishing with a magnanimous mind and heart may all beings be

140
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:10,360
happy may all beings be

141
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,960
safe may all beings be

142
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:21,080
peaceful may all beings be free

143
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:29,799
and as a minimum may I provide these things for

144
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:35,000
others in how I hold them in my

145
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,440
awareness how I hold them in my heart may all

146
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,679
beings be happy

147
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:56,710
[Music]

148
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,919
thank you

149
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:56,279
so hello and welcome to this

150
00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:02,200
Monday beginning of the week continu continuity continuation

151
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:10,000
of samadei the theme of samadei and today this week we begin the fourth

152
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:19,120
Janna which is in some some ways of understanding the the deepest of the the

153
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:26,480
Janna sometimes there's a list of eight Janna but in the teachings of the Buddha

154
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,440
uh the final four he calls uh the four

155
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:42,480
bases the four kind of uh fields maybe and um and

156
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:48,600
the what's called Janna is reserved for just these first four and but then

157
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:56,000
colloally people have because there's even these are the next four are even deeper states um that they call them all

158
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,960
all four Janna all all eight of them are called Janna but uh we come to a very

159
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:11,760
significant step in the Buddha's teachings around the fourth Janna because it's a a time when the mind is

160
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:19,840
most malleable most ready most um at ease

161
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,880
so that it's not there's no lingering clinging anymore there's no lingering

162
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:31,720
uh resistance or pushing or um

163
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:40,159
preoccupation and so the mind has gotten very aquamous very peaceful and it sets the stage for being

164
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:46,480
able to have deep insight and for that insight to be

165
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:55,519
liberating now there's very little filters of concepts ideas that uh stories that with

166
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:04,640
which we experience ourselves there's a lot of equinimity a lot of ease with what we how we are and

167
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:11,358
that combination allows for insights to happen uh and the mind is just ready to

168
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:20,599
uh just kind of um receive that in a dissolving opening way to to so that all

169
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:29,520
clinging and it's some radical deep way can let go and that deep letting go uh is the

170
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,720
ultimate purpose of going through these Janna it's not the purpose is not the

171
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:41,919
Janna themselves so I want to be a little bit careful not to overvalue the importance of these they serve they

172
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:50,000
serve a a purpose and the purpose is freedom and that freedom can be attained

173
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,839
other ways besides the Jonas so it's a little bit important not to over

174
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:04,640
prioritize or feel like we have to experience these but at the same time it's remarkable that these are h part of

175
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:10,960
our human potential and uh and they create a tremendous feeling of beauty the fourth

176
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,960
gen is considered to be the most beautiful of it all so the experience of the most probably one of the most

177
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:24,720
beautiful things we can experience in life and um it provides phenomenal peace

178
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:32,320
and a reorientation a healing uh quite quite a wonderful uh experience to be

179
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:39,280
had so on one hand we don't want to strive for it we don't want to measure ourselves by it that spiritual success

180
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:46,480
is only had by attaining these things that then we're somehow you know the best meditator on our block and we can

181
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,920
get lots of status for it so we don't that's that's all extra at the same time

182
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,760
we don't want to uh dismiss them as unimportant or that they don't exist i

183
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:03,240
remember when I was many years ago when I was a a graduate student in Buddhist

184
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:10,880
studies there were professors who um didn't believe in Janna they thought they literally the language coming from

185
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:19,839
a borrowing from a Buddhist scholar from the 1930s that Janna were um the overactive

186
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:27,680
fantasies imagination of starving aesthetics and um and uh so it just

187
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:33,599
seems so far-fetched from what uh they could imagine was humanly possible

188
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:41,400
but it is possible to dip into these Janna they is possible to experience them and and they are far from

189
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:48,079
imagination in fact these are uh uh uh almost the opposite of imagination it's

190
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:53,280
when imagination drops away sometimes they're called it in the in the old

191
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,640
school of translators uh they're called transances and these are not transances

192
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:07,119
these are the almost like the opposite of trance this is uh when the mind wakes up in a lucid and clear way and uh

193
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:13,280
there's very little that the mind is aware of in these states so that can give impression maybe it's a kind of a

194
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:19,200
trance a disconnection but uh it's not actually it's a more of a we're more

195
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:25,040
deeply connected to life to the experience of being alive than we are

196
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,480
when we have a lot of thoughts and ideas in which we're navigating the ideas the

197
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,839
thoughts um and some people who are living a very active life in the world

198
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:42,000
are mostly living in their imagination and Um and that's where

199
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,880
imagination can can interfere with our experience of of freedom of deep

200
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:53,520
spirituality and so these uh these Janna where the imagination quiets down and

201
00:37:53,520 --> 00:38:00,000
stills and there's very little thinking uh the mind becomes elucid kind of a

202
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:07,640
lucid awareness and uh where very little else is going on uh partly because we're

203
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:12,800
not focusing on our sense we're not focusing on hearing and listening and

204
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:20,880
hearing and smelling and tasting and all this and even to some degree we're not focusing on sensing the body uh uh when

205
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,240
there's no focus there's no tightening of the mind narrowing the mind to to

206
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:35,040
focus on anything in particular it's more like we're floating in this vast sea in the of lake of the third Janna

207
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:40,800
but where now the even the water disappears and the we'll see tomorrow

208
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:48,880
the metaphor of the of the fourth Janna is someone um uh sitting uh meditating

209
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:55,520
in the open air um in a particular way so the softness

210
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:04,640
and the refreshment of water is even fallen away and in some ways you just feel so free and light to u be in the

211
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:10,480
open air now in this deep meditative way uh and even that so even the sense of

212
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:17,280
the body in this is not there in the usual way so it's a kind of a lucid awareness

213
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:23,760
that's very aquamous very peaceful and uh in both the third and

214
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,839
the fourth Janna there is um

215
00:39:28,839 --> 00:39:34,880
um equinimity but it seems that in the third Janna the equinimity has a little

216
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:41,680
bit more substance its own thing in the fourth Janna uh uh awareness and

217
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:49,960
equinimity uh are almost are the same thing just about the same thing it's like a compound word um

218
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:57,560
uh quantumous awareness aware equinimity it's just this uh uh it there's

219
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:05,280
no texture there's no flavor there's no substance to either

220
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,320
the awareness or the equinimity it's and you can almost not say it's a thing it's

221
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:19,599
almost like what's left in the absence of in great space can you say that um as the sky is

222
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:25,040
a quantumous as a bird flies through it i mean we don't attribute

223
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:31,920
consciousness to the sky but um the mind doesn't react to it but the mind holds

224
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:37,359
it it's like you don't equinimity is not a thing that is done it's just that

225
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:43,280
there's no movement of reactivity whatsoever so it's called aquatamus

226
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:52,240
awareness aware aware equinimity so I'll read to you the the description and um

227
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:57,839
the description of the of the fourth Janna and the metaphor are shorter than

228
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:03,319
the earlier three Jas and that's maybe appropriate given that

229
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:08,599
um uh there's so so little happening now it's so little to

230
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:16,079
describe so letting go of pleasure and pain how do you let go of pleasure and

231
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:22,560
pain that's a that's like a what that doesn't make any sense you either you have pleasure and pain but if you

232
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:29,920
have pleasure and pain can you let go of it well certainly the mind can let go of its orientation preoccupation

233
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:37,640
um with it letting go of pleasure and pre pain with a

234
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:44,680
disappearance of mental happiness and mental

235
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:53,760
suffering so this is a kind something very different is going on here there's no pleasure and pain no mental happiness

236
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:00,200
and suffering at all in this state one enters and

237
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:06,520
abides in the purity of a quantimous awareness of the fourth

238
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:13,440
Janna and so the only description of the fourth Janna is the absence of happiness

239
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:20,560
mental happiness and mental um suffering a phenomenal state to be in there's no

240
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:27,680
suffering whatsoever and there's no pain and no pleasure now is this is can be

241
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:35,359
seem like very dull you know there's nothing but um this is one of the most sublime

242
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:41,040
peaceful feelings of well-being that is possible for human being and so the

243
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:47,359
description maybe it doesn't you have to almost experience to see oh this is good

244
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:53,200
um one abides in the in the purity of a quantumous awareness of the fourth Janna

245
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:59,119
one sits pervading this body with a pure clear mind so that no part of the entire

246
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:06,079
body is untouched by the pure clear mind so the word uh pure here some people

247
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:11,200
don't like to use it in their in this you know in their spiritual life um it

248
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:18,760
can also mean clean so um one sits pervading this body with a

249
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:27,599
pure with a clean clear mind and here mind means more like awareness um and uh

250
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:34,240
so the whole body is becomes almost like a field of awareness it's what it is and

251
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:39,520
it a feeling of being very clean very pure

252
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:46,359
um and clear this clear awareness so I like to call the awareness here lucid

253
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:52,640
awareness a field a state of vast clear awareness and what's the characteristic

254
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:58,880
of this field of clear awareness that spreads through the body um it's aquamus

255
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,599
and um it's clearly aware and

256
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:10,920
um and uh so that's the kind of classic description uh

257
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:16,640
and um the um so we'll go spend this this

258
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:21,920
week kind of going into it with a little bit more detail and look at the metaphor

259
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:27,599
and so forth and um and my hope is that

260
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:34,319
having done these now over 50 day sessions on samadei that as we go

261
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:39,680
into the fourth cha not expected to go into it but uh maybe there's some way

262
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:46,720
that uh uh you can you can kind of feel the edges of it or kind of feel some

263
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:52,560
qualities of it that um uh give you a sense of what this might be when it's

264
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,839
complete and and um and if not that I hope it's at

265
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:03,319
least inspiring that this is a potential for each person's heart and

266
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:09,400
mind so thank you very much and uh look forward to

267
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,400
um continuing
