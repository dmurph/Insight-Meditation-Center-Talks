1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:09,559
so um as I prepare to give this talk

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,480
it occurs to me to ask for your patience and your forgiveness

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,660
for what's going to talk about because I'm going to talk about something that I don't really think I

4
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,599
know much about and I'll probably say all kinds of

5
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,840
things which maybe are not maybe not even accurate and some of you will know more about this topic than me

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:41,280
and if I could shake your head and or you have particular perspectives on this topic from your particular studies

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,480
or something that what I end up saying might not fit that perspective and you'll shake your head

8
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:56,699
but the uh for all the mistakes I make uh my wish from giving this talk is to

9
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:03,719
provide you with a heightened attention to this topic and to be able to think about it spend

10
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:10,799
time with it talk to friends about it maybe see if there's other perspectives for this topic that might be useful of

11
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:18,840
how you live your life so uh the topic is time

12
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,540
time what is time I don't even I don't even know how to

13
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:31,340
answer that question very well but I I live in time all the time

14
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:40,079
I suspect some of you do as well and uh it's possible to have many

15
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:47,280
relationships with time it's possible to be time rich and time

16
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,780
poor and just to say it that way suggests that time can be a wealth

17
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:01,079
and that's independent of material wealth it suggests that there's something very

18
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:07,740
valuable potentially about time that may be many of us live

19
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:13,020
in impoverished in time in how we live our lives

20
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,360
what would it like to be living time Rich to be wealthy in time

21
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,360
you have to wait until you're well and retired some people who retired find themselves

22
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:31,580
with even less time so that's no guarantee

23
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:39,180
and then uh I was reflecting about how we have all these terminologies around

24
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:46,080
time that we use and two of them that I'm thinking about is

25
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:54,599
taking time and giving time to something and you know taking time I mean that

26
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:59,840
seems kind of acquisitive once I started thinking about it we were taking time

27
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,160
for myself I take time for myself where do I take it do I keep it do I share it

28
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,980
what do you know what does it mean to take time exactly and uh but more more

29
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,200
importantly you know it's just an idiom but uh but you know it has other

30
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,480
associations to it taking time that maybe it goes along with certain kind of

31
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:27,239
self-centeredness what about giving time being is it

32
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:34,080
possible to have a generous relationship with time and uh and you you know it's and does

33
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,640
that provide a very different relationship to the world than the notion of taking time for something

34
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:46,019
many people say that uh time is really a useful resource to have time for

35
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:51,260
something allows healing to happen sometimes healing psychological healing

36
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:57,659
requires amount of time to for it to happen time is useful for processing Our Lives

37
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:04,620
digesting our life the time is a really important quality if you want to be a wise person

38
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:11,640
I said I would suggest that um that if you don't have a lot of time

39
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:18,239
you're probably not going to have a lot of access to wisdom and one of the one of the

40
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:24,979
characteristics may be a foolish way of being in this world is to not

41
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,600
give enough time for what you do to do it well and then

42
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:37,680
you have to do it over again which takes more time there's a traffic sign here in Everett

43
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,520
City I don't know if it's still up that um that says something like late with the

44
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:52,460
question mark um you'll be later if you get a ticket

45
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:58,440
and so um so you know so

46
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,479
you know this rushing that people do is it really beneficial

47
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:09,479
you know or is it you know in the short term it seems like it's beneficial but what happens in the end I saw a car

48
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:14,580
accident in the freeway the other day and and I wondered if the person responsible

49
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,580
was in a hurry and

50
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,780
probably the person was going to be late now if the person was even alive there was

51
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:34,880
some question about that as I drove by so

52
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:41,400
a wise life is a life that has time for time

53
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,940
and what does that mean what does it mean to have time for time

54
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,440
there are some people distinguish between a physical time and psychological time

55
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,979
and so we could do that I that might be useful to think about cultural time

56
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:08,940
and spiritual time so at least you know four categories of time and physical time has to do with some

57
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:14,340
physical event in the world which measures the duration of

58
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:19,800
of time measure some duration for measure for some way of measuring change

59
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,039
sequentially and so

60
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,720
there was a time when people measured the months by the sequence of the moon

61
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:37,139
lunar time and now we have this Roman time that it was kind of made up by the

62
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:42,300
Romans in some kind of funny way that we're still kind of trying to Grapple with

63
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:48,960
and uh and it's very confused time because September literally in Latin means the

64
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,120
seventh month October is the eighth month but for us these are the 9th and

65
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,580
tenth months and um and then you know so November is the

66
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:05,780
ninth month and December is a tenth month but you know so like we're just confused

67
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,919
and um so so

68
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:16,860
um physical time so we have um uh you know the calendar time

69
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:23,340
that we live in and uh for example the year and the year it lends itself to kind of

70
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:28,380
a cyclic idea of time but also we have this linear idea of time that from the

71
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:35,340
past to the Future the there's atomic time that's used now for measuring things and so it's all

72
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:41,819
kind of physical time is something where we can measure psychological time is the time that our

73
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:47,819
mind somehow calculates or lives in and works in and it's amazing that our mind can in

74
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:53,520
certain kinds of ways measure duration of time between events

75
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,940
and apparently they have never discovered any place in the brain that is the time keeper it's some kind of an

76
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:06,120
intuitive sense maybe a way of looking at patterns of things that the patterning of the Mind as it coordinates

77
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:13,919
can get a sense and so for example the time it takes for a beach ball to reach you

78
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,919
is very different in the time for a baseball to reach you when you're at that

79
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:26,759
and so in a you know baseball player has to have a very acute sense of how long it takes for that ball to get over over

80
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:32,820
home base and if you don't have the right timing you've missed the ball

81
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:40,020
and a beach ball flies through the air and sometimes you can just keep your hands in your pockets for a second or so

82
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:45,839
because you know it's like taking its time to float there to you um but you know the volleyball that

83
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,600
comes over the net you better be on it you know quickly so that somehow you don't you don't pull

84
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,820
out your stopwatch and calculate you know and you're you know you have smartphones now so we can probably do

85
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:04,260
all kinds of calculations there's no time to do the calculations and let alone figure out the physics of time and

86
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:10,440
weight and mass and all these things that have to be calculated to figure out when the object's going to reach you

87
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,899
and is it going to reach you it's going to reach you on your left or the right or higher or lower

88
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:21,240
and the mind has this amazing capacity to have a sense of the duration it takes

89
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:27,120
the time it takes for things to come without any us consciously calculating

90
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:34,019
it so the mind has a capacity for for you know figuring out something about time

91
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:39,660
and um and uh and also they say that people can

92
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,700
have a spatial sense of time and uh what's interesting is that people

93
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:53,339
at different peoples in the world cultures have very different ideas of what how they imagine time spatially

94
00:09:53,339 --> 00:10:00,420
so for example I think in most English-speaking books where they're going to do a chronology of History

95
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:06,120
it goes from left to right the the old times is in the left and you

96
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:12,420
get you know into the future and then maybe if Arrow that's pointing to the right for the future

97
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:18,360
in um then maybe that makes some sense because we or we read from that direction

98
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:24,899
cultures that read in the other direction they actually see time as going to the

99
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:33,720
left and and I heard that what what do you mean to the left that can't be

100
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:40,800
and um and uh and what's interesting about also about this is this is the reference

101
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,680
point for this image of time is personal it has to do with your phys your body

102
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,720
left and right kind of there are some cultures who don't use the left and

103
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:58,920
right which is a bodily personal reference point but they used things in nature there's

104
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:04,940
places in the world where um uh islands and people live on where

105
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:10,079
the the future is it up the mountain

106
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:16,320
Where the River comes from and the past is the ocean where the

107
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,019
river goes to and so it's the source it's the source of everything is in the future in a

108
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:29,040
certain way and uh and then it goes to a place where there's a big repository you know the big repository for the past the past

109
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,200
contains so much have you noticed that and and you're contributing to making it

110
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:41,820
bigger and bigger and um so um so that's kind of interesting that

111
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:48,120
so so no matter where you are on the mountain whatever Direction you're facing they always have a sense that you

112
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:54,120
know if they're going to talk about the the future they point up and um

113
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:00,600
and uh in some of the aboriginals in Australia

114
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,600
um you know I think for many of us but some of us if we were given a whole series of

115
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:13,279
photographs of ourselves over our lifetime and were told to put them in chronological order

116
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:20,519
many of here in the in America at least in the west would probably do it uh you know for again from left to right baby

117
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:29,399
pictures on the left and you know whatever age you are lately closer to the right

118
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:35,279
and um yeah apparently some aboriginals in Australia are just they're asked and

119
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:41,100
they always do it from Westie from I think it's from east to west

120
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,200
I guess where the sun comes up and it goes and then it goes down and so no

121
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:51,540
matter what direction there's wherever they're sitting whatever Direction they are uh if they're if they're sitting

122
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:58,740
pointing south or they're putting North they always have a sense of where East and West is and they'll lay out the

123
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:05,519
chronology in that way so these people with the mountain and the ocean and and the East and the West

124
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:11,579
sense they're not measuring time from the personal reference point

125
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:18,600
that people in the western cultures are often doing the right and left which is always personal in some way it has to do

126
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,060
with the body and our hands and how we see things does it make a difference

127
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:29,639
that we have this anthropocentric Centric idea of time uh directionality

128
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:36,360
for time spatial idea of time and or having some some reference point in nature that's beyond our anthropocentric

129
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:42,000
concerns I don't know if it makes any difference but it does show it does show that we

130
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
have different senses of slime ideas of time concepts of time

131
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,880
I asked a friend recently yesterday about this thing about left and right

132
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:59,940
you know where does she see time and she thought to me no a time comes at me it

133
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:06,240
kind of goes through her from the future it comes directly at her and through and and one way I think of time is as an

134
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:13,860
hourglass and I think sometimes that time comes from above and goes through The Hourglass this big funnel and then

135
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:20,399
it goes out again at the bottom and I'm sitting at the neck of The Hourglass and I'm sitting that's

136
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,940
what I watch everything going through the neck of my experience

137
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:33,899
so um psychological time but psychological time is also related to cultural time

138
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:39,360
and we live part of the burden we have in living under time is had a lot to do

139
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,420
with our cultures we we we're living in the legacy of in the industrial revolution

140
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:52,260
there that's when really strict ideas of time through the day really became institutionalized

141
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:57,360
and from uh because they had all these shifts in the industries that were being

142
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,000
built as huge manufacturing places and they would have these horns that would blow and people would know when their

143
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,360
shift stopped and started and they had to show up all at the right time and and so it became much more regimented than

144
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:16,560
it had been before before there was just big Industries and big groups of people to organize and then from what I read is it from the

145
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,680
industrial example of how they organized time that was translated or applied to

146
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:28,440
the school systems and I don't know if before the Industrial Revolution how time was at

147
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,899
school but um certainly at the time of the Industrial Revolution it became clear to

148
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:41,519
the industrial countries that it was important to educate people to make them prepared for this industrial world that

149
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:47,519
we were growing into so then there was massive movement to educate people and they borrowed you know very you know

150
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:54,720
again we know some some of us know this very regimented idea of time that the students have to live under

151
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:01,920
is that healthy to do that is that useful to do that I met a kid up in Islands outside of Vancouver some years

152
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:08,760
ago who had never been to school and he'd lived on a farm and his parents

153
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:15,060
would never required him to go to school and and I don't think they made any particular efforts to educate him either

154
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:22,079
and uh and he just kind of roamed around and worked on the farm a lot and he seemed very smart and knowledgeable and

155
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:29,699
engaged and seemed like a really fantastic lovely person but had never been put under the

156
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:35,579
pressures of this and you know regimented time that so many of us I believe have probably

157
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:41,040
lived under I've lived in different cultural times a

158
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:47,040
fascinating time for me was I lived in a Zen monasteries that used a Time system

159
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:53,639
from long ago in Japan maybe China which was a five-day week

160
00:16:53,639 --> 00:17:00,420
and and so it was measured by the days of the month so there were there you

161
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:07,500
know there was the one days the two days the three days the four days and the five days and you know and um

162
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:13,980
so one two it was right for nine days uh I think we worked one

163
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:19,740
two three four I think we worked three days and then the fourth day was off is that right that works and then uh five

164
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:26,880
six seven eight no no I think there were zero days right so there was four we worked for four days uh then we had a

165
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:33,299
zero in it uh and then one two three and then the fourth day was off and then

166
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:38,400
five six seven eight and the ninth day was off so we would talk about four or nine days

167
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,880
like some people talk about weekends we would talk about four or nine days so rather than having two days off we

168
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,059
would have one day off and then go back to work for four days or to beat the monastery schedule

169
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:56,220
and it was fascinating to live in this alternative sequence of time and I lost

170
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:02,580
touch with what days of the week it was days of the week were irrelevant and I didn't know it was Sunday or

171
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:09,299
Monday or you know because I just knew that the date because it was all by the date

172
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:15,419
foreign so that was interesting and then I've done long retreats where I had no idea

173
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:23,120
what day or month it was you know just that that kind of concern just completely dropped away

174
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,740
I I lived on a farm for a while and I loved living on the farm for a number of

175
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:34,980
reasons but one of the reasons was time wasn't regimated

176
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:41,760
the work time and off time and play time were kind of flowed kind of seamlessly

177
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:48,480
between each other we would go out and work in the fields or take care of the cows and then we would have time off and

178
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,640
do something but it was never planned it was never um

179
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,919
you know strict but rather has a wonderful organic feeling just flowing

180
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:04,380
between what we were doing um the only thing that was a little bit strict was uh

181
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:11,100
um by Dawn you had to have milk the cows and by dusk you had to have brought them back to milk them but that was you know

182
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:16,340
following the light um and um

183
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:22,500
so to have that experience or this fluidity of schedules between personal

184
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:29,660
time and work time and having it so porous was really a fascinating thing for me

185
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:35,059
and then we have spiritual time and what is spiritual time

186
00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:41,059
I think that you know there's a kind of a common

187
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:47,400
story of going to some wise spiritual person and

188
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:52,799
saying you know what's the most important time and the answer is now

189
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:59,100
now is the most important time and we have a spiritual practice this

190
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:05,160
Insight Meditation practice that is really based on being firmly rooted

191
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:12,720
grounded in the present in the now an important part of that practice of

192
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,960
attempting to be in the now is to discover how difficult that is

193
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,080
and how difficult it is because of concerns about other times the the concerns about the future

194
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,840
concerns about the past and and how difficult it is to be

195
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:36,660
resting or or or alive or feeling a sense of

196
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:43,740
real kind of um uh attentional vitality

197
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:49,080
to this moment here without a need to leave it behind without a leave to kind

198
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:55,020
of lose track of it by our distractions and our thinking mind or are rushing around

199
00:20:55,020 --> 00:21:00,660
and um and so we start discovering how for that challenge we have with the present moment

200
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:06,380
and some people attribute that challenge to the challenge of a distracted mind

201
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:12,000
some people have the challenge of having a full schedule of things to do or a

202
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,820
long to-do list but it's also a challenge of

203
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:24,360
um you know our relationship to time and maybe not understanding how valuable

204
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:33,179
the present moment is how much is available here I think of uh you know if we have the

205
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:41,760
time being a timeline where it's it's a line from at least here in California from left to right

206
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,039
that a line is impoverished it's just a very

207
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:54,780
thin narrow and rather than the present moment being a DOT on that

208
00:21:54,780 --> 00:22:00,299
um the present moment is not even an axis that goes through it that makes it

209
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:06,659
two-dimensional the present moment is three-dimensional or there's maybe there's more Dimensions

210
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:12,059
I don't know but um three dimensions it's it's you know as opposed to there's

211
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:19,260
something about the past and the future that maybe fits into a line but the present I think is

212
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:26,820
three-dimensional it's a difference between going from a black and white movie to a a color movie

213
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:35,600
it's you know that dramatic if you're old enough you remembered Wizard of Oz going that direction

214
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:41,580
suddenly it's alive and um so um

215
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:48,840
so this spiritual time I propose has a lot to do with our

216
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:55,620
relationship to present moment time the time that's unfolding Here and Now

217
00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:02,820
and that that's the three-dimensional which means that it's never a DOT

218
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:10,140
little pixelated dot that you you know you've passed through quickly that spiritual now

219
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:15,960
is has a duration and how long is the duration

220
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:23,280
of the now if you're relaxed and present and really embodied or inhabiting the present

221
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,980
moment without any indicate any uh varying away into the past and future or

222
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:35,340
preoccupation fantasy but really here to experience this moment kind of in its fullness

223
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:40,620
three-dimensional fullness what's the duration of now

224
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:49,440
some of you probably never considered seriously how long is it now and how long is the moment is it is it

225
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:55,260
just like Snap the finger that's all it is a famous American philosopher

226
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:02,940
psychologist named William James I think it was him who talked about the Saddleback of the present moment

227
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:09,900
and the Saddleback means it's kind of like a u-shape and so the present moment somehow is in this you know maybe if

228
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:18,120
there's a timeline the present moment is like this u-shaped dip and um that uh you know that saddled

229
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:23,400
back that's it lasts for a while but how long is that while

230
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,440
and then we have spiritual people who want to talk about the Timeless now

231
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:37,519
what is a Timeless now and what good is it because if it's if it's timeless

232
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:44,280
if time measures change how do we deal with change if we're if

233
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:50,900
it's timeless well maybe time and Timeless can coexist

234
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,120
but what is this present moment that we have that we live in what's the duration of now

235
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,700
and it's possible by getting a sense of the

236
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,820
present moment now then this moment

237
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:15,720
that then we can start living in time and the expression living in time I

238
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:21,419
think has two delightful meanings one meaning is like comes from music

239
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:29,460
you know the music is in time I'm in time with the music and so living in harmony with uh with

240
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:35,640
time to be in time is not just to show up on time but to kind of be in harmony

241
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:41,279
or to be in the flow or find a rhythm with time as opposed to missing the

242
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:48,299
present moment I suspect most of us here have missed a lot of

243
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:53,700
moments they went by without us noticing and noticing them

244
00:25:53,700 --> 00:26:01,980
and and so to be in time in harmony with time but also to end time is kind of to

245
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:08,220
inhabit time as opposed to living under the weight of time

246
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:14,760
to live in time is more like a floating on the water

247
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:21,299
to to be in the water for most people is they're floating on the surface right because unless you're a scuba diver or

248
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:27,120
something or diving down for a few moments but uh to be in time to be floating on

249
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,059
time maybe time is weightless

250
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:38,279
as opposed to the weight of time what do we really weigh down by when you

251
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:45,419
talk about the weight of time because time is I think it's weightless last time I tried putting on the scale

252
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:49,100
and if time is weightless

253
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:57,539
and we have some intuitive sense of time the Mind does kind of construct a sense

254
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:03,779
of duration of time and a sense of time and but if it's weightless

255
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:09,419
and you're somehow can you feel that or sense that does that make a difference

256
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:16,080
or are is the preoccupations of the mind so strong that you're pulling away out of this

257
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:22,260
moment that you don't have time for this talk even I mean this is such a silly talk ridiculous

258
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:28,320
when you could you know probably be

259
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:35,039
figuring out what stocks to buy tomorrow or today I don't know if they've opened in the weekend something's open the

260
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:41,880
weekend to buy but um but to be in time

261
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:48,600
and uh and then in time and be present for the duration of the present the

262
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:56,659
moment now and how long is the moment for you sometimes I've thought that my moments

263
00:27:56,659 --> 00:28:02,880
last about as long as I say it takes to say the word now

264
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:09,299
sometimes now is the duration of how long is to happen how long it is for me to have an in-breath

265
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:14,640
that's that's duration of a now and and

266
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:22,200
sometimes I have a sense of some Timeless now Timeless presence but generally doesn't

267
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:29,460
last in theory it lasts outside of my being aware of it

268
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:36,480
but it is there time is there timelessness if we're not aware

269
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,640
is there does the tree that falls in the forest make a sound if there's no one to hear

270
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:48,720
it is there time if there's no one to be aware of time

271
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,480
and uh and I I think not at least spiritually there's a way in which we

272
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,840
could talk about awareness time where awareness and time are inseparable

273
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:08,419
they kind of arise together and so this richness this three-dimensionality of time

274
00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:13,980
awareness time what is it what's the time in which we're aware

275
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:21,600
what's the awareness that exists in time the awareness that exists in time can

276
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,700
only exist in the present your awareness which such an important

277
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:34,080
part of this practice cannot exist in the past it's gone there's no there's no awareness the only

278
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,299
awareness of the of the past is our memory and we're aware of the memories

279
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:44,340
the only awareness we have of the future is our prediction

280
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:51,299
and and forecasting the future which again is the world of we can be aware of those thoughts and ideas

281
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:58,740
but to be aware of time is to be here and what are we aware of

282
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:05,700
it's fascinating that it's possible to be aware of the recognition of now

283
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:10,919
I'm in now I'm now I'm here and it has a beginning

284
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:15,740
and has a middle and that has an end

285
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:23,520
and then you do it again and again that somehow an act of awareness a clear

286
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:29,399
concise distinct recognition of the moment has a duration

287
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:35,279
that appears it's there for a while and then it disappears

288
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:42,360
what happens to time when you've the recognition of it has faded

289
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:48,299
away physical time you can go look at your watch and know exactly what happened

290
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:55,919
but um but this spiritual time the time that has spiritual time is time

291
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:02,220
that has time lots of time it's spacious time

292
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:07,500
that's where time becomes a richness a wealth

293
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:12,600
here where the mind is not rushing off

294
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:18,419
is not preoccupied where the Mind senses and feels

295
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:26,340
what's here is available for something that's different than what

296
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:32,240
we're controlling what we're directing what we're wanting

297
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:41,159
that doesn't fit into industrial time doesn't fit into even this kind of idea

298
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:49,140
of time that's very personally the spatial sense of it is very personal from left to right or right to left

299
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:54,740
to feel the time here now

300
00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:04,380
what is it to not live under the burden of time the pressures of time

301
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:10,140
what is it to live in a luxurious time and this is such a these are such

302
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:18,960
important questions for people doing this meditation practice because at least when you're meditating

303
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,720
that's the time to give yourself over to time

304
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:34,440
to live in time to live in the the time of this moment

305
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:40,140
here where awareness and time are coterminous

306
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:45,380
awareness and time arise together no separation

307
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:52,679
where there's no hard and fast measure of time requirements of time

308
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:59,399
where we can sense the comings and goings even of time in a sense the awareness of

309
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:05,100
time and um it's almost as if

310
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:11,399
you know there's a vast ocean if time is not a line but a

311
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:21,740
vast ocean two-dimensional surface and maybe the present moment is a wave

312
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:28,620
that somehow gets energized gets lifted up and has some prominence for a moment

313
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:34,140
and then the wave passes and and settles down again

314
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:41,820
and so what is that wave what is this coalescing or coming together or Rising

315
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:47,700
of um that happens here and now and this time now

316
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:52,919
what do you feel what do you experience what's available for you

317
00:33:52,919 --> 00:34:00,140
when you're living in time in the moment Here and Now

318
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:07,980
so I hope that these ideas and we'll give you something to think

319
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:13,080
about and to reflect on how might you have a new relationship

320
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:19,440
what is your relationship to time and is there a new way of seeing it and is there such a new way of

321
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,378
engaging in time when you're meditating

322
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:30,480
is there a way of living in a spiritual time or luxurious time a generous time

323
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:39,320
when you're meditating and what would it take to do that to have a sense of that to be in there

324
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,740
and um

325
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:49,700
and so

326
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:01,980
and I hope that this will support your meditation practice in a dramatic way

327
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:08,820
that kind of kind of opens up a new dimension of it that maybe you don't know it not so well attuned to because

328
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:13,920
we don't really give a lot of time to think about time

329
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,740
but to give time for Time Imagine That

330
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:25,980
give time for time so that's what I have

331
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:32,099
and maybe if some of you stay now for a discussion outside maybe we'll find out

332
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:38,160
if it sparked any interests questions Reflections on this topic or anything

333
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:46,338
else you want to bring up bring up so thank you all very much and um
