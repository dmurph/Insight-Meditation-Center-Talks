1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,859
been learning good day

2
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:14,599
hello everybody all right

3
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:21,859
I'm seeing the chat messages coming in so good morning everybody

4
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,920
so we'll get started

5
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,600
let me start my recording here

6
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:49,878
yeah warm greetings from everywhere good to be with you all

7
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,039
um hey my day here is

8
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:07,200
um Thursday so we're going to um move to another phase of our stonus and

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,979
the movement Journey and so today we'll be incorporating

10
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:19,759
maybe expanding from where we were uh in the Stillness and movement journey

11
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:26,780
to include the mind or the thinking mind

12
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,939
in our practice so maybe if you follow along uh we'll

13
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,640
begin right here where we are

14
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:47,060
I'm gonna give a sound for Belle to start

15
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,689
[Music]

16
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,580
Begin by entering into this body and mind

17
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:27,540
and heart maybe this entering as an orientation

18
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,280
of attorney inward

19
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,099
maybe there is a sense of immediacy

20
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:50,540
and sense of a presence coming forth

21
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,680
each morning we enter into this Temple

22
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,459
Temple of this body mind and heart

23
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:20,720
with the reverence with care

24
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,379
tenderness

25
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:54,560
Here and Now is where we enter

26
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,540
and in which to feel

27
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,500
settling into a posture

28
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,419
sitting lying down standing

29
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:35,660
on the posture that expresses a kind of an inner alignment

30
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,960
Inner Harmony

31
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:47,120
the inner commitment to the practice

32
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:03,560
maybe you're feeling the lower half of the body grounding on Earth

33
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,020
and torso is uplifted

34
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:32,400
there is a totality that combines

35
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,820
steadiness balance

36
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,300
and uplift wakefulness

37
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,080
right here

38
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:14,000
and right here may be already feeling a sense of a Stillness in the body

39
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:27,439
expressed in the pasture of the sitting

40
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,258
sitting like a mountain

41
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:54,240
maybe just a hint of it or a hint of a hint

42
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:03,440
possibility as one of my teachers often says

43
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:29,000
what's the fat sense of the body sitting here

44
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:38,960
Earth element solid

45
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:47,720
all moving grounding

46
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,479
the movements it's very natural to be felt

47
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:24,800
with the Stillness in the body being in the background

48
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,318
the movements of the breath

49
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:43,279
expansion and contraction of the Torso

50
00:08:52,500 --> 00:09:01,040
temperature change as you breathe in and out

51
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:19,800
like a breeze or sing through

52
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,060
a tall mountain

53
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,459
of the Stillness and the movements

54
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:41,540
are present

55
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,800
the flow of the breath enlightens

56
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:26,959
as a whole body giving life

57
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,480
it's such a Wonder

58
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,180
a life Mountain

59
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:06,779
you already notice the movements of the emotions bubbling up

60
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:09,779
Rippling

61
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:20,959
a sense of a Wonder sense of all

62
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,040
curiosity

63
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,040
the emotions may have a somatic imprints

64
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,940
or maybe bubbly energy in the body

65
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:12,120
that's related the joy happiness

66
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,380
in the emotions

67
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:25,220
feeling and sensing

68
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:33,920
the embodied field of emotions

69
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:47,899
maybe thoughts or coursing through

70
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,899
it's related to emotions

71
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:19,160
healing and sensing those movements in the mind

72
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:28,100
whether there are emotions or thoughts

73
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:42,079
and just different energy forms that we can feel

74
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,680
and sense

75
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,880
notice the feeling and sensing

76
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,500
as a flavor of quiet Stillness

77
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,399
right there

78
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,720
letting go of the stories

79
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,820
content of the thinking

80
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,779
resting in the felt sense

81
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:41,639
there is a Stillness in the body and Stillness

82
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:44,600
in the mind

83
00:15:53,339 --> 00:16:02,360
and there's a Stillness in the knowing in the feeling and sensing

84
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:14,779
and there is a movements in the body

85
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:23,760
movements in our mind emotions

86
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,760
thoughts

87
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:35,899
images words

88
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:55,339
without pushing or pulling

89
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:07,079
resting in the still quiet

90
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:10,760
field of knowing

91
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:45,620
Sensations in the body may be very different to right now

92
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:53,000
the breath has changed

93
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:20,460
being available to The Wonder of Our Lives

94
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,559
Right Here and Now

95
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:18,840
being available to the blossoming

96
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,640
of the inner being

97
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:29,880
without wanting

98
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:33,380
not wanting

99
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:44,520
references judgments

100
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:59,659
whatever is here in whatever form

101
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:11,340
and be received but I'm a kind loving

102
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,600
still filled

103
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:55,740
and sound May flow through the sound of my voice

104
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:59,480
the ambience sound

105
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:15,620
noticing the difference between the content of our thoughts

106
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:22,220
versus the felt sense of thinking

107
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:27,260
it's in the embodied field

108
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:49,460
winking we have a somatic energetic feel to it

109
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:56,039
it's present immediate

110
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:11,179
the mountain is often detached from the body

111
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:35,900
all that stuff out sense in the body right now

112
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:46,880
the in the movements movements of the breath

113
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:36,799
you know where some energetic shape shifts

114
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:46,380
as I transition from a quiet sitting

115
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,279
to talking

116
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:59,279
and as you shift I'm quiet sitting

117
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:06,860
to listening listening to the stories and words

118
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:17,279
you listen from a settled

119
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:22,519
quiet open

120
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:27,140
and loving field

121
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:38,960
and allow the words to drop in and flow through

122
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:46,220
without grasping to anything in particular

123
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:53,960
but whatever might touch you and Center in

124
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:13,709
[Music]

125
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:13,080
so we're transitioning um to another

126
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:19,140
story um the

127
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:25,679
great women disciples the stories of the great women Disciples of the Buddha that

128
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:33,000
I've been speaking about to this this whole week but I remember I I kind of forgot one

129
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,279
thing that I meant to say so I'm gonna put it in now

130
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:44,120
um so and that is I forgot to say that

131
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:51,419
this stories that I've been sharing up to now today that it's best to not to

132
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:58,320
take them as some sort of absolutely absolute truth so

133
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:05,460
many details of this stories were kind of pieceded together from parts of the

134
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:11,159
poly Canon and commentaries

135
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:20,600
and so there's um no way that we can be really definitive of all the details and that

136
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:26,279
that came through so we hear this with some

137
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:31,380
light-heartedness and at the same time

138
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:37,019
and maybe each of these stories have a certain aspects of the teachings

139
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:43,080
that are meaningful and inspiring for us and that they are supportive for the

140
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:52,019
Dharma path maybe that's good enough to consider taking some aspects of this in

141
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:58,620
and for the parts that are harder to connect and

142
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:04,320
um are not connecting at all we can simply put aside

143
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:13,260
and this is a kind of an art of learning how to study and work with teachings that are

144
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:19,980
offered in all different forms and so in the ancient Buddhist

145
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:25,580
Traditions or maybe maybe almost all of the spiritual traditions

146
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:31,500
storytelling has always been a very vibrant part of

147
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:37,260
the teaching mode and so because they touch us in

148
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:45,500
some ways that may be quite different from Simply receiving a set of

149
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:50,540
instructions for example you know

150
00:34:56,339 --> 00:34:58,460
um

151
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,820
yeah I'm noticing my internet it has a little issue so I'm just switching to a

152
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:29,040
different internet right now um hopefully this would work

153
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:35,700
so today I yet another day I'm bringing in a story maybe some of you would have

154
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:43,740
already heard this this is a story of isakutami and maybe what I'll offer

155
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:50,579
there'll be some New Perspective here as well even if you may have a herd and the

156
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:59,520
story of the kisako gotami so kisakotomy is said to be born in

157
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:07,380
um no cast of family and she's also very frail and weak and

158
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:13,760
she's said to be quite skinny and Haggard

159
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:22,619
the word Kissa means sagio or Haggard and so that's what she's known as and so

160
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:29,460
kind of a very fragile woman and because of that it was very hard for

161
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:34,859
her to get married and that was a challenge itself I

162
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:42,480
suspected for young women in those days but there's one day a rich Merchant

163
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:49,920
um a young man somehow saw her and they saw something different inside of her and they fell in

164
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:56,579
love with her and I he decided to marry kisakutan

165
00:36:56,579 --> 00:37:02,880
even though the family didn't seem to buy in with this decision

166
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:11,119
nevertheless the young the young man was quite persistent and so they got married

167
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:16,859
and um in those days and maybe even today for

168
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:22,260
um some of the parts of the world when a

169
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:28,380
young women get married and they go to the husband's household to live

170
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:37,800
and that was that was tough for akisakotami because the in-laws often find faults in her and

171
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:43,500
it was very challenging even though the young couple seems to

172
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:49,579
love each other very much at some point

173
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:55,200
kisakotami was pregnant with a young boy a baby boy

174
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:02,540
and when the little boy was born this changed her life

175
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:08,540
the young boy was energetic vibrant and

176
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:15,480
very cute and handsome and all the grudges that the in-laws had

177
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:24,060
with her went away and so you can see how uh

178
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:31,859
how much this meant for kisakotami in a way that this young boy wasn't just

179
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:39,720
praying a new life into the family but also had a given hisakotami a sense of

180
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:49,040
Life of her own and her her own existence now depends on this young boy

181
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:55,560
so she was very happy for a while and very contented for a while

182
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:04,380
that did not last a very long one day the boy got sick and very sick

183
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:11,339
quickly he died and you can imagine the death of this

184
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:18,000
child of her kisakotami was more than the death of the young boy

185
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,119
the son because Kisa gotami had

186
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:32,339
kind of her life depends on this boy so it's as if her life not taking away

187
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:37,680
in this way um

188
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:44,240
the whole family was distraught they all turned against kisakotami

189
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:51,720
blaming her accusing her you can imagine you know all the stuff that would come

190
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:59,460
up in situations like like this and even her husband began to reject to

191
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:05,940
her this was too much for kisakotami and a

192
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:12,660
very short time kind of the whole life changed from upside down

193
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:19,800
maybe it was hours and days and so she started hallucinating and began to

194
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,960
imagine things and so she refused to accept that her

195
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,839
son had died she imagined that she was that he was

196
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:39,359
just as sick and needed a medicine to bring him back to normal so he carried this young boy in her arms

197
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:48,119
and start running from one household to another asking for medicine and to bring

198
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:56,640
her some back to life and everyone as she met said no your son

199
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:06,599
was dead and there's no way that you can bring her back but at some point and she met this one

200
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:12,420
um maybe wise compassionate um family

201
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:20,040
who told her well maybe you should see a physician who

202
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:28,859
might be able to offer you a medicine to treat your son and as a physician is the Buddha so you

203
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:34,760
should go see the Buddha as I get the sense that this wise person

204
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:45,260
that sense to something within her had some sense of hope or wisdom

205
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:53,838
incor and so he sent me to the Buddha

206
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:01,560
now had such a hope a possibility sense of a

207
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:07,200
hope and possibility so she ran to the ananta pentecas

208
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,780
monastery where the Buddha stayed in the middle of assembly that the

209
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:19,859
Buddha held she ran writing from the in front of in front of the Buddha

210
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:28,320
in total Despair and back the Buddha please the Buddha give some medicine to

211
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:34,380
my son and the Buddha stopped his teaching right then

212
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:42,380
and kindly without dismissing her without

213
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:50,040
blaming ridiculing and he responded with this verses

214
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:55,800
that the kisakotami recounted later in the Legends of the terries

215
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:01,619
and this was said the Buddha is killed in crafty speech

216
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:07,140
said bring me a white Mustard Seed collected

217
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:12,359
in whichever home where people dying is unknown

218
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:20,520
okay so the Buddha askedame to collect white mustard seed from any household

219
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:28,500
that didn't have death in their family but in those days the households people

220
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:34,380
live in are kind of generations you know generations of people live in those

221
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:42,359
house households and it's pretty impossible to find a house that doesn't have anyone died in

222
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:47,520
that so kisakotami went to each house

223
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:55,619
while first asking for the white mustard seed Mustard Seed is very common in Indian

224
00:43:55,619 --> 00:44:02,880
Cuisine and so it's one of the spices pretty much everybody uses so that was no problem

225
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,880
but when she get to the second part of the question that was unexpected by

226
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:14,099
kisakotami so was there any death well mustard yes

227
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:21,480
we have Mustard Seed yes we have but How about if there's any death in the

228
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:28,520
family and everybody said yes there was death

229
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,900
so he came she came back to the Buddha empty-handed

230
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:44,900
this journey itself was a powerful teaching right there and then

231
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:52,680
as she already got a sense wow no one escapes death and this is

232
00:44:52,680 --> 00:45:00,359
inevitable so she said in her poem

233
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:06,359
throwing away my baby's corpse I went to the Buddha

234
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:12,060
having seen me from distance the Buddha said this to me

235
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:19,140
better than a hundred years of life not seeing how things rise and fall

236
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:25,740
is a living for a single day seeing things rising and falling

237
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:30,780
this is the condition of the entire world

238
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:36,680
the impermanence of all that is

239
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:40,619
eyes

240
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:50,240
and she realized the truth of what the Buddha was pointing to

241
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:58,859
and so there's a story reminded me and many years ago when I did the Sati

242
00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:06,420
center chaplaincy training and I was going on to the patient gowns

243
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:12,720
in the Kaiser Hospital and also meeting with cancer patients

244
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:19,140
and their caregivers I remember very vividly each time I went

245
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:27,599
and then going back home is like being sent for mustard seeds and again

246
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:33,420
and again I came back empty-handed

247
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:39,000
who doesn't get sick and who is not going to die

248
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:47,640
and that was that hit me very strongly wow but this is the truth of Our Lives

249
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:54,619
and so there is a reason why these are called Divine Messengers

250
00:46:54,619 --> 00:47:01,920
directly and the deeply they start challenging our grasping or under tight

251
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:11,240
grip we may have on on things that are Ever Changing

252
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:19,260
and for me this is still ongoing on voting process

253
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:28,220
and yet each time I meet this there is such a secretness that's unfolding

254
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:38,160
I remember uh in the days when I was meeting with the cancer patients that I

255
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:44,520
was with each time sitting with them my gratitude

256
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:50,339
towards everything kind of deepens little by little

257
00:47:50,339 --> 00:47:57,960
and also I started witnessing the possibilities of liberating right there

258
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:04,740
and then they Advance the cancer patients are

259
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:11,700
moving through kind of the faces of a traumatic experience from the

260
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:18,119
beginning and to maybe um of surviving modes

261
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:26,160
and in some ways also in some kind of thriving mode that is not necessarily

262
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:31,619
about defining uh death but about how they

263
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:39,119
live each moment and so we had a coined a term that

264
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:44,940
um we called this group can Thrive group

265
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:54,540
and so uh and there is some part of our lives that it feels vibrant and thriving

266
00:48:54,540 --> 00:49:01,619
in the midst of maybe meeting with illness and faith and

267
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:09,180
the death and so maybe this teaching from

268
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:15,980
kisakotami offers this possibility for each of us

269
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:22,760
to bow to the secretness of Our Lives

270
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:32,460
and not to grasp on anything but open to the possibility to thrive in

271
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:38,059
the midst of all challenges and difficulties

272
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:44,240
even even the facing of a death

273
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:55,460
so thank you everyone you have a wonderful peaceful day
