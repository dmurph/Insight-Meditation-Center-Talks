1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,319
hello and welcome and as we

2
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:12,960
begin I'm reminded of a story told of the Zen teachers Shinrio

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,199
Suzuki Roshi in the maybe in the 1960s when he came to United

4
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:24,279
States and he was asked by someone by student um or someone interested in

5
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:29,840
Zen if I practice Zen will I become enlightened

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:36,760
and Suzuki Roshi uh answered uh if your practice is

7
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:44,320
sincere it's almost as good and uh and this idea that sincere

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:51,960
practice is as good as or almost as good as awakening i think a remarkable

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:59,000
statement and to be sincere I I understand is to give

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,878
oneself kind of wholeheartedly to the practice with a

11
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,400
certain humility a certain uh giving oneself

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:18,880
over to it but without straining or without conceit without

13
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:27,880
trying to attain awakening even though that's the purpose of it uh a sincere engagement with the

14
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:34,960
process just for its own sake in this moment i think of sincerity as being having

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,720
very closely related to honesty an honest understanding of how

16
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:48,759
we operate what drives us what our challenges are and to hold that with a

17
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:54,159
certain humility a certain

18
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:02,439
non-reactivity and that in the end uh there is a learning to give up give

19
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:07,520
away cease all the efforts in the mind the

20
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,800
heart the body maybe all the efforts that are not

21
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,000
needed all the reactions all the judgments all the trying to make

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
something happen build something up try to avoid something try to fix something

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,640
anything that's extra to the radical

24
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:38,480
simplicity of presence of attention

25
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:45,959
here and one of the ways to appreciate this is to

26
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:52,360
appreciate that way in which practice

27
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,519
attention can be effortless it's not something we have to

28
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,560
put effort into but something that we align

29
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:11,359
ourselves with or open to or allow to move through us

30
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,800
that we have this capacity as human beings to have

31
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:25,000
mental emotional processes operating that don't seem to require

32
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,440
any active intention active effort on our

33
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,560
part they just there just as if the heart beats the

34
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,680
diaphragm moves as we breathe the good part of human life

35
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,480
we're not actively working on having the heart

36
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:55,680
beat mostly we just let it do its thing it's a kind of effortless in the sense

37
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:03,799
that uh it takes no uh effort of choice no effort of mental

38
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:10,000
effort and so practice becomes that when it's sincere and one way of understanding

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,120
this path of janna is a deeper or fuller experience

40
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:26,000
of effortlessness and when we come to the fourth Janna it's kind of remarkably satisfying

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,639
because of the clarity the amazing clarity of

42
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:38,960
awareness that's there without any effort without any personal effort

43
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:46,840
without any choice so to assume a meditation

44
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:51,520
posture and to gently close your

45
00:04:52,919 --> 00:05:01,759
eyes and to begin appreciating a certain kind of

46
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:11,600
effortless quality of practice it helps to relax deeply

47
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:18,080
so first sitting here and feeling

48
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:23,120
sensing a global experience of

49
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:30,360
yourself as if whatever way you are right now is fine

50
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:38,120
there's no need to add judgments or preferences reactions to how you

51
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:44,039
are but to allow there to be a global awareness that for a few

52
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:47,840
moments it's all

53
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:03,120
okay and into that global awareness to experience it all in a fuller more

54
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:10,840
expansive way take a few long slow deep breaths

55
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,800
in the long exhale relaxing holding and tension in

56
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:31,080
the body the energy that goes into being

57
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,638
tense is extra it's not really

58
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:44,919
needed so softening relaxing what you can

59
00:06:53,199 --> 00:07:01,440
and then letting the breathing return to normal and for maybe three more

60
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:06,919
breaths see if you can allow a

61
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:12,120
relaxing of the body on the exhale

62
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:35,039
and then sitting quietly with this simple global

63
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:43,039
awareness of your body in whatever way that's easy for you without making any special effort

64
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,280
for

65
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:56,080
it and in that global

66
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:04,560
awareness can you find maybe in the middle of it the place a settling place a

67
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,919
grounding place within or a place deep

68
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:22,199
inside that has a kind of feeling of being home or a center of all things

69
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:31,840
that takes no effort for it to be there it is just

70
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,599
there and perhaps feel that effortless

71
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:48,839
quality of the centering place

72
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,839
the grounding place may be at the end of the exhale

73
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,440
and as if there's a resting place deep

74
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:31,120
within that's waiting for all of who you are to join in the rest in the

75
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:40,120
effortlessness is there any tension in the mind

76
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:03,519
and be aware of mental tension in an effortless way don't make

77
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:10,040
it a problem nothing to fix or change

78
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:23,040
back up step back to where you can gaze upon it

79
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:33,079
effortlessly that quantumously just known and that's all

80
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,279
and then to return to your breathing and while you might have some

81
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:08,360
effort in staying with the breath breathing in and breathing out returning

82
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:15,519
sustaining notice that part of awareness knowing

83
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:25,959
mindfulness that seems has seems to have the least effort in it

84
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,720
maybe it has a receptive

85
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,640
quality a quiet

86
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:52,640
stillness and appreciate the interface the interface

87
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:58,760
between Effortless

88
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,079
attention and breathing

89
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:32,200
and as you're sitting here is there any feeling of

90
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:39,800
comfort pleasure maybe with the edge es of

91
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:45,360
breathing maybe just beyond the breathing

92
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:54,880
sensations a kind of simple pleasure

93
00:13:55,959 --> 00:14:03,920
well-being that exists effortlessly maybe with its own

94
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:11,959
hum and the awareness that knows it receives

95
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:20,480
it without effort almost like a wind will a breeze

96
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,000
will blow through an open window with no effort on the part of the

97
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
window

98
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,519
and then gently very

99
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:11,399
gently open yourself to the simplicity of effortless

100
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,120
awareness effortless

101
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:24,680
attention effortless knowing that is

102
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:30,639
perhaps nonverbal it requires almost nothing of

103
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,720
you so that

104
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:48,600
awareness settles into itself by

105
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:56,680
recognizing a certain clarity of awareness openness of

106
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,680
awareness effortlessness

107
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:18,480
And in that effortless awareness might there be some quality of

108
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:28,399
peace awareness aware of itself

109
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:48,279
awareness aware of its own clarity

110
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:57,959
clarity like the clarity of unobstructed space

111
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,480
as you sit here in the most

112
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:36,400
gentle almost effortless way you

113
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,440
can don't do anything

114
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,080
no I don't do anything with the

115
00:21:53,480 --> 00:22:01,919
mind if you find yourself thinking that involves some degree of

116
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:13,120
effort see if you can find the place where that effort is not

117
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:20,090
happening where you can stop meditating to just

118
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:28,840
[Music] E no conscious effort

119
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:02,120
and as we come to the end of the sitting to

120
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:09,360
consider how an open window allows the breeze to come in

121
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,360
effortlessly

122
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,840
an open window will not

123
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,760
break if a rock is thrown at the

124
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:31,360
window and an open window

125
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:38,880
[Music] allows the radiance the

126
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:46,600
light of our love our care for the world our

127
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:55,520
goodwill to shine out the window unobstructed by curtains glass tinted

128
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:03,200
glass so we sit here at the end of the

129
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:12,400
sitting with an open heart

130
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:21,278
allowing the gentle breeze of the world

131
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:29,760
suffering to light the warmth of care and

132
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:37,760
compassion so that our heart open heart can radiate its goodwill out into the

133
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,799
world spreading the medicine of

134
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:52,279
care far and wide may all

135
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:58,360
beings be happy may all

136
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:05,000
beings be safe may all

137
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,600
beings be peaceful may all

138
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,919
beings be free

139
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:25,089
[Music]

140
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,480
thank you

141
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:44,720
so good morning and or good day and welcome to this next talk on samadei

142
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,039
we're talking about the fourth Janna and

143
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:55,640
um it's not something that people will experience often and regularly in life

144
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:01,279
and maybe occasionally it's experienced in very particular circumstances

145
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:10,039
something like this but even in meditation it's not something that is easy to to enter into enter and

146
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:16,559
abide and um but one of the ways maybe to get feel for it is through the

147
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:21,840
imagination and through some of the characteristics of it which might appear

148
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:27,760
in ordinary life and one of those is um there's a a

149
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,960
deep effortless quality that is highlighted in the fourth

150
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:40,000
Janna before entering into samadei there is a kind of effort that's being done in

151
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,720
practice sincere effort and hopefully an effort that you enjoy doing that you

152
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,000
find a way that it's enjoyable and satisfying you look forward to you know

153
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,480
just like you would forward to certain kinds of activities that are fun to do like playing an instrument or maybe

154
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:04,640
cooking if you enjoy that or sometimes we put a tremendous amount of effort into

155
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,559
uh you know some sport or something um go for a hike in the hills and it takes

156
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:17,080
a lot of energy but there's a pleasure there's a joy there's a kind of

157
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:22,360
um maybe a kind of effortless quality in the sense that we're not

158
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:29,760
uh having to work hard against ourselves so as we to really enjoy the practice

159
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:38,679
and then to begin finding a way that to a deeper settling deeper uh uh quieting

160
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:44,480
calming and uh while being deeply centered and unified and really feel

161
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,919
like we're fully here in the present moment here centered here in this time

162
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:56,080
and place and um and then as we go through

163
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:02,799
the deepening samadei um uh slowly the there's sometimes

164
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:08,559
sometimes with kind of big jumps but slowly there's a transition from how

165
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:14,080
much effort we have to make and how much effortless effort there is how much

166
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:22,720
there the practice rather than we doing the practice the practice is doing doing us and so to go along with that to feel

167
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,919
that shift so we're not overriding the effortless part overriding the way the

168
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:33,440
practice practices us um u because we think it's always up to us we're pushing

169
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:40,240
and striving and doing there's an art to knowing when to let up and just enough

170
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:47,279
but to stay really present uh not so much that the mind drifts off but not too much so that

171
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:55,200
there's a strain and so this art of kind of knowing how to make this shift gradual transition until there's less

172
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,640
and less effort from us needed because there's no wandering off we're just here

173
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:08,880
we're entered and abided we've arrived here and the Janna the four Janna are

174
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,039
one way of understanding them yesterday I talked about progressive stages of

175
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:20,039
calming another way of understanding them uh it's a

176
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:25,200
progressive entering and abiding in an effortless awareness less and less

177
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:31,760
effort is needed and until we get to the fourth Janna and uh it seems like there's

178
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:37,919
really no effort at all and uh it can seem like there's no

179
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:44,240
effort in the third Janna for example but uh from the point of view of the fourth Janna there's still a little bit

180
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:54,799
orientation of the mind towards the happiness towards the the the good qualities of it and uh and so um uh in

181
00:31:54,799 --> 00:32:02,080
the fourth Janna kind of uh the joy of clear recognition the joy of the

182
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:07,279
happiness of awareness the happiness that's a little bit activated energy

183
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:12,760
quiets down even more and so there's this kind of deep feeling of

184
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:21,840
effortlessness but it's effortlessness that seems to leave what's left is a

185
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:29,919
broad un un um bounded

186
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:40,720
uh sense of awareness of clarity of knowing of um sensing of just being that

187
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,480
uh maybe has very little characteristics to it it's almost and it's like that the

188
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:52,679
awareness is aware of itself uh it's kind of like um

189
00:32:52,679 --> 00:33:02,000
uh you know uh I'm you know I'm nearsighted and um and so if I uh kind

190
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:10,320
of I have complicated eyesight now but uh uh without my glasses um I

191
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:17,760
don't see so well and c certain distances it's all blurry and um and uh

192
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:24,480
but uh when When I put on my glasses uh it's everything is clear and I can see

193
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:31,360
in certain certain directions certain distances and uh and uh the seeing it's

194
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,799
kind of like the seeing sees its own clarity well it is

195
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:42,159
the object that's there that I see clearly but there's a feeling that uh

196
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:49,760
it's not like it's not so much about the objects there's almost a feeling that the the eyes themselves now have cleared

197
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:56,399
there's a the eyes see their own clarity almost and so the the the uh the

198
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:03,919
awareness knows its own clarity knows its own purity or maybe there's some deep deep

199
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:09,280
nonverbal knowing that knows these things it's a

200
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:15,760
no deep knowing of uh something very of what is really special this effortless

201
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:22,000
awareness that's clear it's unruffled there's no waves there's no judgments

202
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,638
and so there it's very aquamous and um and uh it's not reacting

203
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:33,839
to anything and not participating anything so a lot of things disappear

204
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:40,638
because part of what the mind is is an uh alarm system we're alert and vigilant

205
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:47,118
for all kinds of things for what we are afraid of what we don't want what we want and the kind of that kind of

206
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:52,240
vigilance falls away it's a feeling of deep deep safety

207
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,280
uh generally the Janna are very hard to experience unless somehow we provide our

208
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:03,240
whole psychophysical system with the reassurance of a deep kind of safety in that

209
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:11,599
time because that's another way of describing the Janna is a progressive state of feeling more and more safe so

210
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:18,720
safe that the idea of safety and danger disappears entirely and we're just there and with

211
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:25,560
this clarity with this purity with this feeling a very clean um very still very

212
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:31,760
quiet um there's no thoughts at all though there might be still a little bit

213
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:38,240
just in the faint kind of nonverbal knowing that um you know really you're

214
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:44,119
not involved in it just it's just just kind of floats there a little bit gently

215
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:51,280
quietly it has no power there's no energy behind it and um and the mind

216
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,800
feels very clean as I've said and one of the characteristics of it in the

217
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:03,920
description in my translation I said um uh disappearance of mental happiness and

218
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,280
mental suffering it's hard to know how to translate these two words from Pali

219
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:17,079
Duman and sudan sumanasa and um basically it's kind of

220
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:24,079
means good mind and bad mind and it might mean something like u a really

221
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:29,200
elated mind or deflated mind a u uh

222
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:35,520
happily aroused mind activated mind or u unhappy

223
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:45,680
uh mind and so the emotional tenor quality of the mind um uh is neither elated nor

224
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:52,520
depressed neither inspired nor dispirited neither sad

225
00:36:52,520 --> 00:37:00,640
nor you know inspired and it can seem like that's an amazing dullness amazing blandness why

226
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:10,920
would anybody want that oh well to be in it it just feels like this is really good it feels so pure

227
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:18,640
so nice so clear uh so peaceful uh that maybe describing it as

228
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:25,280
a profound peace that we it's almost as if that's what's all that's left and

229
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,400
maybe we're still there in some kind of way with some kind of attention but the

230
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:36,960
degree to which there's any self-centeredness or self-involvement has almost almost if not entirely kind

231
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:45,079
of disappeared and um and uh the effortless awareness and

232
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:51,280
effortless peace uh that we abide in we feel safe in we

233
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,400
feel comforted in and um a you know like

234
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:02,839
uh wrapping ourselves after a nice refreshing

235
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:09,760
uh bath in a wonderful bath towel that just sit and be completely content and

236
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:18,320
happy as we sit there wrapped in the clean clean towel clean body refreshed body

237
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:26,200
everything vibrating with a open clear

238
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:33,200
um a quantumous mind awareness so I'll read you the the

239
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:40,920
description of the fourth Janna letting go of pleasure and

240
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:47,320
pain with the disappearance of mental happiness and mental

241
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:53,800
suffering one enters and abides in the purity of a quantmous

242
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:59,680
awareness of the fourth Janna once it's pervading this body with

243
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:08,480
a pure clear mind so that no part of the entire body is untouched by the pure

244
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,560
clear mind by the clean clear

245
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:23,160
mind and um and uh this is a mind which is

246
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:30,240
unpreoccupied with itself unpreoccupied with self un preoccupied with desires

247
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:36,760
and aversions unpreoccupied by fears and

248
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:42,440
distress and um and this makes the

249
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:50,440
mind phenomenally ready for a

250
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:56,079
transformation because as soon as the mind is preoccupied by something

251
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:03,720
uh it can't it's the hard for it to shift and change and be ready for what

252
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:11,040
comes so um so the fourth Janna so we have one

253
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:16,079
more talk on uh this fourth Janna and the

254
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:21,599
Janna in general and I'll kind of bring it to a kind of conclusion tomorrow

255
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:30,800
and uh and talk a little bit about what follows the Jonas so thank you very much and um may

256
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:39,000
this day be a day that you feel the the preciousness the joy

257
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:45,119
the deep satisfaction of the way that your heart

258
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:52,160
and mind can be effortless as it moves through the day

259
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:58,599
don't sacrifice the depth of who you

260
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:10,119
are by making too much effort let the mind be at ease thank you
