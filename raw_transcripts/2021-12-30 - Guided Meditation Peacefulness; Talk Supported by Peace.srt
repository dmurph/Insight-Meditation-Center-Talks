[Music]

3
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,920
so

4
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,240
so good day and hello everyone

5
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,560
and for the today's meditation i'd like to offer something a little bit different

6
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,000
and that is that um

7
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,720
rather than thinking of meditation as something we do as a work

8
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,839
think of it more as an undoing so that

9
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:22,640
there is a little bit of doing we do of course but mostly it's avoiding or not doing

10
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,000
so many things that we normally do that add tension and stress

11
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,040
to our moments of being alive

12
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,959
so in this meditation you might try to assume assume

13
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,000
a or touch into some modicum

14
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,920
of being peaceful or calm it can just be most you might be mostly

15
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,839
not be that way but maybe somewhere you can touch into a little bit of being calm in the middle

16
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,839
of the storm and then uh let everything kind of

17
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,040
settle into that calm or peace that's the reference point

18
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:13,519
to see how much you're actually doing and so for example tension in the body

19
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:20,320
is a doing it's an activity that we're engaged in and it's tiring to be tense and as we sit kind of with the modicum

20
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,000
of calm or peaceful let that tension in the body release

21
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,320
let yourself settle into that piece a little bit more

22
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,040
some modicum of calm or peace can be a shield that protects you a little bit from too

23
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:44,160
easily wandering into thoughts which are stressful and a lot of doing

24
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:53,040
so we're undoing the engagement in active thinking coming back letting go into this peace

25
00:12:53,040 --> 00:13:00,480
staying close to that and when we're focusing on the breathing

26
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,399
it's kind of like we're we're aware from that peaceful place

27
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:13,360
through the peaceful place where we're aware in a calm calm way

28
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:20,440
as if breathing is held in a sea of calm

29
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:27,200
so um sitting upright or submitted entering

30
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,240
into your meditation posture

31
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,800
and perhaps gently closing your eyes

32
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:46,399
and without doing anything more can you find or touch into

33
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:53,199
some degree of calm or ease or peacefulness that's here now for you

34
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,959
the calm in the middle of the storm

35
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:05,680
maybe it's found someplace in your body maybe it lives in your chest or your

36
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:11,800
belly in your hands or

37
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,959
in whatever modicum of calm or peace you can feel

38
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:36,720
let your body relax into that relax the doing of tension holding

39
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,680
of your shoulders

40
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,480
of your belly

41
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,279
of your face

42
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:20,839
in a calm peaceful way becoming aware of your breathing

43
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:38,560
so it's not work to be aware of the breathing but almost as if the breathing

44
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:46,160
are the waves of the ocean gently washing across the shore

45
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,519
the sand so gently the

46
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:59,639
your breathing washes across whatever is calm or peaceful for you

47
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:18,399
especially as you exhale i kind of return to a peaceful place

48
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:24,800
staying with the whole exhale settling into whatever calm there is

49
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,800
here

50
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,839
and notice if you start thinking if that's extra work for your mind

51
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,959
and the overactive mind is tiring

52
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,120
sometimes in the mind there's physical tension from all the thinking

53
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:42,720
we do that can be tiring if we really feel it

54
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,559
undoing the doing of thinking

55
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,240
let the thinking mind relax

56
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,520
not so you don't think at all but so your thinking becomes calm and relaxed

57
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:10,720
the thinking becomes thinking about breathing

58
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:20,760
gentle slow thoughts about being present here in this peaceful place

59
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:47,760
and so for this meditation stay close to a feeling of peace or ease

60
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,919
and notice what takes you away from it

61
00:18:53,039 --> 00:19:00,399
and whatever takes you away from it can you relax

62
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:08,400
settle back let go into the piece again

63
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,360
and then notice what takes you away from it

64
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,960
[Music]

65
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:08,069
[Music]

66
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:48,988
[Music]

67
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,640
touching into some degree of calm or peacefulness

68
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:50,400
or ease within and trying to stay close to that

69
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,838
open your heart now to the people around you

70
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:02,160
to the people you might encounter today or people in your lives

71
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:08,520
neighbors strangers colleagues

72
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:17,520
and what i like to bring them to mind with a peaceful heart

73
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:25,040
a heart which is not doing much that doesn't have to react or

74
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:33,560
immediately pick up all the things that should be done just be aware peacefully

75
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:44,800
and perhaps peacefully without expectation or work

76
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,280
a gentle calm

77
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,079
of aspiration that is our aspiration that we can

78
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:04,599
contribute to the welfare and happiness of others calmly peacefully

79
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:12,240
may all beings be happy

80
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,400
may all beings be safe

81
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,039
may all beings be peaceful

82
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,599
may all beings be free

83
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:35,839
and may our peacefulness contribute to that

84
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:43,280
may our ability to be peaceful make space for others

85
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,040
to be free to be happy to be safe

86
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:01,800
maybe our contribution is simply to stay peaceful and calm

87
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,078
and in that peace and calm to be present for others

88
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:15,838
for our friendliness simple friendliness to shine forth

89
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,839
okay

90
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,599
so yesterday morning's teachings on karma are an important

91
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:04,800
aspect of buddhism and to appreciate

92
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:10,079
that are all our actions have consequences and to be careful of what we do

93
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:16,560
and to do the things that are health producing that are wholesome and

94
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:24,000
helpful supportive that move us towards freedom and to avoid those who do the opposite

95
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,280
so this is an important teaching but it can be heard as if

96
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:35,200
now we have to get to work like this is a lot of work now every single action i have to track and

97
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,960
monitor and and think about and try to do it just the right way

98
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,160
and so it can be taken as a teaching that you have to kind of work

99
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:54,640
and sometimes it can be even be exhausting just to hear this kind of teaching because it just if the implication is a lot of working

100
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:59,680
and sometimes to be passionate inside meditation practice in general when it's taught

101
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:05,119
might lend itself to the idea that there's a lot to do there's a lot of instructions and

102
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:11,359
and you can now hear hear all the instructions and you can actually what do i do now and do i do this now and

103
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:16,640
now now there's a lot of emotions and what i was supposed to do with supposed to you know go through the list of the

104
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,079
different uh raft or rain or whatever it might be and

105
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,440
and it could be done just uh keeping her end up being busy

106
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,680
but that's not how it's supposed to be um

107
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:42,240
and i think that uh closer to the idea is what we did in this meditation is to find some degree

108
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:48,240
of calm or peace or ease and let that be the reference point

109
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:55,119
for not making things worse to recognize that when

110
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:00,480
the mind gets caught up in preoccupations in a sense you're losing touch with that peace and that ease

111
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:06,640
you're not being peaceful anymore and in a sense you're making things worse

112
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:13,440
if you start you're peaceful but then you start rushing and feel tense and they're rushing in a

113
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,280
sense you're making things worse if you

114
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:27,119
start complaining about something in a sense you're making things worse maybe for yourself and for someone else

115
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:33,680
and so to have this reference point of some degree of peace and calm

116
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:40,400
and have that as a reference that don't make it worse and it's not a lot of work to do this

117
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:45,680
it's more like stay stay close to the peace stay attentive and notice

118
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:52,240
when uh it becomes not peaceful when it becomes agitated when it becomes stressful

119
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:58,800
when it becomes contracted or tense and with time we start becoming quite

120
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:04,319
sensitive and familiar with the feeling the sensations the experience of things

121
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:09,359
getting tense or tight or contracted or agitated

122
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:14,720
and we recognize it early and earlier and then

123
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:21,359
question is it really necessary to do this and maybe not

124
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:28,800
come back to the peace you can still do things and take care of things but do things from this calm place

125
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:35,680
and so the attentiveness of mindfulness this attention to the moment and to the consequences

126
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:42,000
can be very simple it means stay calm and peaceful the best you can and notice

127
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,079
when you lose it and probably if you uh you lose it you're making the

128
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:54,720
situation worse and one of the fundamental principles of this karma teachings

129
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:01,520
is don't make it worse whether you can make it wonderfully wonderful for people or do wonderful

130
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:06,800
things for the world that might be difficult to figure out

131
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:12,720
and kind of burden to carry that responsibilities it's nice to be supportive and do nice things for people

132
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:18,880
for sure but the minimum is don't make it worse

133
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:25,599
making it worse is probably some kind of activity we have to work to make it worse

134
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:32,400
and so if we're a little bit hesitant to do meditation because it seems like a lot of work

135
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:39,119
uh we're probably overlooking the the all the work that we do that makes situations worse for ourselves and

136
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:44,960
for other people and don't make it worse and then

137
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:49,839
trust this place of calm or peace or subtleness

138
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:56,880
and if you have these reference points of some modicum of peace and calm and again it doesn't have to be dramatic

139
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,920
i mean it might not be might be that you're quite agitated but

140
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:07,119
a little bit you have a senseless sliver of calm you have some sense of what it is

141
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:12,720
that becomes a better reference pointer to highlight how you are tense

142
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:19,440
how you are contracted or agitated and then to stop and take a good look at that

143
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:25,280
become familiar with that that's when we bring our attention to

144
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:31,760
sometimes my instructions that i give myself and you know what i do in meditation or in daily life

145
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:38,880
is i stop for suffering i go about my life peacefully happily

146
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:45,119
along but if i start suffering if i start getting agitated or tense that becomes a mindfulness spell okay

147
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:50,800
here's something i should pay attention to now i should notice here's something for me to learn

148
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:56,000
what did i just do what did i just believe what is arising out of me what's the

149
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:03,200
reactivity that's happening here and those questions uh of investigation of looking at it

150
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:08,720
begins to take some of the authority away from it some of the automatic nature of it

151
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:15,359
so that i don't have to kind of go barreling into or participate in this suffering

152
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:22,160
producing kind of state that i'm in for some people

153
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:27,599
it can there's very strong uh counter forces to being peaceful and

154
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:33,359
calm and one of them is a belief that it's not okay

155
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:39,760
and the belief that we're supposed to be agitated or i'm so terrible person that i have to kind of

156
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:46,319
make up for it and just kind of really try to run around and fix everything up and make everything safe and everything

157
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:52,160
good and tidy and being peaceful just means that i'm lazy or good for nothing or something

158
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:59,920
and my worth is only found in doing and so if i don't do something i would will have no inner worth and this piece

159
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:07,599
implies some kind of not doing and so that then where's my worth if i just sit and be calm

160
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:13,280
and this is you know not necessary to think this way because it's possible to do all the things we

161
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:19,440
are supposed to do our responsibilities with through with our calm with peacefulness we can do it peacefully we

162
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,640
can do it calmly and some people have found that they do things better that way

163
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:31,200
it's more effective it has a better impact on others on our oneself that by time some activity is over we

164
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:36,240
feel more settled or more focused than if we did it agitated way and time

165
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:41,838
is over we felt we feel exhausted by it tense by it

166
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:49,760
so this idea that buddhist practice is a lot of work um is a

167
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:55,440
misunderstanding that's easy to come up with and i'd like to think of it it's almost

168
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,960
the opposite it's like the undoing of work it's the undoing of

169
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:08,240
all the different forces that are work that are exhausting or tiring and discovering a place of ease from

170
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:13,839
which we can do things and um and enjoy it and and that's fine

171
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:19,599
that's a wonderful place to be and trust it in some deep profound way

172
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:29,119
so in this way the instructions in meditation that we give sometimes are not really prescriptive

173
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:34,960
less less than what we do and more what we notice

174
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:43,440
less what we're doing but more what we're undoing so if the attention is to

175
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:50,800
the breathing then it's noticing how we add extra work to breathing to the attention to

176
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:56,319
breathing like when we're trying too hard and trusting that it's possible to do it

177
00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:01,359
in a peaceful way in a relaxed way if you bring attention to our body

178
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:06,960
feeling that we have to fix every ache and pain in the body and so we get busy trying to

179
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:12,079
focus on pain and get rid of the pain and do something with it and

180
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:17,760
and as opposed to being peaceful with discomfort oh i'm supposed to pay attention to

181
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:24,079
discomfort let me do it peacefully and no agenda no work emotions

182
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:29,839
all these wonderful instructions we give on emotions can seem like a lot of work

183
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:35,040
but what is it like to be with emotions in a peaceful calm way and to use the instructions and

184
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:40,800
emotional emotions to support the peaceful way a calm way

185
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:46,800
and thinking you know a lot of thinking makes it worse a lot of thinking is difficult and stressful

186
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,839
but what's it like to hold that peacefully and look upon it kindly

187
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:56,799
and not be too caught and preoccupied by it

188
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,839
so

189
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:11,119
our actions make a difference our actions have consequences and the actions that are done peacefully

190
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:17,040
will have peaceful consequences at least locally

191
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:25,200
and the actions that are done in an agitated way unpeacefully will have unpeaceful consequences

192
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:30,319
so hopefully that simple teaching will encourage you to

193
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:35,359
stay peaceful and not to use buddhism as some as a

194
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:42,319
as a lot of work it can be ongoing it can be continuous it can be the center of our life

195
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:47,599
um but it's more of a undoing than a doing

196
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:53,520
it's kind of like um we put a lot of work in

197
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:59,599
to stay at ease and stay close to the place of ease and there's a paradox there if you put a

198
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:05,680
lot of work to that you can't get tense in order to be at ease but you can't

199
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:11,920
have a continuous attention you can be have a heightened awareness that keeps you close to that place of

200
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:18,960
ease and peace a heightened awareness which is itself an expression of that peace itself

201
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:25,680
and that becomes a protection and this easeful mindfulness is a really a protection becomes a shield

202
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:33,160
from all the ways that we get caught up in excessive work in the mind and the heart

203
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:39,040
so thank you and if you take one thing from this uh talk

204
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:45,280
um live a life where you don't make it worse whatever situation you're in don't make

205
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:51,440
it worse so um

206
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:58,640
i look forward to coming back tomorrow and then next week we'll do i'll start the sati patano start the instructions on

207
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:03,839
the buddhist instructions on the four foundations of mindfulness and we'll go through it probably over a few

208
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:11,400
weeks it's a like we did last year with anapanasati so thank you

209
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:36,880
you
