1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:08,360
I'm gonna talk about suta majama Nakaya 128.

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:15,120
as it's interpreted by ajan tsuchito no sujato

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,240
let me make sure I got that right yeah

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:28,099
and um so and I'm using his translation right I don't know Paulie so

5
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:33,600
there's interpretations of interpretations right and I'm so I'm

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,820
just sharing freely as I read through this suit uh kind of the things that

7
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,399
came up for me and what it made me think about and there's things that are both

8
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:51,120
directly said and then there's things that are demonstrated in the way that the story is told

9
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,120
and I think it's really worthwhile to um recognize that the Buddha taught not

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,960
just in the words that he shared but in the way he behaved

11
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:10,140
so for me and actually have two there's so much in the suit so there's I'm

12
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,320
planning to do one pass of it tonight and or this morning and another pass tomorrow night

13
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,740
um focusing on today the aspects of relationship and community and practice

14
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:32,880
and tomorrow on the Corruptions or the things that get in the way of community and and practice and the the suta is

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,700
called translated as Corruptions and um

16
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,280
Corruptions um let me see

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,340
there's a I don't see where it is right now but um the translation of Corruptions is essentially things that

18
00:01:53,340 --> 00:02:00,960
don't belong that are kind of come into play and just kind of corrode or disrupt

19
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:08,160
um make make problems so I think because of the way I want to

20
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:15,180
share the suits I think that I'll give you first a whole just a brief summary of the whole Arc of the story

21
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,459
and then as I go through you'll have a map of sort of where where we're going

22
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:29,459
and hopefully it'll help you keep track and also as I'm saying I was reading and

23
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:36,599
rereading the suits on noticing what was coming up for me what was I noticing and I invite you to do the same

24
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:43,379
I invite you to be curious and interested in how your own mind responds what what associations your mind makes

25
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:49,920
and along the way I'll be opening up and inviting you to share if you want to share any of

26
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,260
your own personal reflections I think we have an opportunity to to

27
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:03,000
learn from each other in this way so the summary of this suta

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,220
is that um the Buddha goes out of compassion to

29
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,920
a Sangha that's in in conflict and when he gets there he tries three

30
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,819
times to Halt the argument and to um you know engage masuta

31
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:27,900
but he doesn't succeed so he moves on and then he visits a single meditator

32
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:34,260
um where he connects with him asks him how he is and then teaches him dhamma

33
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:40,019
instructs and inspires him and then he moves on to

34
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:47,280
um another a park where there are three companions living together and what is

35
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,680
described as with love living together with love

36
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:59,940
loving themselves and he asked them how they're doing in a

37
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:07,739
number of ways and I'll go into the details later right and you know are they getting along

38
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:14,700
are they living in harmony and um and then when he finds out yes they

39
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:20,579
are indeed he goes on to ask about their practice and how they are progressing in

40
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:26,820
their own meditation practice and then he teaches him about his own

41
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:32,820
experience with difficulties or blocks or Corruptions to his meditation

42
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:41,419
to help them find a way free from the Corruptions that are arising in their own practice

43
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,660
so you know right away we see the Buddha goes he's responding out of compassion

44
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,400
to a Sangha that's in conflict

45
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,820
at the time that he was asked to go he was staying in a monastery

46
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:11,820
and so we can kind of assume that I assume that it was

47
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:19,800
um you know he was being able to meditate practice that he had food and shelter and companions who were also

48
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:28,560
practicing and there was a mendicant who from

49
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:35,340
kasambi came and told the Buddha that at kasambi they

50
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:43,919
were arguing quarreling disputing and continuing continually wounding each

51
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,479
other with barbed words

52
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:59,280
so mendicant is someone who practices relying chiefly or exclusively on alms

53
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:06,960
to survive in principle mendicans you know there's a religion the multiple religious orders

54
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:14,400
but they have little property right and um many instances they've taken vows of

55
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,740
poverty in order that all their time and energy could be expended on practicing

56
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:24,960
their respective Faith preaching and serving Society

57
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,979
so a kosamba where they're quarreling and brawling and in deep disputes this

58
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:37,259
is another translation they say stabbing each other with verbal daggers

59
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:43,580
they're clearly not doing the other parts of being a mendicant right

60
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:53,100
so to help kind of provide a contrast I'm going to reference a different suta

61
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:58,440
where someone describes the Buddhist community of practitioners

62
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,660
when he comes upon them and he says because he's he's

63
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:08,699
referencing first this visitor how he's seen other community communities like

64
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:15,060
kambasa and then he he comes to the Buddhas and he says but here

65
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:22,819
I see biku smiling and cheerful sincerely joyful

66
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:30,780
plainly delighting with their faculties fresh living at ease unruffled

67
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,819
subsisting on what others give abiding with a mind

68
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:43,220
as aloof as a wild steer and then

69
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:49,380
um so just this huge contrast in what happens

70
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:56,719
in communities based on how we're practicing and living with each other right

71
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,039
so the Buddha has gone to kombasa he

72
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,978
consented in silence when he asked he just got up and went

73
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:18,060
and when he arrives nasuta says

74
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:26,900
he said enough mendicants stop arguing quarreling and disputing

75
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,820
the Buddha repeats this three times

76
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:43,320
and each time the I'm assuming it's the mendicant that

77
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:50,760
came to ask him to come it doesn't say explicitly that mannequin says to the Buddha wait

78
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:57,839
sir let the Buddha the lord of the Dharma remain passive dwelling in Blissful meditation in

79
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,540
present life we will be known for this arguing quarreling and disputing

80
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,760
so three times the Buddha says you know enough

81
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:15,360
stop quarreling stop disputing and three times the mannequin responds

82
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:22,279
wait wait you know you live passive dwelling and Blissful meditation

83
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:36,660
another thing to notice about you know the Buddha comes and immediately tells them you know wait and stop and they

84
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:42,540
don't listen is there's no reception for the Buddha there's no greeting of the Buddha when

85
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,180
he arrives there's no listening to the Buddha

86
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,959
so in the morning the Buddha robed up and took his bowl

87
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:00,019
and robe and entered kasambi for alms

88
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:05,580
and after the meal on his return from alms round he set his lodgings in order

89
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:12,199
taking his bowl and robe he recited these verses while standing right there

90
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,420
so the Buddha is quite Direct

91
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:25,740
he's in this in these phrases like a poem that he he speaks

92
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:32,760
he doesn't mince words it's very direct and I think this is also a teaching Buddha is not being

93
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:39,420
unkind he didn't yell he didn't kind of argue himself he just asked them to stop

94
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:46,440
three times so he's preparing to leave with clarity

95
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:54,260
and he says when many voices shout at once no one thinks that they're a fool

96
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:01,920
while the song is being split none thought another to do be better

97
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,920
adults yes adults pretending to be astute

98
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:15,480
they talk their Words Right Out of Bounds they blab at will their mouths agape and

99
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,240
no one knows what leads them on and then he he says in quotes yeah they

100
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,660
abused me they hit me they beat me they robbed me

101
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,160
for those who bear such a grudge hatred never ends

102
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,920
he repeats they abused me they hit me they beat me they robbed me

103
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:44,459
for those who bear no such Grudge so who don't go on in this way hatred has an

104
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:51,180
end for never is hatred settled by hate

105
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:56,540
it is settled by love this is an eternal truth

106
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:03,240
there's um a similar verse in the dhamapada

107
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,940
so I'll reference it here to sort of kind of you know Savor in this teaching

108
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:15,060
a little bit and it includes this explicit teaching

109
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:22,260
on how the mind precedes what happens so all experiences preceded by mind led

110
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:28,860
by mind made by mind speak or act with a corrupted mind and

111
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:36,200
suffering follows as the Wagon Wheel follows the hoof of the ox

112
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:43,399
all experiences preceded by mind led by mind made by mind

113
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:50,579
speak or act with a peaceful mind and happiness follows like a never departing

114
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:57,720
shadow hatred ends never ends through hatred by

115
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:03,800
non-hatred alone does it end this is an ancient truth

116
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:12,300
so we go back to his poem and he says

117
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:18,920
others don't understand that here we need to be restrained

118
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:25,260
but those who do understand this being clever settle their conflicts

119
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:32,700
so something in here is really important to me which is we do things are going to come up

120
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:39,600
when we're living and practicing in community we're going to have conflict differences

121
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:46,800
and so what he's saying is Well Be restraint be restrained about how you respond to

122
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:53,579
that conflict and and settle so being clever wise

123
00:13:53,579 --> 00:14:01,200
settle your conflicts so the Buddha is encouraging us to deal

124
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,300
directly with conflict he's not saying be passive try and be nicey nice happy

125
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:13,579
happy all the time right in this he's implying and that it's natural for difficulties to arise

126
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:20,339
in relationship but that hatred and and operating from

127
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:26,779
hatred will not help right it won't end the conflict

128
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:32,639
another thing about this is the being clever so the Buddha

129
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,639
is emphasizing wisdom when he's using the word clever

130
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:44,519
wisdom is praised as the most the most right the wisdom that is praised the

131
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:49,620
most is not knowledge that one is acquired it's not being able to recite

132
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:55,920
the texts or tell people things the wisdom that is praised is a form of

133
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,880
penetrative seeing directly into one's aspect of life comes from the application of the

134
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:10,440
teachings right comes from experience in in the Buddha's teaching wisdom plays

135
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:17,519
a central role in the path to liberation not only does it lead

136
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,800
to Enlightenment right it is a result of enlightenment

137
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,380
so you know the Buddha the Buddha is really

138
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:34,860
um kind of referenced earlier the people

139
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:40,740
who were you know debating and talking and thinking they're right right that's getting caught and ethicative Views it's

140
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:47,579
but you know your assertions your intellect versus somebody else's and that's not the kind of the wisdom that

141
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:52,920
the Buddha is encouraging us to cultivate

142
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:58,440
so back to the poem the Buddha says Breakers of Bones and

143
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:06,060
taker of Life thieves of cattle horses wealth those who plunder the nation

144
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:11,360
even they can come together so why on Earth can't you

145
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:19,019
and then he goes on to say something else that's really important two lines I'll read one at a

146
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:24,720
time if you find an alert companion a wise and virtuous friend

147
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:32,699
then overcoming all adversities wander with them joyful and mindful

148
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:40,740
if you find no alert companion no wise and virtuous friend then like a king who

149
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:47,279
flees his conquered realm wander alone like a tusker in the Wilds

150
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:52,380
so again this is goes back to the Buddhist like he went to this community

151
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:58,320
in Conflict tried to help there was no wisdom there no engagement

152
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,319
there so he left he's going to go off on his own

153
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:11,400
and sometimes we need to do the same the one of the things about what the

154
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,500
Buddha did that I I think is really important is three times he invited them

155
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:23,699
to stop three times and I think this is also a teaching

156
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:31,080
right like sometimes how how often do we either keep trying and keep trying and keep

157
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:38,340
trying and we're beating our head against you know the wall and other times when do we walk away too soon

158
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:43,440
and I like this idea of trying three times it's a nice you know it's a nice

159
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:50,460
number and so like there's this balance here we're not just coming in and expecting

160
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:57,059
everything to be okay and fine right away but you know we try and we try we try again

161
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:03,299
but at some point maybe after three times we recognize okay

162
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:10,620
they're not here this this this notion of the king with a conquered Kingdom right it's like the boot is sort of like

163
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:18,840
the king of the Dharma right and then this little Sangha there's there's no Dharma happen

164
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,880
right there's there's a lot of conflict

165
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,580
and so he leaves he doesn't try and take them with him he doesn't try you know it's just okay I'm

166
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:37,260
moving on and at the same time when we find you

167
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:45,660
know Wise companions right it's such a blessing like it's such a blessing to come here and to sit with you all

168
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:52,080
to feel the support of sitting in community to go on a retreat and have the

169
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,660
incredible support of watching everybody else move their bodies and sit in

170
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:05,400
Stillness and quiet there's so much support that happens in that realm and there's times for

171
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,539
practice alone too

172
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:19,140
another way you know modern term for what the Buddha is demonstrating might

173
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:26,280
be the word boundaries he had boundaries he had good boundaries right his own

174
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:32,460
clarity about what he was willing to do and not do where he could help where he couldn't

175
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,760
help

176
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:50,760
maybe this is a moment to ask is anyone else having other associations or

177
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:57,120
thoughts that you would like to share it's fine if not just an open invitation

178
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:04,320
Martha will have a microphone right up there yeah if anyone has um anything else they're

179
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:10,799
kind of noticing or picking up on nope yeah oh great okay we got two

180
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,059
people thank you

181
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:21,480
I was just thinking um one reason for the difference or for the

182
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:27,059
conflict is a real attachment to the Views a real attachment to

183
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:32,220
you know not necessarily being right but they're what their thoughts are in their

184
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:39,179
argument and uh unwilling to let that go yeah absolutely

185
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:45,840
you can you pass it to her in the corner foreign

186
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:52,559
I'm not sure what I want to say but like okay

187
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:58,880
I'm not sure what I want to say um but I really appreciate this talk

188
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,759
uh it's resonating with me it's this

189
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:11,880
uh ego knowing I'm right yeah in a relationship or something and

190
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:18,080
then uh uh I'm just really hearing like no

191
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,340
so thank you beautiful beautiful

192
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,059
over here

193
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,100
I had a spiritual advisor many years ago who had a phrase that has helped me a

194
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:50,930
great deal in my life and that is being right is a disease

195
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:58,620
[Music] very very diseaseful

196
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,380
yeah great oh I love it I so appreciate you sharing

197
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:09,600
these Reflections because you know when we when we study together when we

198
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:16,980
practice the Dharma together you know there's there's so much wisdom and everyone is

199
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:23,880
going to see a little different or approach it and feel it a little differently and and that's that's

200
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:31,980
engagement with the practice which is the most important thing is to engage with the teachings to feel

201
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:40,140
them to allow them to to kind of guide you and and for you to notice too what comes

202
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:46,260
up in relationship to them another

203
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:51,480
um part that I wanted to reflect on because I think some people get stuck in

204
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,760
communities or relationships because they don't want to be alone

205
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:05,700
it's hard to leave people and you know I'm not endorsing quickly

206
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,760
leaving relationships right obviously but it's also important to remember that

207
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,799
it is possible to find joy and well-being when awareness is your

208
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:23,880
companion when you get to be the Tasker the elephant in the in the woods walking

209
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:30,900
confidently if you have you know the the elephant is kind of so you know the

210
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:38,280
biggest to Beast right in the wild so they have a certain you know gravity to

211
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:45,600
them and strength to them they're also slow and you know said to

212
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:52,020
have good memories and you know there's a lot of reasons I think the Buddha probably referenced elephants but

213
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:59,700
um you know if we're walking in that way in the world with that confidence

214
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:04,799
instead of fear it's easy much easier to find joy and a

215
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,580
sense of well-being

216
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,720
so the final line in this poem from the Buddha is it's better to wander alone

217
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:27,539
there's no fellowship with fools wander alone and do no wrong at ease

218
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:33,200
like a tusker in the wild foreign

219
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:53,880
the Buddha moves on and he goes to visit

220
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,419
a mendicant named bagu in a village

221
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:09,140
so as the Buddha approaches bagu saw the Buddha coming off in the distance

222
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:17,760
so what did he do he spread out a seat and placed water for washing the feet

223
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,539
when the Buddha came he sat on the seat spread out for him

224
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:29,220
and washed his feet and then bagu bowed to the Buddha and

225
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:35,159
sat down to one side so I mentioned this earlier but this is

226
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:43,140
quite a contrast right how the Buddha is being received in this setting is very very different

227
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:50,220
and I wonder what what in our modern day times what's the equivalent

228
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:58,200
of greeting someone in this way a respected teacher you know laying out a seat putting water

229
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:05,220
for the feet to wash well what might we do what do we do when someone we care

230
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:12,980
for we respect and maybe even Revere comes to visit

231
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:21,659
thank you you know I

232
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:27,360
offer them tea water to drink invite them to have a seat somewhere

233
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:33,900
comfortable ask them if they need food they're hungry

234
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:41,400
welcome them please make yourself at home please feel free to use my bathroom important right

235
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:47,159
and then if somebody really important comes I love the images of um

236
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:52,440
the Dalai Lama when he goes to visit places because the Dalai Lama

237
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:57,720
you know wherever he stays this is not so much necessarily the greeting there

238
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:06,059
is always this intense greeting actually I have a story about him greeting so he went to IMS in Massachusetts and Sharon

239
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:12,600
Salzburg was there in the back of the audience standing but she had a broken leg so she was on crutches and pretty

240
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:18,960
miserable and the Buddhas are not the Dalai Lama is coming with this you know whole

241
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,600
Entourage of people and security guards and all of this stuff and

242
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,820
but the Dalai Lama arrives and he looks around at all the people here and he

243
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:35,400
zeros right in on Sharon Salzburg who's standing in the back she says looking

244
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:42,480
pretty miserable and he goes right back to her and ask her are you okay how are you

245
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,539
dear that's so beautiful right so not only you know are we welcoming him when he

246
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:54,539
comes but he's that's caring for us right the Dalai Lama and then when he

247
00:27:54,539 --> 00:28:01,200
leaves a place so if he stays at a hotel so I'm told these are stories right but

248
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:07,140
I believe them before he goes he has all of the people who work at the hotel

249
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:13,380
everyone who has served him stand in a long line and he goes and he

250
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:19,880
grabs their hand or bows to every one of them one at a time

251
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,380
I also heard a story about someone who was in an airport and that they were with a couple other

252
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:34,140
people waiting in some Lounge area and the Dalai Lama and his Entourage

253
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:40,380
walk by pass them right he's kind of they're off in this little corner they

254
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:47,779
go by and then the Dalai Lama turns around and comes back and Bounds to them so sweet

255
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:55,799
I have a quote from llama Rod Owens and he says at the heart of radical presence

256
00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:01,740
is simply the act of love loving ourselves loving others and allowing

257
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:07,140
that love to be deeply manifested in the world in a real clear way

258
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:12,539
those to me those are beautiful demonstrations

259
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:20,899
of bringing the world man love to the world manifesting in a real clear way

260
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:30,960
so the Buddha having sat down washed his feet back to the sutsa

261
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:37,740
he says to the mendicant I hope you're keeping well mendicant

262
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:43,860
I hope you're all right and I hope you're having no trouble getting alms food

263
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:49,380
that's very touching to me this is the you know this amazing

264
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:58,320
teacher coming giving his presence to you and he asks you if you're doing well if

265
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,340
you're getting enough to eat

266
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:10,020
so this is like the Dalai Lama right his bowing his taking the time to Express

267
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:18,059
Care so I asked you how do you greet people how do you welcome them and how do you

268
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:23,279
how do you express your care for them what do you say

269
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:29,640
how do you let them know that you sincerely want to know how they are not hey how you doing

270
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:36,500
with a fine right but maybe something more than that yeah

271
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:45,179
so bagu says to the Buddha I'm keeping well sir I'm all right and I'm having no

272
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:51,360
trouble getting alms food nice nice

273
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:59,760
and when the Buddha hears that he goes on and he educates encourages fires up and

274
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,820
inspires bagu with a Dharma talk

275
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:11,760
nice like not just you know like Hi how are

276
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:17,520
you you know but like okay making sure he's okay his needs are met

277
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:23,279
and then the Buddha goes to practice he goes to the Dharma first he makes

278
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:28,380
sure you're okay and then he goes to the Dharma because making sure okay is the

279
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:33,799
Dharma right it's an expression of the Dharma

280
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:43,559
and so the Buddha educated encouraged I love

281
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:50,580
this fired up and inspired bagu so he's leaving bhagavuku is practicing by himself it's not described as being with

282
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:58,080
anyone else so this is you know it's okay right it's okay sometimes practicing alone is just the right thing

283
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,899
so the Buddha offers him the Dharma and then he gets up

284
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:08,419
and he sets out for the Eastern bamboo Park

285
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:19,260
at that time at the Eastern bamboo park there were the venerables on Ruda nandia

286
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:25,140
and Kim Bila please forgive me for buturing their names

287
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:30,960
and they um so the Buddha is approaching and

288
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:38,399
the park keeper sees the Buddha coming and clearly doesn't know who the Buddha is and he says to the Buddha

289
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:44,520
don't come into this park ascetic there are three gentlemen who love

290
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:52,320
themselves staying here do not disturb them I love that there are three

291
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:59,340
gentlemen who love themselves staying here that is so sweet

292
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,539
don't bother them

293
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:13,919
but anruda sees the Buddha so he lets the security person know and says come forth

294
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:19,159
venerables come forth our teacher the blessed one has arrived

295
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:27,840
and they go out and receive the Buddhist bowl and robe and one spreads out a seed

296
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:33,419
and one sets out water for washing his feet so

297
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:38,880
the Buddha sat on the sea spread out washed his feet and the venerables bowed

298
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:45,419
and sat down to one side the Buddha says to anruda I hope you're

299
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:51,659
keeping well on Ruda and Friends I hope you're all right and I hope you're having no trouble getting alms

300
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:58,320
food so keeping well I just thought I'd kind

301
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,480
of Define talk about what does it mean good or satisfactory

302
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:10,740

308
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:51,300
trouble getting alms food okay now this is now the Buddhist

309
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:59,099
talking to a community and instead of going right into telling teaching the Dharma the Buddha says I

310
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:06,140
hope you're living in harmony appreciating each other without quarreling blending like milk and water

311
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:13,640
and regarding each other with kindly eyes wow

312
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:22,920
living in harmony appreciating each other living in harmony is you know I pact of

313
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:29,040
peace and Concord agreement you know consensus Unity

314
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:38,280
concert mutual appreciation Mutual right experienced or done by each

315
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:46,920
toward the others reciprocal reciprocated

316
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:53,900
returned interchangeable common

317
00:35:54,180 --> 00:36:01,140
appreciation recognition and enjoyment of the good qualities of someone or something

318
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:07,940
valuing respecting prizing cherishing treasuring and admiration

319
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,640
and without quarreling so in the absence of quarreling

320
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:23,660
blending the action of mixing or combining things together mingle combine Mutiny join

321
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:28,680
incorporate interflow comex

322
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:37,200
so there's Something In this passage that sometimes um

323
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:44,220
people have a little bit of a hard time with and that's this idea of you know blending like milk and water

324
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:50,760
regarding each other with kindly eyes appreciating each other especially

325
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:57,000
um when they go on the Buddha asks you know they say indeed sir we live in harmony

326
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,880
as you say love this then the Buddha says well how do you live this way

327
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:09,420
how do you do that because we need to know right it's not a you know it's great when things are going well but if

328
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:15,300
we don't know what we're doing to support those conditions it's easy to take them for granted and

329
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:20,480
stop doing the things that are allowing it to happen to manifest

330
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:31,920
so they answer that they're doing well and they say in this case sir I think I'm

331
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:37,859
fortunate so very fortunate to live together with spiritual companions such as these

332
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:43,859
I consistently treat these venerables with kindness by way of body speech and

333
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:50,220
mind both in public and in private I think why don't I set aside my own ideas

334
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:55,619
and just go along with these venerables ideas and that's what I do

335
00:37:55,619 --> 00:38:01,260
though we're different in bodies sir or one in mind it seems to me

336
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:07,380
so here's where people can get a little bit Tangled Up when they have been in a

337
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:13,380
situation where they feel like they're constantly doing for others and that it's not reciprocal

338
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:20,220
I made it very clear I pointed out the way the Buddha is asking and teaching us is not just to give

339
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:26,880
when it's not reciprocal when it's not valued when it is when it is

340
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:35,460
um in a way that isn't useful for us should be helpful to me to you and both

341
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:41,880
right but this community is living in a mutual way they're they're sharing

342
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,338
collectively in this way of relating to each other

343
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:54,480
and remember you know the Buddha earlier said if your companions aren't treating you well it's better to go practice on

344
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,640
your own right another

345
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:05,520
um there's this nice quote from a woman named Maria papova and she talks about

346
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,460
um kind of oh

347
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:18,420
codependence right because I think sometimes people are fearful of being codependent or being taken advantage of

348
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:25,140
and she says when you love truly love somebody there is no version of reality in which

349
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:31,380
what is good for them is bad for you no choice they could possibly make that is right for them and wrong for you

350
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:37,680
nothing they could give you that could make love more complete she says this is a difficult notion for

351
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:44,820
the Western mind to grasp too easily to mistake for the Psychopathology of codependence

352
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:50,280
too quick to slip into the tyrannical romantic ideal of merging at its heart

353
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,680
is something else together a kind of transcendent ego dissolution under which

354
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,020
the self ceases to be and becomes being

355
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:12,119
so back to the Sutra and then the venerables spoke the other two companions and they

356
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:17,520
added that's how we live in harmony so they're agreeing they're concurring with anruda

357
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:23,460
the mutuality is here appreciating each other without quarreling blending like

358
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:28,460
milk and water and regarding each other with kindly eyes

359
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:35,660
and Buddha says good good anruda and Friends

360
00:40:38,339 --> 00:40:45,079
and then he says but I hope you're living diligently keen and resolute

361
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:53,820
so diligent having assuring care and Consciousness in one's work and duties

362
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:59,599
Keen having or shown eagerness or enthusiasm

363
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:06,960
resolute admirably purposeful determined and unwavering

364
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,540
and they say indeed sir we live diligently and then the Buddha

365
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:20,838
says again but how do you live this way and anruda answers

366
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:27,180
in this case sir whoever returns first from alms round prepares the seat and

367
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:34,800
puts out the drinking water and the rubbish bin if there's anything left over whoever returns last eats it if they like

368
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:41,339
otherwise they throw it out where there is little that grows or drop it into water that has no living

369
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:47,520
creatures then they put away these seats drinking water and rubbish bin and sweep the

370
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:54,599
refractory if someone sees that the pot of water for dishwashing drinking or the toilet is empty they set it up

371
00:41:54,599 --> 00:42:01,560
if he can't do it he summons another with a wave of the hand and they set it up by lifting it with her hands but we

372
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:07,800
don't break into speech for that reason and every five days we sit together for the whole night and discuss the

373
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:16,380
teachings that is how we live diligently keen and resolute and the Buddha says good good on Ruda

374
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:23,640
and Friends so I'm gonna wrap it up

375
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:29,520
and tomorrow night I'll continue and the Buddha goes on so you can listen to talk if you're

376
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:38,040
interested or not right but the Buddha goes on and talks about the Corruptions that as they show up in meditation

377
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:43,560
and he only does that because he sees that they are living

378
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:51,000
in accordance with the dhamma the way we practice with each other in community affects our meditation

379
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,460
practice so I'll end with a quote by James

380
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:02,520
Baldwin the longer I live the more deeply I

381
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:08,579
learn that love whether we call it friendship or family or Romance

382
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:14,040
is the work of mirroring and manifesting each other's light

383
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:20,460
gentle work steadfast work life-saving work in those moments when

384
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:27,000
life and shame and sorrow occlude our own light from our view

385
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:34,440
but there is still a clear-eyed loving person to beam it back in our best moments we are that person

386
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,400
for another

387
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:46,578
May the benefit of our practice be for the benefit of all

388
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,800
thank you for your kind attention
