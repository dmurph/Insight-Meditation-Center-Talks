1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,759
so greetings greetings everybody welcome

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:15,800
welcome so this morning I want to drop in a

3
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,880
poem that uh reminds me a little bit of part of the Buddha's biography part of

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,759
the way in which he found his way to

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:36,000
Awakening and maybe it's a modernday version of uh part of H his

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,160
biography and I'll unpack that later during the dermat and it'll become

7
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,719
obvious to you once I drop in the poem but I I wanted to say just a few

8
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:54,920
words about uh poetry and that is that to fully enter a

9
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:03,320
poem there's a way in which we like must like stop and step away from our usual

10
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:09,200
way of showing up it's a right to really often like we don't think about people

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:16,560
reading poetry uh while they're doing something else instead it I tend to

12
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,880
think in this is my own experience I read poetry when I'm like SE seated when

13
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,520
I'm sitting down and have like a book in front of

14
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,960
me this ISS or yeah often like my the books I have at poetry are you know like

15
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,960
actual books no requirement for that but just this W like it's shifting out of uh

16
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,240
it's not something that I'm doing well I'm fixing a meal or walking or you know

17
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,399
sometimes we see people with their uh devices while they're walking or something like that but instead it's

18
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,280
like to stop and pay attention to a poem is a

19
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:04,240
way to help kind of like bring that poem to life and so often like we're just caught

20
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:11,640
up in getting from one place to another doing one thing and then the next thing and often like there isn't a compelling

21
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:18,640
reason to just stop except this is what mindfulness practice can be now I don't have to stop

22
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,760
but maybe a meditation practice to take a meditation posture and we might say

23
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:31,160
that poetry is also a way that encourages to stop and enter into to a

24
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:38,840
different way of being with the moment kind of like interrupt this

25
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,879
momentum that we often have with whatever is compelling us to go on and

26
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:52,720
on to the next moment so poetry is a way that really encourages us to stop

27
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,560
and really enter into the world that it is offering us

28
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:11,280
so with that as an introduction let's take a meditation

29
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:24,440
posture arriving into this

30
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:33,439
moment putting aside all the going and doing and in some kind of way stopping

31
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:39,799
we might even say allowing this

32
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,200
moment connecting

33
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,799
connecting to the experiences of this

34
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,680
moment most likely those experiences include pressure against the body where

35
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,199
the body meets the sitting surface

36
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:45,199
we sitting in a chair and using a back rest or a couch perhaps it might be

37
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,280
pressure against the

38
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:04,039
back pressure against the back side the

39
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,720
btics feeling that we're planted here we

40
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:16,120
here this location right now this

41
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,919
moment pressure on the back of the legs

42
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:44,520
and to the feet whatever they are [Music]

43
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,638
touching going to the top of the body

44
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,759
feeling into the

45
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,720
face sometimes there can be tension around the eyes or the

46
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:29,520
jaw mouth just noticing

47
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:46,919
just noticing it might be that our

48
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:57,319
noticing brings a softness or ease of any tightness and it might not be too

49
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:30,759
NE sometimes the back of the neck can have some tension

50
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:36,360
can that be okay

51
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:06,759
the shoulders letting the shoulder blades

52
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:10,199
slight down the

53
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:22,159
back the chest

54
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,839
remember belly

55
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:10,959
and embodying this

56
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,399
moment inhabiting this

57
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,839
moment experiencing this

58
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,360
moment e

59
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,959
tuning into the sensations of

60
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:16,720
breathing the experience of the body

61
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,320
breathing e

62
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:15,399
and when the mind wanders it doesn't have to be a

63
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:22,279
problem very simply gently Begin

64
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
Again

65
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
e

66
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

67
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120

68
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

69
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,079
e e

70
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:48,959
and we [Music] allow this meditation

71
00:14:49,880 --> 00:15:00,399
period to be an opportunity to stop all the goings and comings

72
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:07,240
and just be with this

73
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,160
moment as best we can as best we

74
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
can

75
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920

e e

79
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:15,280
and the story that the tradition has about

80
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,280
the

81
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:30,760
Buddha his biography his spiritual Quest

82
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,480
it begins with him meeting the Heavenly

83
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,919
Messengers old age sickness and

84
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:05,799
death there was something about without seeing that that stirred him roused

85
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,320
him to seek an end to suffering

86
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:40,080
what happens when we encounter Heavenly

87
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:51,399
Messengers can it be a support for our practice for our life

88
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:15,039
there's a poem I'd like to drop in it's by padrao

89
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,520
Tuma it's called The Facts of

90
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:29,919
Life The Facts of Life by Padre go Tuma

91
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:37,720
that you were born and you will

92
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:45,480
die that you will sometimes love enough and sometimes

93
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:50,799
not that you will lie if only to

94
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:57,559
yourself that you will get tired that you will learn most from the

95
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:01,440
situations you did not

96
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:10,039
choose that there will be some things that move you more than you can

97
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:16,278
say that you will live that you must be

98
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:23,960
loved that you will avoid questions most urgently in need of your

99
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:32,640
attention that you began as the fusion of a sperm and an egg of two people who

100
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,799
once were strangers and may well still

101
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:48,480
be that life isn't fair that life is sometimes good and

102
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:57,960
sometimes even better than good that life is often not so good

103
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:06,080
that life is real and if you can survive it well

104
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:16,679
survive it well with love and art and meaning given where meanings

105
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,919
scarce that you will learn to live with regret that you will learn to live with

106
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:27,919
respect

107
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:37,000
that the structures that constrict you may not be permanently

108
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:43,200
constricting that you will probably be

109
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:49,760
okay that you must accept change before you die but you will die

110
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,840
anyway so you might as well live and you

111
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,880
might as well love you might as well well

112
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,679
love you might as well

113
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:16,400
love Facts of Life by padrao

116
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:40,279
effects of Life by pedre Guma that you were born and you will

117
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:46,320
die that you will sometimes love enough and sometimes

118
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:52,600
not that you will lie if only to yourself that you will get

119
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:58,840
tired that you will learn most from the situations you did not choose

120
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:04,399
that there will be some things that move you more than you can

121
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:09,880
see that you will live that you must be

122
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:16,559
loved that you will avoid questions most urgently in need of your

123
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,960
attention that you began as the fusion of a sperm and an egg of two people who

124
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:30,320
once were strangers and may well still be

125
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:37,360
that life is unfair that life is sometimes good and sometimes even better than good that

126
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,720
life is often not so good that life is

127
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:51,440
real and if you can survive it well survive it well with love and art and

128
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:58,520
meaning given where meaning scarce that you will learn to live with

129
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:04,120
regret that you will learn to live with respect that the structures that

130
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:11,039
constrict you may not be permanently constricting that you will probably be

131

133
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,679
well not

134
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:54,880
what if this poem were Heavenly

135
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,240
Messengers for you

136
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

137
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,158
e e

138
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:43,499
for [Music]

139
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:52,320
[Music]

140
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:03,900
[Music]

141
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:29,600
this poem The Facts of Life by P go

142
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:37,799
Tuma but uh for me when I first read this it it uh had an impact on

143
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:45,519
me um there's something you know so often like poetry is as I said earlier

144
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:52,240
like you know it's a change in perspective or helps us to see things differently and I really felt like oh

145
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,600
yeah this did help me to see things differently one thing it helped me to

146
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:04,039
see is that sometimes I have a bias that poetry should just be uplifting and uh

147
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:09,760
you know enjoyable or something like this but there's something about this

148
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:16,159
poem its directness um saying things that uh I

149
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:23,000
feel like we don't want to say but feels like so much in line with the

150
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,080
Dharma right the first Noble truth is you know there is Dua

151
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:36,440
and in some ways this is what patri otuma is saying in this poem as well and he's saying it in a way that uh

152
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:44,600
feels relevant and feels for me touching and I I'll talk about

153
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:51,200
this or I'll just start I'm making this personal here but this uh one sentence

154
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:57,240
that you began as the fusion of a sperm and an egg of two people who once Were

155
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:03,760
Strangers and may well still be it's funny how right when we think

156
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:09,159
about time well yeah most of us when we think about time we usually do it in

157
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:14,360
relationship to ourselves you know this was when I was young I guess this might

158
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:19,840
be like when I'm older or somehow later or something like this but this whole

159
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:25,760
idea a fusion of a sperm and an egg of two people who once Were Strangers two

160
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:31,000
people who once Were Strangers kind of like transports us to another time when

161
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,159
we're not at the center of it right there's like we don't even exist yet but

162
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:42,919
and yet there's still a little bit of a personal feeling to it I love

163
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:48,840
this it's a way to like honor our parents of two strangers at one time

164
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:56,080
they didn't even know one another and then just this strict clinical biological thing of a fusion of a sperm

165
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:02,360
and an egg helps kind of like take us out of the middle of

166
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:07,519
everything and in some ways this is a deep not self teaching how we're

167
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:14,519
actually not at the center of everything even though you know we imagine that we are and we

168
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:19,960
experience that we are and we think that we are but turns out we're

169
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:27,399
not and another thing that about this poem that I think is really uh beautiful

170
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:34,799
is he starts with that you were born and you will die and we recognize this as

171
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:41,039
one of the Heavenly Messengers right death is like okay we know this but then

172
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:47,880
this one that you will sometimes love enough and sometimes not like this feels

173
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:54,039
a little bit more personal like oh yeah like we don't always get it perfect we

174
00:32:54,039 --> 00:33:01,000
don't always get it right and maybe sometimes we have fear fear that gets in the way or like maybe we don't even know

175
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:08,000
what gets in the way but sometimes there we haven't loved enough and sometimes we

176
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:13,480
have and can we allow the fullness of our life the things that we did well the

177
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:19,200
things that we didn't do so well can we allow it to be there instead of trying

178
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,720
to run away from those things that we didn't do so well and only Embrace those

179
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:30,799
things that we did well or maybe we can't even see clearly like what is the difference between loving enough and not

180
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:37,880
loving enough and the poet he includes that you

181
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:44,880
will get tired just one sentence that you will get tired like we don't have like you know

182
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:51,960
the story of the Buddha you know this Relentless you know movement towards Awakening and we have this idealized

183
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:58,360
version of ourself and our heroes and you know stories that we often neglect

184
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:04,840
this part that you will get tired I love it it just kind of like

185
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:12,320
brings the humanity into our lives brings the fullness of our experience into

186
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:19,560
life and then the next line that you will learn most from the situations you did not

187
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:28,760
choose yeah there's a way in which um

188
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:36,280
I mean it's it's almost a a cliche right that I wouldn't wish this on anybody but

189
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:43,079
you know I learned a lot from it or something like this and maybe maybe that's helpful

190
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:49,280
maybe it's not helpful but if the things that we choose are things that are comfortable and

191
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:56,118
familiar and turns out that's not where the greatest growth happens and there's a part of us that knows that that

192
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:01,320
recognize that and

193
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:09,320
then how could I not mention this whole idea of love in this poem that uh love gets mentioned

194
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:15,680
throughout this poem and is like sprinkled in like sometimes we will love enough sometimes it won't that you will

195
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:22,359
live that you must be loved and that we must love he throws in

196
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:31,559
here at the end right that uh you might as well love you might as well

197
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:39,040
love what does it mean to love to love

198
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:46,599
ourselves to love our life such as it is to love

199
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,800
others and what does it mean to just love without any particular object just

200
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:57,119
radiating love despite all these things that

201
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:04,599
happen in our our life despite all the way that our life

202
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:08,960
didn't turn out the way that we thought it was going

203
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:20,920
to I'll read this poem The Facts of Life by Padre go

204
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:28,440
Tuma what would it be like to hear these as if they were Heavenly Messengers

205
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:35,040
modern day Heavenly Messengers that you were born and you

206
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:42,720
will die that you will sometimes love enough and sometimes

207
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:49,160
not that you will lie if only to yourself that you will get

208
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:55,079
tired that you will learn most from the situations you did not

209
00:36:55,079 --> 00:37:02,160
choose that there will be some things that move you more than you can

210
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,520
say that you will live that you must be

211
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:14,440
loved that you will avoid questions most urgently in need of your

212
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:21,599
attention that you began as the fusion of a sperm and an egg of two people who

213
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:27,720
once were strangers and may well still be

214
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:35,319
that life isn't fair that life is sometimes good and sometimes even better than

215
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:43,160
good that life is often not so good that life is real and if you can

216
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:50,920
survive it will survive it will with love and art and meaning given where

217
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:57,560
meanings scarce that you will learn to love with regret

218
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:06,880
that you will learn to live with respect that the structures that constrict you may not be permanently

219
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:14,640
constricting that you will probably be okay that you must accept change before

220
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:24,040
you die but you will die anyway so you might as well live and you might as well

221
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:31,599
love you might as well love you might as well

222
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:40,559
love and I think I'll end there this

223
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:52,200
morning you might as well love they're part of The Facts of

224
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:57,720
Life how might that show up for you today

225
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:02,839
