00:03:51,920 --> 00:04:00,080
settings um so that accidental unmuting will go away

32
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:06,959
the possibility of that and also the chat will become host only in case my sound

33

34
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:20,239
quiet uh for the duration of the guided meditation and um the little dormant and last

35
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:28,560
but not the least i'm going to turn on recording and it's going to ask you whether you got it or leave meeting wait for it

wait for it it's gonna come okay hi welcome

37
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:44,240
so so for the theme of our practice

38
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:52,720
today um i'd like to invite us to to continue to explore

39
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,639
um the breath on the last time we practiced together on

40
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,000
wednesday i introduced um some ideas from this

41
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,240
book i've been listening to this audiobook called breath by james nestor

42
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,680
and and we did some experiments together as a

43
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,360
sangha and also i got some emails but people would listen to the audio and experimented so

44
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,759
we're gonna continue with the breath experimenting with meta and breath similarly and slightly

45
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:34,720
differently we're having learned from our experiments perhaps so here's here are the

46
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,320
the ways to to consider the practice for tonight so

47
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:50,160
so the practice of meta loving-kindness is both a cultivation practice

48
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,720
it's also considered a practice of concentration or samadhi

49
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:03,759
samata practice where the mind gets settled settled quiet peaceful

50
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:10,479
and perhaps absorptions states of jhana can arise

51
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,960
so practicing meta really has this dual effect both the cultivation of the

52
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,319
heart the good will for others for oneself as well as the settling of the mind

53
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:29,360
really subtly so bringing in bringing in

54
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,759
the slowing down of the breath and supposedly based on some studies the

55
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:43,600
optimal breath rate is about six seconds per in breath sex six seconds per out breath

56
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:51,599
and the exhale especially elongating exhale seems to be important so that

57
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,800
can really support the calming and settling of the mind

58
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:04,319
so so [Music] the invitation would be as

59
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:11,280
as we'll go through some of the categories tonight and i'll leave a lot more space silent

60
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,440
space for you to experiment with the pacing i'll i'll start with the phrases to set the

61
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:24,639
phrasing and then we'll also simplify the phrases instead of perhaps trying all the four

62
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,240
phrases as we did last time which might have been too much to juggle for

63
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,759
for some and became a little overwhelming okay okay there's the breath there's the feeling of meta

64
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:43,759
there's the elongating there's the exhale like oh what do i do so so we will simplify and it's

65
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:49,520
perfectly fine to work with simplified phrases

66
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:56,960
we sometimes work with the four phrases you be safe happy healthy and have ease and

67
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,840
it's also fine to work with a simplified phrase may you be well may i be well and really bring in more

68
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,960
emphasis to the feeling to the feeling of meta so maybe tonight we'll simplify the

69
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,160
the phrase if you wish if the simplified phrase after a while you want to bring

70
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:22,160
on all four phrases you're welcome to and also bringing

71
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,840
attention to the to the breath of the slow down breath they're roughly five

72
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,200
and a half uh in breath and out breaths per second so

73
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:39,599
and um let me see if there's anything else to set the

74
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,800
frame maybe i'll pause for a moment and ask if there are any questions

75
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:51,120
uh unusually so before i start if you actually tell you what if

76
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:58,800
you have questions i'll be saying a lot more during the guided meditation so i'll all become clear we'll all become clear

77
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:06,839
especially if it isn't so it's all good so let's just start together let's start practicing

78
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,000
together so landing

79
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:23,839
landing in the body

80
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:37,200
landing in this moment

81
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,200
inviting first and foremost inviting your body to rest

82
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:51,839
to let go

83
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,560
of anything that's not needed in this moment any tension

84
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,480
any extra thoughts plans from today

85
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,600
for the future memories of the past

86
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,839
as if you were putting down

87
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:28,000
as if you were putting down the heavy weight on your shoulders or plans and memories

88
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,600
ah feeling lighter feeling lighter just coming to this moment

89
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:47,839
taking refuge in this moment

90
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:02,320
feeling your feet and the floor if you're sitting on the

91
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:09,440
cushion your lower legs connecting to the earth

92
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,959
letting go of the weight of the weight of the lower body

93
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,839
onto the earth

94
00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:00,079
feeling your sit bones your bottom contacting the cushion or

95
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:06,000
the chair ah letting go of the weight of the upper

96
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:25,839
body releasing releasing onto your sit bones

97
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,839
fighting your belly your lower abdomen to relax and soften

98
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,720
ah letting go internally

99
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,839
inviting the chest

100
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:08,800
to soften the heart center the proverbial heart

101
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:17,360
center in the center of the chest inviting your heart to relax

102
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:26,560
a quote-unquote center of emotions letting your heart rest in this moment

103
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:35,200
whatever has been arising is okay

104
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,360
can all rest and feel safe

105
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,839
softening the arms the hands

106
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:03,839
letting gravity pull down

107
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,760
relaxing the shoulders and the neck

108
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,399
the face

109
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:35,600
letting the eyes rest their socket the forehead to relax

110
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:45,839
to jaw to unwind

111
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,279
for your scalp

112
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,839
to settle

113
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:20,560
nowhere to be nothing to do but to greet

114
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:30,000
to embrace this moment intimately

115
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,879
with the in-breath and the out-breath

116
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:43,839
moving right now naturally letting them be natural throughout the body

117
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:55,839
the natural breath through the body

118
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:14,640
now keeping keeping the attention receptive attention

119
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,839
in the body maybe in the lower abdomen

120
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:33,840
the sensations of the body

121
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,000
ever so slowly

122
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:04,240
elongating slowing down the in-breath and the out-breath

123
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:15,679
both this time okay and

124
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,919
count to five one breathing five

125
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,320
breathing out five one two three four five

126
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,600
breathing in front

127
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:43,840
breathing out five one two three

128
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:57,840
breathing again

129
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,600
now breathing in six

130
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,799
breathing out six one two three

131
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,240
breathing in six

132
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,840
breathing out six

133
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:54,000
breathing out six one two three four five

134
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:07,280
six breathing and six

135
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:21,840
thank you

136
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,840
this

137
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,320
letting the breath be a count of six but increasing the out breath to a count

138
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,519
of seven even slower out breath

139
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:57,600
four five six in breath one two three four

140
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:13,840
five six seven out of breath

141
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:48,240
now letting the counting should drop

142
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:56,400
but maintaining letting the slower rhythm of breathing in

143
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,760
and the slower rhythm of breathing out

144
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:12,480
stay no counting needed you know the rhythm now

145
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,200
trust it

146
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,840
close enough is good enough

147
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:34,000
letting the exhale be long and full letting go at the end of the exhale

148
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,080
relaxing softening

149
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:47,840
the body the mind

150
00:24:53,039 --> 00:25:02,240
now with this expansive rhythm of the breath

151
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:09,279
received in the body

152
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,640

drenched in metal

201
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:52,079
branching your own heart slowly slowly with each breath

202
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:01,599
in good will and care

203
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,839
bury yourself

204
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,560
and for the last moments of practice

205
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:30,319
shining a good will slowly

206
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:35,839
patiently unto all beings

207
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,400

making sure you are included in all beings

211
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:55,359
meta touching you first as it leaves your heart shining

212
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,838
onto the whole world

213
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,680
may all beings be well

214
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:55,838
may all beings be free

215
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:23,838
thank you all for your practice

216
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:32,880
so i feel a deep calm

217
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,838
slowness sense of well-being

218
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,720
that wasn't here when we started

219
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:52,240
so calm that i don't want to talk i wonder if that is similar for you

220
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:58,318
i see some of you still have your eyes closed

221
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:10,319
so i think there is genuinely something to

222
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:18,079
this to this these various research studies about

223
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:24,560
a slowed breath roughly six seconds for in-breath and out-breath as i

224
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:29,760
mentioned last time roughly the same length of time that takes

225
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:35,440
to chant some of the well-known buddhist chant with his

226
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:41,519
chants as well as christian ones it turns out

227
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:50,400
so we'd love to hear your reflections what you've noticed what's coming up for you you can type in

228
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:56,079
chat if it's to everyone else read your name as well as the reflection

229
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:01,200
if it's just to me i'll only read the reflection not your name

230
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:06,560
you're welcome to raise your hand too reports from the field

231
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:14,400
questions comments and bill says yes this was very calming

232
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,920
yeah thank you bill for sharing that reflection

233
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:28,560
and this is the sense of samadhi stillness calming the mind settling the mind

234
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:35,040
which can both which can arise both from the practice of meta alone

235
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:41,920
as well as on the panasonic mindfulness of the breath so we're really bringing these practices

236
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:48,880
together here and it's almost like supercharging the calming effect

237
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:56,800
this the sense of well-being and self-well beings like a sense of mehta through the sense of meta and the

238
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:04,160
sense of well-being that i feel more of there's more available when i have a sense of well-being

239
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:09,839
i have more mental more good will to share with others not just with myself but i have more

240
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:14,880
capacity to share with others

241
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:25,119
lish says may both of us who was both oops

242
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:31,200

243
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:38,079
invited us to bring the beer being and then i invited for the self to join them so both the

244
