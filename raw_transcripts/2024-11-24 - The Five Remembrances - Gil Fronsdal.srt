1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:07,760
yes good morning everyone welcome to IMC and hearing this idea that it's

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:14,839
Thanksgiving week and I suppose the right theme would be Thanksgiving thanks

3
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:21,519
gratitude but that's not what I have on my mind and I

4
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:28,039
will you know somewhat you know amusingly defend myself by telling you a

5
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:35,640
little story that um Joseph Goldstein who's one of the founding teachers of this Western

6
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:42,200
Insight movement um still alive very senior teacher now and brilliant man

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:50,719
great practitioner uh he uh said once that the first time he was asked to officiate a

8
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:58,760
wedding um he was expected or asked to give a little Dharma talk as part of that and the D Dharma talk he gave was a

9
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,920
talk on death

10
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:12,040
so that gives me a little bit of license here for for what you're going to

11
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,560
hear so um the topic is the five

12
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,720
remembrances and I'll tell you what they are as we go along some of you know they're kind of a famous set of things

13
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:32,680
to reflect on and the Buddha said uh when he taught them he said this is something that uh all people whether

14
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,600
they're Lei or monastic should regularly reflect on these five

15
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:45,200
remembrances but I'll start with a first a little personal anecdote and lead to a

16
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,719
little story about the Buddha uh and this kind of points to one way in which

17
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:56,399
these five remembrances carry a certain kind of value for me or emotional

18
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,880
Association or meanings meaning when I was

19
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:09,720
11 uh I was with my parents visiting Nepal which back then I was visited

20
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,319
again 20 years later and I was uh amazed how radically it had changed I don't

21
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:21,120
think there were any asphalted roads in Katmandu and it was like a small town

22
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,319
almost and um but uh one day we were

23
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:35,480
walking around town and uh near a river and we saw some uh people carrying a

24
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:41,800
stretcher uh with a body wrapped in blankets and the body was small enough

25
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:49,800
that it was certainly that of a small child and they were bringing it down to the river as far as I could tell to um

26
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:57,239
to cremate the baby cremate that was a baby I think it was a small child uh to to cremate it and

27
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:03,360
um and that was my first encounter with someone who had died I couldn't

28
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,000
actually see the person because of the blanket and uh it did make an impression

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,920
on me uh it didn't it wasn't like an unfavorable impression or a frightening

30
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,360
impression but there was something um in retrospect like I think about it these

31
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:26,360
days uh I was witnessing something that had been going on in the ancient world

32
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:33,959
maybe ancient Indian subcontinent for thousands of years later 20 years later I did go to

33
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:40,480
varasi and where they do have the famous uh burning Pires where they cremate

34
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,959
people and was there to saw some of that and but there was something kind of almost like natural almost like part of

35
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,079
the natural world as an unnatural as we might say it as the death of a child

36
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:57,519
there was something uh very simple and natural about what they were doing it

37
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,079
just seemed like it was a Timeless kind of event so I never thought about it too much but

38
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:09,159
there was something that kind of was in the back of my mind or in my heart this event as a

39
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:14,840
child and then when I came to Buddhism uh I learned about uh the

40
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:21,680
Buddha before he was enlightened and he also had grown up as maybe this young

41
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:28,720
person had in what is now Nepal uh in the fill of the Himalayas so

42
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,120
it was nearby where he he grew up and uh there's a story that Buddhists tell

43
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:40,720
about his upbringing and that is that he um didn't predict had been predicted at

44
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:48,440
his birth that he would become he might become a renunciant go off and be a monk

45
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:54,000
a religious Wanderer who has no possessions and engage in spiritual

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,800
practice but this was not to the liking of his father who was the king who

47
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,440
needed and wanted to have his son follow in the family

48
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,039
business and uh so the father did what he could to prevent his son from

49
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,600
encountering a suffering in the world to keep him entertained or engaged with

50
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:22,199
education with entertainment with sports with probably all kinds of warrior

51
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:28,919
trainings that was important for the royalty at that time so uh the young

52
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:34,880
Buddha to be was quite engaged and so he lived inside the Royal compounds and

53
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,400
there were apparently three of them so between different seasons he could be moved between the different places and

54
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,280
kept kept distracted from fundamental human

55
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,840
experiences of suffering and he wasn't as 11-year-old out there in Katmandu

56
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:59,759
seeing the child being carry down to the Pyers and not until he was 27 that he

57
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:07,360
began getting restless and it was a little bit like The Truman Show those of you who know the movie so so at some point he felt

58
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:14,240
like he had to kind of go go beyond the walls and um and he did he went at night

59
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:20,160
or early in the morning and and uh with his charioteer and they went driving

60
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,800
through town and around and the first time they went they saw an old person

61
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:34,400
and somehow the Buddha had never seen a really old person before and um and so he asked the

62
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:41,080
Chariot here what is that and the Chariot here said something like well that's an old

63
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:47,919
person and it's the nature of all of us to become old and the story doesn't say this but I

64
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:56,599
could almost imagine the Buddhist said really and then the next day they did it

65
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:03,919
again and this time they saw a sick person quite sick and

66
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:10,440
um and the Buddha asked again what is that and the Chariot Chariot here said

67
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:17,960
well that's a sick person it's the nature of all of us to become ill

68
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:24,800
really and then the third time they went out they saw a dead person maybe the

69
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:32,479
symbol or scene that I'd seen someone with people carrying a stretcher with a body wrapped in shrouds and taking it to

70
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:40,120
the to the burning fires and uh so the fact that Buddha saw

71
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,879
this you know I imagine you know the scene that I had in Nepal and by the river Katmandu was it wasn't a village

72
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:52,720
but it was you know it was dirt roads and you could just get out to the river easily and it was this you know it had

73
00:07:52,720 --> 00:08:00,120
clo probably closer to the ancient times than it is now and the smog is there

74
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:07,560
and um and uh so the same thing happened the Buddha said what is this and Jer here

75
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,360
said it it's a dead person we all have the nature to

76
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,918
die so then the Buddha went

77
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:30,639
out the Buddha went out uh a fourth time and this time they

78
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,120
saw a renunciant they saw a religious mendicant walking through the

79
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,320
streets calmly state state stately way just calmly

80
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:49,480
self-possessed walking the Buddha had never seen a person in this kind of way this kind of calm this kind of

81
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,519
peacefulness this kind of stately kind of way that being kind of mindful and present for their experience as they

82
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,680
walked and uh everyone else is running around doing things

83
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:06,240
and the Buddha said what is that and the charot here explained well that's a

84
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,680
religious mendicant that's someone who has left the home life to find out

85
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:18,079
what's true and to become free and uh so then the Buddha so the

86
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:24,519
these four uh sites the Buddha Saw made a big impression on him and perhaps

87
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:31,600
being 27 you can imagine like if you hadn't seen anything like this before I mean why wow this is part of life

88
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:38,040
too and um and then the very thing his father feared the Buddha did then he

89
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:44,959
jumped over the walls and went with his charioteer uh across to the to the river

90
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:50,720
I guess the border of the country and gave all his royal royal Garb and jewels

91
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,160
to the charioteer and crossed the river and into the woods to live auncient life

92
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:02,320
to to find his own Awakening which it took seven years for him to

93
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,839
find and when he did then he started to teach and his teachings have continued

94
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:15,000
to today and his leaving the home life to go off

95
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,200
and find his Awakening is one of the conditions for all of us to be here today we wouldn't be here we'd be doing

96
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,880
something else today um but somehow that set in motion something that brought people here to

97
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:33,440
places like IMC that people find very meaningful and very important and

98
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,480
supportive to for them and maybe for their own uh seeking their own discovery

99
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:45,120
of Freedom their own kind of waking up to this life and contending and dealing

100
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,600
with the fundamental human sufferings that we all have to approach at some

101
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:56,320
point and so uh so that's Su somehow sometimes summarized under this

102
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:03,880
expression sickness old age and death and um there's a famous story that kind

103
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,360
of in this in this theme that a few hundred years

104
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,440
after the Buddha there was a king king Asoka who's considered considered to be

105
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:22,160
the first emperor of of India the first one to kind of conquer all of India and apparently he was a cruel king and a

106
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:29,440
vast vast Army and and um you know and conquering the territory

107
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:36,600
but one day and he eventually became the what the Buddhists say the first Buddhist King dedicated to

108
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,880
nonviolence but uh but when he before that he he was going around having these

109
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:48,000
big battles and after one big battle that he won uh he walked apparently by

110
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,279
himself across the battlefield and AC uh walking through

111
00:11:53,279 --> 00:12:01,000
all the carcasses of soldiers who had died apparently it was pretty awful thousands and thousands of solders had

112
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,639
died and I we don't know what impact it was for him to walk through all that death and Carnage that he was

113
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:15,680
responsible for and then lo and behold walking through the field was a Buddhist

114
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,800
monk and the Buddhist monk uh was walking calmly with certain

115
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,880
kind of self-possession peacefully mindfully and the contrast between the

116
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:34,680
Carnage and this peacefulness of this Monk um uh made a big impression on the

117
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:40,440
king and the King went to talk to him and monk explained he was a disciple of

118
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:46,000
the Buddha and the King said something like you know what does he

119
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,560
teach and uh the monk responded

120
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:59,480
hatred never ends through hatred by Love Alone does hatred end

121
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:05,399
this is the ancient truth and with that the king renounced

122
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:10,880
violence renounced war and he still stayed King and Emperor of ruled this

123
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:17,360
vast territory but supposedly that was the turning point for him to become um

124
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,079
dedicated to nonviolence and supporting people and apparently he

125
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:29,399
created hospitals or for for animals and just took care of things kind of made it

126
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:36,839
dramatic turn and so uh so we come to us we come to the

127
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:42,480
five remembrances and this is one of the teachings of the Buddha he said as I

128
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,199
said that this is something to reflect on on a regular basis so I'll read them to

129
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:54,480
you and then say a few words well actually before I read them I

130
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,920
wanted to introduce them another way

131
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,880
that creates a context maybe for hearing this so we practice mindfulness here

132
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:13,519
that's what we're known for the primary thing we do and mindfulness is

133
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:20,360
something only you can do for yourself no one can do it for

134
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:28,800
you you can't uh you know Farm it out to someone call up the local you know Uber

135
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:34,920
like mindfulness service you know and and you know hire someone who comes over and does it for

136
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:42,959
you and and spare you the effort that would be nice right you have a lot to do why why spend time doing it

137
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,759
when you know you can get someone to I'm sure you can get people to come to your house to meditate for you I might even

138
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:57,360
come [Laughter] if and um so um but it doesn't it's not

139
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:04,279
really going to do any good for you in a deep way mindfulness is something we have to do for ourselves and there has

140
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:09,880
to be done out of free will it has to be done with your own capacity to decide to

141
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:16,480
engage to choose this is important and it belongs to a a family of inner mental

142
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:23,959
states that uh only only work if we choose them only work if we self-manage

143
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:31,519
them monitor them uh engage in them that we engage the capacity of choice to

144
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:39,199
track what's going on inside of us choose what to participate in and what not to participate in uh the monk who

145
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:44,360
was here in September Tanis abiku uh he has this teaching that he Likens the

146
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,160
mind to a corporate board where uh you're at a board

147
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,720
meeting and uh and all the board members you know you he the the chair has no

148
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:03,600
control over what the board members say they say all kinds of crazy things however the the chair has one

149
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,519
thing that the others don't have the chair has the veto power over anything

150
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:17,000
and so the mind is like that you don't have control over what your mind thinks and does but you do have uh veto power

151
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,600
you do have the ability to choose not to participate not to continue that not to invest in it not to Grant authority to

152
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:31,800
to whatever those things are and that difference makes a huge difference difference and for that kind of

153
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:37,440
monitoring and tracking and managing your inner life uh only you can do a lot

154
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:46,240
of this stuff it's really up to you and a lot of the practice is to learn how to better self-monitor

155
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:53,000
self-regulate and find Freedom in doing so uh in the autonomy of really being

156
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,079
able to you know manage yourself so that

157
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:05,360
when the Mind goes in a Direction that's going to make it more difficult for you you can you can say no you can let go

158
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:11,678
you can choose to engage the mind use the mind in ways that are supportive make things better make you

159
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:17,720
better opens up to something and in using that ability to choose that comes

160
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:24,600
from this kind of careful self manage management that mindfulness provides uh we find our

161
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:30,200
freedom we find our freedom to choose the freedom to be independent from

162
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:39,520
anything in terms of not being um not not being um the the servant of our

163
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:46,679
compulsions or the victims of our feelings and ideas and thoughts rather we learn and stay close

164
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:51,919
to that place of freedom and um and that's a remarkable

165
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:57,840
thing to learn that to become free of greed hatred and

166
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:04,240
illusion because we choose to VTO power which chose not to give into it to find

167
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,679
a place where we're free from attachments and

168
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:16,039
clinging that we're free from um needing to have an

169
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:21,440
identity or needing not to have an identity that we're simply

170
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:28,000
free in the world of having identities and not identities free even from

171
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,360
thinking about it and engaging in thoughts that participate in that it's a remarkable journey and part

172
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:42,840
of this journey of mindfulness is a journey of growing autonomy just like a young child or a

173
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:48,440
baby the Journey of a baby to adulthood one way of understanding it is is steps

174
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:54,360
in increasing degrees of autonomy first they maybe learn

175
00:18:54,360 --> 00:19:00,120
to eat for themselves then they learn to walk they learn to to dress themselves

176
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:06,880
they learn to take the bus to school by themselves alone they learn how to leave

177
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:14,320
home to go to college or go off to work find a home for themselves take care of their own finances and so you know

178
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:22,360
there's it's all this autonomy that that we learn growing up to become an adult I like to believe as an adult that

179
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:28,000
process of maturation continues but that sense of autonomy as an adult becomes

180
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,880
increasingly internal it's increasingly and that's why mindfulness so helpful increasingly

181
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:41,520
be able to track ourselves know ourselves well enough know what our impulses are our compulsions know what

182
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:47,840
our choices are know our biases and our beliefs more and more so that we're not

183
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,360
caught by our inner life we're not we don't caught in our

184
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:07,440
autonomy and uh and uh so that if we get angry we don't have to act

185
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:14,240
angrily so that if we are feel shy we don't have to act shy we can we have the

186
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,600
freedom to act in spite of it all these ways in which as we grow up we learn to

187
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:26,679
not to be caught in the things that limit us inhibit us that act for forces

188
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:32,000
us to act in ways that later we regret and so in all kinds of ways we're

189
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,240
learning this as we kind of until that lesson of learning that autonomy and

190
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:44,080
that freedom to track oursel and know ourselves kind of comes to a

191
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:50,640
culmination when we're going to die I think of it as the last time that

192
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,919
we have a chance to learn this lesson no one can die for

193
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:02,840
us you can't you know call up the you know the dying people and say can you do

194
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:08,000
it for me now I'm busy so I

195
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,159
can't and uh it's really a very personal thing and there's some people die people

196
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:20,600
die in so many different ways but this kind of the general kind of image I have

197
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:29,679
of dying in a gradual kind of healthy way is um is uh things start fading away

198
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:36,400
and sometimes eyesight Fades away hearing Fades away um people sometimes are closing their eyes the external

199
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:43,960
world really doesn't really pull them anymore even if the loved ones are there it becomes a very internal personal

200
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:50,080
world there's no one to help at that point and so now it becomes the last

201
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:58,279
place to learn that autonomy can we find Freedom there too is there freedom in dying or are we

202
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:05,840
going to die afraid angry worried what's what is the you know this whole process

203
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:11,760
of autonomy can come to a final conclusion here to learn it there as

204
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:21,799
well so with that as introduction I'll read you the five remembrances

205
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:36,679
so it's um stated in the first person meaning the Buddha saying this is what

206
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:42,400
you should be doing on a regular basis have these remembrances you should say to

207
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:48,120
yourself I am subject to

208
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:55,480
aging and I'm not free from aging I am subject to

209
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:04,640
illness and I'm not free from illness from getting ill I am subject to

210
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:11,960
death and I have not gone beyond death I'm not free from

211
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:20,480
dying that's three the fourth one I will become different and separate

212
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:27,679
from all that is dear and appealing to me I'll become separate from some way

213
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:33,000
from all the people that I love one way or the other that separation will

214
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:43,200
happen and the fifth one I am the owner of my actions heir to my actions

215
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:50,440
born from my actions related to my actions and have my actions as my

216
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:59,400
refuge I should be the air of whatever Deeds I do whether beautiful or bad

217
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:05,440
the word Deeds is same is karma whatever Karma I do whether beautiful or

218
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:11,840
bad so these are the fundamental kind of in a sense truths of human life maybe

219
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:18,600
they're unwelcome truths maybe we don't want to call them truths maybe some people would call them

220
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:25,640
realities that uh the Buddha was kept distracted from maybe because he was so acutely

221
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:31,200
aware of what happened to him growing up uh he as he teach gives us teachings the he

222
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:41,000
says the reason he's teaching it is because uh it's so easy to get um um uh

223
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,440
enamored intoxicated absorbed preoccupied with

224
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:55,880
youth to get lost lose P perspective of how this world really is uh when we're

225
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:02,880
healthy and to get also in Amed and lost and enthused by the idea of being

226
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:09,840
alive or we forget we're so enthused by our loved ones that we forget that

227
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:18,240
sooner or later we will be separated maybe that's why Joseph Goldstein talked about death that death is part of being

228
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:26,640
married one of them if you stay married chances are one of you will die before the other it's can certainly be

229
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:33,159
tragic but just say I saw that child being carried Down To The

230
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:38,760
River To Die there's something ancient that goes

231
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:46,200
back thousands of years or more that one one part of a couple dies

232
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:52,360
before the other it's part of built into this world that we live so is this does

233
00:25:52,360 --> 00:26:00,000
does this evoke horror does this evoke evoke protests does this evoke running away and finding

234
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,360
you know seize the day and just let's go out and party or you know just ignore it

235
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:11,880
just live it up while we can the Buddha is suggesting otherwise he's suggesting

236
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:19,039
keep this in mind remember this and it does a few things one is then you're not

237
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:24,440
surprised when these things come and that that can count for a lot

238
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,760
you're prepared maybe for the Buddha he interpreted as a

239
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,720
as a as a meaning or as a indication that you should really

240
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:43,679
practice you should be prepared for this you shouldn't and you know it's very hard to practice Freedom non- clinging

241
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:49,840
compassion love for all in times of Crisis unless we've we're prepared for

242
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,520
it we' built up the strength of mindfulness the capacity the skills of self-

243
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:01,000
understanding and so it's better to start when you're young it's better to

244
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,200
build and grow with that and mindfulness will help

245
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,960
dramatically with this process of growing autonomy growing

246
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:18,080
freedom in relationship to our inner life which I propose is one of the

247
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:25,760
important tasks of adult life and um and so to remember I too

248
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:33,200
have the nature to get old I too have the nature natur to get sick I too have the nature to die I to have the nature

249
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:41,120
of being separated from everything that I love and and even care about one way or the other things change people change

250
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:48,640
all kinds of things so given that can we find

251
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:56,120
autonomy Freedom Choice decision making about our inner life in

252
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:03,159
relationship to health and sickness Youth and old

253
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:10,279
age being alive and dying being with what we love and being

254
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:16,679
separated from it can we turn inward so that we're not

255
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:24,519
on automatic pilot the compulsions the habits the the automatic impulses of our

256
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:30,240
beliefs our biases our expectations don't have the upper hand we have the

257
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:36,240
veto power so that we don't become a victim to these things we don't get

258
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:43,720
overwhelmed by them we don't go get agitated disturbed by them does that mean that we should just

259
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:53,559
accept them happily The veto power is has an amazing

260
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:59,600
capacity it can both say no to rejecting something

261
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:06,600
and to accepting it what's the third

262
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:12,360
option what where is that place of neither accepting nor

263
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,600
rejecting I suggest that's where your freedom is found if you have to accept

264
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:25,320
something you're not really really free and remember when you're neither AC

265
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:33,120
when you're accepting you're doing something when you're rejecting you're doing something is there a place in the

266
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,480
mind maybe a place of awareness mindfulness maybe a place of

267
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:47,360
Stillness quiet calm peace within that does not need to accept or

268
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,640
reject anything it can allow it to

269
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:58,640
be because that still quiet place within

270
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,440
is not being battered by the conditions of the world it's not being disturbed by

271
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:11,679
it it's not afraid of it it's not there's no clinging associated with it no attachments Associated we have this

272
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:17,039
place of freedom of non- clinging of

273
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:23,080
nonidentification of non um

274
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:31,679
reactivity there's a autonomy a freedom a from reactivity in this place of

275
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:37,399
freedom and what happens when we go to our

276
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:44,159
deathbed without practice what happens when we enter into a final phase of

277
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:49,440
life and we're sitting there and we watch the

278
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,120
Mind sitting there laying there in bed maybe watching the

279
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:03,360
mind and now we know we're familiar when certain attachments certain beliefs

280
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:09,639
come up that maybe we say no thank you don't have to do

281
00:31:09,639 --> 00:31:15,679
that there was a woman here at IMC who died so maybe

282
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:22,919
12 14 years ago and uh she died uh she became

283
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:28,120
amazingly aquanus and peaceful in her last weeks of her life it was really

284
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:33,880
remarkable and maybe some of you here who knew her went with people here IMC

285
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:39,080
would go to be with her at her last weeks partly because it was like being

286
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:45,200
with a saint it was kind of like being with this beautiful radiant peaceful person it was like contagious Daran

287
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:51,880
almost with her and I was I was with her and the few hours before she

288
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:58,240
died and uh and she was agitated after these weeks of so much peace

289
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,840
and she said to me the practice is no longer

290
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:10,799
working there's no idea no you know we don't know that our strength of our practice and mindfulness is going to be

291
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:16,200
there even so what happens when we can't even rely on

292
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:22,840
practice is freedom still possible is autonomy still to be found with that as

293
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:28,720
well so I and she was having a little bit of hallucinations I think that was part of it and she didn't know quite to

294
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:34,080
deal with these hallucinations and strange thoughts that were coming on because I think there were you know

295
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:40,960
brain chemistry changes and and um so I told her uh all you have

296
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,320
to do is don't believe them you don't have I said you don't have to practice

297
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,600
anymore all you have to do is don't believe those delusions those images and

298
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:57,840
things like that and she calmed down immediately the agitation went and then

299
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:04,919
and I wasn't there but a couple hours later she passed away she used the veto power don't have

300
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:11,120
to believe them she found her peace and there's a remarkable peace to

301
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:19,679
be had I believe because it's possible to become so in the moment so present so

302
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:25,240
much no longer participating in the normal course of thinking and believing

303
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:31,919
and and um imagining and judging and commentary

304
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:38,159
and having ideas about the future and ideas about the past where all that

305
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:44,679
quiets down there's a place inside where it's a it's a reference point to a place that's

306
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:54,360
an alternative to that where the past in the future

307
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:59,399
disappears not from the wherever the past is not from wherever the future is

308
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:04,440
waiting for us but it disappears in our mind disappears in our active engagement

309
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:09,720
and concerns and it's possible to find this

310
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:17,118
place of Stillness quiet of awareness inside as we're

311
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:22,839
dying where there is no

312
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:31,440
dying of course you're dying but thoughts of dying dying concerns about the future in 2 minutes

313
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:37,560
are irrelevant they're not interesting I you know how much the more time do I

314
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:43,398
have you know uh oh only two minutes you know I better you know

315
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:48,440
balance my checkbook before I go or I need to call my credit card and complain

316
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:53,878
about the extra bill I got I have important things to do no

317
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:59,200
no that you you have you have a much better thing to to

318
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,320
do you know better things to do than checking the clock

319
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,640
or you have know you have better things to do than to imagine two minutes from

320
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:16,599
now there's a place where there is no death in the mind that doesn't think

321
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:23,000
about that in the mind that's aware and awake that's not operating in on these

322
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,640
Concepts there is a place of no aging there is is a place or a state or

323
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:36,960
a way of being that's absent of sickness even while you're

324
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:43,800
sick and to find that place to find that way of being to be able to say no thank

325
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:50,319
you to all the forces to take us away from that is part of the veto power that

326
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:57,359
we have part of the letting go that we have and to learn that autonomy to learn

327
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:01,039
that capacity for freedom and

328
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:08,960
Independence I hope that that's one of the last things you do before you

329
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,720
die what a wonderful way to die I hope none of us die

330
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:22,359
afraid angry confused I hope we die

331
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:29,079
peacefully and that's what the Buddha did he learned that

332
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:35,680
he taught that and then he did it and the and the

333
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,720
image that's the Buddhist tradition provides for this is that

334
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:46,000
um uh he was walking back to his home country because that's what you did back

335
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,520
there was walk across across Northern India and it's kind of touching that he was walking

336
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:58,359
back but even for the Buddha he didn't make it he had his last wish I guess to

337
00:36:58,359 --> 00:37:06,880
go home but he didn't make it and he knew he was dying and he laid himself down between

338
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:13,400
two flowering Sal trees Majestic trees like the redwood trees of India I guess

339
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:20,640
and he laid himself down there and let people come visit him and have the last kind of words to the monks who were

340
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:27,720
there ask them are you sure you don't have any more questions about the teachings are you sure and they said

341
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:33,319
yeah we we have no more questions and then um he closed his eyes

342
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:39,599
and he went into a deep states of meditation deep states of peaceful meditation deep states of meditation

343
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:46,079
where past and future don't exist life and death don't exist in

344
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:54,920
terms of Concepts and orientations of things where there's freedom and peace and from there he passed

345
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:02,160
away what a great reference point for how we can live our lives to have

346
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:08,200
that as a as a model so the five remembrances and the

347
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:16,280
last one is um we are the heir to our actions and this this represents the uh

348
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:21,680
what we do makes a difference and what we do creates habits

349
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,839
what we do follows us what it do what we do shapes us who we are be care careful

350
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:36,400
with what you do what you say your actions how you live and um and that

351
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,839
care is exercising your capacity for autonomy

352
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:50,800
your capacity for decision making for yourself to make a decision to live a life a better life a good life

353
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:59,400
that brings you all the benefits of a life free of clinging to craving and

354
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:05,480
selfishness conceit so the five

355
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:12,240
remembrances you might remember them if they ever become

356
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:21,640
relevant so uh we have a few minutes before the polu and given that it's a polu it's it's nice if uh you set hello

357
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,760
to each other especially for those of you who might be new it's nice if someone says hello to you but everyone

358
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:33,119
including those you knew then can welcome the person you say hello to and you can talk a little bit about this

359
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:39,760
ideas of the talk how it's How it landed for you and what it evoked for you if you want there anything you want but

360
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:46,000
what I'd like to ask so say hello to maybe you know maybe one or two people next to you but uh but once you're with

361
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,240
someone look around make sure no one is sitting there alone because sometimes accidentally some people just turn the

362
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:58,760
opposite directions from you and you're like what do I do now and it's awkward right so just

363
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:05,520
everyone keep an eye out and include everyone say hello and and then when you're ready you can leave and and uh or

364
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:11,880
stay for the potluck and they'll take a few minutes for them to get everything set up so it's a nice thing to do here

365
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,160
so thank you for being here
