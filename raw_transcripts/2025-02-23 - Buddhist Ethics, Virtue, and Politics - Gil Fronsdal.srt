1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,319
so good morning everyone and so a couple of announcements so uh first I want to say

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:12,480
I'm so delighted when we do these polux and teas here on Sunday and people who stay and the sense of community that

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,600
comes and so you're all welcome to stay the fact that there's not a lot of food

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:26,199
is incidental to what we're doing the real thing is just coming together and and um and uh most of you

5
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:31,320
can probably if you don't get enough food at this meal

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,440
can Pro probably find a little bit more later in the day

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:44,399
somewhere so please stay don't don't be shy and uh and then also um many of you

8
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:51,920
know we've been doing this fundraising for save the children that was meant to go for about a week but we kept the the

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,160
Donate button up and um and so now um uh

10
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,640
we've raised $95,000 it doesn't show that on the save the

11
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,040
save the children um kind of site yet but it it will but that's pretty

12
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,439
impressive and um I guess it's not over officially it's over but things

13
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:21,360
money keeps being donated so who knows maybe we'll get to 100,000 it's it's

14
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,920
very inspiring to me uh just in general but also at these times that a community

15
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:35,280
of people can come together in this kind of way and collectively make such a big impression impact and it's almost a

16
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,320
statement uh of of what a community what a society can do at a time when we have

17
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:47,640
a society that's showing what it can take away what it can stop doing and uh to you know save the children is one of

18
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:54,880
those uh wonderful organizations that uh uh had a contract with the uh United

19
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,159
States agency of International Development uh to they were count on

20
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,000
money it was promised basically and then suddenly it was taken away and so all these people who were employed by them

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,480
all this food that they were bringing in medicine so it's kind of a tragic thing that to have happen the way it happened

22
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:19,360
and so but to have people step up as communities to I mean we're making only a small difference but it's a I think

23
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:26,200
it's a beautiful thing and I'm inspired by it and I want to thank you all participated and if you want to make a

24
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:32,000
donation still maybe we get up to 100,000 um uh it's still on IMCU website

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,760
that there's a red banner and on top and um

26
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,599
so um you know I've been thinking this last week just in general more than I

27
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,800
usually do what to teach because of uh National world

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:00,239
affairs and um and I would like to uh make a case that one of the very strong

29
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,000
contributions that Buddhism has to our society our world now and in general is

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,159
its emphasis on on ethics on virtue and that uh in ethics and virtue

31
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:19,040
maybe not is not the Super popular topic but that how what it's popular how it

32
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,280
comes in Buddhism is that it's also an expression a manifestation of what

33
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:30,159
happens to people when they do Buddhist practice if you do mindfulness well what

34
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,400
comes is a heightened sensitivity to yourself in the world and it's that

35
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:42,239
heightened sensitivity uh will almost in inevitably lead to what can be called an

36
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,400
ethical sensitivity a heightened ethical sensitivity because we start feeling

37
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:56,680
intimately in ourselves that um what harms ourselves how we we we kind of violate

38
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,760
ourselves even to use dramatic language uh we harm ourselves we shut ourselves

39
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,920
down we alienate ourselves from ourselves that when it h when we do things that are intentionally harmful

40
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,720
for others to others and um and also where there's a heightened ethical sensitivity to how

41
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:22,160
harm affects other people the our own way of harming people but also how they're harmed by others in our

42
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:30,240
society and the Buddha was clearly um uh Champion the idea that when we see harm

43
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,280
being done to others we should speak up that we shouldn't be passive about that

44
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,240
and so that this ethical sensitivity then we become increasingly sensitive to

45
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:49,120
to how people are being harmed by unethical Behavior by harmful behavior and and uh we do something

46
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,199
really good for ourselves if we know how from this place of ethical sensitivity

47
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:59,800
to speak up and the question is what is that speaking up look like how is it

48
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,560
different than being angry how's it different than responding from hate how

49
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:13,000
what what happens when we come from this deeper ethical sensitivity that Dharma practice inspires what does that look

50
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,360
like and one of the things it looks like it looks like it's in the classic Buddhist language it's virtue virtuous

51
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:26,600
it's ethical uh or even more classical is that um the language in Buddhism

52
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,440
would be that it's beautiful the one of the words words for ethics is beauty it's something

53
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:39,639
beautiful behavior and another uh word is wholesome and uh and wholesome in

54
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:45,360
English popularly I think kind of has a connotations of healthy so it's a healthy

55
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,600
response um U but I like the atmology of the word which is that it's uh it's

56
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,080
wholesome as part of the whole and uh and the UNH wholesome is that which is not part of the whole

57
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,280
there's UNH wholesome Behavior um that not beautiful Behavior that's

58
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,319
unethical where we actually make ourselves fragmented we we're responding from only

59
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:14,400
part of who we are because we can't really be involved in causing harm to

60
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:21,759
others without losing touch with our whole with our deeper sensitivity and so you know in Buddhism

61
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,199
this idea of being wholesome being um is really a central move movement of

62
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:34,240
Buddhism to live in a wholesome way to act wholesome from the whole from the beauty that we have and so ethical

63
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,720
sensitivity is also sensitivity from our Beauty and I don't know how many people

64
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,039
how many of you relate to that you that there's something beautiful inside of you but that's kind of the direction

65
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:51,560
that Buddhist practice is going they discover that there is beauty there's inner beauty there's a kind of a beauty

66
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,599
that we practice in we live in we are inspired by we come from and what does

67
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:04,360
it what does it mean to respond to and and uh and resist to stand opposed to or

68
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,879
to speak up for Injustice in the world in a way that's

69
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:15,879
beautiful and most people don't put those two together because it's somehow

70
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:21,680
when there's Injustice it demands righteous action it demands Fury

71
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,960
it demands somehow we're now getting into the world of conflict and conflict

72
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:33,840
must mean that there's I don't know aggression assertiveness being upset being

73
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,960
demanding doing something lot a lot of behavior which is not

74
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,759
beautiful and so what does it mean to be beautiful not in a way that

75
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:51,080
avoids but steps up and does so this emphasis on virtue on

76
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,720
Beauty on ethics um is I think a very important one to consider in the current

77
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:04,759
climate of things because um uh from all my lifetime until last month

78
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:10,759
I thought America was based on the rule of law and uh and now we have a president

79
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:16,560
who says he's Above the Law or he he's not above the law really but he decides the

80
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,879
law if he decides that's a law I mean that's a phenomenal new thing that I've

81
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:27,560
never would have imagined would have come out of this in this country presidents in this

82
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:34,279
country and um so but it basically means that uh means one person is above the

83
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:40,440
law and the rule of law means that everyone is responsible to the

84
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,480
law but uh uh philosophers of or or

85
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,959
political scientists who studied the uh the idea of rule of law have pointed out

86
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,560
that it has a flaw that uh the flaw is that uh it's

87
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:04,240
too easy to have loopholes it's too easy easy to have gray zones in which uh people kind of

88
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,640
manage to get by breaking the law or not not adhering to the ethics of the law

89
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,920
it's too easy now in a society where there's capitalism and huge corporations

90
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,279
with lots of money it's too easy to shape the laws in your

91
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:27,440
favor so just a rule of law by itself is not enough and some some people say that

92
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:34,120
you need something else and what you need is virtue and uh and that that idea goes

93
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:40,399
back to ancient India even it goes back to the Greeks it goes back to ancient India where they recognize this issue

94
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:47,480
and in Ancient India before Buddhism I think uh there was the idea that um um

95
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:53,920
the law was the Dharma and sometimes the word Dharma in certain context in India

96
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,160
Indian text when it translated into English is translated as the law and

97
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:05,279
that uh even Kings have to adhere to that law the Dharma law the and one of

98
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,959
those laws that uh in Ancient India for a king uh if a person doesn't follow

99
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:16,640
this particular law they forfeit their right to be king and uh and that was uh

100
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:23,880
to protect everyone their job is to be protectors and if they don't do that if they're the ones who harm them then they

101
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:30,519
forfeit their their Authority their right to have that so that's considered an ancient law

102
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:37,480
and uh and uh that even the king the monarchs had to adhere to and um and

103
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:45,279
Buddhism also that uh last week or two weeks ago I talked about the ancient myth that the Buddha presented that uh

104
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:53,240
if a king doesn't follow the Dharma doesn't follow particular caring for the poor that uh then uh society

105
00:10:53,240 --> 00:11:00,040
unravels and um and so this idea and the way it it reels the way it comes back to together

106
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,079
is when people start living ethically so when when the Monarch is

107
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:10,760
unethical Society falls apart but when the people are ethical they can come back together

108
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:16,920
again so that means that we all have a role and uh and it's a happy

109
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:22,279
role I think too often in in uh english- speaking countries I get the sense that

110
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:27,639
the idea of Ethics is a little bit of a burden it's a little bit like you know

111
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:36,320
you know oh no and certainly when I you know when I grew up um I actually thought ethics was

112
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,320
kind of like a four-letter word you know I you know it you know it wasn't really

113
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,320
you know I was growing up there was a lot of ideas that there was a lot of hypocrisy ethical hypocrisy in our

114
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,639
society and ethics people who are really ethical kind of were Hypocrites somehow

115
00:11:53,639 --> 00:12:00,680
or that they were superficial or they were just kind of polanish or it wasn't really real and and and so there was a

116
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:06,480
whole generation of the counterculture that I was part of that was looking for something that was more authentic and

117
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:14,240
looking for another way of living and so there was a kind of kind of a rejection of Ethics at least for me without being

118
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:20,880
unethical mostly because I had a lack of imagination and so so but you know so I

119
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:27,079
was you know it wasn't really doing anything unethical but what was surprised to me and a great source of

120
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:33,440
joy for me was through buddh practice to discover how wonderful it is to have

121
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,360
this ethical sensitivity ethical sensibility from the inside out I had no

122
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,440
idea that there was a reference inside that of beauty and it was even even a

123
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,480
word that the only word I could describe it to myself which is also a taboo word for

124
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,600
many years was the word purity uh Purity we also represented all

125
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:02,880
kinds of things that were problematic in the Puritans and things like that but then lo and behold to discover that

126
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:09,199
there was something that felt really pure inside that was the best word for it sometimes I try to I still try to

127
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:17,040
slip around using that word uh by calling it clean it feels really clean and cleansed

128
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,920
rather than purified and um but to discover this place inside and that that's a place

129
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:31,160
where there's a love for for for this Sensibility ility for this way of being

130
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:38,560
it is love almost and that and that you don't want to violate it it's is it harm and I

131
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,720
remember when I first discovered this on retreat in Thailand that uh I could I

132
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:51,120
could see that if I had certain thoughts that were you know maybe a little bit unethical that uh I could feel that

133
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,399
immediately was violating this thing inside or kind of diminishing it or harming it and so the idea was to keep

134
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:03,040
coming back to that and trusting and living in it and it's you know it's always in

135
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,320
navigation negotiation it's always discovering you know how this works in

136
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,519
different different circumstances and um but for the Buddha

137
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:21,920
when he you know uh emphasized this uh kind of the importance of ethical life

138
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,560
there was a wonderful little teaching it's a place where uh he's he called it

139
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:34,399
uh kind of this is the teaching this is the teaching of all the Buddhas so that's quite nice you know

140
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:40,000
not just him but all the Buddhas um it's a it's a three line it's a four-line

141
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,079
verse it goes um don't

142
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:50,839
do what is Barren don't do what is

143
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,560
deadening engage in what is wholesome purify the

144
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:03,199
mind this is the teachings of the Buddha the first line is sometimes

145
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:08,440
translated as evil don't do evil and there's kind of a question of what this

146
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,600
ancient Indian word means but uh but I like the word some

147
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:20,800
people have tried using Baron or deadening and what I like about that is evil doesn't necessarily point back to

148
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:27,160
the effect that those behaviors have or where where they come from but Barren or

149
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:33,120
or um deadening uh indicates where they come from and their effect that they

150
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,480
have on us so to do really harmful things in the world with a evil intent

151
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,880
in a sense um comes from baren place inside comes from a place of that's not

152
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,040
really full and wholesome and alive from that beauty and the effect it has is

153
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:57,079
kind of deadening on people and um something dies inside as a

154
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:02,240
result and um so um so that that's kind

155
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:08,360
of considered that Buddhism in a nutshell don't do what's

156
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:14,279
Barren do what is wholesome purify the mind or the

157
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:19,720
heart and um that's it now you know you can go

158
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:27,199
home and uh but this of the wholesome and one of the first and uh

159
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:33,440
one of the ways one of the uh classic descriptions of what is wholesome when there's a list of things that are

160
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:41,160
wholesome begins with not killing not harming so now I want to read this is

161
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:49,440
the opening you know just some people call it the the beginning of the Buddhist Bible because it's the DAP and

162
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,839
just there's no real like first like the Bible has uh you know in the be you know

163
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,440
beginning there was kind of it has a kind of real real beginning of it of it

164
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:09,038
a Buddhism kind of like a text that has like the beginning of the Canon but the closest thing maybe is this these these

165
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:14,798
verses here all

166
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:22,640
actions are preceded by mind led by mind made by mind speak or act with a

167
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:30,880
corrupted mind and suffering follows as the Wagon Wheel follows the hoof of the

168
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:38,280
ox all action is preceded by mind led by mind made by mind speak or act with a

169
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:45,320
peaceful mind and happiness follows like a never departing Shadow

170
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:53,080
so so what you how where you act from makes a huge difference so then it goes

171
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:59,400
on he abused me or let's say it a little differently they abused me

172
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:05,600
they attacked me they defeated me they robbed me for those carrying on like

173
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:12,640
this hatred does not end they abused me they attacked me they

174
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:18,200
defeated me they robbed me for those not carrying on like this hatred

175
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:26,880
ends hatred never ends through hatred by non-hate alone does it end

176
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:34,039
this is an ancient truth and U many people translate it a little differently it's it's allowed this is a

177
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:39,559
very literal translation and the alternative is hatred never ends through

178
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:47,480
hatred by non-hate alone does it end this is an ancient truth

179
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:13,720
this is uh Martin Luther King Jr a basic fact that characterizes

180
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:20,880
nonviolence resistance is that it does not seek to defeat or humiliate the

181
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:27,400
opponent but to opponents but to win over their friendship and

182
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:34,679
understanding isn't that is that remarkable I would say that's beautiful what a beautiful

183
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:39,960
thing that's very different than wanting to kill them or

184
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,320
or all kinds of things get rid of

185
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:58,120
them so that's an example that under the rule of law is

186
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:03,600
virtue under the rule of law is ethics under rule of law is the Dharma and here

187
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:09,039
the Dharma of Love of care of respect for

188
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:20,280
people love is not a weak passive love it is Love In

189
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:28,200
Action love seeking to preserve and create community so generative love love that

190
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:35,280
creates Community unity and people and this was a huge part of the Buddhist teaching

191
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:42,480
also that uh uh when we speak we should speak in a ways that unit people not in

192
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,679
ways that divide people so how do we do that with people that we disagree with

193
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:53,799
how do we do with people who are even harming us do we do this and um how do

194
00:20:53,799 --> 00:21:00,600
we do this and I want to read another piece from Martin Luther

195
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,799
King here we go hold you have your seat belts

196
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:22,158
on so I guess uh he's he's quoting uh Mahatma

197
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:31,600
Gandhi rivers of blood may have to flow before we gain

198
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:39,640
our freedom rivers of blood may have to flow before we great gain our

199
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:46,039
freedom but it must be our

200
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:51,760
blood isn't that quite something so this is the recognition

201
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:58,000
that these great proponents of non-violent resistance that uh this is not for the

202
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,320
Cowardly it's not for the weak this was for the strong and this had to be done with

203
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:14,360
great courage great Beauty great dedication something that some deeper value that uh of ethics of of of virtue

204
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:20,480
of Love of community of unity that um I mean there's plenty of

205
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:27,200
people who are willing to die for their country if they have a gun in their

206
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,880
hand then people people go to war for that purpose you know they're willing they're you know but how many people are

207
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:40,520
willing to die without a gun in their hand and I think what they're saying is

208
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:45,679
that's required too to make a

209
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,320
difference so

210
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:58,799
um so if you read something like dapada you find there's a kind of a

211
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:06,159
a beat a rhythm that goes through it that is emphasizing nonviolence

212
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:13,799
peace better than a thousand meaningless statements is one meaningful word which

213
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:20,799
having been heard brings peace better than a thousand meaningless

214
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:28,520
verses is one meaningful verse one line of a verse which having been heard

215
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:36,480
brings peace everyone trembles at violence all

216
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:43,720
fear death seeing others as being like yourself do not kill or cause others to

217
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:50,679
kill all tremble at violence life is there for all seeing others as being

218
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:55,880
like yourself do not kill or cause others to kill this is one of the

219
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:02,279
primary rationals that Buddha gives for nonviolence Ence is that just like you don't want to

220
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:07,600
die you want to live so others want to and so to kind of empathize or

221
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:14,400
understand this deep source of uh deep wish de deep movement of people's inner

222
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,360
life and respect it see people as

223
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,039
oneself whoever uses violence to harm the nonviolent and

224
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:32,279
innocent quickly goes to one of 10 conditions intense pain and great loss

225
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:38,120
bodily injury or Insanity serious illness or vicious slander oppression

226
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:43,679
from rulers or the loss of relatives houses consumed by fire and wealth

227
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:50,398
destroyed well we see plenty of examples that that doesn't happen fast enough

228
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:07,000
so here's this word uh evil that that I translate now as Barren or or

229
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:15,278
deadening evil is done by oneself Alone by oneself is one

230
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:22,240
defiled evil is avoided by oneself by oneself alone is one

231
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:30,039
purified Purity and impurity depend on oneself no one can pure purify

232
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:35,520
another don't give up your own welfare for the sake of others welfare however

233
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,559
great clearly know your own welfare and be intent on the highest

234
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:47,559
good some people are really disturbed by this verse because you're supposed to be altruistic your welfare shouldn't count

235
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:55,159
you should really you know sacrifice yourself for the welfare of others this is not what the Buddha taught because he

236
00:25:55,159 --> 00:26:00,840
taught this deep place of ethical sensitivity which is the beautiful place

237
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,960
is our welfare the highest welfare we can discover inside of ourselves and

238
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:13,200
from that we can act don't sacrifice that if you act don't sacrifice it if

239
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:22,600
you're the one who's standing in front of the tanks in kinan square you might be asked to do that

240
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:41,120
conquer anger with non- anger conquer Wicked wickedness with

241
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:47,760
goodness conquer stinginess with giving and a liar with

242
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:56,640
truth so it's not you know go to court this is calling upon this Dharma

243
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,200
this virtue this inner law to who we

244
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:11,000
are it's easy to see The Faults of others but hard to see one's own

245
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,240
fault when sifts out fults of others like chaff but conceals one's own as a

246
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,278
cheat conceals a bad throw of a

247
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:32,559
dice one is not just who judges a case

248
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:38,480
hastily one doesn't fire people justly if you fire them

249
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,279
hastily a wise person considers both what is and isn't right guiding others

250
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:50,120
without force impartially and in accord with the Dharma one is called a guardian

251
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,799
of the D Dharma intelligent and just so here the Dharma doesn't mean Buddhist

252
00:27:55,799 --> 00:28:01,440
teachings here the Dharma means the law the truth this underlying virtue that we

253
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:07,840
that kind of built into a deep ethical sensitivity and sometimes d word Dharma

254
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:15,320
can be translated as Justice guiding others without force

255
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:23,960
impartially and in accord with the Dharma what is called the guardian of the Dharma intelligent and

256
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:32,960
just so couple of more from the dapada not by harming living beings is one a

257
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:41,360
noble one by being harmless to all living beings when is called a noble

258
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:51,080
one having given up violence towards both towards beings both timid and

259
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:58,640
strong whoever neither kills nor causes others to kill I call a Brahman

260
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:06,679
so there's emphasis on nonviolence but that doesn't mean that there's not nonviolent

261
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:13,320
resistance and I think that would be the way that uh Buddhists

262
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:21,559
respond but I would like to say there kind of the theme of this talk is not that per se but to rather to say that um

263
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:30,880
underneath the rule of law there has to be virtue there has to be an understanding of ethics and and whether the society as

264
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,279
a whole can learn that in time we don't know but uh that's the kind of specialty

265
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:44,480
of what we want to con convey to the world and bring to the world and one of the ways to do it is uh by how we live

266
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:50,240
and our action and one of the ways we're going to live it some of us I feel is

267
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,679
always this has been true ever since I was young I felt and one of the reasons

268
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:03,080
I came to Buddhism was so we could be ready for what comes and I was ready

269
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:10,120
I've been ready for sometimes where I've s seen violence around me I've seen people

270
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:19,159
fighting uh physically fighting each other in the streets and places and communities and uh

271
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:26,360
and my instinct I think coming out of this practice was to approach to get to see what I could do

272
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:32,320
to stop it and sometimes not clear I was successful but

273
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:39,360
remember the first time I did this really was in the middle of an intersection in San Francisco and this

274
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:46,120
woman was kind of being attacked by big men she was trying to get away from them

275
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:53,799
so I stood between her and them but they were bigger than me big and strong so

276
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:59,799
they took a step towards me so I took a step

277
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:05,480
back and they took a step towards me you know I was still standing in the

278
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:12,799
middle but I took a step back so I didn't know what to do who got be stepping back and then this person came

279
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:18,240
off the sidewalk into the intersection and said to these two big guys

280
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:24,279
hey uh if I was in the situation of this woman I I hope you would come and help

281
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:31,519
me they that immediately calmed the whole situation down just that saying that statement wasn't that something he

282
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:36,639
knew that person figured out what to say or that was just that was enough so

283
00:31:36,639 --> 00:31:42,639
maybe maybe my role was just to you know slow this thing down long enough so he

284
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:48,799
could show up and then I once um I've told this

285
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:54,320
story here near my house there was people also F getting ready to fight and

286
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,480
two people in a group of people outside of a house and then I

287
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:05,720
approached but I approached and stood be it was in the street right so I I carefully stood behind a car I didn't

288
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:11,600
want to get too close I didn't know what was going to happen there and I said um

289
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:19,440
I'm a minister can I help and uh technically I'm a

290
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,639
minister legally I'm the minister so sometimes I use that

291
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:33,360
card and uh and every everything calmed down so and the last time I did

292
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:39,279
something like this was a believe it or not there were people

293
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:44,320
playing frisbee golf who were having two different

294
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:50,200
people with having some huge conflict around frisbe Gulf and they were also

295
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:55,399
big muscular guys and and uh and they and they started

296
00:32:55,399 --> 00:33:01,279
actually hitting each other and falling on the ground beating each other up so again again they were much bigger and

297
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:06,880
stronger than me and who am I to go do anything so I didn't know what to do but

298
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:13,840
I started walking towards them but before any I don't think anybody noticed before I could get to them their friends

299
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:19,880
pulled them apart that was nice I'm glad

300
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:26,880
because I don't know what I would have done but um but you know these are all

301
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:34,960
examples of doing something responding being ready are you ready and whose blood is going to flow

302
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:43,480
are you ready to have it be your blood what does that mean what kind of Courage is needed what kind of healthy

303
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:51,440
appropriate understanding would allow for that to happen I'm still very deeply touched by

304
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:58,960
uh the John Lewis civil rights leader for what he did but the the the

305
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,519
thing that most touches me is a story of U First what had leading up to the story

306
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:09,560
was he did his uh walk across this bridge in in U

307
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:14,919
Alabama that um and that police were waiting the other side and they were

308
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:22,079
marching for civil rights and um and they kept walking and then they were beat up they were with B batons and he

309
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:28,760
got damaged and hurt and I think he ended up with a concussion and uh uh and then ended up

310
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:35,040
being a congressman and uh for many years and

311
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:42,878
then uh something like 40 years later uh oh or he was beat up repeatedly

312
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:48,358
not just that time but before that he would go and do these protests in in U

313
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:55,520
in uh bus stations and um and there were these kuk CL people who came and would beat him up

314
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:03,280
and he was beat a couple of times also would to you know pretty pretty badly and 40 years after one of these

315
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:10,760
beating UPS the man who beat him up came to his office in congress with his son

316
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:16,240
to apologize 40

317
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:23,040
years that's impressive we don't see the good results right away sometimes but

318
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,280
you know he touched someone very deeply

319
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:36,079
so what what how are we going to touch what are we going to do

320
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:42,119
so we I don't know I don't know what we should do it's

321
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:49,079
complicated all these different points of view that go on in our society but there's a very interesting thing that uh

322
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:56,280
I wonder wondering if there are nonpartisan things nonpartisan seems to be more like bringing Community together

323
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:01,800
nonpartisan seems more like like maybe something that is uh coming from love or

324
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:10,079
care and supposedly there's a nonpartisan um thing that's going to happen on Friday on February 28th

325
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:17,640
there's been economic boycott of the major corporations don't buy and uh and that's very interesting

326
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:23,119
because it's not exactly political but it's actually addressing

327
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:29,160
one of the forces in society that are kind of part the law and not part of the

328
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:35,760
law the major corporations are the ones who can kind of find their ways around it or can buy politicians and do all

329
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,560
kinds of things and um and and corporations they're not really run on

330
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:47,359
virtue the corporations are run on making money which is a very different

331
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:53,560
decisions that uh they make and uh and so to make an impression

332
00:36:53,560 --> 00:37:01,400
on them that there are that people have power too people have uh can respond to them and

333
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:08,119
they're not they're accountable to the the people who provide them the money and to make that impression so that they

334
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:13,280
maybe think twice what they're doing and be more careful so that's supposed to be a

335
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:19,680
nonpartisan thing and is that buddhistic is that a way that Buddhists

336
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,920
can uh speak up or do something and act in a way that comes from this deeper

337
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:30,520
place of beauty and ethical sensibility and Not to cause harm not to create division

338
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:36,119
but to actually bring people together you'll have to decide I I shouldn't

339
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:42,520
answer that question for you so um those are my thoughts

340
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:48,160
today but the core one saying the third time is that Underneath It All one of

341
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:54,359
the Specialties of Buddhism is to really point to the tremendous importance of

342
00:37:54,359 --> 00:38:01,119
Ethics virt virtuous Beauty beautiful virtue that uh can

343
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:08,280
come from cultivating a deep ethical sensitivity it doesn't have to come from

344
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:15,119
a moral requirement should that comes from the outside it really it can emerge

345
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:20,599
deeply from inside and for maybe each person then it'll emerge in different

346
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:27,240
ways maybe there's a plurality of what how people live from this deep inner sensitivity but the one thing they all

347
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:33,280
have in common is they're not going to kill not going to cause harm that way

348
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,960
and that's the fundamental Buddhist ethical principle don't kill don't

349
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:47,760
harm so those are my thoughts and we have a few minutes before there's the polu and as I like to do in these days

350
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,839
is for you to say hello to each other and maybe you want to say a word or two about this talk if it touched you in

351
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:59,319
some kind of way or made you reflective of something and so if you would if you're willing to

352
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:04,560
stay for a few minutes um maybe to maybe to maybe to two people around you two

353
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:10,760
three people turn around and say hello and share a few words but look around make sure no one's left alone because we

354
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:17,839
don't want people that sitting there kind of we want to bring people together not create separation so and then I'll

355
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:23,359
ring a bell in a few minutes and then we can uh maybe have uh have the P luck so

356
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,519
thank you
