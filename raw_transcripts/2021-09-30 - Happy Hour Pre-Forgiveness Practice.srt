1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:06,000
so hello and welcome everyone it's good to see you here at happy hour dear

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,480
sangha so so for today's practice um

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,760
i was having a tough time deciding between two practices so maybe i'll do one to today and another one next time

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,039
so or on friday so

5
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,640
the practice for today i'd like to invite us to consider is um

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,920
is what's considered tilling the soil or till or preparing the soil

7
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,680
for forgiveness so we are human beings we all go through

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:56,160
life and [Music] there might have been situations where

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,280
you know there's still a little bit of you know uh not quite clarity being

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,479
completely clear with somebody in our lives and we may may or may not be ready

11
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:13,040
to forgive them or maybe we have forgiven them to some extent so anywhere there or there has been some

12
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,720
kind of um maybe challenge or rub or

13
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,240
uh entanglement say with someone in our lives where we have pushed their buttons

14
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,400
they have pushed our buttons it happens we're human beings we get entangled right is there a single one of us who

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,920
hasn't had an entanglement and so in order to till the soil in order to

16
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,159
prepare the soil for gratitude you know we may not be ready i'm sorry

17
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,840
not gratitude that's what we'll do on friday that's the other practice i was thinking of doing a different way of

18
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,960
doing it i guess that's the preview okay come for gratitude on friday

19
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,840
but um to tell the soil to really prepare our hearts for forgiveness even if we're not ready quite for forgiveness

20
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:09,360
because forgiveness is something that can't be pushed can't be rushed um

21
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,440
and um or also maybe as i said we've forgiven this person

22
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:22,160
quite to to a large extent but maybe there's still a little little rub there and of course this idea of forgiveness

23
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,840
etc doesn't mean that we bring them back into our lives but just that there's clarity in our heart

24
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,720
so the way we till the soil with the way we prepare our hearts to be ready

25
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,160
for forgiveness is to consider their common humanities to consider

26
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,680
their good qualities to consider the good maybe some of the

27
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,800
good deeds they have done for us maybe some of the in the past maybe we've been friends and just recollecting

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,800
bringing to our heart um not as a not with forcing and pushing but to

29
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,440
really glad in our heart or there's this other human being who has some good qualities and

30
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,040
and um maybe they are really supporting some

31
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,080
other people in in some ways through their work through their

32
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,720
uh family life and just so bringing these good qualities and

33
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,239
again we're not trying to rush into forgiveness and tonight it's

34
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:35,280
just in in some ways maybe this could be another way i could frame this is a meta

35
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:43,519
for someone we have had challenges with or meta for someone we have a challenge with but with kind of our ear out or our

36
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:51,760
eye out like oh yeah when we do this when we consider their goodness

37
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:58,879
the heart gets ready the soil gets tilled for forgiveness at some point

38
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,400
whenever the heart is ready so so that is the framing that is the

39
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,599
context and i hope i've been clear enough maybe i'll just say one more thing about it

40
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:17,280
which is um what i'm inviting us to explore tonight

41
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:24,080
is considering in our hearts the good qualities of someone we've had

42
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,000
an entanglement with and it's a it's similar but slightly

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,080
different from doing metaphor them as you will see similar but a little different and it's definitely not

44
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:43,600
forgiveness yet right so it's not it's not forgiveness organism might arise tonight it's like oh naturally great if

45
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,960
it comes up have fun with it but we're just recollecting goodness it's a

46
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,199
recollection of goodness that's that's that's how i'm framing the practice

47
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,039
tonight let's explore let's see what happens different things might come up always

48
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,160
trust your experience and if at any point it gets challenging or difficult

49
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:14,080
um go to self-care go to self-compassion self-meta taking care of your own heart

50
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:21,600
if challenges from the past like really bubble up and you find yourself in anger and remorse or whatever just go back to

51
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:29,840
self-compassion all right dear it's okay it's all right okay so as long as you bring kindness

52
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,919
to whatever comes up you are doing the practice right

53
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,960
let me say that again as long as you turn

54
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,000
with kindness and hold with kindness whatever is coming up

55
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,240
even if it's remorse or anger whatever it is if you're kind with it just holding it with patience and

56
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:59,600
kindness you're doing this practice perfectly right it's all about meta so

57
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,840
plenty of words to set the frame let's start let's formally start our practice

58
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,919
together so let's

59
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,280

in the body in your abdomen not in your head and as i give invitations if and when

111
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:22,559
you notice you're thinking the center of gravity is moved up

112
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:29,840

an adult

118
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,799
as you bring this being to your heart

119
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:28,160
feeling what it feels like to consider them

120
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,919
in your body

121
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:44,080
maybe you notice a sense of peace and ease or a smile shows up just notice

122
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,280
maybe a sense of friendliness good will that this person has for you and you

123
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:58,840
have for them care love

124
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:31,260
and with each breath so that it feels embodied not

125
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:39,200
[Music] thinking with your breath maybe not with each breath let there be

126
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,960
a recollection a sense of something you appreciate

127
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,000
about them when you stay for a few breaths with it

128
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:58,240
something you appreciate about this being is breathe with it

129
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:08,360
maybe maybe you've been friends this is a human being you've been friends for a long time maybe

130
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:33,840
letting their various things letting the various things arise

131
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:42,240
feeling with them with the breath maybe you appreciate that they're happy when they see you

132
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,280
this could be particularly true if you've chosen a pet

133
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,120
let each of these recollections brighten your heart brighten your heart glad in

134
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,600
your heart

135
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,760
as if you're soaking in them

136
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:18,320
taking them in with each breath take your time

137
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:27,280
with the different qualities or it may be things they have done for

138
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,880
you or they do for you maybe they call you

139
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,400
or have called you when you're not feeling well

140
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,720
really really let yourself breathe and then take it in

141
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:59,640
brightening your heart we all have this capacity

142
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:51,720
let your heart be gladdened made brighter with these recollections

143
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:07,360
recollecting dimensions aspects of their buddhahood their inner beauty their goodness

144
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,400
their buddha nature

145
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:44,000
now with our heart primed and recollecting of goodness

146
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,519
now i'd like to invite you

147
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:57,840
to choose someone you've had some entanglement not the toughest one on the list not number one

148
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,520
not the most challenging but someone that maybe you have

149
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:10,559
already worked some things through or in your heart at least you've offered some forgiveness it's not too big it's just a

150
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:16,559
little a little entangled just a little entitled

151
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:22,480
not over the top entangled choosing this being bringing them to

152
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:29,200
your heart and similarly noticing that they too

153
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:36,480
have a buddha nature not condoning the harm that was done but

154
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:42,000
they too are a human being can you bring

155
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,760
bring to heart some of their good qualities

156
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:53,840
some of the ways maybe they supported you in the past

157
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:04,320
or that their kind loving giving

158
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:12,559
to others or that their work supports others their gifts in this world

159
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:22,799
if you need to keep some separation not really bringing them close to your heart but just having some kind of separation

160
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:31,200
it's okay too for this practice they don't need to be right up close but as long as you feel into their goodness

161
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,640
again if even that them at a distance it feels too much then go back to your dear

162
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,000
being your easy being and when there's more stability you can

163
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:49,279
come back to this person i think there's been some challenge maybe keep them at a bit of a distance

164
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:56,159
maybe they're sitting in the other side of the room but you still see their goodness

165
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,320
you let yourself see their goodness

166
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,799
they're not all bad

167
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:58,440
maybe there are some things that come to them naturally which you appreciate

168
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:39,158
maybe even let yourself see some of their vulnerability

169
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:53,039
the feeling of good will comes up naturally you can offer it and if not

170
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:59,799
that's okay respect where you are

171
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:20,799
we all have challenges in this life every single one of us

172
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:25,000
has challenges and vulnerabilities

173
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:33,600
and if natural forgiveness arises as much as it arises partial you can

174
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,559
offer it and if not it's okay don't push it

175
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:04,518
we're collecting good wholesome qualities and acts of goodness

176
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,839
this

177
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:42,720
for the last minutes of this practice period

178
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:51,359
recollecting your own good quality for showing up and practicing

179
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:59,200
doing the best you could given the causes and conditions and letting go

180
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:04,640
letting go of any judgment

181
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:11,838
anything that it was challenging or difficult

182
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:19,119
you've done your best offering forgiveness to yourself

183
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:26,560
goodness to yourself and the wishing world for all beings everywhere

184
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:35,040
may all beings know the blessings of their own heart their own goodness

185
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,838
their own but in nature may all beings be free

186
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,759
thanks everyone thank you for your practice

187
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:06,090
[Music] so

188
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:12,880
[Music] it is said that

189
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:20,720
forgiveness is for the curve the courageous

190
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:29,200
and by building by recollecting goodness the

191
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:36,800
goodness of people who've had some entanglement with we build more courage in this way

192
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,400
so so

193
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:49,280

195
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,800

196
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:06,880
reflection i mean not your name only your reflection let me try that again if you write it to

197
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:13,680
me privately i only read your reflection not your name if you write it public to the chat is to everyone then they'll

198
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:19,920
acknowledge you your name and you can also raise your hand especially if you haven't spoken for a while would love to

199
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:26,839
hear from you what did you discover with this practice

200
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:39,440
i'll share something with you as i was doing the practice i i found myself smiling when i was

201
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:45,839
bringing up i was smiling of course at the beginning when i was bringing up the recollecting the good

202
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:52,079
qualities of of a person dear or just my heart was sliding up

203
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:57,920
and and i also found myself recollecting the good qualities of someone i've had some entanglement with

204
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:04,240
that also made me smile it made me light up and my mind wanted to just consider

205
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:09,680
and remember and recollect more and more of the good qualities of this person

206
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:16,200
that i had forgotten it just it and having meta for them seeing their

207
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:21,839
vulnerabilities and offering even more forgiveness it just became natural just

208
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:28,240
flowed like you know as the buddha says the water the stream water just flows

209
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:34,319
downhill naturally it just all these started to flow naturally of course your mileage might

210
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:39,680
vary i'm just sharing my own practice report a little bit as support as

211
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:46,240
inspiration but it's all good maybe it was challenging maybe it was very difficult for you it's

212
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,760
all good bring it on

213
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:59,680
one reflection from someone uh i was just thinking about how i still

214
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:05,119
feel angry towards my ex even though i think i have found forgiveness

215
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:10,960
if anger is still present does that mean i still have further forgiveness to give

216
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,319
this was very emotional for me yeah thank you for sharing this

217
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:23,680
if there is still anger yes i respect your inner wisdom knowing that

218
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:30,960
you know yourself that there is still further forgiveness to work through to offer and yeah

219
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,079
thank you for that reflection i appreciate this practice can be

220
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:40,400
emotional and can't be rushed or pushed

221
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,680
other reflections please

222
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:56,318
questions complaints discoveries

223
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,880
dawn says i smiled too thinking of others i also thought of the anger that

224
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:08,079
i caused in others needed to forgive myself yeah beautiful

225
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:13,599

226
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:21,119
and offering forgiveness to ourselves yeah beautiful yes please carol

227
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,760
hi nikki hi um i uh thanks for the nice

228
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:35,839
guided meditation i had a hard time focusing um the whole time because i'm

229
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:43,119
i'm in a really intense period at work and wrapping up a three-year construction project this week so

230
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:48,560
but i kind of focused on um i mean i i work in a very like male

231
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:54,000
dominated field and there's a lot of misogyny sexism is still kind of a

232
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,920
stronghold there so i kind of focused on that versus an individual and there's

233
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,960
lots of kind of micro moments that happen with people that i really like to work

234
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,240
with it's just kind of part of society and socially like where we are

235
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:15,359
still so it was kind of nice because i was like half distracted

236
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:21,760
um and just trying to really like like uh undo some of the like

237
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:28,319
wound up quality in my uh system um but then also kind of being

238
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:35,680
able to hold some of the challenges that i face that other women face in the industry and sort of see that as

239
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:42,319
part of the experience and part of what can be really frustrating about the experience and work in general

240
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:48,720
and so i really enjoyed it i kind of took your intention and

241
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,720
crafted it to exactly what i'm going through and it was really it was actually really nice and i felt like it

242
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:02,079
it felt like a nice uh thing for me to do as an intention to kind of close out a big uh thing that

243
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:08,560
i've worked on for several years so thank you so much thank you carol it's beautiful i so

244
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,839
appreciate hearing of course you know as you're i love your words wound up you're

245
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:19,200
going through a very intense period so there's a lot of energy and

246
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:25,359
you figured how to make this practice uh work for you tonight how do i make this

247
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:30,640
work like oh yes there's a lot of challenges and you know misogyny coming

248
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:36,240
and how can i work in just general me maybe and and maybe the sense i get uh

249
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:42,800
you didn't say this but i wonder you're welcome to admit yourself if not it's a sense of maybe seeing some of the good

250
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:48,839
and some of the people that you said i like to work with so i like these people and yet there's these uh

251
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:55,280
challenging yeah challenges yeah yeah i mean you can't there's so much of it that happens so

252
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:02,160
frequently you know when you're kind of working in an industry when you're where you're an outsider still

253
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:08,960
you can't really stay in anger all the time but you can sort of take it as sort of like oh these other people are also a

254
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,560
product of our own conditioning and society and so like they're good people

255
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:20,400
who are intending ill will it's just they're like there's unconsciousness and sort of like a

256
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,599
larger collective social thing that happens um and when you de-personalize it in

257
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:30,880
that way it makes it a lot easier especially for yourself like for your own experience right you can

258
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:37,680
de-personalize it in this way where you're like oh i'm just part of this bigger thing and you know i can work

259
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:43,040
to change that by being positive and bringing a different kind of consciousness to it but in that you

260
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:49,040
still have to acknowledge the frustration and the pain

261
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:55,839
of being subjected to that you know yes kind of balancing both exactly

262
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:01,200
so well put carol thank you so to of course to acknowledge the the hurt the

263
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:06,480
frustration the the harm that has caused all of that and

264
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,680
and it's a both end all of that acknowledged and as you said one can't

265
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:17,440
stay in anger to see they know their intention they have good intention it's it's

266
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:22,800
and yet it's out of ignorance it's really ignorance causing

267
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:28,960
harm not to condone the harm and hurt and yet seeing their humanity in that way supporting yourself

268
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:34,799
to not stay in anger beautiful so much wisdom here thank you carol

269
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:42,640
thank you beautiful so dear once i see more reflections in chat i like to acknowledge them and

270
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:50,319
it's it the time has come we tend to so let's transition to the uh small groups practice and

271
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:57,359
community because especially this has been such a can be such a rich topic and it's important for us to to make space

272
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:03,359
for holding each other and um and then when we come back i'd like to acknowledge the

273
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:11,359
the uh the more reflections given time so i am creating the rooms right now

274
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:18,400
and um let me uh yes so the yes the rooms are

275
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:25,359
created and i'm about to open them take care of yourselves take care of each other here we go

276
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:33,200
so um we have a couple of minutes and i wanted to make space if there's a comment

277
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:39,200
anybody wants to make after having been in groups if it's brief um

278
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:44,880
oh my connection is unstable let me fix that here

279
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:53,760
the group if not i will acknowledge the one

280
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:59,359
while i wait for your hand to raise okay so i'll acknowledge a couple of reflections before i went into

281
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:05,839
um into group and eileen had um shared that you know i may have the

282
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:11,920
intention to forgive but there are still freeings of anger and hurt and so that's why we are doing this practice because a

283
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:16,359
lot of times we have the intention to

284
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:31,280
all right i got logged out and i came right back on hi everyone

285
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,319
that was quick so so um

286
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:43,040
yes let's see where were we yes i don't know how much of that you heard but i was saying basically that sometimes you can have

287
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:49,599
the intention but uh there's still more work to do which is why it was inviting us in this

288
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:56,480
practice to till the soil to till the soil to gently gently think of the positive quality so that the heart

289
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:03,280
you'll kind of loosen it will loosen the and it will allow for natural forgiveness to come through

290
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:08,960
and appreciate jeremy's reflection about the intention to pay to allowing

291
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,960
yourself to be happy and for your happiness to shine through yes it's a gift to the world

292
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:21,599
and and jerry's reflection on yes it helps to think about people's causes and conditions and you know that they might

293
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:26,720
have had a challenging history and background and childhood which

294
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:32,160
might be part of their their upbringing and and their costs and conditions

295
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:40,480
uh to see their humanity in that way so that contributes to their present behavior says jerry very wisely and dear

296
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:46,000
ones it is seven o'clock we have come to the end of yet another happy hour and

297
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,079
it's such a privilege and pleasure to practice with all of you so i thank you all for your

298
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:59,040
practice for showing up for doing this practice for yourself and all beings everywhere may all beings be

299
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:04,079
