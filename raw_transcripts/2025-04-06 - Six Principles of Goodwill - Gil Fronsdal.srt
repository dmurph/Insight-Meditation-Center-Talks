1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:07,759
so uh for today I want to um kind of tell you a story but also um

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:15,200
uh offer you the teachings the Buddha gave uh for the monks at Kosambi uh it

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,920
had to do with the conflict in Kosambi uh we sometimes might naively think that

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,599
the Buddha was so so great wonderful teacher that there couldn't have been any conflict in his among his disciples

5
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:35,760
in his time everyone was must have floating on clouds and got along really well but uh there was uh definitely uh

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:43,120
just because of human nature uh conflicts within his monastic community that in his own lifetime in the

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,320
monastery where he was living even and so this happened in the in a

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:55,800
town called Kosambi and um and uh it had to do with a very

9
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:02,879
minor monastic rule and uh it's so minor that you think is this really worth the

10
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:09,920
level of conflict that uh arose and um uh they had you know they

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,200
had an outhouse and the way that people clean clean theelves because they didn't have toilet paper back then was they

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:22,080
used water and they had these dippers for dipping water and it was very important not to um leave any water in

13
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,240
the dipper when you're finished and u maybe because mosquitoes or I don't know

14
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,600
why and um and so there was someone who was an expert in the monastic rules

15
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,360
there were some monks who specialized in this and um and the this expert was

16
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,759
criticized or was accused of having left some water in his

17
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,240
dipper oh these monks

18
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:58,079
And um and so there was this and and uh he insisted he hadn't done that other people said insisted he did and so there

19
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:04,320
was two factions in the monastery the factions were against him and the fact that they were for him and they couldn't

20
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,440
get an agreement and eventually somehow maybe the majority or something voted to

21
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:16,319
expel him from the monastery but that even created more conflict in the community and uh there

22
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:22,400
was all this arguing and the Buddha was there in the monastery and he said cool it you know you know you should get

23
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,920
along and let let maybe let go of this but they said they said to him something like um you know just leave us alone

24
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,680
venerable sir we'll take care of this and they don't even listen to the Buddha

25
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,360
and so so they they were continuing to argue and it was noisy in the monastery and so the Buddha he had tried to

26
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:49,840
intervene they didn't listen to him so He left he just he just went went off to

27
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,519
go someplace else and uh but then the the town's

28
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:02,000
people got wind that the Buddha wasn't there and that there was this conflict so they started stopped supporting the

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,680
monks there and um and support means feeding them because monks are not they

30
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,720
don't cook they don't they can't even keep keep food overnight they're not allowed to store food so every day

31
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,000
they're dependent on what's offered to them and as they go walk for arms so

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:29,599
people stopped feeding them so that got their attention eventually they started to starve and so um uh they went to the

33
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:36,480
Buddha to apa to apologize and say you know we you know please forgive us and please come

34
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:45,680
back and and um so he came back and um and um and so but they were

35
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,680
still kind of you know a little bit challenged by it all but uh so he said

36
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,879
um so this is the description of the how it went now on

37
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,760
that caa occasion the monks at Kosambi had taken to quarreling and

38
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:09,120
brawling and were deep in disputes stabbing each other with verbal daggers

39
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,720
this is not this is like serious um they could neither convince

40
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:21,759
each other nor be convinced by others they could neither persuade each other nor be persuaded by others so they're at

41
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,919
a standstill um so

42
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:34,000
uh someone went to the Buddha and sat down explained what happened um and uh I

43
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,400
think and what it says here the Buddha called them to come visit to him so he had gone someplace and so the monks all

44
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:49,600
went to him and he asked them um monks is it true that you have taken

45
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:56,960
to quarreling and brawling and are deep in dispute stabbing each other verbal daggers and so they're supposed to be

46
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,639
honest for your monks so so they said "Yes venerable

47
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:10,240
sir." Um and then the Buddha said "Munks what do you think when you are quarreling and

48
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:18,000
brawling and in deep and deep in disputes stabbing each other with verbal dagger daggers do you on that occasion

49
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,320
maintain acts of loving kindness by body speech and mind in public and in private

50
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:30,080
towards your companions in the holy life that's a beautiful expression asking

51
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,520
them and we can ask ourselves that you know there's people quarrel in

52
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:42,800
families sometimes there's things fall apart people quarrel in communities they

53
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:48,080
quarrel in work they quarrel quarrel in politics they quarrel a whole nation is

54
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,080
at a standstill with with each other and um with verbal daggers for each other

55
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:02,039
it's not uncommon that we get this standstills around this tension and problems so what do you

56
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:07,479
think when you're in opposition with other people for whatever

57
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:14,960
reason um are you stabbing each other with verbal daggers or do you on that occasion

58
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,319
maintain acts of loving kindness by body speech and mind in public and in private

59
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:26,080
towards your fellow citizens how do you how do you view people

60
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:33,039
and um and it's a call to always always have goodwill whether this word meta should

61
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,960
be translated as loving kindness or not is a open question for some people loving kindness is a little bit too high

62
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:45,600
a bar and a little bit too idealistic and maybe uh maybe maybe it is unrealistic

63
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,240
but goodwill maybe is more realistic that you can always have goodwill uh even for your enemies you can wish them

64
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,599
well because then they'll treat you better maybe and um so

65
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:04,400
uh so to um uh so this is a really high

66
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:11,759
kind of teaching of Buddha very important teaching the Buddha to always maintain loving kindness um and and uh

67
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:19,759
one reason is that it antidote to having ill will is the antidote for ill will and

68
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,880
ill will harms the person who has it and uh why would you want harm

69
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,639
yourself and that's one of the remarkable things that happens through this practice is as we settle on

70
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:36,560
ourselves more and more deeply in the present moment become more embodied more connected to ourselves in a deep deep

71
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,800
way we we're become acutely sensitive to the ways that we harm ourselves by what

72
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,919
we do with our mind our speech and our body acutely aware of the tension that

73
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:54,879
builds up the way we close down the way that we do even some kind of sometimes I felt

74
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:01,520
like violence to ourselves by having hate by having greed by having all these

75
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:09,759
ways in all you know in all directions including towards ourselves towards others and we we feel how we're harming

76
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:17,280
ourselves and why would you harm yourself and that's the big question in Buddhism when you really have settled

77
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,520
deeply deeply leap on yourself really connected and sensitive to what's happening which is a hard thing to come

78
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,120
to because we're so distracted we're so busy you know chasing after doing things

79
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,640
and thinking about important things and that we don't we're often somewhat alienated from

80
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:41,919
ourselves and this this uh becoming deeply connected then provides us this

81
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:48,959
important information about how we self harm and it's remarkably

82
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:54,240
uh powerful to see this and it's it goes against kind of the grain of how we

83
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,640
normally think when we spend a lot of time blaming other people or blaming the

84
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:09,120
world or the weather or something but as we get more and more deeply connected we can feel the movements of

85
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,680
uh illwill the movements of greed and ambition the movements of even sometimes

86
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,120
anxiety and doubts how it kind of begins to twist something inside or close

87
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:29,120
something inside uh that uh irritate something inside kind of harm something inside and so to

88
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:37,120
discover um that good will is not something we have to do but

89
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:44,320
is what is left when ill will has gone away that's like a treasure to discover

90
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:51,360
so for the Buddha he put a lot of emphasis on the importance of goodwill and loving kindness and so he starts

91
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,519
with this addressing the monks who are quarreling when you're quarreling do you have goodwill

92
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:04,800
and being committed to being honest they said "No venerable

93
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:11,760
sir." Um and then he goes on and um says "Well

94
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:18,480
when you're quarreling and brawling in this way what can you possibly know what can

95
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,519
you see that you take to quarreling and brawling

96
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:30,160
what is it that you what is it you're which you deeply have insight or see clearly or what's triggering what what

97
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,920
do you value what's so important for you that you want to quarrel and brawl what's happening when you hate someone

98
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:43,519
or challenged by them or really so it's a it's a it's a request to really look

99
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:49,320
deeply what are you going on in you at that time

100
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:57,600
um um and uh if you keep doing this living this way

101
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,760
uh it will lead to your harm and suffering for a long time

102
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:10,160
and I'm struck by you know how many huge conflicts we've had you know in our in

103
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:16,320
our world over the last hundred and what 200 years or something that we're still

104
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,920
living in the legacy of it the harm that was done by these major wars continues to this day

105
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:29,440
um you know I was uh my parents-in-law uh were in the concentration camps in

106
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:36,800
Germany so I knew them until they died and knew the impact of that up until I

107
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:43,600
think my my father-in-law died about I think about 11 years ago and so

108
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:50,720
up until that time right up to the day he died I know that the effects of being in those camps was still with him and

109
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,079
the people who went through uh uh all kinds of things their Armenian genocide

110
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:02,880
in 1910s and 20s they're still living with it uh we're still in this country

111
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:09,600
still living with the the challenges of the civil war that uh goes on and

112
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,920
someone would argue some people would argue that the violence that happened for the Americans American Revolution is

113
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,279
still with us in some deep way that uh it wasn't all good the American

114
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:26,399
Revolution and independence that somehow that act of violence that was horrible

115
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,959
um there could have been another way like

116
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:40,839
Canada maybe got independent a little different kind of way and um so this idea of of

117
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:47,279
um of being connected to ourselves and uh this value of loving kindness instead

118
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:55,519
of violence instead of hate uh is one the Buddha was championing so

119
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:02,040
um so then so then the Buddha had this is his core teaching in this

120
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:10,360
text then the Buddha addressed amongst us there are these six memorable

121
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:17,920
qualities that create love and respect and conduce to helpfulness to nondispute

122
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:24,360
to concord and to unity what are the six

123
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:30,480
uh so uh these memorable qualities sometimes they're called um uh six

124
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,399
principles of cordiality which seems a little bit dry uh one translator

125
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:42,320
translates in the six principles of of uh goodheartedness someone else tried to

126
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,720
translate it as six principles of amiability when's the last time you'd said

127
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:57,199
amiable but good-heartedness but I love this idea that they create love and respect conduc to helpfulness

128
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:03,199
to non-dispute to concord and to unity this is one of the primary principles of

129
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:09,279
uh Buddhism is don't create divisiveness look to see how you can create concord

130
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,399
and unity so there can be conflict there can

131
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:22,320
be differences of opinion there can be but how do we live in conflict how do we live in challenges with loving kindness

132
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,240
with looking for how can we come together rather than be torn apart and

133
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:36,399
we're always going to have difference of opinions does that have to tear us apart and for the Buddha that no so

134
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,680
there's six principles um so he said and three of

135
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:50,639
them have to do with this goodwill so it's kind of nice and the idea is to do them in in public and in private and um

136
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:57,720
I think private means so no one knows about it isn't that nice you don't have to get any

137
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:03,279
credit and then maybe it's even better you know to do do acts of kindness of

138
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:11,440
love of care um uh without anybody necessarily knowing that you're doing it

139
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:19,199
um maintain bodily acts of loving kindness both in public and in private

140
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:26,199
towards one comp one's companions in the holy life so he's talking to monastics in their monastic

141
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:31,760
environment this is a memorable quality that creates love respect conduces to

142
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:38,560
helpfulness to non-dispute to concord and to unity that's the first principle the

143
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:45,240
second is maintain verbal acts so first do things with your body make a

144
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,720
gift cook a meal and offer it to a friend uh the inside world aid that

145
00:15:50,720 --> 00:16:00,240
we've started up again i think it's this Thursday is starting up is Thursday right uh is um starting up um making uh

146
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:07,839
bag launches for homeless and they're going to do it here in uh they're going to make them here in Redwood City um uh

147
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:15,120
we we we discovered that there's a small group of people connected to the Catholics workers here in um in uh

148
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:22,320
Redwood City they have a little house and they're going to let us use their their space to make these bag lunches

149
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:29,600
and um and I love that fact catholic worker and Dorothy Day were very important social workers or caregivers

150
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:37,120
of this country and um and so they're still live and going here at Rubid City and we're getting to use their space so

151
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,560
there's information on the inside world aid website about that if you want to go and help make

152
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:49,920
sandwiches so that so uh you know bodily acts of loving kindness then the second

153
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:56,560
principle is maintain verbal acts of loving kindness both in public and in private

154
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,880
third one is maintain mental acts of loving kindness both in public and in

155
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:09,199
private so I don't know what a mental act in public would be versus private um

156
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:17,038
maybe just what maybe it means like when you when you're out and about you should uh you know in in the society just have

157
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:23,438
have good thoughts of goodwill and the private maybe means when you're meditating when you're alone think well

158
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:32,520
about people then too so the fourth one is um um

159
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:39,760
uh you use things in common oh again a monastic uses things in common with

160
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:45,360
their virtuous companions in the holy life without making reservations one

161
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:52,080
shares with them any gain of any kind that accords with the dharma and has been obtained in a way that accords with

162
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,280
the dharma including even the contents of their bowl so that means the food

163
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:04,080
they get so the idea is so that the fourth way to conducive for for conducive for loving kindness and

164
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:11,919
imiability and good good-heartedness is to share without reservations what you have uh even the contents of your bowl

165
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:19,799
of food even your food that's quite something because they only get one meal you know one meal a day or you know and

166
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:25,760
um and you're just lucky if you get enough food back then and even if you don't have enough food share with those

167
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:32,480
who have even less always be sharing that's a the principle always share so

168
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:39,080
we have a little extra in this country so supporting Burma would be nice

169
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:47,320
um and then um um the fifth

170
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,720
principle a monastic dwells both in public and in private possessing in

171
00:18:52,720 --> 00:19:00,120
common with her companions in the holy life those virtues that are unbroken

172
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:05,480
unblatched unmutled liberating commended by the

173
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:11,320
wise and conducive to concentration ation so here there's a call to be

174
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:19,799
ethical and live in such an ethical way live by the precepts live with the virtues in a way that uh is uh

175
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:26,799
un unblenmished that somehow is just kind of a purehearted

176
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,919
uh connection to being ethical and this was a huge surprise for me when I

177
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:37,919
started doing this insight practice the first time this was in Thailand and my I

178
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:46,559
kind of stumbled into it i didn't quite know what I was getting involved in and um and so kind of accidentally my first

179
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:54,960
introduction to this practice that we do here was on a 10-week retreat so and uh so that was kind of

180
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:00,480
that got so that was long enough to get my attention and one of the things that

181
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:08,320
happened surprising things happened in that those course of those 10 weeks was I got so settled and so connected to

182
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:14,840
myself so at peace with myself so there was so little inner conflict present

183
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:21,679
anymore that uh there was I I started to feel something inside which by according

184
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,720
to my earlier life based on principle I wouldn't have appreciated they didn't

185
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,080
trust uh it was kind of like they didn't trust this kind of words the language

186
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:37,679
concepts and that was the concept of purity and I started feeling this

187
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:44,159
amazing sense of purity within and uh and I I could feel that if

188
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,640
I had certain thoughts that were not so pure uh how it was a kind of violence or kind

189
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,159
of darkened or colored or you know shut down this place of purity that felt so

190
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:04,320
healthy and good it felt like home in a way and so this idea of of uh of um uh

191
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,679
virtue which is unblatched unbroken that in ourselves

192
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,919
it's quite a remarkable experience to have as a reference point for how to live a

193
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:21,919
life and that's some here it's called liberating and I wasn't liberated spiritually in

194
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:29,679
the deep Buddhist sense that during that 10-week retreat but I certainly felt free from a lot of the kind of inner

195
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:35,880
conflict the the way that greed and hatred kind of uh were a kind of

196
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,919
u loss of freedom because they kind of become compulsions that are difficult to

197
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:49,760
put down they kind of drive us and so there's a kind of freedom from living with a deep sense of virtue

198
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:55,600
but the most uh uh uh surprising thing around this description it ends with the

199
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,600
virtue that is conducive for concentration and that's meditation in

200
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:08,960
order to be able to sit in deep states of meditation to have this deep connection to oneself this deep feeling

201
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:16,080
concentration is also a feeling of wholeness we're completely comp uh feeling whole and connected in some deep

202
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:21,600
inner way um uh virtue is essential you

203
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,960
have to you can't you can't be unethical and expect to become whole in the way

204
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:33,520
that concentration makes you whole and uh a feeling of wholesomeness or wholeness

205
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,559
so the idea that virtue that's conducive to concentration and I love this term

206
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:44,559
because there there's a safety mechanism built into this that um any attempt to

207
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:52,480
be to live an ethical life that makes you more agitated that somehow takes away your

208
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,760
capacity to get deeply settled is probably not going to be ethical and not

209
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:05,280
a few people think they're living an ethical life but underneath it there is hostility there's hatred there's there's

210
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:12,360
fear there's anxiety there's shame there's embarrassment there's all these complicated things that we have

211
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:17,679
guilt that uh that doesn't help concentration doesn't help for this deep

212
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:24,159
sense of peace that concentration can provide and so um uh so the connect to

213
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:34,679
connect ethics with concentration I think is a wonderful safeguard so that our ethics is really the right

214
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:42,960
kind so uh and then we come to the sixth one um a monastic dwells both in public

215
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:49,720
and in private possessing in common with her companions in the holy life that

216
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:57,679
view that perspective that is noble and liberating and leads one who practices

217
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:04,159
in in accordance with it to the complete destruction of suffering this too is a

218
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:12,240
memorable quality that creates love and respect conduces to helpfulness to non-dispute to concord and to unity so

219
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,600
this is kind of what Buddhism is kind of the teaching of the Buddha is all directed towards it's directed to

220
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:25,000
towards something in you that is

221
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,640
conducive to love and respect to being helpful becoming

222
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:37,400
helpful person to non-dispute to concord and to unity is that so

223
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:44,039
bad that this is kind of like the the kind of over and over again this is what the Buddha is pointing towards as

224
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:52,320
possibility I think is really useful not to forget this that this is the kind of orientation or this is the litmus test

225
00:24:52,320 --> 00:25:00,559
for practice and for Buddhist teachings how does it support our ability to do these things over and over again how not

226
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:05,840
to succumb to ill will how to live with goodwill how to live with a a kind of

227
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:11,039
virtue or kind of ethics that is conducive to your own well-being that

228
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:16,320
conducive to concentration and virtue is really good for the world around us if you live

229
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:22,400
ethically uh the only people who might uh be suffer a lot are the newspapers

230
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:28,600
the news channels because most of the news is about people being

231
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:34,919
unethical and um the um and then

232
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:41,120
sharing you know the sharing with the with others this the fourth quality and

233
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:48,799
now there's something about a view a perspective that's liberating and uh that frees us that

234
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:54,960
that also creates goodwill or creates helpfulness and unity that we create a

235
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,080
view that frees us from greed and hatred frees us from

236
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:07,480
the kind of clinging and resistance the kind of obsessiveness and compulsivity which gets in the way

237
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:14,480
of goodwill gets in the way of caring for our community around us it gets in

238
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,640
the way of caring for the people who we disagree with is that

239
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:25,279
possible and that's that's the idea so I don't think that this teaching here is

240
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:31,919
about monks not disagreeing over a monestic rule i think this is uh it's

241
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,159
you know rules are difficult to interpret and understand but it's even if you have a

242
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:44,240
disagreement never give up your loving kindness and hopefully it's a you know

243
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:51,600
religious people speak in hyperbole sometimes so you have maybe hopefully what I'm about to quote we can

244
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:57,840
understand that just said in an exaggerated way so that to really stress

245
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,799
how important it is the Buddha said "Even if

246
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:12,760
bandits are sawing off your limbs maintain goodwill."

247
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:20,799
And uh when I was in uh and there was a uh a teacher uh

248
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:26,640
Indian teacher named Manindra Gi when um some of the westerners went to practice

249
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:33,919
with him in the 1960s um I think there was a a woman who was

250
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:39,760
somehow little bit accosted on the publicly in the street and I think she fought off or got cut got cut got cut

251
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,799
got cut got cut got cut got cut got cut got cut got cut got cut got away from the person but she went to the to the man and said you know what should I do

252
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:50,640
if I get accosted in the in the on the streets and he said with all the loving

253
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,480
kindness you can muster hit the person overhead with your umbrella

254
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,039
and um but but that goes that goes along with um one of the rules the monastics

255
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:14,559
are supposed to live by one of the rules is that they're not allowed to hit

256
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:20,440
anyone to strike anyone physically fight with them but there is one

257
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,840
exception they're allowed to hit out i think the expression is strike out

258
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:32,279
against someone for for for two caveats two

259
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:37,840
requirements they have to do it with loving kindness in their hearts they have to have a do with goodwill they

260
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:44,000
cannot have ill will for someone when they do it the second uh they do it only for the

261
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,720
purposes of escaping them so you know you don't have to stand

262
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:57,200
there and just not do anything if someone's hitting you attacking you're allowed to do do what it takes to escape

263
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:03,200
uh but there has to be goodwill and that's a high bar right i mean how many people can do that when they're caught

264
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:10,080
in their fear or something but it is possible i've known people uh because the people

265
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:16,720
I know because that's my circles I know mostly is uh I know uh practitioners who

266
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,080
deep practitioners who have in fact been uh something has happened someone like

267
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,120
was robbing them at gunpoint or something and they somehow they knew how

268
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:33,120
to not succumb to fear not to succumb to ill will and they kind of something they

269
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,240
were surprised themselves by what came out of them that's uh that uh settled

270
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:46,159
the situation made the whole thing go away one friend of mine looked at the person and said um your mother would be

271
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:52,640
ashamed of you and that was enough another person

272
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:58,240
who um uh was out in the desert and this man

273
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,799
accosted her was with a gun and um didn't want it wasn't going to be a good

274
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:10,279
scene and she said um you're you're no Christian give me that

275
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:15,679
gun and that was enough and then she threw it in the bushes and ran so I'm

276
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:22,640
not suggesting any of these things you know as a strategy you know to try to do it but somehow they knew what to do in

277
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,480
the moment that uh that settled it and I knew one person one friend of mine who

278
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:35,200
did not stay calm uh being held up in San Francisco and um

279
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,880
and he was the one that ended up in jail because of his ill will and what he

280
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:49,200
tried to do so uh so the six principles of goodwill

281
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:57,679
six principles that lead to love and respect to unity and concord that begins with loving kindness

282
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:03,200
in body speech and mind publicly and privately

283
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:11,200
six uh uh that includes uh sharing generosity giving uh even down to your

284
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,960
last food in your own bo own bowl without reservations supporting the

285
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:24,159
people around us this is one of the deep principles of Buddhism and then virtue and the and

286
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:30,159
it's not just any old virtue any old ethical rules but the ethics that really

287
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:37,279
does something to your heart does something to your inner life so that when you sit down to meditate it's easy

288
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:44,960
for you to get settled to get concentrated and then uh to have a view

289
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:51,840
to have a perspective that understands that uh it that uh clinging

290
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:57,960
to anything grasping to anything craving to anything is

291
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:04,640
harmful and then the and the practice the purpose of the practice is to let go of that clinging to let go of all

292
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:10,600
craving and clinging and it's those people who have no clinging clinging and

293
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:15,640
craving who become second nature to live with

294
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:20,840
goodwill to live with caring for people to be helpful for this

295
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:27,279
world to be concerned with the welfare and happiness of everyone the unity the

296
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:34,159
concord that we can live in and it's a high bar it's not easy

297
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:39,840
when there's so much divisiveness in our society and so much is at stake and uh

298
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:47,320
so much harm can get done and so there's a lot of tempting

299
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:54,559
reasons to succumb to hostile anger there's a lot

300
00:32:54,559 --> 00:33:00,960
of reasons to get succumb to fear and anxiety and distress

301
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:07,200
and the Buddha was teaching something else for us he was and I find it

302
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,559
tremendously inspiring and encouraging he was in uh he was teaching

303
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:18,399
that in some sense that the world begins by you and if you want to live in a

304
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:25,960
better world begin with yourself live with live with goodwill publicly and

305
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:31,519
privately live with sharing not with hoarding

306
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,880
live with virtue live with ethics not with causing

307
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:43,559
harm any ways through your behavior and understand something

308
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:50,799
profound about a perspective that frees you from all harm intentional harm

309
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:57,039
making any greed hatred that causes harm to yourself and to others live with a

310
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:04,200
view that it is possible to be free it is possible to be have profound peace at

311
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:11,040
heart to be transformed into someone who lives for the welfare and happiness for

312
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:18,520
the world not because they should but because it becomes who we are

313
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:26,079
so thank you that so those people in the past the

314
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:32,878
ancient world how could they be live in conflict with each other shouldn't they known better time with the Buddha we

315
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:38,320
certainly know better now don't we one of the things that disturbed me

316
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:44,638
about um watching things like Star Trek when I was younger it was supposed to happen you

317
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:50,720
know thousands hundreds of years into the future I I was just str so struck by how

318
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:56,960
um ethically naive they were i was so surprised that you know

319
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:03,040
that by that you know in a few hundred years that we hadn't kind of become ethically and psychologically

320
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:10,640
sophisticated and capable of caring for each other in a deep profound way

321
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:16,160
so anyway we live in this world where these teachings are so important and

322
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:21,800
maybe we'll always need them six principles of

323
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,359
goodwill so thank you
