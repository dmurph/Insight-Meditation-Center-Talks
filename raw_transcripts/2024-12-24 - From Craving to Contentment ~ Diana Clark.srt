1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,359
good evening welcome welcome I think I moved oh there we go

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:14,840
it's okay I was going to say I moved the microphone but it it's still all

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,680
right nice to see you all it's nice to sit

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,599
together so tonight I wanted to talk a little bit about uh the holiday season

5
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:34,160
it's not uncommon to see reference to or hear reference to or something about

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:41,199
this idea of a wish list this idea of you know things that are

7
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:48,840
wanted if this exists year round we often have wish list we even have a you

8
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,480
know organ Amazon right just has a little wish list make they all these uh

9
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:01,359
online I shouldn't say all many of the these online things have just make it as easy easy as possible for you to just

10
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:07,119
clickity click click and uh there you go you can make a list of all the things

11
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:14,880
that you wish that you had that you wanted and so this way there's and maybe

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,640
in particular this time of year I don't know there's this like this valorization of Desire like it's really held up oh

13
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,320
what is your wish list what what what do you want whether that's because of the new

14
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,560
year because of Christmas or for other uh

15
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,000
holidays what is this sense of uh what do we want or or maybe it can be uh

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,479
interpreted as well what should I give you so that you'll be happy or what am I going to give you so

17
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,920
that I'll be happy so that I'll feel good about myself or something like that

18
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:57,520
this uh intersection of desires and objects being exchanged and happiness

19
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,600
and or maybe that we could just say this time of year maybe there's we could just

20
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,000
highlight the beauty actually of uh opportunities to reflect on and maybe

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,080
act on you know those people that we care about that are important to us or part of our

22
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:21,360
lives and to express care love

23
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,160
appreciation in whatever way that shows up I I was helping my mom with her

24
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,640
Christmas cards my family celebrates Christmas and uh it's really sweet right

25
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:39,800
you know she's been sending Christmas cards to these same people 50 years you know and there's a little newsletter

26
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,920
that goes with it you know this year we did X Y and Z and stuff like this it's a

27
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:53,560
beautiful beautiful gesture I think I think and of course you know she receives some too and it's

28
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:00,800
nice but this idea of what you want or desire you know often has a bad rap

29
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,200
guess a bad rap in Buddhism this idea of that okay you know desire just leads to

30
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,400
suffering and I remember um somebody this was years ago when they discovered

31
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,799
that I was a Buddhist practitioner this is something that they just first thing what they wanted to say is oh yeah I

32
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:23,120
heard that Buddhism I don't like desire but how crazy is that I mean you can't

33
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,319
even desire to not have desire or you can't desire to be

34
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,640
awakened I was like no no no it's not like that it's not like that but you know that was their kind of idea on the

35
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,959
outside looking in and certainly maybe in the when we first start practicing and maybe I had that idea too I can't

36
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:49,599
remember this idea like oh yeah we somehow we should be free of uh all

37
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:56,599
desires and that's not quite how it works that's not quite how it works and

38
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:04,040
so today I'd like to unpack a little bit this IDE IDE of desire and partly of how it can be a big

39
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:10,120
support for our path to Greater freedom and peace and ease as well as you know

40
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,639
it can be problematic so maybe I'll start by saying you know of course in the broad

41
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,880
sense in the very broad sense that uh desire is just a natural part of the

42
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:29,919
human experience of the desire to eat when we're hungry desire to use the bathroom when

43
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:37,400
the body needs to eliminate waste right these are just natural things that happen we also have you know just these

44
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:43,440
like leanings we might say or inclinations or aspirations or you know

45
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,720
this uh going a particular direction of course we do of course we

46
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:55,520
do there not a we're not trying to get rid of this or deny it or somehow turn

47
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:02,560
ourselves into machines that would be awful we're not machines we're

48
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,520
humans and we have uh human bodies and human temperaments that's just the way

49
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:16,960
it is and it's a beautiful thing so but there's also a way in which

50
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:26,479
we also have cravings and addictions and some uh clinging that are

51
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:33,199
harmful harmful to ourselves harmful to others that's part of the human condition too very

52
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:40,080
often and so that Buddha of course he didn't teach that all Desir should be

53
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:48,440
eliminated these healthy ones that desire for food or connection or the desire for not causing harm or for the

54
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:55,000
desire for greater ease greater Freedom greater peace of course those should be

55
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,240
cultivated and worked with and instead of trying to eradicate

56
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,479
all the ones that we feel like oh I I shouldn't feel this way or something

57
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,599
like this can we understand them and transform these desires into something

58
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:17,919
that can be helpful so as you might imagine uh

59
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:24,800
classically in the Buddhist tradition that the desires are put in two camps those that are helpful and those are

60
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:31,160
that are not helpful cusa is the PO word I'm translating it as helpful it's kind of

61
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:37,560
our experience of it is as helpful there's all kinds of other English words that we could use but I'm going to stick

62
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,800
with this idea of helpful helpful for more ease in our life helpful for more

63
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,039
peace helpful for more freedom helpful for more ease uh equinity all all kinds

64
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:56,039
of this things that we really want in our life so the helpful ones we could say

65
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:02,800
are those that are aligned with well-being that contribute to well-being maybe

66
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,240
that's just a simple way to think about it and it's not only well-being for ourselves but contributes to well-being

67
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:15,039
for others and I am making a distinction here between wellbeing and

68
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:22,199
pleasure you know well-being is a sense of that promotes health and balance and

69
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:28,599
some stability and spaciousness as opposed to just pleasure that just leads

70
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:34,000
to wanting more pleasure and can lead to heedlessness and things

71
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,240
that make our life go arai or can make our life

72
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:48,199
go so those not only that promoting a sense of well-being but they're characterized by the experience of some

73
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:53,560
spaciousness or some

74
00:07:53,639 --> 00:08:00,120
lightness I mean this is like such a small example but today while I was out for a walk

75
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:08,599
um apparently it's the conditions for lots of mushrooms to pop up and I it was just so fantastic I'm walking like whoa

76
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:14,360
wow and just some of they were just ginormous this huge like white uh

77
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,639
mushrooms and I just took Delight in them walking a little further and then I saw some that were a different color and

78
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:26,319
they were so small they were so cute and I just felt my heart like who knew that

79
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:33,279
underneath the ground were all these uh risom of uh you know these fun dry and

80
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,080
uh and then there was this desire to well how many different types of mushrooms are here so while I'm walking

81
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:46,680
along I'm keeping an eye and I don't know it was just fun and it just made me appreciate like wow what you know these

82
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:52,160
are here all the time under the soil and we just don't see them until uh it's

83
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,519
dark and rainy and I don't know exactly what the conditions are but apparently the conditions are being met right now

84
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:03,640
at least in the some places so this desire to like feel that Delight again

85
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,920
when I'm seeing all these different mushrooms different types different

86
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:16,760
colors and different places and so there's this sense of lightness and a little bit of a uplift uh we might say

87
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:23,519
Associated that's just it's harmless uh desire and maybe that's a silly

88
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:30,000
example but we could say that desire for spiritual growth

89
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,600
desire for Liberation from suffering or we could say desire for not

90
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,680
causing harm to ourselves or to others to live an ethical

91
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:50,079
Life One in which we're you know being sensitive to the impact that we're having on others and uh in the world

92
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:56,959
that can show up in so many ways and then in contrast we could say well this unhelpful desire is the one

93
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:03,920
that we might use the the expression craving that falls into like I got to

94
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,959
have it I got to have it I don't care about all this other stuff I got to have

95
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:15,560
this and there's this way this craving has a this un Like It's associated with

96
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:22,320
a contraction in the body and this uh maybe this compulsion that's uh moving

97
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:29,160
us forward towards I I got to get this cigarettes

98
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:40,160
shopping gambling alcohol food it's amazing the things that we can

99
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,680
crave right the things that we can really want and have this sense of okay

100
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:52,440
well as soon as I get this then I'll feel better I just got to

101
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:59,920
get this and I I don't care how I feel right now I'm not noticing how uncomfortable it feels I just got to get

102
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:07,600
this thing whether it's a brownie or drugs or whatever it might be alcohol

103
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:14,480
it's it's just there's no end to the things that we can become addicted to or just

104
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,959
crave so not only like made things that we're addicted to but there's a way that

105
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:27,399
which we can crave or maybe I'll I could use a different word also like cling

106
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:33,240
to and this can be this maybe even material possessions this idea is that there's

107
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,320
some objects that okay as soon as I have this then that'll be a source of lasting

108
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:46,519
happiness we don't use that language but that's what's underneath it we think okay not only will it be pleasurable for

109
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:53,560
a moment when I get it but it'll be a source of lasting happiness so I want to just do a little

110
00:11:53,560 --> 00:12:00,760
experiment a little uh with you guys or a little um uh exercise

111
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,880
here because there's this way in which exploring

112
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:12,199
desire can be enormously helpful very powerful way to find more

113
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:20,880
freedom not always easy not always comfortable not always fast and neat and

114
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:28,680
tidy but powerful so let's like just bring to

115
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:36,680
mind something you want and for now let's focus well I'll

116
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:43,639
give some examples so something you want it could be something significant it could be like objects a

117
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:51,920
car house different place to live or maybe a relationship if you don't have one

118
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:58,279
right now or whatever you know something something like something significant to you like that would different job to

119
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:03,880
live in a different place place or it could be just something minor or

120
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:10,199
small like a grande skinny half

121
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:16,040
CF I wrote it down here pumpkin spice latte with two pumps extra hot you know

122
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:23,000
like it's impressive right all these things that uh you can have at your favorite uh Barista can serve

123
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,880
you so it can be whatever you want you know something like this it could be a long-term goal like a degree a

124
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:37,079
certification payoff loans you know something like this or um it could be

125
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:45,079
something just fleeting like you know what I'm just didn't have enough dinner earlier and I'm kind of hungry and I'm thinking of having some burritos or or

126
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:52,759
some cookies or whatever it might be so just bring to mind something that you feel like you would

127
00:13:55,959 --> 00:14:02,600
want and maybe just I I don't know feel into

128
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:08,279
uh how you what it feels like oh yeah I'd like to have

129
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:15,519
uh I finally get a new car that uh can impress the neighbors and demonstrate

130
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:22,839
that I've uh finally made it financially successful or or a car that demonstrates

131
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:28,040
that I'm ecologically minded I get an electric car or something like

132
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:33,800
this and then just notice how your mood changes when you start to thinking about

133
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:42,480
oh yeah as soon as a loans are paid off or as soon as the grandchild is uh born

134
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,560
or uh you know whatever it might be whatever it might be and there's this

135
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:55,399
way in which we start when we start to think about what we want there's often this little bit of an

136
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:00,560
uplift there's this way in which this sense of s sadness or heaviness might

137
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,199
shift to oh yeah it's going to be great as soon as I

138
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:13,680
get this thing that I want can you feel into that this maybe a sense of uplift

139
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:20,079
that happens maybe there's a sense of some

140
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:25,959
tension goes away or maybe there's some sense a little bit more calm as you're

141
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:31,560
fantasizing about how great it's going to be when what you want finally

142
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,000
is has arisen you have

143
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:42,240
it there's this way in which you might feel lighter or happier or maybe even

144
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,800
more connected because when there's this way when

145
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:53,959
there's a sense of a future promise future promise or something that's

146
00:15:53,959 --> 00:16:01,920
bigger that's about to happen it somehow can make our life seem promising Ing and

147
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:10,720
exciting can make it I don't know like there's some juiciness to it in uh some kind of

148
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:17,800
way and this can be a nice feeling it's not surprising that we often are lost in fantasies about uh what we're going to

149
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:23,959
have we don't call them fantasies but this is completely 100% fantasy right what you were just thinking about is not

150
00:16:23,959 --> 00:16:29,560
here right this uh moment

151
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,680
so there's this way that maybe we can stay with

152
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:45,360
this uh what we want noticing how the mind and the body

153
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,560
kind of liked to have this sense of wanting but now can you have a gentle

154
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:59,240
inquiry what is the subtle belief that is underneath it like what do you think

155
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:06,319
will happen once you obtain whatever it is that is the object of your desire is

156
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:11,400
this I'm assuming that there's this implicit belief that achieving it will

157
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:17,038
improve your life I think that's a reasonable

158
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:24,480
assumption but can you be a little bit more specific I want to promotion because

159
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,440
then I will earn more money and have more respect

160
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:36,080
and then when we say that it's often really

161
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,440
subtle is this sense of lack I don't have enough

162
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:48,039
money I don't have enough respect they should respect me more I

163
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:53,280
should have more money and that doesn't feel good that does to have that like

164
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:00,000
sense of lack doesn't feel good or maybe there's this place I want to have a bigger place to live a better place to

165
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,600
live because then I can invite people over and I can have parties and uh

166
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,240
there'll be room for lots of people and then I won't feel so lonely

167
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:17,240
maybe it's like ouch like to feel into the sense of

168
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:22,960
loneliness or the sense of lack or whatever it might

169
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:30,400
be and so there's this way that uh

170
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,679
often it's these subtle feelings of things not being quite

171
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:42,600
right I want more that's actually fueling our

172
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:50,120
desires but if we can recognize what it is that's fueling these desires and to

173
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:57,360
be with it as best we can this will lead to Greater

174
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:05,919
Freedom this will lead to Greater peace and ease not just getting one more thing

175
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:12,760
whether it's the promotion whether it's the degree whether it's the

176
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:20,200
cupcake because there's this way in which it's so easy to live our lives

177
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:26,919
just chasing desire after the another our whole life could be nothing but this

178
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:34,440
just trying to get the next thing I got a feel better I got to feel better and we're just completely ignoring this

179
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:41,280
Dua this uh things have sensed not being right this can be subtle or it can be

180
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,679
really loud this is not easy it's not

181
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,039
comfortable it's not fun but there's a way when we just

182
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:58,760
simply acknowledge oh yeah there's loneliness I feel lonely

183
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:05,400
and can we acknowledge it and still have some uprightness and feel the loneliness

184
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:11,240
maybe in the body the heaviness in the shoulders or tightness in the

185
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:19,919
chest maybe some pressure behind the eyes and then can we just loneliness

186
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:26,400
feels like this we don't have to say it should be different in fact

187
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,440
it's just the way it is humans feel lonely sometimes even people

188
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:38,360
who are very um gregarious and you know extroverted and are surrounded around

189
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:45,360
people they feel lonely sometimes can we like normalize and

190
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:51,360
honor and respect our experience instead of thinking like I

191
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:59,480
should be different looking at all those other people they have lots of money surely they're happy

192
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,679
how many really rich people do we know that are in the media all the time and

193
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:10,760
are clearly not happy you can see by all the weird things that they do if they

194
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:15,278
were happy they would not be out there doing that weird

195
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,919
stuff so there's this way in which recognizing

196
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:30,080
desire and there's you know it brings some uplift and part of this uplift lift

197
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,279
is recognizing that or maybe part of us um

198
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:40,840
in the present moment we can just recognize that the

199
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:46,440
illusion of this fictitious Bliss this fictitious Bliss this completely thing

200
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:53,880
that's a fantasy that okay as soon as I get that it's uh going to be fine will

201
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:59,159
never let's say let me say it a different way our present moment experience

202
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:06,559
will never be as wonderful as this fictitious Bliss it just won't here's one key reason there's a

203
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:12,640
number of reasons here's one key reason this little thing called

204
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:19,440
anicha impermanence things change the Buddha pointed to this as well right

205
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,360
there's that what we gain we eventually lose including like this hedonic

206
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:33,640
treadmill something that makes us happy stops making up us happy and there's this way in which Joy

207
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:39,400
turns into sorrow soy sorrow turns into joy as well I

208
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,480
don't know what soy turns into I guess but well I guess it depends if you eat

209
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,880
it well okay we could go down there but so it's just things are changing

210
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,799
that's just the natural way things are but in our fictitious Bliss it's just

211
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:02,840
like okay I'm going to get this and it's going to be a source of lasting Happiness full stop right it's just not

212
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:09,159
going to happen that way and there's this way in which actually this um there

213
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:15,840
can be a little bit of a relief to realize oh it's not that I'm failing

214
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:22,120
it's not that I'm doing everything wrong that I had these fantasies these ideas about how things should be and I'm not

215
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:29,600
quite as happy and this is my story I'll say of how I find myself here

216
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:35,480
having a PhD in Biochemistry and yet here I am being a Darman teacher like how did that

217
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,960
happen and I'm a very slow learner because uh I went to school have all

218
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,960
this hyper educated and uh was a biochemist I love biochemistry but

219
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:53,279
somehow you know having a lot of professional success and yet oh yeah

220
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:59,400
yeah okay that that didn't quite make me happy and I'm a slow learner because then I went back back to graduate school

221
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:05,799
think okay I just have to learn something else and became you know in Buddha studies and I have another graduate

222
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:12,480
degree in Buddha studies and then realize oh yeah okay that that didn't quite make me happy in

223
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:18,559
the way that I thought it would either right there's this way in which we just for me it was this idea that I just have

224
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:24,360
to learn more I just have to learn more it's not surprising you know having

225
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:29,559
this coming from my family background and stuff and so how many things have

226
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:37,080
you just thought okay well I just maybe that wasn't the right car or it wasn't the right whatever it

227
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:45,760
is it can be a relief to think like no actually our ideas about things they're

228
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:53,200
I kind of like this word fantasies which you know is a little bit pejorative but the truth is they're just

229
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:59,320
thoughts they're just ideas they're just uh

230
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:06,399
imaginations we have they have a place they have a role but our actual

231
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:11,520
experience will never match sometimes it'll be better

232
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:18,919
sometimes it'll be worse but it'll never match what we're imagining maybe we'll be a happier it'll

233
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:25,120
be more pleasurable than what we were imagining but it will

234
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:32,200
change this is something about fantasies that don't really take that into

235
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:40,960
account so what are the what are wants this is part of you know working with

236
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:47,640
them or being with them or honoring and respecting them they're just simply a thought that's arising from an

237
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:55,600
underlying belief they're just thoughts often uh they're very quiet

238
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,880
maybe we'll call them beliefs that they're maybe not you know articulated so clearly as thoughts but you know

239
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:07,520
they're completely you know insubstantial but these ideas that

240
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:15,679
promise a different imagined future but when we look at our desires

241
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:23,080
what we want we can kind of like look underneath to see okay what are the underlying

242
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:28,760
belief will make me feel secure uh I'll no longer feel afraid

243
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:36,080
people will respect me I will other people will love

244
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:41,960
me and then we can just pay attention to

245
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:49,039
that we're complex beings humans we have all these things under there and so much

246
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:54,559
we don't want to acknowledge but paying attention to our desires and what's

247
00:26:54,559 --> 00:27:03,399
underneath it and can we be with that and sometimes it can be helpful to

248
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:10,320
not and to drop the labels yeah I want to be loved I feel

249
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:16,799
unloved can we feel that in the body and then drop the labels and just

250
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:22,799
be with the bodily experience right now it feels like this

251
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:29,679
it feels uh heavy it feels like really tight

252
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:35,720
feels like uh wanting to hide or something like

253
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,840
this so we might reflect on is are we trying to escape from something are we

254
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:49,279
trying to reject a part of ourselves are we dismissing a part of ourselves is there something we're trying to avoid

255
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:56,039
and then just to be with the experience to stop

256
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,480
avoiding as best we can and even if it's just for a fleeting

257
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:08,880
moment just to acknowledge it can we hold the space for

258
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:17,360
this for the bodily experience for the belief and then there was a uh

259
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,880
underneath that was like I want to be loved and then the bodily experience that's associated with wanting to be

260
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:29,039
loved can we just be with that hold the space with it

261
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:34,679
and this will lead to Greater peace this will lead to Greater Freedom this will

262
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:41,760
lead to Liberation a Liberation from being pushed around from always chasing

263
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:47,200
our desires chasing the next thing okay well

264
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,640
as soon as I get this next thing it's going to be fine we have those ideas When We're

265
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:58,799
Young until we get a number of things and we realize oh yeah I'm still not happy

266
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:05,039
so some we it doesn't help that you know somebody to tell you for somebody like me to be sitting here and to be saying

267
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:12,279
oh yeah uh it's not going to be satisfying we all have to have that experience ourself but as we get older

268
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:17,480
we realize yeah what I thought was going to make me happy

269
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:25,080
wasn't the pleasures that we seek they evaporate

270
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:31,360
quickly and we overestimate how much happiness they will bring this is part

271
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,000
of the human

272
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:45,360
condition so what I just described is not easy it's not fast it's probably exactly

273
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:53,760
what you don't want to do instead it's so much I nicer to think like okay as soon as I get uh this car

274
00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:00,960
or as soon as I retire as soon as uh I move to that other place I I don't know right we our lives are filled with these

275
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:09,519
things that we can want but here are some things to do to make it easier or to be a

276
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:18,279
support bring curiosity to desires this is a starting place okay I

277
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:27,399
really do want this whatever that list was half calf extra hot um pumpkin spice

278
00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:33,519
latte skinny I don't know there were some other things there lower two pumps oh

279
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:39,600
two pumps that's right I said two pumps thank you three pups I guess if you really

280
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:46,679
want it [Laughter] right that was so great thank [Laughter]

281
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:52,279
you so just bring a curiosity to it you

282
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:57,559
can bring curiosity to like oh yeah how we're so often focused on the object

283
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:02,880
that thing out there but can we bring some curiosity

284
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,120
well how does it feel both we can curiosity about that

285
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:13,720
thing but also what's our experience we have this idea um um it'll be soothing

286
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:19,600
it'll be comforting I deserve it it's the holiday season pumpkin spice latte I

287
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:25,360
did go into the particular coffee shops website and try to get some ideas here

288
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:31,519
and they have like gingerbread lattes peppermint lattes is quite something right for the

289
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:37,320
holidays but so this brings some curiosity to what do

290
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:43,360
I why do I want it what is what is the why do I want it

291
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:51,880
and what is the experience of wanting it like is it feeling like oh yeah like

292
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:59,120
we're dis completely disconnected from our experience often instead we're thinking about okay what are we going to have

293
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,960
you know as soon as I get that that'll be great I'm going to maybe um share it with a friend we're both going to get

294
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:13,399
something and spend some time and I can connect and like oh okay there's this idea of comfort and wanting to

295
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:19,559
connect so just bring some curiosity to that experience and then the second thing

296
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:25,760
that we can do which is really important really important in our lives can we

297
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:33,240
just in general and small little Jes cultivate

298
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:39,679
contentment there are times in our life when we just things are fine maybe we're

299
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,799
going for a walk and we just notice there's mushrooms there's a little bit of

300
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:50,320
delight everything just perfectly fine nothing has to be different and just to

301
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:57,440
acknowledge right now nothing needs to be different there's this way in which we

302
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:03,480
kind of like uh to honor and respect those human experiences of

303
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:09,320
contentment as uh maybe uh orients the mind and the body

304
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:17,440
towards oh yeah this is possible it doesn't require that we get everything that we have or that we want sorry it's

305
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:23,720
about you know appreciating whatever is arising there in the moment and there's this way that

306
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:29,360
contentment can feel like the booby prize like okay if I can get what I want

307
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:37,159
okay I'll practice contentment you know there is but it turns

308
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:44,080
out that freedom is radical

309
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:52,519
contentment freedom is feeling like yep it's okay it's not being a bliss blob

310
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:58,240
it's like yep everything's okay this is what freedom is because the lack of

311
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,960
freedom is being pushed around by our desires I have to get this I have to avoid this other thing or whatever it

312
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:10,079
might be and we don't talk about freedom in this way we tend to think that freedom

313
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:15,200
means that we can have whatever we want but it's actually a radical contentment

314
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:21,200
like everything is okay it's not pretending like there isn't pain it's

315
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:26,240
not pretending like there isn't terrible injustices and pression in the world

316
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:35,480
it's not pretending that all that doesn't exist is just recognizing this moment just this moment

317
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:41,520
it's okay and maybe my life situation allows

318
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:48,679
me to help others maybe my life situation right now

319
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:54,520
is a tremendous amount of difficulties and I need to uh pay attention to my

320
00:34:54,520 --> 00:35:00,359
responsibilities and what I can do to alleviate some of those difficulties and

321
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:06,200
maybe I'm have this inclination this wish to help others I can't support others as much as I'd like right now

322
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:11,880
right now I need to also pay attention to what's happening here but I have the contentment that right

323
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,920
now this is okay this is

324
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:24,960
okay so cultivating contentment allows us also to be with

325
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,240
desire because we start to really understand that oh I don't have to get

326
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:36,160
everything I want in order to feel

327
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,839
okay and not only that with this contentment is a a little taste of

328
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:48,720
Freedom maybe it's a big Taste of freedom and it's so I know when I first

329
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:54,319
heard this idea contentment I don't know it didn't sound so

330
00:35:54,319 --> 00:36:01,160
appealing but now I love it it's turn turns out to be so great I've you know

331
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:06,359
done a lot of meditation and uh had a lot of meditative experiences but

332
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:13,200
there's something about contentment that is enormously

333
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:20,280
satisfying and this is what humans really want contentment

334
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:25,800
satisfaction a stopping of that that nagging like oh I got to get something

335
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:31,400
else it's not quite right so

336
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,839
desire wishless we might have a wishless that's

337
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:42,240
fine if you find that you really want something in particular an object you

338
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:49,520
can practice use that as like oh yeah there's a lot of Desire here and just use that as an opportunity to to maybe

339
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:57,680
understand yourself a little bit better look into what is the underlying belief that's uh fueling that desire that want

340
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:03,079
and can we just honor and respect that it can be a way of uh finding more ease

341
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:10,920
in the moment or maybe you have desire for world peace for yourself to not

342
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:17,119
cause harm to yourself to not cause harm to others maybe you have desire

343
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:24,480
for having compassion and loving kindness and these types of things the world some wholesome

344
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:32,240
desires and celebrate that cultivate those and can we cultivate

345
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:38,640
contentment as a way to help us have the steadiness that we can work with desire

346
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:44,920
so we're not just automatically falling into desire after

347
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:53,160
desire so I'll stop there and I'll open it up for some comments or questions

348
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,400
thank you

349
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,400
anybody have something they'd uh like to say or make a comment

350
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:29,400
on hello great talk thank you so in my experience uh when I

351
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:37,079
practice um with contentment uh and desire sometimes but not always

352
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:42,760
I can't quite distinguish between a wholesome

353
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:48,400
contentment uh and a not so wholesome apathy or disinterest or

354
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,680
disengagement or on the flip side of the spectrum distinguishing a wholesome

355
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,880
ambition um the kind of ambition that produces excellence in relationships or

356
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:05,079
career or um or art uh the wholesome ambition

357
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:10,119
from UNH wholesome egoic uh

358
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:15,760
desire and so uh contentment or ambition yeah distinguishing wholesome from UNH

359
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:21,160
wholesome I wonder if you have any thoughts on that I do I can this is a

360
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:27,520
great topic I should I could give a whole another Dharma talk on this uh um Al so I'll give some bullet points uh

361
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:34,720
here sure so one is um I use this uh for myself I use this uh feeling and you

362
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:40,800
this and uh you can kind like maybe transla into something that makes sense for you it doesn't necessarily what I'm

363
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:47,440
going to describe work for everybody the way I'm describing it but things that um are supportive so

364
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:55,720
like wholesome they have a sense of spaciousness I'm doing this with my hands there's this uh as opposed to a

365
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:03,040
contraction and so contra action feels like literally sometimes the muscles are tight the shoulders up near the ears or

366
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:11,640
there's a furrowing of the brow or but sometimes it's subtle there's a feeling like in the Torso like in the gut or in

367
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:17,400
the heart area there's like this tightness so the wholesome supportive

368
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:24,160
has this General sense of openness and ease so I'll say that's one one

369
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:31,520
thing um a second thing that is um a little bit more cognitive is if there is

370
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:38,520
a a certain uh clinging to particular outcomes I'm doing this in order that

371
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:44,240
this happens of course we do things we often have like an idea about what's

372
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:50,359
going to happen but there can be a way in which it's I got to get this and then

373
00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:56,200
we're not in touch with ourselves or any harm we're causing to others or to ourselves or anything like this instead

374
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:02,319
we're just so focused I'm getting this thing dang it whether that's a ambition

375
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:09,319
or there can also be um a way that subtle uh contentment that is not

376
00:41:09,319 --> 00:41:15,839
helpful turns out not to be contentment it turns about this apathy or disconnection or something there's this

377
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:21,440
subtle way in which the outcome is I don't want to

378
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:28,680
feel I don't want to feel as opposed to I feel this contentment

379
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:36,560
and so that that outcome is uh often subtle but there often if there's this

380
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:42,440
apathy or disconnection or something there's often can be um a lot of

381
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:51,079
avoidance behaviors like we're distracting ourselves with something and or there's some uh fogginess like they

382
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:56,640
just like just not clear we're just kind of disconnected Spacey or something like

383
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:03,280
that so spaciousness versus

384
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:10,359
constriction and uh uh clinging to particular outcomes as opposed to oh

385
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:16,800
yeah this is the next right thing to do I'm I I imagine it's going this direction but I'm just doing the next

386
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,520
right thing to do is what I'm focused on is is that helpful yeah that's helpful thank you

387
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:29,119
you're welcome I I I also kind of wondered about energy level in there as well where

388
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,960
contentment if it's really relaxed you there isn't a great

389
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:45,440
drive a compulsion to act if you're if uh with with spaciousness ease

390
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:52,440
relaxation there can be a nice contentment in a settling in such that you don't feel any

391
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:59,839
particular urge to go and create a great work of art or create a great project at work or yeah overcome a hurdle in a

392
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:04,920
relationship you're just so relaxed and at ease so I wonder about that

393
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:10,400
energy where does that energy come from and perhaps I want to challenge this

394
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:18,040
actually I want to challenge this idea I think with contentment for me it kind of like frees up energy that otherwise is

395
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:24,760
associated with trying to avoid things or something like that things are happy then it's also like inspiration like

396
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:30,599
there's new ideas for art or or for oh it's often when insights can arise like

397
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:36,160
oh right oh okay this problem can get solved by doing X Y or Z and then off

398
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:41,400
you go so there can be some energy with this too because often when there's

399
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:46,680
strong drive you know what's fueling it sometimes is some discontent right it's

400
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:52,760
like okay this has got to be different so and the drive comes

401
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:58,400
from yeah I guess so there can be energy with contentment as well cool yeah very

402
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,000
interesting landscape thank you yeah you're

403
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:13,880
welcome well maybe I'll end this evening I want to say something cute

404
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:20,838
um about wish lists checking it

405
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:28,920
twice I don't know see I don't know just this uh this idea that you know desire

406
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:34,800
is just part of our experience and is there a way that we can use it to

407
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:41,520
support greater Freedom peace and ease for ourselves and for others and for

408
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:48,160
others so thank you and on my wish list is for you all to have a safe travels
