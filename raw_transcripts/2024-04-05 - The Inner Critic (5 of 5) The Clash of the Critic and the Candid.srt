1
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:06,480
good morning good morning welcome welcome good afternoon good evening and

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,759
maybe even hello to the Future right some people listen to this uh I'll be listening to this in the future so we'll

3
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:18,680
send warm-hearted greetings to them as well but I'd like to start this guided

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:24,840
meditation with just looking around your wherever you happen to

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,480
be and uh just notice two things that

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:37,640
uh feel I don't know a little bit uplifting or fun or you have nice memories

7
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,559
too I have this little elephant on my desk so for an example I don't know it

8
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,920
just makes me happy I just like this uh little elephant so maybe you have something maybe there's a beautiful

9
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:57,120
plant maybe there's something on the wall that you put there years ago and

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,080
don't notice as much and what whatever it might be so just

11
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:08,680
uh just allow yourself to maybe connect and appreciate something that's in your

12
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:15,159
living space maybe if it's not an object maybe it's a color or maybe there's a sense of

13
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:21,280
spaciousness or maybe a sense of coziness whatever it might be is there

14
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,600
something that I don't know makes you smile in some kind of

15
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:35,280
way and then we just taking a meditation

16
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:48,200
posture few deep breaths with long

17
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:03,000
exhales just allowing the physiology to

18
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:11,080
settle maybe to diminish some of any agitation that might or might not be

19
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,360
there and letting the breathing return to

20
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:38,920
normal and bringing to mind somebody some being that uh like

21
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:46,000
makes the heart feel warm this can be

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,959
absolutely anybody any being

23
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:58,680
anything we just want to have an orientation towards warmth and

24
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:05,720
openness and in whatever way feels accessible to you right

25
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:33,840
now connecting with this delightful or

26
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,400
lovely or heartwarming being or

27
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:47,879
object just allowing ourselves to feel the appreciation or warmth or

28
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:53,280
openness or however it's experienced for

29
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,720
you

30
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:31,160
and then to feel into the experience of

31
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,000
sitting in this body at this

32
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:48,720
moment feeling the pressure of the chair cushion bed couch wherever you are

33
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,360
against the body I feel the pressure against the

34
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,680
back if you're using a back rest

35
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:06,240
or on the back side all of us are unless you're standing I guess you

36
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:13,759
would have pressure against the buttocks as well in the back of the

37
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:22,038
legs and chances are the feet are touching something as

38
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,639
well so feeling these places of support

39
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,918
connection being felt this pressure against the

40
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:06,759
body and noticing if there are any areas of tension or

41
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,800
tightness bringing some warmth and care to those

42
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:22,599
areas can we allow them to be there and greet them or meet them

43
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:31,560
with some warmth and openness as best we can not always easy

44
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
e

45
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:14,400
then can we bring this sense of connection sense of

46
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,720
warmth this attitude of maybe some

47
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,039
spaciousness openness even if it's just a small

48
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:31,440
amount can we bring that attitude

49
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:39,840
to the experience of breathing hello

50
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
breath

51
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
e

52
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:51,959
just feeling the body breathing a stretch in the chest

53
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:58,440
orbe a feeling of the abdomen the belly going in and

54
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:06,000
out or feeling the different temperatures of air going

55
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,959
in and out of the nose whatever feels

56
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:17,519
comfortable available just resting our attention on

57
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:24,600
the sensations of breathing with an attitude of

58
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:31,360
connection warmth openness ease

59
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
e

60
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:23,600
it wouldn't be surprising if the Mind wandered and we just invite it back

61
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:31,320
in welcome attention back in

62
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,440
the experience of [Music]

63
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:48,040
breathing no need to chastise ourselves condemn ourselves beat ourselves up

64
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:53,200
because the mind is wondering that's all

65
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,320
extra we're just keeping it

66
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:05,320
simple tuning into the inhales for

67
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:35,839
example turning into

68
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,279
exhales how do they

69
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
feel

70
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:27,240
about the transitions between inhales and exhales can we receive

71
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:33,000
them tune into them be sensitive to them just

72
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,240
noticing what does it feel

73
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
like

74
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

75
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

76
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:18,320
at the beginning of this meditation I encouraged you to

77
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:25,120
connect either an object or an individual

78
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,279
or any type of being

79
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:37,820
it supports a sense of warmth and openness [Music]

80
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:44,680
smiling what would it be like to meditate with either that

81
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:50,000
attitude the connection and smiling or maybe

82
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,519
with that [Music] being what would it be like to feel

83
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:03,800
accompanied the support support the

84
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:17,600
Delight encouraging a mind State and attitude

85
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,959
a direction of kindness and

86
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
warmth

87
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

88
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

89
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

90
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

91
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

92
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

93
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

94
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

95
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

96
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:34,039
e you might have to recharge this attitude

97
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:39,960
of WTH and connection sometimes this inner critic

98
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:48,320
can slip in just encouraging an

99
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:54,080
orientation towards openness

100
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,640
care and simplicity

101
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:04,919
as we rest the attention on the sensations of

102
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
breathing

103
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

104
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

105
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

106
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

107
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

108
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

109
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

110
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

111
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:46,599
[Music]

112
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:57,240
[Music]

113
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:03,650
for [Music]

114
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:17,789
[Music]

115
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:42,480
welcome welcome for our fifth and uh last day

116
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,919
that we're talking about the Ino critic I did a little typo when I

117
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:55,039
initially was putting the title for this session I put five of 50 inste of five

118
00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:00,279
of five and it seems like we could do 50 right right seems like the inner critic

119
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:06,640
maybe it just maybe it's just me which I feel like wow there's a lot of stuff that we could do

120
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,799
here I I've been describing the inner critic as this uh Dynamic that often

121
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:18,080
happens not everybody has it but a lot of people do a surprising number of

122
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:24,760
people do in fact there's a way in which uh it's seems like so many of us are

123
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:30,960
moving through life like projecting I got it together I know what I'm doing

124
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,679
and it's quite something because so many people don't actually feel like they have it together and but we're all like

125
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:44,240
pretending like we do it's this uh I don't know part of how our culture is these days so this inner critic of this

126
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:52,080
Dynamic of putting us down belittling us and blaming ourselves nagging at

127
00:27:52,080 --> 00:28:00,640
ourselves kind of maybe comes with a sense of Shame like shame for just who we are in some vague kind of way and has

128
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,519
this uh feeling of harshness that's certainly not uh

129
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:15,120
Pleasant this feeling of you know I'm not enough or I'm not worthy or you know something like this that are often

130
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:21,840
subtle and pervasive so they often can be unnoticed and there's this way in

131
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:27,600
which it can just like creep in and it might be a little bit familiar so

132
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:33,360
familiar like okay we just are like putting on uh some clothing that uh or

133
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:39,640
shoes putting on a certain amount of shoes but shoes are you know a little bit uncomfortable but they're the shoe

134
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,960
there are shoes so we put them on there's something like how this inner

135
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:51,480
critic can be subtle and uh um constricting and we feel like okay well

136
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:59,640
it's going to help us in the same way that shoes help protect us from the environment you know rough things that U

137
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,880
pieces of glass or sharp objects of any

138
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:12,480
sort and so often this inner critic kind of like is masquerading or trying to convince us that it's

139
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:21,399
really helpful because it's protecting us and that certainly was true When We Were Young most likely but now this this

140
00:29:21,399 --> 00:29:28,120
uh this inner critic this way in which we're feeling um inadequate or just

141
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:37,440
getting attacked for just the slightest thing just this small thing then kind of gets globalized just because um maybe

142
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,840
you didn't say the perfect thing to that person at that time that now you're a

143
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:49,360
bad person you know it goes from one little example into something really big it's

144
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:58,320
generalized but this feeling attacked by this inner Dynamic a completely natural reaction is

145
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,720
to kind of like close down to tighten up

146
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:09,519
to maybe have like a shield or to harden and maybe like hide behind

147
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:16,440
that maybe in the same way that like shoes might be constrictive ill fitting shoes that are constrictive and

148
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:23,640
uncomfortable but we think well okay so I have to do it to uh look good make so that everybody think they look good or

149
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:31,120
to protect ourselves from something but there's also a way in which shoes like Shield us we might think it's helpful

150
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,519
but when it comes to the inner critic it causes us to maybe like

151
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:41,600
Harden to brace and contract and close

152
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:47,279
down and there's this way in which doing this becomes um we're a little we get a

153
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:53,880
little bit Frozen we get a little bit stuck without malleability and

154
00:30:53,880 --> 00:31:00,880
flexibility to move with what's happening as many of you know the Buddha described his mind before Awakening is

155
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:06,279
one that was really malleable wieldy when the inner critic is up and

156
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:14,039
attacking ourselves a natural response is to close down brace ourselves and

157
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:20,440
contract emotionally Frozen in some kind of way because this contraction puts uh

158
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:26,960
on hold any natural unfolding any natural processes that

159
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,600
might be working as we metabolize and work with uh the heart work with our

160
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:37,639
life experience but also like when the inner critic is up and running and then

161
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:43,080
there's this contraction then some healing also gets put on hold there's

162
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:49,440
this kind of like frozenness in which uh everything kind of gets

163
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:57,919
stagnant kind like drains the energy and the joy and the all the beautiful things in our life

164
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:04,840
kind of like drains out as we're protecting ourselves from the inner critic but at the same time cutting

165
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:11,919
ourselves off from life really so this inner critic it's trying

166
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:18,880
to protect us and it's telling us like okay this is what you need to deal

167
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,639
effectively with uh whatever life is bringing you

168
00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:30,120
but maybe as you know in your own experience the way

169
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:38,679
forward the way to have more joy and openness and ease in our life is the

170
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:46,080
opposite movement of the inner critic whereas the inner critic wants to protect and shield and tighten us and

171
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:52,240
contract The Way Forward is this certain amount of opening and spaciousness and

172
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:59,960
some warmth and kind of the way forward is like shedding some of these protective layers that are keeping us

173
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:06,240
Frozen so this the opposite direction we might say

174
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,278
if the inner critic is some

175
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:16,880
vulnerability is some emotional

176
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:22,360
sensitivity willingness to expose oneself

177
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:28,519
to uncertainty no guarantees that it will

178
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:33,919
we won't get hurt right if we are open so this

179
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:40,200
vulnerability is the opposite of the inner critic the vulnerability is a Way

180
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:46,679
Forward not easy it takes courage yeah of course it

181
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:55,279
does so vulnerability begins or I say might begin just admitting to

182
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:00,840
ourselves what we're feeling and maybe that's just

183
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:07,080
journaling maybe it's um speaking out loud maybe it's allowing ourselves to

184
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:13,240
say oh yeah there's this Terror inside of me or there's this deep sadness or

185
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:20,079
loneliness or whatever it might be that's uh sometimes the inner critic

186
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,599
is getting um perpetuated as a way to encourage this

187
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:32,280
frozenness so that we don't don't feel this sadness this loneliness the

188
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:40,118
whatever it might be whatever it might be and so the way forward is

189
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:45,200
vulnerability which involves risk and involves

190
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,839
fear and risk and fear of course cause some anxiety and then the inner critic

191
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:56,440
loves it oh yes okay you don't want to feel anxious therefore you should you

192
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:01,640
know buckle down and stay contracted and closed in some kind of way so it's so

193
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:08,880
easy to get into this Loop of just staying closed down and

194
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:16,520
disconnected the way forward is some vulnerability the vulnerability is the

195
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:22,680
as we might say the birthplace the conditions for this

196
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:30,119
connection to ourselves this honor and respect to ourselves this honor and respect this

197
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:35,440
connection with others and it's through this connection

198
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:42,280
where we also have this love and sense of belonging and

199
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:47,880
joy that so many of us are looking for maybe we even came to spiritual practice

200
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:57,000
because we're looking for this and so this um vulnerability this openness

201
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:04,079
this spacious that's willing to be with whatever is arising is exactly what the

202
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:10,839
inner critic does not want you know there's this way in which it's

203
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:18,200
preventing us from experiencing what we actually want and this leads to a life that feels

204
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:26,760
uh maybe not with meaning or some way we feel disconnected or separate

205
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:33,880
from everybody else in some ways kind of like separate from ourselves like watching ourselves go through this

206
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:39,440
life but when we are vulnerable and actually show up for our lives great

207
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:45,079
things can happen and it does not mean we won't get

208
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:53,640
hurt it doesn't mean that we won't be heartbroken it's just uh also means that

209
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:58,760
beautiful things can happen that we can't even imagine when we're in the

210
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:04,720
kind of closed container of the inner critic we can't even imagine some of the beautiful things that might happen on

211
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:10,240
the other side of vulnerability on the other side of willing to

212
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:18,480
feel what's to be felt on this willingness to expose ourselves to

213
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,800
ourselves and maybe even expose ourselves to others depends what your life

214
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:29,760
circumstances are depends how your life is how you are you get to completely um

215
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,200
be in control of the vulnerability is it just with yourselves is it with

216
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:42,400
others but there's this way in which we grow up thinking that vulnerability is this weakness but it takes strength and

217
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:48,000
it takes courage to step into uncertainty to connect authentically

218
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,359
with ourselves or with others and it will kick up the inner

219
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:59,160
critic but Beauty love Grace Joy

220
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:06,960
connection all these things that so many of us are starving for in some kind of

221
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:14,760
way so it can be helpful to just think about um okay vulnerability is part of

222
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:21,280
the way forward and it can start with just being vulnerable with

223
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:28,560
ourselves and so might have add this onto what I've been talking to in the earlier days of the week so can we

224
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,599
approach kind of what we did earlier so Monday I said we could um say to

225
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:39,720
ourselves I'm doing the best I can right now there's a way in which there's some vulnerability right

226
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:45,800
there can we feel into that like okay yeah I'm doing the best I can Tuesday

227
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:52,880
was how am I right now like kind of like tuning into ourselves our experience of

228
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,560
that moment can we be vulnerable and say actually I'm not doing so

229
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:05,520
great and not tip into overwhelm feel a connection to wherever we are I started

230
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:11,640
this guided meditation with an invitation to look around the room and see if there's something there that

231
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:16,680
brings some Delight this can be tremendous support in our daily life and

232
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:24,319
in meditation to it's called resourcing to just like what are the resources that are available here from my heart and my

233
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:30,400
mind Wednesday I talked about judgment is like this when we feel it like oh

234
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:37,040
ouch this inner critic that's creating this brace this uh shell around us in

235
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:45,119
some kind of way can we be vulnerable and like it feels like this and it's really

236
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,079
uncomfortable and on Thursday I uh said maybe we could drop in what does the

237
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:59,240
heart say maybe the heart says ouch Maybe the heart says pay attention

238
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:06,839
to me whatever it might be being vulnerable can we like ask these questions and

239
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:12,960
really be open to what the answer might be and again you know all of us have to take care of ourselves if we have a

240
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:19,960
trauma history or if we you know however we are able our capacity at that moment

241
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:26,319
when we ask our capacities fluctuate throughout the day throughout our life so we have to be sensitive and wise to

242
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:31,560
that and vulnerability is about taking risks

243
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:37,040
about stretching our capacity

244
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:43,400
so this vulnerability is part of the way forward with the inner

245
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:49,800
critic and I wrote uh in the description like the clash of the critic and the

246
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:57,960
candid because vulnerability and the inner critic will always be kind like in a dialog AOS one

247
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:04,200
another the inner critic is going to say no don't do it can you do it

248
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:11,319
anyway and whatever way feels comfortable for you and whatever way is available for

249
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:17,760
you so this week I've been talking about the inner critic and there's a lot that can be said but um there's a way in

250
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:24,119
which our meditation practice it can really sneak in there as soon as we discover like oh I'm supposed to be on

251
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:30,640
the object and I've been uh off uh you know planning or fantasizing or

252
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:37,400
remembering or whatever it might be so thank you it's uh it's been really

253
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:42,720
fabulous to uh practice with you all this week and maybe I'll just say some

254
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:48,839
people have been reaching out and like Dana where where can I uh find where you're teaching or something like this

255
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:56,319
I'll just mention briefly in case it's of interest if you've ever thought like oh I'd like to go on a retreat but I'm

256
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:01,680
not sure well if you're in the Bay Area or willing to come to the Bay Area Tanya

257
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,880
Weiser and I are teaching a non-residential retreat for those people

258
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:13,839
who are curious about Retreat and want to know how do I do it what is it like what's going to be expected so it's

259
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:19,119
specifically for people who are new to retreat practice and you can find

260
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:25,079
information about that on the IMC website and then I'll just say I'm at

261
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:30,720
IRC in June and aug August in October and I'm in spare Rock in September and

262
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:38,480
Cloud Mountain in October so it's just just if you're interested on doing some Retreat practice and I'd love to

263
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,559
practice with you all it's a beautiful thing to practice

264
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:52,280
together so I hope this week of the working with the inner critic has been helpful and supportive and if it hasn't

265
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:58,480
just you know put it away and just take what is helpful just to take what is a

266
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:05,079
support for you and with some heartfelt wish for I

267
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:11,920
don't know may your day your practice your life be filled with ease and warmth

268
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:19,119

269
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:23,960

here with you all and it's very nice to read your comments

276
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:45,280
Eric asked a phrase for Friday I thought would there be a phrase and I didn't

277
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:52,760
have one but I've changed my mind I think I'll just like to bring some vulnerability to the other four

278
00:44:52,760 --> 00:45:00,680
phrases I think maybe that's a maybe be a better way to

279
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:18,240
support you guys are so great it's so much fun to teach with you

280
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:25,000
all yeah Lana there wasn't a phrase for Friday it was um just bringing

281
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:31,200
vulnerability to the other four phrases and then those other four

282
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:38,920
phrases might come alive in a particular way in a deeper way

283
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:51,680
maybe Cindy writes see you at the day long tomorrow Diana yes I'm teaching

284
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:58,920
online uh with IRC doing a day long tomorrow maybe I'll see somebody there

285
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:07,599
Julie writes thanks for waking up extra early this week yeah I think it's not so much waking up it's having to teach so

286
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:14,599
early I'm usually awake but uh you know not uh having to speak you know to

287
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:18,359
others or something but it's been such a

288
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:28,319
pleasure well writes you know how when you have dinner and it's time for everybody to leave but they stay at the

289
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:33,039
end yeah it's kind of like that too right but that's very

290
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:44,040
sweet can you repeat the four other phrases Monday I'm doing the best I can

291
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:49,319
right now Tuesday how am I right

292
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:55,319
now Wednesday judgment is like this and

293
00:46:55,319 --> 00:47:03,119
Thursday what does the heart say and maybe I'll invite all of you who

294
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:10,240
would like to have a phrase for Friday to make up your own phrase what was what's a phrase for you that can help

295
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:18,040
you with um being vulnerable while you're asking these other four phrases or just

296
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:25,040
um in your everyday life I thought about words like courage

297
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:31,039
or yeah I don't there's a number of different

298
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:40,559
things no phrase for Friday Lana no phrase just an encouragement to bring

299
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:45,079
vulnerability to the four other

300
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,839
phrases

301
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:12,559
how can vulnerability help me move forward and it's I am okay bravely go on

302
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:19,079
oh yeah these are some nice phrases maybe just try one on find one

303
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:23,640
that works for you that can help you that supports

304

exception
