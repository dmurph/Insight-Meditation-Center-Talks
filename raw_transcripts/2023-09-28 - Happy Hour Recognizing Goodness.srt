okay we're going to get started then time to get started so thank you Neil

18
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:56,400
for posting information on Zoom about rpr Google Groups we have a low traffic

19
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:05,099
mailing list and also there is information about how to offer yourself and other folks safety and and

20
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:10,980
care when we transition to small groups after the meditation so at this time I

21
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:18,199
change the settings so I'm muting won't be possible so the space stays quiet

22
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:23,759
and I also changed to chat settings but I ask you to keep it quiet even though

23
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,919
you can still send me chat but it can be distracting to receive chats in the middle of

24
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:35,000
Chang so let's keep that quiet and last but not least I turn on

25
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,979
recording for the sake of Audio Dharma

26
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,320
hey here we go all right hi everyone

27
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,540
welcome to happy hour so

28
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:59,699
this week for those of you who also attend the 7 A.M uh

29
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:07,460
teachings or that Gail usually does uh this week I'm substituting for Gail

30
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:14,280
and I'm covering um a teaching on

31
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,979
um what's called the five Aggregates anyway the five heaps the five candas

32
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:26,100
now What's um what I wanted to discuss tonight is

33
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,440
actually related to something I I cut I shared this morning 7 A.M

34
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,740
Pacific time and um and it's um

35
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,900
it's about our perception so today this morning I talked about perception or

36
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:48,000
recognition this this uh amazing

37
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,580
um capacity this constituent of our

38
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:59,400
experience which is recognizing which is perceiving

39
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,740
um what arises and and what arises in our

40
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:10,400
field of experience to recognize that to say this is that basically we're we're

41
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,380
being pattern recognition machines in many way given given our background our

42
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:23,460
history our mind States it's dependently Arisen based on so many factors this

43
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:28,740
recognition this recognizing this is that this is that that that's what the

44
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:35,639
Sanya or this this recognition recognition in Buddhism it points to a

45
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:41,340
different a little more simple much simpler than the concept of recognition

46
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,860
or perception in psychology so how does it relate to happy hour huh

47
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:54,740
the way I like to invite us to practice with this today is

48
00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:01,620
recognizing that our recognition is

49
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:07,860
very shiftable changeable it's not fixed it's

50
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:14,880
not inherent in a particular person or object or situation

51
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:22,680
um it's malleable our recognition or classification of something as friendly

52
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:29,880
or unfriendly or good or bad it's it's very very malleable

53
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,340
that it's I mean that's the one of the primary teachings of the Buddha which

54
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,860
really relates to um this concept of emptiness which thing we

55
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:46,500
when we hear that we think of nullness but it's really it's this codependently

56
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:52,919
Arisen it's dependent um that that our recognition is dependent on so many different things

57
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:58,680
including our state of mind including how we've primed ourselves

58
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:04,220
things are not fixed they are malleable they're changeable

59
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:09,740
there's not a truth or reality with capital r out there it's all

60
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:17,280
phenomenologically determined and so is our level of Freedom our level of Happiness we've talked about happiness

61
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,919
is a choice you make and in many ways our perception our recognition

62
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:30,440
is is primed is primed through our experiences primed through

63
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:36,360
how we um we cultivate our mind and hearts

64
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:43,320
if we turn towards friendliness if we turn towards a perception of safety

65
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:49,080
goodness kindness happiness that's that's the perception that arises that's

66
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:55,019
the state that arises it's this is really really powerful we perceive

67
00:08:55,019 --> 00:09:00,120
things people thoughts objects our own behavior

68
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,000
um in a more friendly way and there's more freedom then we don't perhaps judge

69
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,240
things in in such a judgmental way there's more freedom

70
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,440
from clinging from becoming identified

71
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:23,399
[Music] um and fixed in a particular View anyway that's all

72
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:28,620
a long a long short dormant so I'm gonna leave

73
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:35,160
that as the uh priming or or our guided meditation then you don't

74
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,620
have to have heard my talk this morning at all everything you need to know is

75
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:47,399
share it with you right now both in the dharment as well as the guided meditation some you can let all of that

76
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:54,180
go all of the thoughts and Concepts go

77
00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:00,440
let's turn let's turn to practicing together let's arrive together

78
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,260
let's turn

79
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,519
let's turn our awareness to this body In This Moment In Time

80
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:36,560
regardless of whatever has been happening just before this moment

81
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:44,779
maybe you were busy full agitated it's all okay not a problem

82
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,320
and we bring can we intentionally bring a perception

83
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,500
of spaciousness can we intentionally recognize

84
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:04,980
that there's a lot of spaciousness around

85
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:13,459
there's a lot of air around us space around us

86
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:25,740
letting ourselves recognize to assess your space outside our bodies

87
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:34,040
Our Hearts can relax I know this there is space inside

88
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:44,480
and more space with each in-breath and hot breath as we settle

89
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:24,720
I think the body the mind the heart relax can be put down if there

90
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:33,560
are preoccupations instead of being stuck in a loop

91
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:40,560
turn to perception of openness and ease it's also here

92
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,579
that is here as well with each breath

93
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:58,680
you can always pick up the entanglement later

94
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,860
we can choose to perceive

95
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:13,620
spaciousness ease and sense of refuge and heart and mind in this moment it is

96
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,800
available

97
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:11,760
and we expand this perception of spaciousness

98
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,600
to include

99
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:29,459
the perception of a recognition of

100
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:35,300
relative safety you're probably indoors

101
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,560
protected safe enough from the elements

102
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:54,240
and of course there are always there's not absolute safety in this world and yet we can tune

103
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,839
instead of tuning into perception of lack of safety we can choose to perceive

104
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:05,720
to recognize that there is safety

105
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:14,420
it's an inclination pattern of the mind we can

106
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:22,699
turn towards that recognizing the comfort

107
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:29,720
able enough perhaps where you are sitting meditating

108
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:11,839
opening turning this knowing this perception to

109
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,520
including the Goodwill that

110
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:23,418

111
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:30,199

00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:54,740

the way they stretch you you get stretched opened up

165
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:55,679
softened tenderized

166
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:23,299
and as we turn to close this meditation together can we recognize perceive goodness

167
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:31,020
in ourselves in our community in our circumstances having been able to show up

168
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,399
come together in practice

169
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,720
you're listening to this leader on Audio Dharma the goodness of being able to do this

170
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:53,340
listen to this and join many others maybe not in time

171
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:57,679
but in in spirit

172
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:04,380
may all beings everywhere benefit

173
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:10,140
from the goodness this co-created goodness may they benefit me they

174
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,520
recognize goodness

175
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,658
may I recognize the goodness in my life

176
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:34,220
may practice be of service to all beings everywhere including myself

177
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:42,799
thank you

178
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:54,740
thanks everyone thanks for your practice

179
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:03,720
so recognition recognizing perceiving can take so many different

180
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:09,960
perceptions on it you can choose and put on a grumpy perception through

181
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:17,039
the lens of grumpiness you can put on a a perception choose a perception of

182
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:25,519
gratitude appreciation kindness so I'd like to invite us to engage

183
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:32,779
in small groups with this perception with choosing perceptions

184
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:40,640
recognition what we choose to recognize how we choose to recognize and

185
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:48,059
let us engage again in small groups we're exploring for our own benefit the

186
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:55,500
two other people are just holding Witness [Music] um they're perceiving goodness you're only

187
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:01,799
speaking exploring for your own benefit you're not speaking for their benefit and if you're listening and you didn't

188
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:09,658
even understand what they said it's okay don't ask questions you're just holding witness let them explore it's we're

189
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:17,158
serving each other in this way in this beautiful way so give it a try but just really give it

190
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:22,320
a try as one of you reported on Monday I just really appreciated that sense of

191
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:29,398
safety okay let me explore for my own sake how was this practice what did you

192
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:35,760
recognize from turning to recognizing choosing to

193
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:43,320
perceive goodness what shifted what happened please offer one short nugget let

194
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:48,419
another person offer a short nugget really or rather explore a short nugget

195
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:54,960
the next person explores the short nugget but it comes back to you and you go round and round a few times it's not

196
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:01,020
a long monologue after you hear others you get inspired to explore some more

197
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:06,839
and let's go in alphabetical order according to first name closest to the

198
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:12,000
beginning of the alphabet so so take care of yourselves take care of each

199
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:19,920
other be kind and lean into the perception perception of of goodness how

200
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,079
can we lean into that okay I'm gonna open up the ropes and see what you

201
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:30,260
discover let yourself be surprised here we go

202
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:02,839
okay the rooms are closed everybody's back welcome back everyone

203
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:10,099

204
00:45:10,099 --> 00:45:15,660
discovered either in the meditation or when you were exploring with in small

205
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:22,079
groups also if you haven't spoken in the large group for a while I invite you to

206
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:30,119
pull forward raise your hand bring your voice in and if you have recently spoken uh please pull back let others share

207
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:32,960
reflections

208
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:39,619
bill

209
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:48,300
um but I was struck by In This meditation is something that I've noticed to me before which is that the

210
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:53,339
negative stuff negative perceptions has such a strong pull

211
00:45:53,339 --> 00:45:58,920
you know and there's a a very Twisted sort of enjoyment of thinking of all

212
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:06,240
these things that are wrong and it's it's not healthy but it's it's just it's

213
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:12,180
the poll is so strong I don't know if I have a question here this is just making

214
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:19,740
an observation thank you thank you Bill this is a terrific observation this is

215
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:25,079
this is called an Insight what you just shared it's an Insight that comes from

216
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:31,800
practice when you really pay attention and you see wow there is such a strong

217
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:37,140
pull there's this habit pattern of the mind going there and then oh my there's

218
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:42,900
also enjoyment even though it's not healthy and really it doesn't feel good but the mind seems to be enjoying being

219
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:50,640
in this uh grumpy negative state of perception this is so profound to know

220
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:57,480
this to see this clearly as you have been because many people go through their entire lives and never really see

221
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:06,119
this clearly and seeing it clearly is the first step for this pool to become

222
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:12,660
weakened because when you see the pool then it starts to lose its its um its

223
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:18,060
hold its energy its power it happens little by little so this is just

224
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:23,579
terrific I'm so glad you've uh observed this for your own sake and also shared

225
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:31,260
it with the community chair says I like the idea of saying a challenge as something to bend into

226
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:37,920
and to see it as a gift to have this challenge yeah they are

227
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:46,200
they stretch us they mold us yeah and it's a gift to be alive to have

228
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:53,280
challenges to grow through Vicky on YouTube says I'll share that I feel more ease after doing this practice

229
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:59,460
much less grumpy oh that's great it's sweet

230
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:08,119
yeah they're Reflections before we bring our time together to a close

231
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:15,119
anything else you noticed Fred I saw your hand show up and

232
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:20,460
disappear please raise your hand if that was

233
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:23,060
intentional

234
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:33,560
yes sorry my fumbling fingers oh good um

235
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:39,900
so I'm aware doing this meditation and often others like it when we come back

236
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:45,119
to reflect upon our own goodness um that there's just not as as much

237
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:50,400
juice in it when I consider myself and I can think of you know friend or

238
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:56,220
family member and you know if I wanted I could establish some sort of critical

239
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:05,280
distance from them and say well of course they they they reap all these benefits from from their theirs uh

240
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:12,480
unselfishness their generosity um that the sort of you know the wives selfishness is at play with them but I

241
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:20,700
don't do that with them I I just admire their their presence and their action but I I just find it harder with myself

242
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:26,220
not entirely you know I mean I'm I'm realistic about it I see that

243
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:32,400
um you know I can I can do things that are um that are kind and generous but I

244
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:37,560
cannot step into the sort of full-throated experience of it like I

245
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:44,880
can for a beloved family member or friend thank you for notes for seeing this and

246
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:53,819
verbalizing it so clearly eloquently Fred this is common and and

247
00:49:53,819 --> 00:49:58,859
um so I so appreciate you bringing into the the um the container of this

248
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:06,540
practice of our community today so a couple of Reflections one is since you

249
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:11,819
already said that for you it is easy to do it with people with other people to

250
00:50:11,819 --> 00:50:19,800
care that you care about friends and family to just rejoice in their goodness too without being critical and and just

251
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:28,440
Rejoice let your heart be uplifted in their goodness so yay that's available fantastic so so it's like a you know in

252
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:35,940
math how we do kiwi-d we reduce the problem to already to an already solved problem so so this solution is already

253
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:43,319
available so what what then I suggest is to take to step away from

254
00:50:43,319 --> 00:50:49,800
yourself to see yourself as your friends and loved ones and and relatives see you

255
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:56,099
so take that third person perspective because you can already do that your heart your mind already knows how to do

256
00:50:56,099 --> 00:51:02,640
that and Through Time rejoicing in your own goodness from this third person in fact

257
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:07,920
put yourself in a group in fact this would be the step so so take take Fred's

258
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:13,500
perspective seeing your friend and then your friends family multiple ones and

259
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:18,780
then uh add yourself to them add yourself to their group so it's a group

260
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:26,700
that you're seeing the goodness of and if it starts to you know it's kind of like a skillful

261
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:32,099
um it's like skillful bringing group together so that that energy of rejoicing is going towards you I know

262
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:37,260
yeah towards you too Fred oh he's he's such a good person generous kind look at

263
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:43,140
at his goodness as well as this other person so so a heart can rejoice and

264
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:49,319
little by little turn towards yourself as an individual and then turn to

265
00:51:49,319 --> 00:51:54,480
yourself as yourself but break it down to these

266
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:00,260
um multiple steps thanks that's really helpful thank you thanks Fred this is exciting

267
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:06,359

269
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:20,339
