1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,839
so welcome

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,320
uh good to um good to be with you

3
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,119
so uh let's settle in

4
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:06,880
so in any given moment a million things will be right

5
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,000
and a million will be wrong

6
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,799
and we afford ourselves the luxury

7
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,840
of not needing to sort all of that out

8
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,119
being supported by the million things that are right and

9
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:47,560
being softened by the million things that are wrong

10
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,920
although it feels maybe unsafe or irresponsible or something

11
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,800
to momentarily put down the world

12
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,560
it's actually important for our heart

13
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,879
rather than living in the realm of hope and fear we put all

14
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,720
of our hope into this moment

15
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,920
and rest

16
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,199
we don't always associate letting go

17
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,599
with joy

18
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,680
maybe we associate it with renunciation or with how

19
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:41,760
it can feel to unclench the closed fist of clinging

20
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,399
the movement from clenched to un unclenched

21
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,720
often has a flavor a flavor of grieving

22
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,399
and that's all real

23
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:13,200
but there's also this deep link between letting go and being re-born into

24
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,240
a world of experience where so much joy

25
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,560
is possible

26
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,320
the heart that lets go is carefree

27
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,800
and at ease and totally

28
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,000
not territorial

29
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:08,880
let's go steps out of comparing mind

30
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,480
becomes so porous to the joy of others

31
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,279
we call it mudita

32
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:39,120
sympathetic joy joy in the face of the others

33
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,720
happiness good fortune

34
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,720
and so as we said we sense in what

35
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,160
needs to be put down

36
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:41,320
what can be surrendered release that go

37
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:51,519
such that i become more porous to the joy of others

38
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:59,560
the delight of others it becomes utterly unthreatening

39
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,160
we put down our egoic clinging in our reborn

40
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:47,839
into a world of experience where so much joy is possible

41
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,839
anything might bring it

42
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,199
so calling to mind someone whose uh

43
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,320
well-being good fortune

44
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,160
is uh totally unintimidating for you something

45
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,120
unthreatening

46
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,580
does not evoke comparison [Music]

47
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,800
just bringing their face to mind

48
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,759
now of course there's dukkha in their life

49
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,320
it's a given

50
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:08,040
but there's much goodness happiness welfare

51
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,560
and so we attuned to that

52
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,199
we make our heart porous

53
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:34,519
and we just receive their joy

54
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:21,199
silently wishing our own mind

55
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,520
may your happiness continue

56
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,960
increase

57
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,639
i'm picturing their face

58
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,240
their face in the wake of this uh

59
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,480
joy happiness their good fortune

60
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,960
the particularities of their smile

61
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:59,840
i imagine what their inner life what their body must feel like

62
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,440
amidst their joy success

63
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,160
i just let that into my body

64
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,160
may your happiness continue

65
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,799
that increase

66
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,158
and we just abide suspended

67
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,440
in some delight

68
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,559
when there is no self

69
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,679
there's just the world

70
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:24,240
the happiness of others is known

71
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:30,519
precisely as our own

72
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,400
in these last few minutes

73
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:33,840
the wishes that all the happiness in the world

74
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,039
increase

75
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,520
my all beings revel

76
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,679
happiness made increase

77
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,640
and we even might extend it out beyond

78
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,960
the beings born now

79
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:27,158
to the future maybe even the distant future

80
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:42,679
all the potential happiness contained in this moment

81
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,120
may all that goodness all that

82
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,760
richness may that increase may it be born

83
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,000
and increased

84
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,159
b

85
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,440
so um

86
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,799
thank you good to um good to sit with you

87
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:47,679
um excuse me the uh topic modita

88
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:54,520
some pathetic joy and um

89
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,320
you know sometimes when i think about um

90
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:06,799
you know joy i think of um kind of like those awkward family photos where the children are

91
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:11,840
wearing these like very forced very artificial smiles that

92
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:19,039
look basically like grimaces you know it's like

93
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:25,440
be joyful modita sympathetic joy is a tricky one yeah

94
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:33,840
it's a tricky one right because um joy is just like this this spontaneous

95
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:39,440
upwelling it's a little maybe a little trickier to incline the

96
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,799
mind in a way that feels spontaneous and alive

97
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:54,480
and so i promise not to command you to be joyful you know um

98
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,080
so a colleague a friend of mine uh tawari

99
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:09,039
salah sometimes she she's like uh the queen of met of uh of mudita you

100
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:16,159
know she sometimes just i don't know when she talks about it or guides something she just like goes for

101
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:21,640
it and uh i wind up in like a slightly

102
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:26,720
disregulated ecstatic blur of delight she's just like

103
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:34,399
sometimes relentless with it and um anyway so i wanted to uh to share share

104
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:39,440
a little bit of what she said this is from a retreat we did a year ago

105
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:46,399
um it's a couple paragraphs from her so she says um we've come to

106
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:53,120
my favorite favorite moment in all of dhamma

107
00:31:53,120 --> 00:32:00,720
i don't know when i opened this pandora's box it's not the way i grew up with this energy i don't know

108
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,399
anywhere in my life i would say oh yeah joy is what i would call life i grew up

109
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:11,840
in a very difficult childhood spent the bulk of my life poor on welfare

110
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,279
joy would not be the underlying feature of experience that i would point out

111
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:24,640
but somewhere in dumb i stumbled upon this mudita and it's been a game changer for me

112
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:31,039
so let me see if i can try to help you see where i'm pointing to there's a great difference between

113
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:38,480
mudita and the kind of worldly joy that we try to access regularly in our lives

114
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:45,760
i imagine that each one of us on this call there's 56 of us we all get two

115
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:53,360
joys two moments of joy in our lives this year that's all you get two opportunities of

116
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,960
joy and if you're like me we've already used them up

117
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,720
so there's no joy for the rest of the year you've already had it

118
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,880
so the only way you can access a level of joy is it has to come from someone else

119
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,399
if i start telling you about some joy i have because you're human you'll feel it

120
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:24,480
if i begin to cry you'll feel that if i tell you about some sadness some difficulty in my life you'll feel that

121
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,320
and likewise i realized that i could feel the joy of another

122
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,600
person and there would never be a day or a moment in time

123
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:42,399
when i would not feel joy never it's not possible there are like billions of people on the

124
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:49,760
earth and at any given moment somebody somewhere is experiencing joy and all i

125
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:56,399
have to do is to be willing to tap into that joy and feel it with them

126
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:03,120
my granddaughter's four years old and she's learning about jokes and she just starts laughing

127
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:08,240
she'll say something like and then they said

128
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:14,480
go away [Laughter] laughing uproariously

129
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:21,520
and i'm laughing and that is not even funny but i'm laughing because she's laughing so hard like she told some

130
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:28,720
great joke it's just another way of experiencing the human condition that we're all

131
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:34,638
interconnected so yeah

132
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:41,280
uh let us um lean on each other's joy

133
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:48,960
let us lean on each other's joy and emits amidst pain

134
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,398
you know it can sometimes feel like joy is a

135
00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:00,000
a way of cheating on one's grief you know it can

136
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:07,280
feel like a certain kind of adultery like cheating on one's grief

137
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,720
but one of the

138
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:18,960
shifts in dharma practice is that our emotional life becomes more

139
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,400
supple and a moment of joy does not cancel out

140
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:31,760
the grief it's just like we our emotional life it's more yeah it's more fluid and

141
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:38,240
supple and so a moment of grief can just be followed by peace

142
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:44,720
and then joy and then maybe the heart circles back to whatever

143
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:50,640
it's pain it might be connected to

144
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:57,200
but the joy is not cheating on the pain it's okay

145
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:04,960
and our are we can depart from our kind of homeostatic baseline

146
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:12,040
into yeah maybe even deep joy

147
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:19,760
sometimes it's um it's easier to talk about removing the

148
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:28,400
obstacles to joy rather than creating joy right i can't chide you you know smile

149
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,599
be happy right and so instead the practice is is really

150
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:40,720
like to examine well what obstructs mudita what obstructs this like delighting in the

151
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:47,760
welfare of others possessiveness

152
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:53,240
comparing mind envy

153
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:02,320
um the machinations of ego

154
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,520
the reflex of of ego is really to um

155
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:13,359
to incorporate all goodness into itself it's like my ego tolerates

156
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:20,960
no goodness outside itself it must appropriate everything

157
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:28,319
that is a very fragile dangerous way of living

158
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:36,480
to not tolerate goodness outside oneself or to need for that goodness to affirm

159
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:43,838
one's own egoic process that's a fragile way of living

160
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:54,160
and so we're gonna have to actually step in some ways out of self to truly enjoy

161
00:37:54,160 --> 00:38:01,680
other people's happiness to truly enjoy it

162
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:10,079
now it just feels important to acknowledge like modita is not a public policy you know

163
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:15,680
so when i say we must relinquish envy or something like this i am not talking

164
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:21,440
about public policy the disparities in health and wealth

165
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:26,960
are not sustainable what i'm talking about here and there's

166
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,880
they're very understandable reasons for things like envy

167
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:39,440
i'm talking to the heart of a of a practitioner

168
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:47,280
we're going to have to step out of some of these egoic forces to truly delight

169
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:55,039
in the welfare of others so there's an essayist um

170
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:04,079
talking about the seven deadly sins lost gluttony greed laziness wrath pride envy

171
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:09,839
and said of the seven deadly sins

172
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:14,880
only envy is no fun at all and isn't

173
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,160
that true isn't that true

174
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:25,839
um envy is um is usually about um

175
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:31,119
two people and jealousy about three

176
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:38,000
and wanting someone something has versus

177
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:46,319
wanting someone some relationship connection in the case of jealousy

178
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:54,800
and of course these forces likely have real evolutionary benefit yeah they've

179
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:02,079
been encoded in to us and still it's important to remember that

180
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:09,760
evolution doesn't care about enlightenment

181
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:16,480
even a little yeah we're here we're here

182
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:25,040
because we're the sufferers yeah this is a evolutionary psychologist

183
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:30,240
despite the manifold unhappiness jealousy creates jealousy

184
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:36,960
has a crystalline functional logic precise purposes and supreme sensibility

185
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:43,440
it exists today in modern humans because those in the evolutionary past who were indifferent

186
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:50,480
to the sexual contact that their mates had with others lost the evolutionary contest to those

187
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:57,599
who became jealous as the descendants of successful ancestors modern humans

188
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:03,200
carry with them the passions that led to their forbearers success

189
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:08,400
the legacy of the success is a dangerous passion that creates unhappiness but the

190
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:14,720
unhappiness motivated adaptive action over evolutionary

191
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,720
history

192
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:28,960
the to move against the

193
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,880
the forces of jealousy of envy is to move in some ways against the

194
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:40,400
stream the the dumb is against the stream

195
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:48,800
and these mechanisms of the mind um

196
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,839
envy uh especially really shows us where

197
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:59,599
we're identified where we're identified

198
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:07,920
um it envy envy highlights the insanity really of

199
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,960
egoic life

200
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:19,440
identification wherever we are identified it impairs our love

201
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:25,599
and our capacity to access joy to receive the joy

202
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:32,880
of another in an unthreatening unintimidating way in a way that does not diminish ourselves

203
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:41,359
that does not evoke the comparing mind this is mature card

204
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:48,079
envy is the product of a wound to self-importance and the fruit of an illusion what can other people's

205
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:53,599
happiness possibly deprive us of nothing of course

206
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:59,680
only the ego can be wounded by it and feel it as pain

207
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:05,680
these are the results of our having forgotten our innermost potential for

208
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:10,040
affection and peace

209
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:19,599
when we uh feel sufficient

210
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:25,839
yeah when the kind of all the the egoic melodramas of worthiness and

211
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:31,920
unworthiness of my deserving undeserving

212
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:38,960
when all of that fades we are

213
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:44,560
we can delight in the well-being of others

214
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:52,720
when we're fluid in ourselves and we ask am i that

215
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:58,799
no am i that

216
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,119
no

217
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:11,520
then there's less and less to defend and the delight of others

218
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:17,599
is totally unthreatening just rushes into our heart

219
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:25,039
very natural easeful joyous

220
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,520
sorry for this for your consideration

221
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,280
you
