1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,160
good evening welcome welcome it's nice to see you all

2
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:19,140
so today I'd like to continue my exploration of these seven factors of

3
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,180
Awakening and

4
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:30,359
there's not surprisingly seven of these seven factors of Awakening

5
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:37,020
and I've gone through all seven and I'm doing a little bit more on this last one equanimity

6
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,600
so there's no requirement to memorize all these lists

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,120
maybe they'll become familiar after you um practice for a while so I don't want

8
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,219
it to feel like burden some it's um frankly it's because I'm going

9
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:59,760
to be teaching a class on these some factors of Awakening it starts in a couple weeks

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,360
and I just wanted to teach this series to give me an opportunity to think about it

11
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,420
all these topics and also to share them in the form of a Dharma talk as a as

12
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,439
opposed to a class so what are these seven factors of Awakening

13
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:24,780
mindfulness investigation energy and Joy are the first four I'll just say

14
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,420
mindfulness is just being aware of what's happening and then there's these

15
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,299
three energizing factors investigation energy and joy kind of

16
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:42,960
like bring the energy up and then there's three tranquilizing calming factors that bring the energy

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,780
down those are Tranquility concentration and

18
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,880
Equanimity and even like if you've never heard any Buddhist teaching whatsoever

19
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,040
you would just recognize oh yeah energy and joy is a little bit more bubbly and

20
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,820
investigation feels like something that you do as opposed to Tranquility concentration

21
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,760
equanimity and so I'd like to kind of like flesh

22
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,120
out a little bit more just talking about equanimity and as I mentioned last week this wasn't

23
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,180
a word that was in my vocabulary until I kind of encountered Buddhist teachers

24
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:30,000
teachings and teachers and with this kind of beginning equa I

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,420
figured it had something to do with equal but uh Equanimity turns out to be a

26
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:44,040
really rich word and there's so many ways we can think about it look at it understand it

27
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,160
practice with it and for me this is something that I appreciate so much about the Buddhist

28
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,220
teachings is that there's such a depth and a breadth and a richness there

29
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:02,459
no matter how many times I come back and maybe teach the same thing or study and I do a little bit of translating and

30
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:08,160
kind of like look at some of these really the early teachings I'm always

31
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,980
finding something new like oh yeah this is related to that

32
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:19,860
either another teaching or like oh right this is that experience that I've had I

33
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:26,400
wouldn't have put it in this language but now I understand it differently and so I kind of hope to maybe share with

34
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,120
all of you some of my appreciation of the richness of what's available and

35
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,000
and of course for me and I'm imagining for many of you too this is in contrast

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,780
to some dogmatic view like this is the way that it is I am and I have encountered teachers

37
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:52,799
that you have this kind of fundamentalist dogmatic View and I don't know it just makes me feel uncomfortable

38
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:59,819
so instead I'd like to encourage like a spirit of inquiry or engagement as

39
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:06,780
opposed to okay this is just some list I'm supposed to memorize but maybe it's a way you might see that

40
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,840
it makes sense to you and it's helpful for in your life and in

41
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,180
your practice okay so equanimity

42
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:25,199
kind of a way that I'd like to think about it and practice with it is this recognition that it's a number of

43
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:31,560
different has a number of different qualities including that it's a steadiness

44
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:37,440
of the mind and the Heart what is steadiness um

45
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:44,580
when I was young there was these I maybe watched a little bit too much TV and there was this uh commercial that came

46
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:50,580
that was still in my mind it's quite something where I tell some of these commercials you know decades later are

47
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:56,580
still in my mind and there is this toy that was called

48
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:03,660
Weebles some of you are not in your head right and you know what the little like jingle

49
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:09,240
was like Weebles wobble but they don't fall down so that's for me a little bit

50
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:17,580
of equanimity like this idea that we might you know get a little bit off balance but then

51
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:24,240
we'll the kid come back to Center and maybe we get a little bit way off balance or maybe it's just a little bit

52
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,600
but Weebles wobble but they don't fall down I never had any of these Weebles but you

53
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:39,720
know I just saw enough of those commercials I understood the premise of them so the steadiness that is there you

54
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:46,199
know maybe there's a little bit of wobbliness which maybe brings me to another point about Equanimity is that

55
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:52,139
it's not an on off switch it's not a binary you have it or you don't have it

56
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:58,080
maybe sometimes you get way off balance maybe the wobble is pretty far before

57
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,680
you come back to a sense of balance or maybe there's just a little bit but

58
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,020
whatever it might be it's pointing to this idea of not falling down

59
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:16,860
or if you do falling down finding your way back so it has this steadiness with maybe I

60
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:22,560
might say this in our balance and I'm using this Weebles example but

61
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:29,520
another way is um I think it's called a keel on the bottom of a sailboat this really long

62
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,400
bit that helps the sailboat not tip over when there's winds

63
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:42,840
so it's like maybe having some a keel but it's uh not only this kind of like

64
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:49,860
stability or the steadiness this balance but it Equanimity also has this quality

65
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:56,639
of seeing the bigger picture and that's part of why it doesn't get

66
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,819
off balance is because it understands like a number

67
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:09,780
of things what the bigger picture is one of it is like oh of course it's this way of

68
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:16,560
course I'm late because I left a little bit late and I forgot it was commute hour and I had to stop and

69
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:23,220
get gas in my car and so instead of this friend of like oh I'm going to be late and what are people going to say and I

70
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:28,500
just said I wasn't going to be late anymore or whatever it might be instead of recognizing like of course it's this

71
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,780
way because there was all these conditions in place to make it that way

72
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:41,340
of course I don't feel well because I got some really difficult news and I ate

73
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:46,500
junk food because I wasn't feeling well and I didn't sleep so well last night so of

74
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:52,680
course right now I'm feeling a little out of sorts and maybe that's why we were short with our co-worker or our

75
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,440
partner or whatever so being able to have this sense of that

76
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:05,599
things are the way that they are because there were conditions that they are there to support it

77
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:13,620
and maybe this goes without saying but maybe it's helpful for me to just make it more explicit that having this

78
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:19,379
stability this balance makes life easier to navigate

79
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:28,020
because maybe we have to do less navigating if we have this ability or to not be

80
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:34,740
thrown off balance so much that we feel like we can't ever come back to some

81
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:41,760
sorts of some sort of Center and to be clear when I'm saying Center I'm not saying that we're like Rock

82
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,820
Solid right I don't know if anybody's life is like that they're completely Rock Solid

83
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:56,360
but it's opposed to this you know just going back and forth Within getting blown all over the place

84
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:04,320
so it makes life easier to navigate because what would it be like if we didn't have

85
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,320
to avoid awkward situations

86
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:15,420
what if we had the confidence to like okay this is gonna be uncomfortable I

87
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:23,640
need to set boundaries with this person and tell them it's not okay that they're doing that or I need to apologize for a

88
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,980
mistake that I made or I need to finish that project even

89
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:36,540
though it's not quite perfect and I really want it to be perfect but I just need to finish it you know what would it

90
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:46,040
be like if we could do these things recognize the uncomfortableness and do it anyway

91
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:54,560
like our lives just would unfold better if we didn't feel like we had to avoid all the uncomfortableness is that arise

92
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:01,620
or if when something wonderful or nice or that something wished for arises

93
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:08,820
if we didn't feel like oh my gosh I have to hold on as tightly as I can because I might never get this again and I gotta

94
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:14,160
squeeze every last bit of goodness out of this experience

95
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:21,300
like wouldn't it be different if we felt like we could just kind of like drink it up and appreciate it of gratitude allow

96
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:26,880
ourselves to feel nourished by it without this feeling of just holding on

97
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:34,200
for everything we got or something like this everything we have with all we got

98
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,200
so it just helps life easier to navigate and

99
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:47,640
as I'm speaking about this it occurs to me that it goes along also with this idea of confidence

100
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:54,120
so maybe it's not so much the idea that we can do whatever needs to be done

101
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:01,920
but maybe it's the idea that I can recover from the difficulty or if

102
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,519
it doesn't turn out great somehow that's going to be still be okay or sometimes we have this feeling like

103
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:16,800
if anything's not okay then we feel like Oh I'm a failure

104
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:23,399
should always make everything be okay nothing ever is going to turn out right right we have that feeling right

105
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:31,740
sometimes it just feels overwhelming and we collapse into it so Equanimity is this idea that

106
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,779
we can it makes our life easier to navigate not

107
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:42,480
only that we can be with uncomfortable situations but we don't have to hold on to

108
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:50,540
things that are pleasurable and gives us the confidence to try new things or to be in new situations

109
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:59,339
so I want to speak a little bit just that I appreciate again Diana and her appreciation but and

110
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:05,160
the Buddhist teachings that the Buddha thousands of years ago I like to think

111
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:10,680
about this thousands of years ago like how many people have heard these

112
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:16,980
teachings and they've been touched by and that this is just part of the human condition so much

113
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:23,279
so that thousands of years ago they were talking about it they were talking about what are the

114
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:29,760
things that help us make us create the conditions in which we're not

115
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,800
equanimous what are the things that knock us off

116
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,440
balance and probably you wouldn't be surprised

117
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:48,240
if I said it was a list oh thanks and it's often called it's eight but

118
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,180
it's four pairs and recently I discovered like a new

119
00:12:54,180 --> 00:13:01,500
translation kind of like a new understanding with these four pairs are and I really like this new set

120
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:07,380
these nudes out of four pairs of uh like that I guess we could call a

121
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:14,839
new translation because it's a little bit in more kind of modern language language that we might use and every day

122
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:21,899
parlance and that you can find lots of books of like how to work with these things and probably Untold

123
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:27,660
talks or something about this so but before I say what these four pairs

124
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:33,660
are the I just want to emphasize that there is

125
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:40,620
no human that is exempt from experiencing these

126
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:48,320
no human like the Buddha right he experience these things

127
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,600
and so I don't know just that alone recognizing that this is part of our

128
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:01,800
inheritance as humans this is what it means to be human is to have these experiences

129
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:08,100
and and the reason why they are in pairs is

130
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:13,699
this idea that you can't have one without the other

131
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,800
as soon as you say well something's on the left hand side then of course there's something that has to be on the

132
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:25,260
right hand side right as soon as we start defining left then there's right gets defined too

133
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:31,320
as soon as we start saying oh that one's tall then we have to say that compared to the

134
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,480
other one that's not as tall that's shorter so as soon as we start kind of like

135
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,480
dividing up the world in one way it's conceptually then we're also saying

136
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:49,860
it's the other way something's good then something else is bad if we're equanimous the opposite of

137
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:56,160
equanimous is out of balance suffering

138
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:01,800
these types of things so that's a reason why they come in to come in pairs is

139
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:07,380
because as soon as you say that you want something then by

140
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:12,480
definition that means you don't want other things of course right of course

141
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:19,019
this is how the world works [Applause] so maybe again before I kind of like say

142
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:26,940
what these pairs are is that it's about Equanimity is not about getting our life

143
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:32,519
perfect it's not manufacturing creating

144
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:39,060
engineering to have everything perfect exactly like we want it

145
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:46,019
and it's not uncommon to have this secret wish like okay well as soon as you know this happens and then that

146
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:51,180
happens and then that happens okay then everything will be fine

147
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:58,440
right here we all are if that worked for you you were not to be here on a Monday night listening to our Dharma talk

148
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:05,639
of course we want everything to be perfect of course we do we want all the Ducks to

149
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:13,620
be in a row but it doesn't work out that way and

150
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:20,180
I kind of feel like it's spoiler alert right it's never gonna be that way

151
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,940
so Equanimity is about our relationship to what is it's not about making things

152
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:34,620
perfect so that we can be happy and feel balanced it's about our relationship like even

153
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:40,139
though things are not the way that we want can we still feel imbalanced

154
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:43,820
can we still have some steadiness

155
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:52,380
I think this is worth repeating it's about our relationship to them sometimes the Buddhist teachings right

156
00:16:52,380 --> 00:17:00,959
there's like we have this Arrow that's things that are unfortunate get stabbed and and then there's the second Arrow

157
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:06,418
is like this sometimes we talk about how wanting things to be different or you

158
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:12,178
know this aversion or holding on to it so tightly or whatever it might be

159
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:19,558
so it's about not having the second Arrow we can't avoid the first arrows

160
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:26,880
okay so what are these eight things these four pairs

161
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:33,480
the first success and failure everybody's gonna have success and

162
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:42,360
failure nobody is immune from this the next status and disgrace

163
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:48,480
or sometimes we talk about like reputation you know sometimes your reputation is up or down and I think

164
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:55,919
like in this age of social media I think this is getting really heightened approval and disapproval

165
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:01,080
this is gonna happen in our lives of course it is maybe we're even doing this

166
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:08,640
to others like okay well I approve this but I don't approve that right and then the last ease and unease

167
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,520
there's going to be times when we feel comfortable on times when we don't feel comfortable

168
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:21,000
it's the way it is so how can we

169
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
cultivate Equanimity how can we recognize recognizing that these eight

170
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,640
worldly winds as they're often called this recognition that these are winds

171
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:39,720
that just blow we don't get to control them they just blow One Way One Direction or the other

172
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,760
recognizing that how can we stay balanced how can we do this Equanimity

173
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:52,440
thing so one thing that I want to point out

174
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:59,039
is I started by saying Equanimity is that the part of the seven factors of Awakening

175
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:06,240
and it's the seventh one it's at the end Equanimity is in a number of other

176
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,600
lists also it's in the Brahma vahara it's these heart practices

177
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:18,240
it's also at the end of that list it's in the power amuse these 10 parames

178
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:24,780
these qualities that we can cultivate in daily life not always on the cushion a

179
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:31,500
little bit of overlap but the same factors Awakening Equity is the tenth one it's in the last

180
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,780
one there genas these are like a concentration

181
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:44,280
States that um for the first four which are the four main ones

182
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:51,960
Equanimity is the predominant experience or I'll say that experience in the last

183
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:58,500
one in the fourth one after having gone through the earlier three

184
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:06,780
progress of insight this development and a little bit later Buddhism of how Awakening occurs before

185
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:15,419
Awakening is this step equanimity so it's always at the end of all these

186
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:20,580
lists and one way to understand that is

187
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:28,140
because all these preceding factors are part of what's cultivating creating

188
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:34,320
the conditions in which Equanimity might arise because it's tempting of course okay

189
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:40,620
Equanimity this sounds like a good thing I want some what do I do and we have this idea well can I just

190
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:45,960
take it out of all of its practices or these Buddhist practices and just do

191
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:53,820
this Equanimity thing I have to worry about all this other stuff that these Dharma teachers are talking about

192
00:20:53,820 --> 00:21:00,480
and I certainly tried this I have a little story that um

193
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:07,380
that's going on a long retreat and for those of you who have been among

194
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:13,140
Retreats you know this that there's this question well how does laundry work

195
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:18,660
when you're on a long retreat right you know if you're there for months right you don't have months of clean clothes

196
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:24,960
right so like how does this work and when there were a hundred people in the meditation hall there's a hundred

197
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:31,260
people's laundry that has to get done so it's a big ordeal

198
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:37,799
and it's a little bit different now but how they used to do this years ago is

199
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:44,400
that there would be like the laundry day for half of the people so let's say for

200
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:52,559
maybe 50 people and you could do laundry for a week's worth 50 people doing a week's worth of

201
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:58,020
laundry this is a lot of laundry right and it was somebody's job they just had

202
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:03,360
washing machines and dryers and you know for a whole day you know like this was

203
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:09,900
they just would run Non-Stop but how to get your own laundry back

204
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:18,900
right it's one thing to put things in but of course you want your clothes back because Well everybody's wearing gray

205
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:26,100
sweatpants and white t-shirts right so how do you find yours back so

206
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:32,220
um laundry tags so they would have some ribbon an indelible marker and you could

207
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:38,159
write your name on this ribbon and then you would safety pin this piece of ribbon onto every single piece of your

208
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:44,940
clothing then you'd bring it to the place they'd be laundry and then there'd be this huge pile of laundry and you

209
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:51,780
would just go through everything and find your pieces not the best system it's as bad as it

210
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:58,919
sounds so I had this idea after learning this is how it is like okay I'm gonna make my

211
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:04,740
own personalized little laundry ties I'm going to turn this into a whole little art project for myself

212
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:11,700
and I wanted to have Equanimity I'd heard about this and I thought okay I'm just gonna do this Equanimity thing on

213
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:17,760
this long retreat so I made a made it much more complicated than it needed to be but it

214
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:26,100
was a little art project for myself but I made all these little tugs that said which is the poly word for equanimity

215
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:33,539
and while I was making all these I was thinking like and I was then when I was on Retreat I'm

216
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:40,200
safety pinning all these little upaka upeka Pekka and all my clothes thinking like okay this is all I have to do just

217
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:47,658
say this word over and over again and I'm gonna get equanimity it didn't work

218
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:54,059
I didn't have equanime I wanted it so badly I thought like okay if I just like

219
00:23:54,059 --> 00:24:00,480
say this word think about it enough or do it over and over again somehow it

220
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:07,620
would arise but it didn't and it wasn't until later

221
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:14,880
on another retreat that I discovered something really

222
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,100
important and this gets back to the

223
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:27,900
Equanimity being the last and all these lists well what's second to last

224
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:33,480
on all these lists like what's preceding it

225
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:40,020
so if in the list of the parames loving kindness

226
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:46,020
is before equanimity the list of the Brahma the horrors these art practices

227
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:51,659
sympathetic Joy is before equanimity

228
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:58,559
in the seven factors of Awakening concentration is in the before

229
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:05,280
Equanimity in the janas happiness is before equanimity

230
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:12,120
so there's this quality of kind of like this maybe we could say warm-heartedness

231
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:19,020
or this type of well-being loving kindness

232
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:27,440
sympathetic Joy that's uh being happy when other people are happy being happy for their uh Good Fortune

233
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:33,779
or concentration I talked about concentration before also has this quality of well-being

234
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:39,659
so Equanimity when we think about it makes perfect sense of course it arises

235
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:45,179
out of a certain amount of well-being when we have a little bit of settledness

236
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:51,299
or this feeling like we have enough we have enough love we have enough

237
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:56,520
something inside of us we feel filled up in some kind of way

238
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:02,640
then of course we're not going to get so knocked off balance

239
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,100
so one of the key ways to develop equanimity

240
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:15,000
is to develop well-being one of the ways to develop well-being is

241
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,120
some warm-heartedness some loving kindness it's not the only way and next week I'll

242
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,520
talk about other ways but I think sometimes this is neglected when we

243
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:35,760
think about Equanimity it sounds like a I don't know it can feel a little bit cold-hearted or indifferent but it's

244
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:41,520
really about this warm-heartedness and this

245
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:47,880
and seen the big picture with a little bit of care that allows us to maybe

246
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:53,240
there's a little bit of wobbling but coming back to balance

247
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:02,700
you might say Okay Diana that sounds nice but how do we cultivate the warm-heartedness for this well-being

248
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:09,600
well of course there's a list but I'm not going to go through a list

249
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:16,020
I'm going to just talk about a few things here one is

250
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:21,380
just inclining the mind towards

251
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:28,080
warm-heartedness or well-being so there's a number of ways to do this

252
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:34,320
in daily life on the cushion off the cushion it doesn't matter but one is

253
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:41,659
notice when it's arising naturally in your experience

254
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:47,520
just notice when that you get that email that as if

255
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:53,039
I'm your friend and they say hey do you want to go to lunch and you feel like oh yeah actually I do and that little bit

256
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:59,460
of uplift that happens or when you get home and your dog is

257
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:04,740
like wagging his tail so happy to see you and that little kind of like uplift that happens

258
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:11,340
or when you are with a good friend and you just feel happy to be with them or

259
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:16,620
whatever it is you're sharing maybe they're having difficulties and you're happy to be able to support them

260
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:24,000
maybe there's your partner brings you a cup of tea a cup of coffee these lots of

261
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,520
mundane things I'm hoping that these are in your life

262
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:35,940
it's time it's true that there are times in our life when we feel like they're they're not there I don't want to make it sound like everybody has these all

263
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:44,820
the time I want to but I want to encourage that when that is there can we just recognize

264
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:51,059
oh here's that little uplift and if it has some warm-heartedness

265
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:57,240
I'm using warm-hearted as this really vague word that maybe you can find your way with

266
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:03,120
some people might say meta or Goodwill or benevolence or something like this so

267
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:08,360
just notice when it just naturally arises

268
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:15,120
when you're feeling the opposite of loving kindness maybe just notice you know irritation with somebody maybe just

269
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:21,659
notice what's what's in the way here why am I feeling cold-hearted here maybe

270
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:26,299
cold-hearted is too strong at an expression but

271
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:32,039
and so that's one just to notice when it's naturally there and so when our

272
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:39,840
minds start to notice it and tune into it notice the pleasantness of it it just

273
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:45,899
makes it more likely the mind will do that again without our having to try it

274
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:52,500
to do anything special and then this is something that

275
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:59,520
um should I say that I appreciate again with uh my Buddhist teachings is that we

276
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:07,020
don't have to wait until the conditions are just perfect to have this sense of

277
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:13,679
kindness this sense of Good Will towards others towards ourselves we don't have

278
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:20,940
to wait for that we can cultivate it and one of the conventional ways is with

279
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:26,120
loving kindness practice so a few ways we can do that

280
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:31,320
with a in a meditative setting

281
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,720
maybe perhaps many of you are familiar with this practice it's um

282
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:43,620
often begins with wherever it's easy whomever it's just easy for you to feel

283
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:49,080
the some warmth towards to start there

284
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,899
I teach loving kindness on Tuesdays and Thursdays online and Nikki mercifori

285
00:30:54,899 --> 00:31:01,140
teaches it Monday Wednesday Friday so if you're interested five days a week we have loving kindness practice online

286
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:06,539
and I always say start where it's easy there's no reason not to start where

287
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:13,398
it's easy and then to feel the connection with this lovable being

288
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:21,840
and it can be helpful to say phrases may you be safe may you be happy may you be healthy may

289
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:28,380
you live with ease and I can tell you from doing this

290
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:33,419
practice over and over again it is transformative and people that have been

291
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:39,600
coming to this what we call it happy hour number of people are just saying this

292
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:47,760
has changed my life in such a way I never expected I just keep on showing up at 6 pm and because it was nice it was

293
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:55,200
pleasant but my life is turning out to be different and so I just want to point out that

294
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,299
it's it's so common that we come to mindfulness practice we

295
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:07,440
come to Buddhist practice thinking that okay we have to meditate we have to get the Mind quiet we have to learn to sit

296
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:15,659
still or all these types of things but we might underestimate how powerful it

297
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:22,020
is to be cultivating loving kindness especially towards ourselves

298
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:28,980
especially towards ourselves it turns out we're often subtly beating

299
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:37,320
ourselves up very commonly when we're meditating and we notice that our mind is off the breath or yeah off we've lost

300
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:44,700
in thought and there's this little like dang it get it together you're supposed to be meditating on this thing that we

301
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:51,659
would come back and there's this little irritation well we're kind of cultivating a little bit of aversion or

302
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:57,000
this little like not appreciating ourselves and that cumulative effect you

303
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,659
know it has an impact so loving kindness practices a way that

304
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:09,380
kind of kind of soften that it's often that

305
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:16,399
inner critic that can arise when we're doing this practice

306
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:22,320
so maybe I'll just mention one more things before I open it up to

307
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,960
um some q a that something that we don't do

308
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:35,700
here very much at IMC we do very little of it but it's a practice that I think

309
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:42,059
is really great and also can be really powerful and some traditions really

310
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:47,580
focus on this practice and that is chanting

311
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:55,740
and chanting the metasuta so there's some of you might be familiar with the the suta that

312
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:01,200
um it it talks about like good will for others or something and it's very

313
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,960
inspiring and um this can be a practice to chant it

314
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:14,040
and or memorize it enchant It And I memorized it by listening to it again

315
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:19,980
and again and again um from the monks by a gear you'll just

316
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:27,599
mention this they have a whole chant book that's you know MP3 you can download and listen to again and again

317
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:34,980
so appreciating when it just arises naturally in your life doing some intentional meditation

318
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:40,440
practices I mentioned one there's some others or doing some chanting there can

319
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:46,020
be something in which I don't know chanting opens up a different part of us

320
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:51,780
it's not for everybody but for some people it's really meaningful and helpful

321
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:59,520
so loving-kindness practice as a support for equanimity

322
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:07,200
loving kindness is a way to kind of like soften the heart think about it right that when we feel kind of like this

323
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,900
sense of love sense of care

324
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:19,320
there's a sense of stability that goes with it and there's like this increased capacity to be with whatever is

325
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,900
difficult so next week I'll talk about some other practices that we can do but I would

326
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:31,380
just like to offer this as well as loving-kindness practices as a support

327
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:36,540
for equanimity okay so with that I'd like to open it up

328
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:42,560
to some q a if there are any questions

329
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:56,180
okay so I guess our friends on YouTube have some questions so yes Sage do you want to use the microphone

330
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:02,760
um one of our friends from the Internet is asking would you give us the reference to download The Meta suit to chant

331
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:08,220
so that's a good question I met this Utah

332
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:15,780
um I recommend going to at buyagiri.org a b h a y a

333
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:22,440
g-i-r-i if I can write it down on a piece of paper if anybody wants who's here and

334
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:29,060
wants to come back and let's try it if you're at home I'll say one more time a b h a

335
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:36,540
y-a-g-i-r-i Abaya giri and they are a monastery that's up near Redding and

336
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:43,440
this is part of their regular chanting they have a whole chant book and they have it in English and in Poley and that

337
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:49,619
you can hear them chanting it both in English and poorly and I was and part of the reason why I'm recommending that one

338
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:54,960
is because um sometimes Retreats at IRC we do chant

339
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:02,160
that and we chant it in the same style that they do so if you learn it from them then um you'll be able to use it at

340
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:08,099
IRC and was there another one or nope nope

341
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:16,980
okay just saying nice things okay well that's nice just uh anybody else have a question or

342
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,760
let's speak there

343
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:30,119
good evening Diana everyone thank you Diana yeah I had a question regarding

344
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:37,260
like Equanimity and confidence and I know it's not like oh I know I'm gonna

345
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:43,140
do this right just just that that whole not grasping the whole thing and how

346
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:48,780
does one do do that if that makes sense so the relationship

347
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:55,339
between Equanimity and and faith and not grasping yes yes yes

348
00:37:55,339 --> 00:38:02,220
of course right this is what we all want absolutely loving-kindness practice

349
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:09,240
this is like something that we can start we can practice with this is something we can do and it does it does make a

350
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:16,140
difference I am not saying it's always easy and I'm not saying it's fast but this is something that can really

351
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:22,980
make a difference and then next week I'll talk about some more what we might say wisdom practices but this is I'm

352
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:29,280
calling it like a heart practice and I cannot emphasize this enough this

353
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:37,140
idea of doing loving kindness practice where it's easy to really spend time there because what's really often

354
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:42,540
what's common is for people like we'll do a little bit of loving kindness may

355
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:48,480
you be happy may you be safe might you be healthy may you live at ease and then they want to do it to the person that

356
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:55,380
they bothers them the most of course they do and it doesn't work so well

357
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:01,700
I'll just say here's because you know we can't just switch like this

358
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:09,380
here's the best way it works is to stay to a living kindness where it's easy

359
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:18,599
cats dogs babies even imaginary beings and allow oneself to be filled up and

360
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:25,740
just keep practicing this could be one day one month one year I know some people have done this years

361
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:33,720
and then what starts to happen is the loving kindness just starts to kind of like overflow naturally

362
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:39,720
if you practice it instead of it being like a tool that I got to fix this problem instead if you use it as a way

363
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:45,960
to kind of just roll around in it swim in this loving kindness breathe it it

364
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:52,560
just starts to you get filled up and then it just automatically flows out and then it automatically just starts to

365
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:59,700
touch all your relationships including the difficult people and that are making our lives miserable and then that just

366
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:07,520
starts to kind of shift that relationship is that helpful very much so thank you thank you

367
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,359
foreign

368
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:29,640
I can just talk um I just I don't have a question but I just wanted to say I love chanting and I

369
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:34,859
have downloaded the loving kindness meta Sutra on my phone and it's three minutes

370
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:41,520
long and sometimes I'll use it to fall asleep by and then I also when I go

371
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:48,140
hiking over at Edgewood Park on the bench I'll play it and sing it at the same time

372
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:55,859
the Edgewood too so that's fantastic fantastic yeah and you know

373
00:40:55,859 --> 00:41:00,900
um I'll say that uh learning it enchanting

374
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:09,060
it really helps with concentration I'm kind of like calming and like collecting the heart and the mind too in a way that

375
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:13,640
this can be really supportive thank you for sharing that it's very nice

376
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:20,060
we have time for another comment or question

377
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:34,320
hi thank you so much um you were when you were speaking about the Equanimity and saying

378
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:42,599
we don't necessarily we can't grasp the larger picture

379
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:48,660
um I would say that Equanimity is about seeing the bigger picture thank you

380
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:53,820
seeing the bigger picture um and so

381
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:59,280
I'm a little confused by that just in the sense of in we don't we don't know

382
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,800
what part this plays in the larger scheme of

383
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,680
things or yeah this is that because you were talking about the things that came

384
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:17,220
before also and I was confused about like yeah yeah what preceded this

385
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:22,260
episode seems different than my understanding of like oh we don't see

386
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:28,320
the whole piece thank you thank you yeah this is a um I didn't really talk about that very

387
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:35,040
much and so thank you for kind of pointing out that this could be um expanded a little bit so what does it

388
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:42,060
mean to like see the bigger picture and I talked a little bit about like saying what's preceded it but also another way

389
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:47,579
to think about it and this might be related a little bit to loving kindness or these types of things is that when

390
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:53,339
we're having a difficulty or something that we really like then we're completely enamored with

391
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:59,099
there's a way in which our kind of like awareness or I'll just use that word awareness just

392
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:04,800
kind of collapses around it and that's all we can see like you know when there's a pain in the knee it just feels

393
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,200
like that's the only thing just the pain in the knee so another way to understand seeing the

394
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:16,920
bigger picture is to recognize yes maybe there's that pain in the knee but there's also this neutral sensation of

395
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:24,960
pressure against the body of what I'm sitting on and there's this kind of neutral sensation of sounds or seen

396
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:32,099
light or so I've seen the bigger picture sometimes it's just seen that there's other things happening at the same time

397
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:37,319
not in addition to seeing what was preceded at so there's like a number of

398
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:44,359
different ways we could understand this idea of the bigger picture is that helpful yes

399
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:53,880
okay okay so uh that's nine o'clock and it's a pleasure to practice with you all

400
00:43:53,880 --> 00:44:00,540
and may you find some balance some steadiness some equanimity

401
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:05,579
and or a little bit of this loving-kindness thing that I've been pointing to

402
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:13,520
and the rest of your evening today or tonight and always so thank you
