00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:06,359
hello everyone and

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:13,480
welcome and I'm quite happy to be back here after being gone for a

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:23,080
week and grateful for David Lori who tght for you all yester last

4
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,640
week so I was on a retreat teaching Retreat

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,759
which was quite lovely at our Retreat Center in Santa

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,520
Cruz so um I think probably most of you know

7
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:48,600
that um the the poly word the Sanskrit word

8
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,399
Dua is which is often translated as suffering it gets translated other ways

9
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:02,640
as well and uh one translator Tanis raiku translates it as stress and one of

10
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,080
the benefits of stress is that um uh

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,159
even things which are quite bring a lot of happiness and joy can simultaneously

12
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:21,479
be stressful and um and so the example that's given is uh

13
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:28,520
a wedding someone getting married is a quite a joyful event but at the same time it can be stressful

14
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:36,560
and and um and also uh stress can apply to small things small degrees of anxiety

15
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,640
small degrees of resistance of uh whereas suffering is a big word

16
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,799
and uh people sometimes associated with the major catastrophes of

17
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:55,640
Life the word that uh sometimes I prefer or enjoy and Delight in as a translation

18
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,920
of Dua is unease and that has some of the same benefits

19
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:10,720
as uh stress and perhaps that it's more Universal application to feel

20
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,680
uneasy and uh then the opposite is uh

21
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:24,040
ease ease and unease to feel easy and feel uneasy

22
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:31,840
about something and uh in meditation those two can be a Wonder ful guide for finding

23
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,720
our way in practice and wonderful way of discovering for

24
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:44,519
ourselves uh the Dharma path so that'll be the theme for this

25
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:50,720
morning's meditation and uh so we'll

26
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,640
begin and uh to

27
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,239
um assume and meditate ation

28
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,519
posture or sometimes I like to say enter your meditation

29
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:15,799
posture if you're familiar with the meditation posture it can be kind of

30
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:22,439
like putting on a comfortable some comfortable soft

31
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,640
clothes and to

32
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:39,760
lower your gaze and perhaps close your

33
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:50,519
eyes and to gently

34
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:57,560
modestly take some deeper breaths that fills your chest maybe even

35
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,239
your belly expands

36
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:09,560
and as you exhale to relax the

37
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:23,759
body as you exhale kind to settle into your seat

38
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,840
into the place where you're meditating

39
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:55,560
as you exhale let the weight of your

40
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,199
body be received

41
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:08,759
by whatever holds the body up from the pull of gravity

42
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:43,880
and letting your breathing return to normal continue to

43
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:51,880
relax relaxing your body with the idea that you're putting your body at

44
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:01,479
ease that meditation is a continual process of find finding our

45
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:06,639
ease in our body our mind our

46
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:16,199
hearts maybe on the inhale to feel the muscles of your

47
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:25,520
face and on the exhale to relax the muscles in your face

48
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,800
feeling the muscles of your

49
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,360
shoulders to relax your

50
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,319
shoulders as you inhale to feel the muscles of your

51
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:31,520
belly and as you exhale to soften the belly relax

52
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
as you inhale to

53
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,599
feel the muscles or what can seem almost like the mus muscles of the thinking

54
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:08,800
mind if there's any pressure or tension

55
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,080
contraction activation associated with

56
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,080
thinking as you exhale

57
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,879
soften in the thinking mind

58
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,680
and then then to introduce the idea of ease

59
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:09,920
do whatever easy way it it you can do so set your body at

60
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:33,120
ease maybe there can be an easing up of the body tensions and pains and

61
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,800
challenges easing up being

62
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,839
easy with how the body is

63
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:11,560
and then to set your mind at ease supporting the mind to take a break

64
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:18,519
from its worries or [Music] concerns giving the mind the thinking

65
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:25,480
mind a chance to be at ease being

66
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,120
easy with the mind

67
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:46,959
and if it's easy enough ease up and easing up and

68
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,200
whatever way the mind is

69
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:13,839
and then setting your heart at ease whatever emotional Center you have

70
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,760
or emotional state that you

71
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,560
have set it at set it at

72
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:34,560
ease or if it won't be at ease is ease up on

73
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,959
it be

74
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:56,600
easy and then centering yourself on your breathing

75
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:03,360
being easy with your

76
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,120
breathing easing up if that's

77
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,800
helpful breathing at ease

78
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,639
and then for the center of this meditation

79
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:48,160
instruction with whatever degree of ease or maybe calm that you

80
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:54,639
have as you're meditating notice what takes you away

81
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,079
from that ease

82
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,839
and when you're ready set yourself at ease

83
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,519
again maybe it's only ever so

84
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:30,920
slight ease set yourself at ease and know what takes you away

85
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:40,959
and be easy with what takes you away ease up on whatever unease you

86
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:47,760
have be easy with the ways that you're you feel

87
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:01,040
uneasy and as you breathe in and breathe

88
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:14,040
sound practicing being easy with whatever is

89
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,639
happening and being sure to notice

90
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,800
what takes the ease

91
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
away

92
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
for

93
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

94
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

95
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
for

96
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
for

97
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

98
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
for

99
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

100
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

101
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
for

102
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
for

103
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

104
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,559
for e

105
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:59,600
set yourself at ease

106
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,840
and maybe then it's easier to stay

107
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,278
aware easier even to be aware of how you become

108
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:20,720
uneasy without being caught in the

109
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
unease

110
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

111
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

112
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

113
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
for

114
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

115
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,278
e for

116
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:21,000
and as we begin to approach the end of the meditation see if in the last minute of

117
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,880
this meditation if you can set yourself at

118
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,640
ease be easy with whatever is going on

119
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:41,640
whatever your meditation is like be at ease for the next 60

120
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,200
Seconds for

121
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,600
and then to finish up the

122
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:47,799
meditation to direct your heart to take in the people in your life your

123
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:54,320
communities around you the circles

124
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,880
of people known and known as they these circles spread

125
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:10,399
outwards out into the world and may what you've discovered or

126
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:16,279
touched into about ease in the

127
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:24,919
meditation may it help you to recognize how others are

128
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:29,880
uneasy when they're not at ease

129
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:40,080
and may we we be a be a safe presence for others may

130
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:47,760
we talk or be or be present in a way that supports

131
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,760
others to be at

132
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:59,360

kinds may all beings find enough ease

[Music]

145
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,320
thank

146
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:59,919
you

147
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,880
e e

148
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:05,799
so hello everyone and welcome to this uh Monday morning

149
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:12,240
and the beginning of a new five-part series for this

150
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:22,480
week and uh what I'd like to talk about is what maybe provisionally we can call

151
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,519
um uh the uh kind of the central or core

152
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:34,600
teach teachings uh as uh I have come to emphasize as a

153
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:42,080
teacher that um every teacher has a particular way of teaching perspectives

154
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:48,679
from which to teach that um

155
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:55,559
um that um maybe because of what works for the teacher or what they've seen

156
00:32:55,559 --> 00:33:01,159
supports other people um or maybe it represents some of the core values the

157
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:10,159
teacher has so as a teacher I have ways that I teach and I have kind of core or

158
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:17,720
Central um aspects of my teaching or assumptions or underlying kind of

159
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:23,440
premises that uh from which I teach or emphasize so since some of you have been

160
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,519
listening to me for a long time I thought it might be nice for me to try to

161
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:34,120
uh explain uh at least for this week five different kind of fundamental

162
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:39,880
orientations that I bring with me uh as as being a

163
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:46,720
teacher in my teaching and maybe some of you will recognize how I teach and why I

164
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:54,600
teach what I do because of this uh kind of uh explanations that I'll give this

165
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:59,679
week so um the the one of the most

166
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:06,440
fundamental orientations I have which maybe comes as no surprise because it's

167
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:15,679
in some ways it's emphasized to ltin Buddhism is uh uh to focus on suffering

168
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:23,679
Dua and the end of it and uh there's a Simplicity to that

169
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:31,358
orientation um and of course Dua are suffering is complicated so certainly it can be

170
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:39,560
complicated to delve into it at times but that's the orientation that uh the fundamental

171
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:48,878
purpose of the Dharma is to end suffering and uh and so there's a uh uh

172
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:57,160
so if there is a uh you know orientation is the is to not to only point to the

173
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:02,680
end of s suffering but point to real study and learn how to effectively be

174
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:09,400
present for suffering to see it and know it and work with it and

175
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:17,000
um and uh it makes the Dharma much more simple and kind of streamlines it

176
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:23,440
there's a lot of wonderful spiritual spiritual goals spiritual understandings religious

177
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:29,160
understandings humanistic understandings purposes that people have for what they want how they want to live their

178
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:36,640
life and some of them involve uh uh pretty um

179
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:45,440
Grand goals that are glorious uh that um involve

180
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,520
Great accomplishments in meditation great accomplishment in in experiences

181
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:58,560
and all kinds of wonderful things and I want um and um

182
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:05,880
and these are all good but uh the question that I live with is am I

183
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:11,480
suffering is there suffering here and some great spiritual

184
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:16,760
experiences uh in the experiences there may be no suffering but the experiences

185
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:24,880
haven't really uh Plumb the depths of the sources and The Roots and of the

186
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:32,240
unease the distress the stress the anxiety the psychological challenges

187
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,760
that we live with and uh and so the Dharma is meant

188
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,800
to really Plum that depth to really see clearly and not just have no

189
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:49,560
suffering you can have no suffering by getting distracted enough to but to

190
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:56,760
really get down to the roots of where suffering comes from in us so that uh uh

191
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:02,640
we don't live suffering we don't live with suffering waiting to be triggered in

192
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:09,560
us so uh uh this emphasis on suffering I think of as a little bit

193
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:16,680
like if you're a nature photographer and go to the savanas of Africa and you want

194
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:25,040
to uh take pictures of many different wild animals uh it's hard to go roaming

195
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:33,359
around the savanas The Plains of afca Africa looking for all the animals that you want to see but if you uh sit at the

196
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:38,680
watering holes all the animals sooner or later have to come to the watering hole

197
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:45,119
so if you sit there maybe camouflaged and wait then all these animals will come and you can take a

198
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:53,119
picture so uh this uh orientation to suffering is that that's the watering

199
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:59,240
hole that's the place where everything everything that you need to know everything you to study everything you

200
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:05,920
need to let go of and to realize comes to it comes into play around suffering

201
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:11,560
so if you if you become attuned to it and study it and see it and learn to be

202
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:17,079
comfortable with being mindful of our the ways of which we're

203
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:25,160
challenged um it gives you a vantage point from which to learn to discover

204
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:32,880
every have Insight in everything that you need really need to know in order to be free of uh

205
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:39,040
suffering and um and

206
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:46,520
uh and so uh the um um and

207
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:54,400
so and so one of the things that orientation around suffering does is it puts the practice in the world of our

208
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:02,680
direct experience uh suffering or if you pref prefer words like um stress or

209
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:08,359
unease uh in the guided meditation I introduce the translation of Dua as

210
00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:14,520
unease uh sometimes I've seen translators uh spell it with the hyphen

211
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:21,520
dis ease and that has its evocative uh suggestive idea is that Dua is a kind of

212
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:27,480
a dis disease um and um that we have and

213
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,680
and uh so to um it's put us focusing on suffering

214
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:39,640
puts us in our direct experience that's where we want to be and does not put us

215
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:46,680
in the books to read about Buddhism you know being a bookand Buddhist who reads all the time ideas are wonderful and

216
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:52,319
inspiring some people get very calm and inspired and have wonderful experiences

217
00:39:52,319 --> 00:39:57,680
reading but it sometimes it's only you know doesn't go deep inside because it's

218
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:04,640
not doesn't sustain us the idea is to read the book of our own hearts and so

219
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:11,680
when we remember that we're looking at suffering not to suffer better but to uh

220
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:18,960
find an alternative a healthy alternative to suffering to find the resolution of the suffering the the the

221
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:29,318
dissolution of our suffering and um uh so to um

222
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:37,040
to uh so the suffering is a direct experience and so it's not metaphysics

223
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:42,800
it's not things we can't know for ourselves it's not taking us away into

224
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:50,040
some Transcendent world away from our uh imminent world of here and now and with

225
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:56,599
other people it puts us right in in the human world uh where we can do the work

226
00:40:56,599 --> 00:41:02,319
of really seeing and being with what is so the question I the fundamental

227
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:09,040
question I ask myself uh as I go about my life is uh am I

228
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:15,000
suffering and if I am then I stop so the bumper sticker that I like would have

229
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,599
maybe is um I stop for suffering if I don't feel the suffering I don't

230
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:28,040
recognize them suffering and then I'll continue what I'm doing if it doesn't cause any harm and um and it it's kind

231
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:34,560
of makes it very easy there are people who have other goals uh for their religious life

232
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:41,000
spiritual life and um and they feel there these other goals are grander more wonderful

233
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:49,160
more important than simply the ending of suffering and um that's fine but my hope

234
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:55,760
is that um first or in addition they're also working to really uproot the uh

235
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:03,680
their own suffering it's it's one of the great goals of life to discover the end of suffering and um and whether that

236
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:10,319
some people might see that as being a lesser goal maybe it's a modest goal maybe there's fantastic things to do in

237
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:15,760
life and experience in life that are better and greater than the end of

238
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:23,119
suffering but at least do that let that be the be the foundation um in which by which you do

239
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:29,960
everything else um and and then uh it isn't suffering that's uh

240
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:37,200
motivating um to get away from suffering or try to solve suffering indirectly or to bypass

241
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:44,520
it that drives Higher Goals than this so for me I've discovered that one of the

242
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:51,040
most ultimate things we can do is uh come to the end of suffering and uh and

243
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:56,480
this practice of insight is the practice that I've seen for me has taken me to

244
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,559
the end of suffering in such a clear and dramatic and full way that I know

245
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:07,760
nothing else that does this good and direct job because it's really addressing it

246
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,800
directly and um and uh so for me it's pretty

247
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:19,800
ultimate uh ultimate kind of experience ultimate purpose that I like to teach for and I like to live for it's not the

248
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:26,280
only purpose uh in the wake of the ending of suffering there's uh uh

249
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:33,040
there's more there's then there's a motivation from that to support other people and I've dedicated my life from a

250
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:41,520
particular moment I had in a Buddhist Monastery to live my life for uh for

251
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:48,240
support Aid guide whatever I can do to help others get to the root of their own

252
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:55,800
suffering and uproot that root to bring it to an end and um and as I've learned

253
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:04,559
to recognize that in myself myself it has inspired me to support other people do this the same thing it is possible to

254
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:10,280
uh come to the end of suffering and that by putting that at the at the core the

255
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:17,160
center of Dharma practice my teaching um The Hope is that we're providing a

256
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:23,520
direct way the most direct way to do it without being distracted or cut up inid

257
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:31,680
shows uh from that might be you know have their own value but uh can be a distraction from Dua and

258
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:40,440
the end of it so uh that is one of my fundamental orientations and and um and

259
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:46,960
with that um the um

260
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,960
um there's some areas of Buddhism that I don't find particularly interesting

261
00:44:52,960 --> 00:45:00,359
because those areas are not the you know pointing directly to that so I'll talk

262
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:06,960
more about that um over this week but um as a beginning to the kind of core

263
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:12,800
teachings that foundations to my teachings that I teach this is really at the

264
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:18,160
center so um thank you and um I look

265
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:24,040
forward to offering you this kind of background to how I teach for the rest

266
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,400
of this week
