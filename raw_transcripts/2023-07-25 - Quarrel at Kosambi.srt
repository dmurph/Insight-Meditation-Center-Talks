1
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,779
test

2
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:44,300
foreign how's the audio okay

3
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:53,300
great the uh the topic for the talk tonight is it's called the coral that kosambi

4
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:59,660
it's one of these um ancient stories that can tell us something about

5
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:05,460
conflict and communal and social harmony

6
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:11,220
first thing I'd like to do is if you're willing

7
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:16,740
if you can draw the mind to someone someone in your community in your circles

8
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:23,280
who who you think of as someone who is both effective

9
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,920
and their actions tend to yield Harmony

10
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:37,039
in the community if you can think of someone someone specific and draw them up in your mind

11
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:50,520
got someone all right and then also if you're willing

12
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:55,980
if with a word or a phrase some some quality or skill that they have that

13
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:01,140
tends to that that you would say characterizes their ability to bring forward Harmony

14
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:08,960
in the community and I'll just repeat it back so we don't need the microphone passing around just popcorn

15
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:23,780
Joy great patience

16
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:31,520
reaching out acceptance

17
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:34,279
self-care

18
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:40,099
write speech

19
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,300
non-threatening

20
00:53:53,160 --> 00:54:00,480
generosity great maybe one more

21
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:06,720
compassion um that's uh whoever you have in mind

22
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:11,720
that's an inspiring Community thank you thank you for sharing those

23
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:20,579
so in some ways this um this is a talk that I've really wanted to give all week these last last few

24
00:54:20,579 --> 00:54:27,300
weeks I've been studying that the Buddhist teaching on social and communal Harmony and we did a series

25
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:33,078
about that and uh 7 A.M last week

26
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:39,420
so I want to um I'm going to go through these two stories in light of in light of that set

27
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:46,099
of teachings and first I want to give you some of the background that I pulled out from

28
00:54:46,099 --> 00:54:51,660
bikubody's beautiful book The Buddha's teachings on social and communal Harmony

29
00:54:51,660 --> 00:55:00,300
just a few principles we want to talk about first and then we'll get into the stories and the first is Right View

30
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:05,339
Right View as the the Forerunner of Social and communal Harmony

31
00:55:05,339 --> 00:55:11,900
um pretty easy pretty easy to understand how if we can't see out the windshield

32
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:17,520
our tendency to bump into things is significantly higher

33
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:27,000
but a clear clear seeing Right View wise View allows us to navigate in a way that's uh

34
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:33,480
hopefully doing less harm for others in the teachings it said that the the

35
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:39,480
Right View it's compared to how the dawn leads it's

36
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:45,059
the the the dawn is the Forerunner of the Risen Sun familiar image

37
00:55:45,059 --> 00:55:50,280
it said that right view is the Forerunner to all the wholesome qualities

38
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:57,359
including the noble a fold path So Right View starts us off a little

39
00:55:57,359 --> 00:56:02,520
disambiguation an important point that right View

40
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:07,740
um has much to do with a way of seeing

41
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:14,700
a way of relating to our experience more so than having the right view or the

42
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:19,819
right opinion about something does that make sense

43
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:27,960
the the essentials there the right view in in this context

44
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:33,480
uh it's two things one is that our actions have

45
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:39,960
consequences our actions are effective in the world they bear fruit

46
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:45,319
and the second is that we can tell the difference in some measure between

47
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:51,540
an action that's helpful and an action that's harmful so I think when we call to mind we call

48
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:58,200
to mind this person and think of think of how they tend to nourish Community that's that that's that right view

49
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:04,500
Instinct that we're tapping into this is a this is a person with a perspective and a way of being in the

50
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:11,160
world that brings help not hurt doesn't bring Affliction they bring

51
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:13,940
well-being

52
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:22,500
So Right View at the beginning second second is the quality of

53
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:28,800
reflection before during and after an action and how we can how we grow through our

54
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:35,520
experience I don't know if I don't know if any of us in this room have ever made a mistake

55
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:41,579
um today you know um

56
00:57:41,579 --> 00:57:50,579
but the the Buddha held in very high regard this this willingness to and reflect on our actions in such a

57
00:57:50,579 --> 00:57:56,579
way that we can we can kind of get a sense oh did I hurt someone here did I harm someone here or did I do something

58
00:57:56,579 --> 00:58:03,859
wholesome and when you do something wholesome rejoice rejoice in it let it grow

59
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:09,599
So Right View and reflection and at some point

60
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:15,859
it's bound to happen that if we're living a reflective life

61
00:58:15,859 --> 00:58:21,420
that the maybe let's say the habits of our character

62
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:26,640
May become apparent to us and this might this might show up in

63
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:34,940
challenging ways it might show up in really supportive ways good example of this is

64
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:42,900
living a living a reflected reflective life and discovering for the first time that there's anger in there

65
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:48,960
and wow I see I really see a difference when That's the basis of my action

66
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:54,319
um or hostility cruelty

67
00:58:54,319 --> 00:59:00,660
when I act from that place is there a tendency to help or to harm

68
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:06,119
so we come into come into contact with these habits of our character

69
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:10,099
and then that gets to be what we reflect on

70
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,480
so

71
00:59:17,819 --> 00:59:24,359
fourth sort of thing that we'll draw out from these stories is the power of good friendship good Dharma friendship

72
00:59:24,359 --> 00:59:33,839
and the fifth is the importance of a Clarity of aspiration I'll say or why why is why is

73
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:40,040
it that we do this why do we put ourselves that ajan Shah has this

74
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:45,900
he's talking about a different point but this is this is the whole point of why we put ourselves through all this

75
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:52,440
difficult practice which I appreciate from someone who was a monk for so long

76
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:58,578
you know the practice is not easy so why do we why do we do it

77
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:03,260
so we'll pull out some of these things as we go through the stories

78
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:12,839
of coral and cosambi this reveals to me so one of the reasons

79
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:18,000
I love this story is that it reveals to me the Buddha as a human

80
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:25,020
who like dealt with difficulty in much the same way we deal with difficulty and actually gets to the

81
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:30,660
point where he walks away from a conflict realizes in this moment it can't be

82
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:37,520
resolved and when I when I saw that for the first time I was actually really touched

83
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:43,440
so how do we get there the way the story goes and this comes

84
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:49,980
from a couple of different places one is the the vinia

85
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:56,819
and apparently the back story is that there are some in the community of monks there was some minor infraction

86
01:00:56,819 --> 01:01:04,380
somebody made a very small mistake and there was a disagreement about

87
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:09,839
whether or not it was actually a mistake so even even the person changed his mind

88
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:15,240
a couple of times first he was like oh you know that was kind of an error and everyone else said oh that's not a

89
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:22,140
problem and then he switched and was like you know I really think I I made him I I did not

90
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:27,839
make a mistake there and everyone else was on the other side

91
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:33,059
so um the way that the monastic Sangha creates Harmony again

92
01:01:33,059 --> 01:01:38,460
if there's if there's a sort of offense let's say is that there's a one of the

93
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:44,700
ways is by way of confession you sort of lay it out there for your friends and the friends and the holy

94
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:52,319
life they say and then that is accepted it's pretty simple and then you resolve

95
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:58,559
to restrain yourself in the future so there's this minor infraction and then there's a there's a split

96
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:04,559
because he's he's now saying no I didn't do anything wrong and they're saying Oh Yes actually all of us agree that you

97
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:09,019
did so please

98
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:15,420
but he really knew his stuff and could make a make a good argument for himself

99
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:21,059
um and wouldn't he would not accept he wouldn't accept this so

100
01:02:21,059 --> 01:02:29,460
um not only not only does he not accept that he made a mistake he decides that the thing to do is to um uh rally

101
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:34,920
a party on his behalf so he's kind of like drum up some help

102
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:40,559
to get people on his side and make a good argument doesn't this sound familiar

103
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:46,020
you know like make a mistake I'm gonna deny it and

104
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:51,420
then I'm going to get a whole bunch of allies you know it's very human

105
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:57,440
um so he goes about doing this and the the split just gets bigger and bigger

106
01:02:59,790 --> 01:03:02,829
[Music]

107
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:13,380
so there's a certain a certain monk who must have realized that we need a little help here this is getting out of hand

108
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:20,460
goes and tells the Buddha and the Buddha the the monk says

109
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:26,160
something like please out of compassion for the community come come talk to these monks

110
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:32,599
Southern Buddha comes and speaks to the speaks to them

111
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:41,040
out of concern for the harm that can be done with the monastic Community is split

112
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:47,119
so this is this is a really big issue when the when the Buddha is thinking about the longevity of his teaching

113
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:52,799
one of the things that that ensures its longevity is a United Community

114
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:58,980
to carry on carry on the teaching generation after generation and if they split then all sorts of

115
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:04,740
things can happen so he hears about this he's thinking oh

116
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:11,420
the Sangha of monks is splitting how's he going to handle this

117
01:04:13,859 --> 01:04:19,200
so he doesn't talk to everyone all at once apparently first he goes to the offending Monk

118
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:25,559
and tries to reason with this monk saying things more or less like uh

119
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:32,760
if if someone has he's saying if someone has done an offense someone's made a mistake but they have the thought I have

120
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:38,579
not made a mistake that should not be grounds for them not confessing and repairing he's like

121
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:44,280
trying to reason with this person on one side and then he goes and tries to reason with the others

122
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:51,559
doesn't work he leaves he leaves for a while and then he gets another report

123
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:55,400
another one comes and says this

124
01:05:00,839 --> 01:05:05,940
another Monk comes and says for the Buddha now the monks are quarreling

125
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:12,299
arguing and disputing wounding one another with verbal daggers

126
01:05:12,299 --> 01:05:18,200
it would be good if the blessed one would go out of sympathy

127
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:24,839
so things are really heating up and the

128
01:05:24,839 --> 01:05:31,859
the Buddha the Buddha sits with the whole Community this time and he says very plainly

129
01:05:31,859 --> 01:05:40,859
four phrases don't argue don't quarrel uh don't make Strife don't dispute

130
01:05:40,859 --> 01:05:47,880
and then a monk stands up and says what on first reading I thought was kind of a compassionate thing to say he says more

131
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:56,280
or less obuda please don't worry about this you go be comfortable and we'll settle this ourselves

132
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:02,119
the Buddha repeats his repeats his admonition gets the same response

133
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:07,880
and then there's a third round

134
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:19,920
and here's a moment when the Buddha became profoundly human um

135
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:25,319
after the third denial this this monk saying oh please don't worry about this

136
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:31,140
please be at peace he says it in a really nice way and then the Buddha thinks

137
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:37,319
here this is this is direct direct quote I won't soften it these worthless men seem to be out of

138
01:06:37,319 --> 01:06:45,180
control they're not easy to convince and he got it from his seat and left

139
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:50,940
and that that was kind of stunning to me just to see or hear the the Buddha get

140
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:56,940
up and reading around in some other some other texts the notion that I have is that he

141
01:06:56,940 --> 01:07:02,579
recognized that despite his skill it

142
01:07:02,579 --> 01:07:09,539
it was not the time that anyone could be shifted from unwholesomeness to wholesomeness he realized he would just

143
01:07:09,539 --> 01:07:12,859
be wasting his time at the moment

144
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:22,140
so what does he do frustrated well he goes for alms and

145
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:29,099
then at the end of his arms around he has his meal he he utters some just devastating stanzas about

146
01:07:29,099 --> 01:07:35,460
um how people can be with each other when they're when they're quarreling some of them are straight out of the Del

147
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:42,720
mopata and then he goes and he spends time alone he spends a lot of time alone

148
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:48,900
makes friends with a big elephant which is which is very very cool

149
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:54,000
um and then he arrives he he goes around

150
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:00,720
visiting some other monks there's one living alone and he kind of checks in on him and then he goes to this other scene

151
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:06,599
which is like the second story I want to tell you but before we get there because the

152
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:15,539
scene is such a strong contrast to where we've been just pausing for a moment and kind of registering how you are

153
01:08:15,539 --> 01:08:21,140
considering considering the sort of conflict and quarrel that we're talking about

154
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:26,000
how that's relevant or how that lives in your lives

155
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:32,460
and taking a moment to register how in in that Community this dispute going on

156
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:39,480
the absence of Right View the sort of short-sightedness of or the

157
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:46,738
the lack of the reflective life it seems like right now in the in the midst of the coral the the blinders are

158
01:08:46,739 --> 01:08:52,080
on such that the most important thing is being being right

159
01:08:52,080 --> 01:08:57,859
rather than being free hmm

160
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:08,120
so we're about to see something very different

161
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:16,040
what I'm going to read you is one of the sweetest things in the video

162
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:23,160
it's these three months I I believe that the most senior of them is venerable honoruda and they're in this place

163
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:30,060
called the Eastern bamboo Park so the Buddha is approaching

164
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:36,660
and this is an interesting detail a park Warden apparently someone taking care of the monastery

165
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:41,758
um saw the Buddha coming and on seeing him said oh please

166
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:50,539
contemplative don't enter the park there are there are three people in here practicing and don't bother them

167
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:57,060
which is which is also this is a this is a moment of the Buddha being profoundly human

168
01:09:57,060 --> 01:10:03,360
because there's not a there's not a sign on him that says uh I am unsurpassed

169
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:11,160
worthy one he just look he looks like an ascetic he's bald head wears a robe

170
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:16,380
and actually I think it it it's um looking at this another way I really

171
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:22,560
appreciate that this person called the park Warden is protecting the seclusion of these

172
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:27,260
practitioners I think that's very cool

173
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:36,659
so luckily the intervalana Ruda overhears this says oh it's okay Park Warden this is the Buddha please he's

174
01:10:36,659 --> 01:10:43,260
our teacher comes in they pay respects and the first thing that the Buddha says

175
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:50,400
he calls them all the three of them anurudas they all share the one name he says Anna

176
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:57,000
Ruda in plural to refer to this group of monks and right away I get a little touch of

177
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:02,540
how this how this group is living harmoniously and he says a couple of initial things

178
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:08,658
checking in on them is is your life tolerable is alms around going okay

179
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:16,679
and then he says this really sweet thing are you living harmoniously

180
01:11:16,679 --> 01:11:22,860
cordially and without dispute blending like milk and water

181
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:28,860
looking at one another with eyes of affection elsewhere it said looking at each other

182
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:34,739
with kindly eyes and the monks say yes yes we are living

183
01:11:34,739 --> 01:11:42,780
this way not content with that and maybe for our benefit the Buddha goes on to say oh

184
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:49,699
well how are you living this way how are you being harmonious

185
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:58,440
and again just as you're as you're hearing what this part of the story the contrast of what we just

186
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:04,980
what we were just going through another root of response here the thought occurs to me regarding

187
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:11,159
his friends in the in the park it is a gain for me a great gain that

188
01:12:11,159 --> 01:12:17,580
I'm living with Companions of this sort I am set on bodily acts of

189
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:25,940
loving-kindness with regard to these to their faces and behind their backs

190
01:12:26,219 --> 01:12:33,179
I really appreciate that he goes on I'm set on bodily verbal and

191
01:12:33,179 --> 01:12:36,739
mental acts of loving kindness

192
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:44,040
and then in this gesture of totally not clinging to any view he says why don't I

193
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:51,239
having put aside my own thoughts conduct myself in line with the thoughts of these venerable ones

194
01:12:51,239 --> 01:12:56,340
and then I do any closes by saying our bodies are

195
01:12:56,340 --> 01:13:02,760
separate Ponte but we are one as it were in mind

196
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:08,280
and then the other two repeat the same thing word for word it's just such a kind way to regard

197
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:14,699
there's so much respect cordiality

198
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:24,300
this next line took me and took me some time to really consider so what's going on here

199
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:30,780
I would have thought that's the end of the story it's like are you living well together are you kind to one another yeah

200
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:36,179
well how well these ways and then the Buddha has a follow-up question

201
01:13:36,179 --> 01:13:42,420
he says but do you remain heedful Ardent and Resolute basically

202
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:48,659
are you practicing hard or or another way I'm hearing that is

203
01:13:48,659 --> 01:13:55,020
are you are you clear on what you're doing and are you staying are you staying engaged

204
01:13:55,020 --> 01:14:01,080
is Right View alive heedful is like um heat full of wholesome and

205
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:08,400
unwholesome qualities cultivating the wholesome abandoning the unwholesome Ardent it's one of these words that

206
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:14,400
shows up a lot in relationship to meditation and resolute

207
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:19,400
so not only are you kind with one another but are you practicing well

208
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:28,380
and then they they say yes then there's a follow-up I won't read the details of

209
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:33,719
the follow-up but when you when they're asked oh how are you Abiding heed-flarden and Resolute they have this

210
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:39,480
very interesting coordinated detailed way of all doing the chores

211
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:46,500
and what's what's relevant about that is that you could like switch out every task that they talk about with whoever

212
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:53,219
or whichever so there's there's this way that they can do it without talking even

213
01:14:53,219 --> 01:14:59,040
they uh one of one of the things is whoever sees that uh this particular jug

214
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:04,620
of water needs needs filling uh whoever sees it will do it

215
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:12,199
but if the if they if they deem that it's too heavy for them they'll gesture over to someone else without speaking

216
01:15:12,199 --> 01:15:19,500
quote so we do not break out into speech they're so protecting the meditative

217
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:26,040
mind that they've found ways to take care of their daily needs without without the disturbance

218
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:31,440
makes sense and then because they're really Intense

219
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:37,860
or that's just me making light every five days they stay up all night talking about the Dharma

220
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:44,520
that's the talk that they do otherwise they're abiding in seclusion

221
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:49,580
together in harmony it's pretty amazing

222
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:56,100
and I think these two stories are put together in the mahavaga and the vinya

223
01:15:56,100 --> 01:16:03,060
in part because there's such Stark examples of conflict conflict and harmony

224
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:09,140
the latter being a really good example of good friendship good Dharma friendship

225
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:14,280
as indicated by its power to help us cultivate the

226
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:16,940
Eightfold Path

227
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:27,179
with the last couple of minutes oh you need to know how the other story

228
01:16:27,179 --> 01:16:33,140
ends the Coral at cosine B ends

229
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:40,639
um the way this goes

230
01:16:41,179 --> 01:16:46,500
the laypeople and in kosembi get really frustrated with the

231
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:52,260
quarreling monks and they they say more or less um

232
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:59,159
it's on account of you that the Buddha went away frustrated so we as a lay community

233
01:16:59,159 --> 01:17:05,880
who the who the monastics depend upon completely they decide the the lay Community

234
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:12,380
decides unanimously that they're not going to pay respects to the monks and they're not going to feed them thank you

235
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:20,880
so that gets some serious attention and then the the monks the quarreling monks decide oh we need to we need to go

236
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:27,120
settle this with the Buddha so interestingly before the Buddha came to them and now they are going back to

237
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:33,360
the Buddha and while the while this is happening the offending Monk

238
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:40,140
I'm so happy for him he repeated he reflected again apparently he's reflecting on the the Dharma and he goes

239
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:45,980
oh was an offense

240
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:52,500
but he doesn't the and this this is a this is a an inspiring point he then does not hide it

241
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:58,140
he he goes to his partisans his allies says hey this was a thing will you help

242
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:03,540
me and then they go to the Buddha and then you see where it goes from there domino

243
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:09,360
effect he apologized he confessed he laid it open to the community and then they did

244
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:16,280
their Community transactions because the laypeople withheld food

245
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:25,199
as one condition yeah so with the last couple of minutes

246
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:29,900
before we do we have some conversation

247
01:18:32,699 --> 01:18:38,360
you know I was um I was out walking here before the talk today

248
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:45,739
admiring the light and the Magnolias and the God there's so many beautiful

249
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:52,159
plants I live in San Francisco um

250
01:18:53,520 --> 01:19:01,500
and the thought occurred to me while I while I was walking that sure we have we have we have a really Stark

251
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:08,699
set of examples here of like the Coral at cos MB and then this like really

252
01:19:08,699 --> 01:19:15,179
coordinated beautiful friendship of these three monks and I thought sure

253
01:19:15,179 --> 01:19:20,340
the you know the power of story is that you can enter into the perspective of any

254
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:27,780
one of these characters and see it from see it from their life so what's it like to step in the form of the Buddha and be

255
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:33,560
frustrated at these these people who are fighting I imagine parents or have this some some

256
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:41,219
experience like that or what's it like to be the the folks in the coral and coast and Coast MB that

257
01:19:41,219 --> 01:19:48,780
um they're actually right and this other monk is just really being stubborn about the fact that

258
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:54,360
or what's it maybe the hardest is like what's it like to be the Monk who really believes that he didn't do anything

259
01:19:54,360 --> 01:20:00,960
wrong but everyone everyone in the group is saying yeah you know this has been offense so anyway I think I think

260
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:04,699
there's some complexity to move around in there

261
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:12,840
but also relevant is the fact that I think for most of us living these

262
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:20,040
living these modern lay lives it's never that clean

263
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:26,580
it's never just like I've got two friends and we live in Perfect Harmony together and it's never like

264
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:32,760
the coral that kosembe you know where it where obviously there's some misguided action going on it's just never that

265
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:38,760
clean so I think that's where our our practice of

266
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:44,880
um ongoing ethical reflection it's just so necessary

267
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:49,920
and as as the as we as we learn from that experience

268
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:56,820
and then as our practice keeps maturing as our right View

269
01:20:56,820 --> 01:21:02,699
I'm going to say purifies than our ethical sensitivity gets more and more clear

270
01:21:02,699 --> 01:21:08,280
and then we Implement that new understanding and that new understanding but I don't think we're going to meet

271
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:13,940
with simple scenarios so we'll have to stay attentive I think

272
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:22,340
so thank you very much one little bit of encouragement from

273
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:30,440
monastic life um Zen monastic life at least we

274
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:37,980
we have this uh we have this teaching that the rocks and the rock tumbler polish one another

275
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:43,560
they're like we Bang into each other and have difficulty intentions but we all

276
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:49,080
come out a little more smooth and a little more shined

277
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:55,260
that may well be so I hope we can do that in a in a way that's peaceful peaceful enough

278
01:21:55,260 --> 01:22:03,540
been supportive of your practice so now maybe if their comments questions

279
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:06,199
sharings

280
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:19,020
um just maybe for clarification could you tell people what

281
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:25,080
the vinya is oh sure thanks yeah the Vinnie is the monastic rules that the

282
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:30,659
the the monastics live by and there's the they're all these great

283
01:22:30,659 --> 01:22:36,420
stories in there I thought I thought it was just a like a list of rules but there are origin stories for everything

284
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:41,880
every rule that came down so there's a lot of good literature in there

285
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:45,678
thanks thanks for asking

286
01:22:50,510 --> 01:22:57,659
[Applause] hi um thank you for your story

287
01:22:57,659 --> 01:23:05,100
um yeah so I had two thoughts so one was these months they dedicate their life in

288
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:10,440
this like higher spirituality and if they had corals and they couldn't get

289
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:16,860
over I was thinking how am I supposed to live in harmonious when I just meditate

290
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:21,900
like 10 minutes a day so that was kind of one thought I had and then the other

291
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:29,060
one is so I would like to live in harmony with all my friends and family

292
01:23:29,060 --> 01:23:35,159
but like sometimes I feel like I need to have a boundary with certain people

293
01:23:35,159 --> 01:23:40,739
otherwise I would feel like I get kind of taken advantage

294
01:23:40,739 --> 01:23:45,960
of or could be viewed as like push over a little bit like if I'm constantly

295
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:52,920
generous and people don't appreciate my generosity or take it as like granted so

296
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:58,560
how do you deal with those situations because if I kind of stop being generous

297
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:06,600
and they protest and want to argue like how like what's the wise way to

298
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:13,020
navigate something like that great great thank you for bringing these up

299
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:19,020
um so it was I heard a little a little Edge maybe this is a little farther than you

300
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:24,719
meant but like uh if these monks practice so hard how is harmony possible for me and then

301
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:31,140
specifically um when it's time for boundaries yeah yeah thank you thank you for both

302
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:37,640
of those um maybe I'll start with the the second one first

303
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:43,560
and the I had two two things come to my mind to

304
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:48,600
to share one is this overarching principle in in

305
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:56,640
Dharma practice and Buddhist practice of non-harming non-harming and that in in the umbrella

306
01:24:56,640 --> 01:25:02,640
of non-harming it's not just every other being minus me

307
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:08,000
we're in we're included too we're included too

308
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:13,920
um so they're they're all number of really helpful teachings on wise speech

309
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:19,500
wise action the 10 skillful actions um

310
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:24,780
those are just titles titles of lists but the things you can find

311
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:30,659
um there can be sort of food for our reflection about how to think even just

312
01:25:30,659 --> 01:25:38,000
things to try out in terms of how to live skillfully with others especially when it comes to boundaries

313
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:44,340
in in living harmonious with others

314
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:50,219
it's difficult to overestimate the power of right speech

315
01:25:50,219 --> 01:25:55,320
practicing practicing right speech that's true honest

316
01:25:55,320 --> 01:26:00,380
useful not harmful

317
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:09,000
um there's a lot of freedom to be had there in addition to speech there's a there's

318
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:16,440
a teaching that I didn't give tonight but that I thought really hard about because it's so functional there was

319
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:22,739
there's a there's a sort of rubric that the Buddha gives to his son rahula for considering

320
01:26:22,739 --> 01:26:30,239
an action and um in this very clear direct way

321
01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:35,699
he gives rahula this way a way of thinking before during and after acting

322
01:26:35,699 --> 01:26:42,000
this time does it look like I'm going to cause harm or does it look like I'm gonna cause well-being

323
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:47,280
okay so my reflection says well-being I'm going to go for it and then you reflect while you're acting

324
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:52,560
so pointing toward harm pointing to our well-being okay still looks good and then after

325
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:59,280
looking you look back and do the same thing if you happen to have gone astray and

326
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:07,760
harmed someone then you can share that with a Dharma friend and resolve on something else in the future

327
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:14,280
I'm describing it just at that rubric level because it it has such Broad applicability

328
01:27:14,280 --> 01:27:20,760
and and it has this Advantage where we we are teaching ourself

329
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:27,300
how to live in a skillful way so it doesn't it doesn't offer a

330
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:32,880
prescription at all about how to how do I live in this harmoniously in this world

331
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:39,420
it's more like through through this iterative reflective process we come to see what what actually works

332
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:45,239
in our own life and then you can take these take these sets of teachings and try some of them

333
01:27:45,239 --> 01:27:51,560
out yeah thanks for your question

334
01:27:54,060 --> 01:28:00,719
thank you I was thinking about the different types of conflict and like conflict I'll have with the family or

335
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:06,239
friends or co-workers and then I was thinking what about myself here um you know sometimes I'm My Own Worst

336
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:11,580
critic and I was thinking oh we practice loving kindness I should probably do a little bit more of that with myself or

337
01:28:11,580 --> 01:28:18,840
something but yeah I was thinking of the really the conflict and how it was with the other members in in the uh the

338
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:24,840
that's the tribe or whatnot and yeah sometimes I think well we always have conflict with ourselves it's hard to not

339
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:30,300
have a day or something without that yeah thank you for sharing I think

340
01:28:30,300 --> 01:28:33,320
that's highly relatable

341
01:28:40,199 --> 01:28:47,340
so in the story uh As Told I'll call it a third party came in with

342
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:53,699
a nuclear option and said well we're going to solve this problem even the Buddha couldn't solve the

343
01:28:53,699 --> 01:29:00,000
problem so you know it's great to think that we'll always have somebody that can come in

344
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:08,699
with such a severe consequence we won't feed you if you don't shape up and fly right so sure how do we get to to a

345
01:29:08,699 --> 01:29:16,020
point where we can catalyze the change in the community without you know uh causing such a a strong

346
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:21,480
uproar if you will yeah wow that's a great question

347
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:26,580
um a couple of things that come to my mind I think one of the one of the principles

348
01:29:26,580 --> 01:29:32,400
that keeps communities healthy is having a healthier rate of change

349
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:38,340
so um having having this um

350
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:46,199
what you call the nuclear option I'm glad that that wasn't the fir the first thing you know I think the I think the

351
01:29:46,199 --> 01:29:53,340
monks had to be ready and they weren't they weren't yet ready before before the lay folks did uh did

352
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:59,580
what they did there's a there's a really interesting teaching in this book

353
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:05,460
that relates to this when um it's on the individual level and then we can say something about

354
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:11,760
Community level on the individual level you may you may notice that someone is

355
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:16,699
doing harm um

356
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:24,360
if you there there's this this set of considerations one is like if I say something will uh will that be difficult

357
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:29,760
for me if I say something will that hurt them because they're prone to anger and

358
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:35,100
resentment and uh there's some there's some other

359
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:42,300
ones in there but the the the most important one is um is it possible for them to hear the

360
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:48,000
message and change and if it's not then the other two don't matter

361
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:55,320
um interestingly the Buddha goes through this and says says uh it may be difficult for me or it

362
01:30:55,320 --> 01:31:00,719
might not be difficult for me that's not the criteria that rules out action and same thing they may be upset or not

363
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:05,540
upset really is there a possibility for change

364
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:12,300
in the community sense this is just me speaking from my

365
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:20,580
experience um from the time of living in Dharma communities I'm kind of surprised

366
01:31:20,580 --> 01:31:26,280
uh one way or another something is going to happen

367
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:31,920
uh with with any given situation there's one way of considering this

368
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:38,639
Coral at cosambi not as the you know you could read it as like a failure of the Buddha or something

369
01:31:38,639 --> 01:31:43,739
but I kind of see it as like the ecology just took its time

370
01:31:43,739 --> 01:31:49,139
and soon enough because there's this will to Unity

371
01:31:49,139 --> 01:31:55,679
um something came together it's maybe a little naive on my part I

372
01:31:55,679 --> 01:32:00,780
guess I'm only going to take it as far as saying I've been surprised I've been surprised

373
01:32:00,780 --> 01:32:07,500
in my own communities the level of distress or conflict that somehow has been able to resolve in an

374
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:14,360
unexpected way yeah and that gives me some hope

375
01:32:15,179 --> 01:32:21,860
that's all I have at the moment though yes

376
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:34,679
yeah hi um two things um I think there's a story

377
01:32:34,679 --> 01:32:42,300
uh the middle length discourse is about um a man who comes to put uh and just hurls

378
01:32:42,300 --> 01:32:48,719
insults at him oh yeah he wants to have teaching and he just lets him know what

379
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:57,360
a bunch of malarkey you're giving us you know and the Prada says you know if somebody

380
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:02,760
comes to your house and you feed them are you polite to them and or or

381
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:07,860
something like that I don't quite remember it but if they don't accept what you have

382
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:13,500
to offer them uh you know I I went too far afield because

383
01:33:13,500 --> 01:33:20,340
I can't remember the story perfectly but the end result was that the Buddha basically says you can't

384
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:26,360
teach someone who doesn't want to be taught even the but I can't teach someone she doesn't want to be taught nice

385
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:32,639
so whether we follow the vinaya or not whether we follow all the the code

386
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:38,340
is really up to us and I I find it Charming that these monks were

387
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:46,020
quarreling so much that they that they basically screwed themselves out of

388
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:51,780
their own you know ability to get food and continue their life

389
01:33:51,780 --> 01:33:59,159
and that's what we do we quarrel that much and and and we push something to an

390
01:33:59,159 --> 01:34:06,060
ultimate limit and I think that that's kind of cool to know that the monks are just like us

391
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:11,760
there they are I have I I someone recently quoted I think uh gu Kenneth to

392
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:19,219
me said you won't find Saints in the monastery because Saints don't need monasteries

393
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:25,880
I don't know if I'll take it that far there's some pretty inspiring monastics

394
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:36,600
well hopefully they have time for one last question right um thank you first of all for your teaching

395
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:41,659
it's very um it's a beautiful gift

396
01:34:41,820 --> 01:34:49,860
um what struck me was this thing about is somebody willing to learn or is

397
01:34:49,860 --> 01:34:55,560
somebody willing to listen and I'm in a situation now with my

398
01:34:55,560 --> 01:35:03,179
supervisor and there's a way in regica well he just does he just isn't listening oh

399
01:35:03,179 --> 01:35:09,900
yeah so is there an element of faith that's

400
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:16,620
or trust that continuing a dialogue that doesn't seem to be going anywhere may

401
01:35:16,620 --> 01:35:23,100
actually lead somewhere you know what I mean it's kind of like I don't really know whether they're

402
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:31,020
willing I I don't really know whether they're willing to learn from what I have to say sure

403
01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:42,020
um I guess I can ask the question am I willing to learn from what they have to say that's valid and that I I have some

404
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:49,380
um sensory or you know some felt sense of whether

405
01:35:49,380 --> 01:35:56,460
am I willing to learn but in terms of being able to evaluate is this other people other person willing to learn

406
01:35:56,460 --> 01:36:04,500
from me so do you have anything that you might want to say about that what's arising is a curiosity

407
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:09,440
I don't think it's not a solution um

408
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:16,500
it's it's a two-pronged question it's one is uh

409
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:21,320
are you clear about what you would want to say

410
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:25,400
and the second is um

411
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:34,980
it it's it's just like the it's just like the question you ask like am I am I am I willing to listen is there anything

412
01:36:34,980 --> 01:36:41,820
here that you're not seeing there may not be you may have a really clear lay of the land and the third

413
01:36:41,820 --> 01:36:46,980
thing is a kind of like a wild hair curiosity like

414
01:36:46,980 --> 01:36:53,100
is is there something surprising that you can do in terms of communication

415
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:59,239
um I'm not I'm not advising this thing I'm about to say but uh

416
01:36:59,239 --> 01:37:05,460
this uh teacher of mine told me a story of um oh she she um

417
01:37:05,460 --> 01:37:10,500
she studied as a psychologist and was learning about brief therapy

418
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:17,820
and there's the there was this intervention where there was a couple there was a couple who's having a fight just every day fight fight same fight

419
01:37:17,820 --> 01:37:23,760
every day they get home and have the same fight and their therapist was like okay

420
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:29,880
I want you to go home tonight I want you to have the exact same fight you always have but I want you to do it in the

421
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:36,120
bathtub and something about that broke the spell

422
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:41,580
and then a dialogue could open so it's not a

423
01:37:41,580 --> 01:37:49,080
it's not a direct path but I I do I do wonder I do wonder if is

424
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:54,360
there some is there some like Quantum shift that's available through a surprise maybe give this person a gift

425
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:59,780
or something or something less drastic

426
01:37:59,880 --> 01:38:05,460
thank you I think we've come to time

427
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:10,679
I very much enjoyed the evening with you um

428
01:38:10,679 --> 01:38:17,900
talking about corals and harmony why don't we end with the dedication

429
01:38:27,719 --> 01:38:35,960
so may it be that our Endeavor in the Dharma and our reflective life

430
01:38:37,139 --> 01:38:44,040
is conducive to Harmony for us for others can be an inspiring light for ourselves

431
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:49,139
and for others it may all beings everywhere

432
01:38:49,139 --> 01:39:06,118
be happy peaceful and free [Music]

433
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:11,480
nice to be with all of you foreign
