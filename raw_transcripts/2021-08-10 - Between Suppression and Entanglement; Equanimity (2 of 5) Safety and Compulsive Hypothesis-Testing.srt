so welcome uh welcome all uh it's nice to uh

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:14,080

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,320
and yeah we'll uh we'll settle settle in and

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,599
practice together so um

6
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:38,280
yeah finding a posture that feels feels sustainable

7
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,878
and maybe maybe i was a little premature in the whole uh silence and stillness thing if

8
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:14,479
you need to check which friends are here go ahead check the uh the chat forget about that whole

9
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:21,280
silence and stillness thing i see stinson beach is uh in the house boise

10
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:28,640
yeah welcome welcome to uh to all of you

11
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,920
so

12
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:57,840
just sensing the the the presence of of others

13
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,880
the the jewel of sangha

14
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,599
just softening your your face

15
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,040
we wear the self on the face

16
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:28,720
in other words a certain kind of self-consciousness creates tension

17
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,560
in our face

18
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,799
relaxing all of that tension relaxing

19
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:26,840
self-consciousness relaxing the the

20
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,600
grip of self

21
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,159
relaxing the shoulders

22
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,240
your belly

23
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,840
hands

24
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,599
we sit undefended

25
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:17,400
but there's a deep dignity in being undefended

26
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:09,120
the game of fixing optimizing this moment

27
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,839
shoring up our resources

28
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,279
maybe it feels safe enough

29
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,839
to put all of that down

30
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:38,079
to rest in the good will of sangha

31
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,920
the goodwill of buddha dhamma

32
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:05,959
to truly make peace with this moment

33
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:20,400
we just keep blessing experience with uh

34
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:27,320
awareness love

35
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,720
non-equanimity arises as a kind of density friction

36
00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:02,120
and it's as if the awareness gets blown into that solidity

37
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,840
everything becoming

38
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,559
less dense more like space

39
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,480
giving up all our fights

40
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:35,679
wherever the story or narratives

41
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,480
of

42
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:50,480
time of our autobiography the story of this meditation

43
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:59,360
as that accumulates and we notice and we just breathe

44
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,360
awareness into all of it

45
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:22,600
somewhere between suppression and entanglement

46
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:58,159
so so welcome muay always struck you can kind of say

47
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:04,240
welcome before sitting but then the the welcome after sitting

48
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:10,480
feels like a sort of true true welcome you know

49
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,960
um so i'm happy to uh to be with you and be

50
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:23,840
continuing this exploration around around equanimity

51
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,679
so

52
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,480
it's uh it's said that um

53
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:42,240
all of biology is evolutionary biology

54
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:48,960
um we we humans we don't just

55
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,080
come from animals sometimes we say that we come from animals

56
00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:00,640
let you in on a little secret we uh we are animals

57
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:06,799
and um sometimes i think that uh you know the

58
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,840
the word human the name human maybe that's just like another

59
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,840
vanity of our of our species

60
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:27,120
and i say this because if we forget that we're animals we start to

61
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:32,640
uh maybe hate parts of ourselves and

62
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,840
when we hate parts of ourselves we

63
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:43,679
can't really train ourselves we can't really learn it's harder to train

64
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:49,919
ourselves when we have this kind of moralistic idea

65
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:55,519
of what it is to be human and

66
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:02,559
one element of equanimity is becoming uh non-moralistic

67
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:07,679
about experience and

68
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:14,080
i've always remembered that teacher's sharing that one of the the kind of

69
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:20,880
honorific names for the buddha was uh the unexcelled trainer of the animal

70
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:27,600
within the human uh this uh path of practice is very much

71
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:34,480
about our status as animals embodied

72
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:42,480
and the kind of um vulnerability of that

73
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:49,840
so in in in neuroscience there's um [Music]

74
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:55,679
there's a model model of the brain as

75
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:02,080
basically a hypothesis testing organ yeah

76
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:08,320
you make a hypothesis you do the experiment you get the data

77
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,839
you revise the view and this is very

78
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:20,480
different this idea of the brain as a prediction machine as a hypothesis

79
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,919
testing organ this is different from the normal

80
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:31,760
stimulus response there's a sound i have a response

81
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:39,280
in this way of thinking this approach um we're not really reflecting the world as

82
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,760
it is we're it's more like we're testing hypotheses about now

83
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,878
based on what happens next yeah

84
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:58,560
like we're constantly generating and testing predictions

85
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:07,520
and then adjusting based on the feedback and so in in a way our very sense of now

86
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:13,838
of what's happening now depends on what happens next

87
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:21,680
so to make a concrete like is this sensation in my knee is this just a

88
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:28,079
harmless ache or a sign of tissue damage of injury

89
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:34,400
well have to see what's next make a hypothesis

90
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:40,079
see what's next and

91
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:47,440
from this perspective perception is a

92
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:55,119
is a process of optimizing beliefs

93
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:00,160
about the causes of my knee sensations

94
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,800
and the driving concern in all of this

95
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:18,000
the knee sensation or the sound the driving concern in all of this as

96
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,359
animals is safety protection

97
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:27,839
very innocent longing

98
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:35,200
and the scientist k

99
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:42,880
tai she says um just made this kind of offhand comment she said like fear

100
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:50,160
fear has an authoritarian command over the rest of the brain

101
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,359
yeah fear has an authoritarian command over

102
00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:02,000
the rest of the brain this this longing to be protected to be

103
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,119
safe yeah and this way in which where

104
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:12,880
we're figuring out the present based on what happens next

105
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,800
making predictions testing them gathering the data revising minimizing

106
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:25,520
our errors and so maybe you have a question like why why

107
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:31,839
am i talking about this uh well

108
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:36,960
i'm talking about it because it gives us an actual sense of

109
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:43,920
the power and the gravitational pull of the future

110
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:52,320
and so we say you know just relax into the present or the shirt

111
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:58,400
that says be present yeah and it sounds simple um

112
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,760
but um [Music] it's actually

113
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:09,280
very uh quite radical yeah to be present it's an act

114
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,560
of letting go to really be present

115
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:20,560
because in some sense to to be present

116
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:27,359
is to be open to that vulnerability

117
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:35,440
to our mortality to be undefended against the future

118
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:43,839
to begin to put down some of this habit of generating

119
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:51,280
hypotheses about the next moment the next moment

120
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:02,400
we we don't always recognize yet to be

121
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,240
open to the present moment this is like a

122
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:14,800
profoundly unguarded state there's a dignity in it and a power and as we'll

123
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:22,400
see a safety in it but it is a profoundly unguarded state

124
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,520
and in this mix as we're trying to

125
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:34,720
ensure our safety in this mix

126
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:41,280
as we're modeling our inner world trying to understand

127
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:48,640
what does this mean inside me what does this sensation mean what does that mean in all of this

128
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:55,440
maybe the most important signal the most important

129
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,440
that has the most salience is something like pain

130
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:10,760
something unexpected something unpleasant and so we get very preoccupied with pain

131
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:17,680
and because it it seems to mean a lot

132
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:24,680
and it gets us moving into this mode of what is this hypothesizing

133
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,240
checking this moment against the next moment

134
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:39,119
and so all of this is to say is that equanimity is vital if we're to step out

135
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:45,760
of this loop of preoccupation with the next moment

136
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:56,560
to actually for the heart not to be spun by pain

137
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:04,160
for us not to over interpret pain you know like often

138
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:10,880
it just pain means too much to us we over interpret it yeah

139
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:17,920
because we're animals because we're patrolling our borders because we are

140
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,280
surveilling yeah to see is everything okay

141
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:30,319
and um and so even little pains you know little bits of dukkha

142
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:36,160
feel as i was saying yesterday they feel like these freak accidents

143
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:43,920
rather than just woven into the fabric of our universe the fabric of our biology

144
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,800
and so we become so vigilant

145
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:56,720
and equanimity with pain creates a deeper

146
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:03,440
sense of safety we're not tracking

147
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,480
threats in the same way our vigilance starts to let down the

148
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,280
belly gets soft

149
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:22,240
experience feels less dense and we settle into the moment in a more

150
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:27,359
profound way a way that feels

151
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:34,160
nourishing and the waves the waves of pain or

152
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:42,400
discomfort the signals of threat rise up the contraction or the

153
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:49,200
pressures the tingling the sharpness the dullness all of this rises up

154
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:56,160
and then that itself brings on a kind of cascade of emotion

155
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:04,160
and then the mind goes scrambling what is this what do i do what can i do what does this mean about now what does this

156
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,920
mean about me what does this mean about the trajectory of my life

157
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:16,560
and we just bring it all down into the present moment

158
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,318
with this equanimous heart

159
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:31,040
even um even small pains can create a sense of desperation when

160
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:39,040
we really look yeah just this this itch on my face

161
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:44,480
we can sense the builds into a certain kind of

162
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:51,359
desperation and so we stay

163
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:58,240
we we feel our way through it we keep

164
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:04,240
our chest open we breathe we breathe into it

165
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:10,400
yeah we rest in the the triple gem

166
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:20,280
we have confidence in this buddhist path and we open to the whole body

167
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:29,760
and as this kind of the momentum of equanimity builds

168
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:35,760
this makes us less afraid less preoccupied with the

169
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:42,880
future and we start to settle into the present

170
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:50,640
moment a moment that um that doesn't feel sandwiched between

171
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:57,680
past and future some kinds of present feel like

172
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,960
the you know sandwiched yeah

173
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:08,880
i was that here's what it where we are and this is coming next

174
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:16,240
as we develop equanimity we don't feel uh sandwiched in that way

175
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:23,440
yeah we drop into a deeper kind of presence and

176
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:29,440
totally exposed but

177
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:36,799
the equanimity creating a sense of of refuge

178
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:44,720
so i offer this for your consideration

179
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:50,560
and that's good to think of you

180
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:56,800
out there all the places and uh

181
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:04,319
look forward to uh to being being together tomorrow continuing the theme

182
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:10,359
so yeah thank you all
