1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:06,120
some many of you have been practicing for quite some time I can kind of tell

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:12,440
right by how quiet the room was uh during the sit that was very nice thank you

3
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,119
and so you might not remember but at the

4
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:25,500
beginning of our practice and maybe this still arises but in the beginning of practice it sometimes feels like our

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,019
difficulties are getting worse like we started this practice thinking it's

6
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:38,719
going to make things better and yet we start noticing all these Troublesome

7
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,920
experiences and things that aren't quite right and

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,620
so it seems like our suffering is actually increasing

9
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,379
and part of us recognizes that because with practice we are no longer hiding

10
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:01,500
from the difficulties no longer hiding from ourselves

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,780
no longer like constantly distracting ourselves with a

12
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:15,180
whenever something uncomfortable arises you know just trying to do whatever we can to not experience it

13
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:23,580
and of course a big part of mindfulness practice is also learning to become tuned in and maybe more sensitive to

14
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:31,140
what it is that we're experiencing you know all of our experiences not just the pleasant ones

15
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:38,880
so for all of these reasons sometimes in the beginning of practice and maybe this continues with practice too we start to

16
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,200
feel like wow there's a lot of stuff here that doesn't feel so great

17
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,079
maybe you know I did have somebody a student say to me ignorance was Bliss

18
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:59,880
because I just didn't see some of this like maybe the deeper difficulties and you it's true right

19
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,840
when we practice we start to see things that we hadn't seen before

20
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:14,640
and not only that and this is true with anything any Endeavor we want to do

21
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,879
if we want to learn to sew and we get the fabric together in the sewing machine if we're using the sewing

22
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,920
machine and we start to see like oh my goodness it's so hard to get the lines

23
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,620
that go straight and the tension right and let alone reading a pattern or anything like this right

24
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:39,060
so we just start to notice oh all the ways in which sewing is difficult

25
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,220
so of course in the way in which we practice and if we have this idea that

26
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:50,280
we want to have more freedom more ease we just start to notice everything that

27
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:58,080
isn't Freedom we start to notice everything that isn't ease

28
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,980
this just naturally happens whenever we're trying to learn something new or we have a

29
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:11,220
expectation or a goal or a direction in which we're headed of course we notice that everything that

30
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:20,900
seems to be going wrong that's preventing us from going that direction or achieving that goal

31
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,459
so we start to see some of our limitations Maybe

32
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:34,019
some of our for in meditation practice maybe some of our fears start to come up or some of

33
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:40,640
these inner conflicts that we might have or confusion or

34
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,940
sensitivities that we might have so then

35
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:54,480
we might when that when this arises when these things arise of course

36
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,879
we fall into some of the habits that humans have when they meet some of these

37
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:07,680
difficulties blame it's got to be somebody's fault

38
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:16,320
sometimes it's our own fault and we have a whole story of somehow why we are inadequate or if only we could do X Y

39
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,520
and Z better if only we had ABC experiences right the list is endless

40
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:30,419
we blame ourselves or we blame others right right well we right we have a whole like

41
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:36,000
media is all about who can we blame right there's so much kind of like

42
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,300
societal support and pressure for just let's just blame somebody

43
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:49,020
let's just blame somebody and that kind of like distracts us from the discomfort of when we see

44
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:57,620
frailties or fears or sensitivities that we have

45
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:06,240
maybe we don't we have the sense of frustration or maybe I don't need to go into all these long lists I think many

46
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,340
of us are familiar with them without my having to list all of them

47
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:18,360
but just this recognition that we might have some difficulties maybe it's we have an idea of how we want our life to

48
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:26,100
be or who the person we think we want to be then we see a gap

49
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:32,699
between how our life is or how we are feels uncomfortable

50
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:41,340
maybe we blame somebody and then we don't even notice like the blaming itself is uncomfortable this

51
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,919
first maybe it feels good right we get to have this righteous indignation and

52
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:53,759
how dare they and I can't believe it and they should have done this and but then we're not

53
00:05:53,759 --> 00:06:00,139
noticing as to like how our hearts and our minds are just getting smaller and smaller and

54
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:07,080
constricted and there's no Freedom there you set up a me versus you US versus

55
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,319
them and that's not where the freedom is

56
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:20,940
so of course when we discover that things are uncomfortable man it just starts all over again well

57
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:28,500
just this uh uncomfortable feeling we have this reaction trying to push them away get rid of them or just go distract

58
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,780
ourselves and have some other pleasant experience

59
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:42,680
laughs so difficulties part of the human experience of course

60
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,880
and maybe we can make a gross generalization and say that there's two

61
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:54,419
types two types of difficulties and this recognition that every life every human

62
00:06:54,419 --> 00:07:02,880
life without exception has periods when there are a lot of difficulties no exceptions we all think and hope that

63
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,180
our life will be but it's not the case and so

64
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:15,360
two types when we have these periods of difficulties or seasons of difficulties

65
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,900
one we might say is some difficulties are clearly problems that need to be

66
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:29,478
solved so there's something we can do and we fix them

67
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:36,740
maybe there's some situations that call for some compassionate

68
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:44,039
I had anemia for quite some time and I just didn't know

69
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:49,440
it wasn't you know until blood tests I don't remember exactly what the occasion

70
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:57,479
was and like oh Diana you are anemic like oh that explains a whole lot

71
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:03,539
okay I can take iron supplements this is a problem you know there's a

72
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:10,139
solution and this is what I do I take iron supplements right so there's those kind of problems that are kind of

73
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:16,160
straightforward and maybe aren't too complicated and there's some action that we can do

74
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,159
but many of our problems aren't like that

75
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,900
so many of them are some of what I've been pointing to are problems that were

76
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:34,620
unknowingly creating for ourselves don't mean to

77
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:40,339
of course not but maybe there's this way in which we're

78
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:48,120
insisting or struggling or wrestling with life and demanding that it be different than how

79
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,420
it is that's painful

80
00:08:54,180 --> 00:09:01,320
it's uh can be never-ending this trying to

81
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:08,519
make things be different than how they are in this way in which we're kind of like shoving things aside and

82
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:15,540
insisting that things be different or maybe there's a way in which I kind

83
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:22,260
of getting so caught up in our point of view and not seeing the bigger picture or not

84
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:29,060
seeing the harm that we're causing ourselves let alone that which were causing others

85
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,839
okay so I talked about some difficulties maybe maybe it'd be helpful to talk

86
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,800
about what can we do

87
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:47,880
the Buddhist you know uh for Noble Truth the first is there is suffering

88
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:54,899
so sometimes it's just to recognize okay what are some of these difficulties that we are creating for ourselves partly by

89
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:59,779
insisting that things be different than how they are

90
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:10,700
so one is we can find Freedom

91
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,380
in the midst of the difficulties of Our Lives

92
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:22,860
I know for a long time I had this idea like okay my life is going to be better as soon as you know all these other

93
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:28,080
things are taken care of or okay I'll be able to meditate properly as soon as I'm

94
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:35,640
no longer Restless or tired or filled with desire or filled with the aversion or don't have any confusion

95
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:41,580
soon as this as soon as that and then you know

96
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:46,800
of course those situations don't arise so often

97
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,320
we try right we are trying to create all the conditions so that we finally can

98
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:59,220
meditate or find Freedom but we don't have to wait

99
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:05,360
in fact it's such a for me it was such a radical uh turning point in my practice

100
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,860
and part of it was when I was helping gilfron still guilt probably all of you

101
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:17,519
know who he is um create this book called unhindered and

102
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:25,079
it's about the hindrances and I have to kind of create that book and edit it and so much the whole book

103
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:30,480
essentially is about how to be with difficulties

104
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,880
and the answer was if I can sum up this book

105
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:42,899
just be mindful of them as best we can

106
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:48,540
but this openness and spaciousness so

107
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:54,660
we can just bring awareness to our difficulties I'm not saying this is easy

108
00:11:54,660 --> 00:12:00,120
because right I've went through all this beginning of this talk talking about how we're trying to push things away and we

109
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:07,260
don't want to see them and we're trying to make them be different but this mindfulness practice kind of

110
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:12,920
like bringing our attention back to our breath again and again and again

111
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:21,240
quickly the practice that we need to help not turn away from difficulties

112
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:29,360
to help us be with them as best we can as best we can

113
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:36,120
so it's often we have this idea there's only two ways to be with practices or be

114
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,880
with our problems is to suppress them and deny them or try to insist that they

115
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:48,480
be different or this maybe there's this or maybe I could

116
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:55,620
say sometimes we have this idea where you should like just all our difficulties yell and express

117
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:02,220
them and you know make sure that everybody knows how

118
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:08,399
unfair or it seems to us or angry but this is pointing to this third one that

119
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:14,880
this third alternative for being with our difficulties and there's this story that Jack

120
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,100
cornfield tells in one of his books that I really like

121
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:27,240
and it goes it's about the poison tree so this poison tree a tree tree that has

122
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:33,899
like poison fruit and Jack in his book tells this story I don't know if he created this story or

123
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:41,700
if it's he got it from somewhere else but that when some people when they first discover this tree they see oh my gosh

124
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:48,360
this is really dangerous this is really dangerous this poison

125
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:54,480
so we've got we better cut down this tree before anybody gets hurt

126
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:01,200
so they get out the chainsaws and cut it down and this often is our

127
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:08,339
initial response to difficulties like we got to get rid of it and we're trying to create whatever way that we can and so

128
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:14,880
it's too difficult I difficulties I talked I'm sorry two approaches that I talked about just a moment earlier is

129
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:21,060
either deny or repress it or let everybody know about them you know so

130
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:26,519
often they're using one of these two approaches with this poison tree

131
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:32,040
but there's some other people that have maybe journeyed a little bit further

132
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:40,019
along this spiritual path And when they see this poison tree they realize oh

133
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:45,180
let's not cut it down and said let's let's take care of the

134
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:52,320
tree take care of ourselves take care of others let's put a fence around it

135
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,899
and we'll just protect people we'll allow it to this poison tree to be there

136
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:03,540
and but we'll just protect ourselves and maybe that this is a compassionate way

137
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:09,180
to be with the difficulties or to be with the poison and so this

138
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:15,000
in some ways is a profound shift in art practice instead of I've got to get rid

139
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,120
of it to like no no it's okay it can be there and we'll just kind of like build a

140
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,839
little fence around it but then there's a third type of person

141
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:34,019
maybe he's gone even a little bit further in their spiritual path and they

142
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:40,459
see this poison tree and they go ah a half stick here's a poison tree

143
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:46,740
exactly what I needed it's perfect just what I was looking for and they take out

144
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:52,440
the fruit and they work with it and they use turn it into take the poison maybe

145
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:58,100
extract it and add it to some other things and they turn it into medicine

146
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:03,720
some things that can be helpful huffle for themselves and helpful for

147
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,360
others as an aside I'll say maybe this is

148
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:17,399
probably the reason why I like this story is that back when I was a biochemist at one of

149
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:26,100
the Laboratories down the whole they were working with Cobra Venom Factor as they were taking a cobra Venom

150
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:32,940
and extracting one particular kind of like the active ingredient and we're using it and did turned it into medicine

151
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:40,500
that can help people so this is you know this is sometimes what people do

152
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:47,820
but is there a way in which when we see poison fruit that we can pick the fruit

153
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:55,399
maybe not eat it but investigate it look at it look at it its properties and

154
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:02,459
treat it with respect and some understanding and use this as a way to find more

155
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:08,360
freedom for ourselves and maybe we can help others too

156
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:16,140
so what are some ways in which we can maybe get a little bit more tangible or practical

157
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:22,740
about how can we pick these poison fruits quote unquote and

158
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,558
help them to be medicine and support for our practice

159
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:34,020
some of you might know that here at Mcgill and Tanya Weiser they came up

160
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:39,960
with this acronym r-a-f-t raft

161
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,960
something that can help us cross over some choppy Waters something that can help us get to the other side where

162
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:54,380
freedom is so r recognize what's happening

163
00:17:54,660 --> 00:18:01,919
this is a poison fruit this is a difficulty this is a difficult emotion

164
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,760
this is not what I wish what were happening

165
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:14,760
but is there a way that we can bring mindfulness to the experience

166
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:20,340
this is sadness and it feels like this

167
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:26,340
this is loneliness and it feels like this this is anger

168
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:31,919
and it feels like this sometimes just recognizing and even

169
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:39,900
using the label is hopeful because then we're not tangled up with it as much

170
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:46,200
there's a way in which there's a little bit more distance between ourselves and the experience

171
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:51,240
there's also a way in which when we label it or give it a name and just say

172
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:57,539
okay this is you know what I don't even know what this is but I feel out of

173
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:03,980
sorts and it feels like this there's a way in which there's a

174
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:09,840
honoring and respecting our experience honoring and respecting ourselves

175
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:17,039
instead of like being dismissive like we often are or instead of like blaming others or blaming ourselves

176
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:23,820
but just to recognize this uncomfortable experiences here

177
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:29,600
and of course this is the first Noble Truth there is suffering

178
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,580
this this second letter A is for allow is there a way that we can make space

179
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:44,280
for what is already here it's already here we're already

180
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:50,280
experiencing it is there a way that we can allow it to

181
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:56,100
be here kind of soften the pushing away

182
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:01,140
that we habitually do this is what humans do of

183
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:08,220
course we do we want to push away what's uncomfortable and there's a way that this kind of allowing

184
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:14,220
even the intention to allow is a way that we can interrupt the momentum this

185
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,559
habitual momentum of push things away

186
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:24,660
there's also a way in which mindfulness you know just recognizing being present

187
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:31,919
for it and allowing it as best we can as best we can there's a way in which it

188
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:38,520
can have a restraining quality maybe restraining is too strong of a

189
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:44,280
word so we like I kind of want to point you that's kind of like interrupting the

190
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:50,640
momentum so stopping the flow of some

191
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:57,200
maybe like some emotional experiences for example like anger

192
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:04,200
so is there a way that we can rather than

193
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:11,400
having this nature creaction of getting rid of it maybe we could just ask ourselves is

194
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:17,779
this something that really needs to be dealt with right now

195
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:23,780
is this something that needs a response right now

196
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:29,340
that we can allow it to be there and by allowing it to be

197
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:34,980
there we can understand it better if we want to work with something if we

198
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:43,700
wanted something to shift in our lives some difficulty it helps to understand it better

199
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:53,460
there's a way that also is kind of respecting ourselves respecting this is

200
00:21:53,460 --> 00:22:00,539
what's happening and I I have the capacity to hold it in such a way that maybe I can

201
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:06,840
understand it have a little bit better

202
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:12,600
understanding of what this experience is like what are the conditions that help

203
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:19,940
it arise what does it feel like

204
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,720
when we come into contact with and allowing this experience and maybe feeling it is

205
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:34,158
maybe some compassion arises depression arises for ourselves

206
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:41,640
this warm-hearted feeling this warm-hearted recognition of yeah this is suffering this is difficult

207
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:47,640
that's coupled with a with this warm-hearted wish for it to be different

208
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:53,580
and this wish for it to be different is not the same as shoving it away it's

209
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:58,519
more compassion is this more warm-hearted quality

210
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:04,140
so allowing allows us to understand it respecting ourselves respecting their

211
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:12,419
experience some compassion to arise and allowing it increases our capacity

212
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:18,240
to be with difficulties this is definitely something that's a

213
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:26,700
skill that we have to train with it's natural that we don't want to be

214
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:32,760
with difficulties so it's a skill that we can train

215
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:38,059
we might ask well why would we want to train with something like that

216
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:44,100
guaranteed that in our lives there will be difficulties that

217
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:48,559
do not quickly and maybe never end

218
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:58,580
people that we care about people that we love have illness or die

219
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:05,520
we have illness or die we will die

220
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:12,419
we don't know when and we don't know how maybe there's you know world events that

221
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:17,840
we have no control over and just really affect us

222
00:24:18,659 --> 00:24:24,960
so there will be large difficulties in our lives that we can't control so

223
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:31,140
just practicing with some of these simple ones learning how to allow even

224
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:38,159
the minor irritations that arise when person in front of you that's driving is

225
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:45,000
going way too slow when the line at the grocery store is

226
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,539
going away too slow when the person nearby is talking way

227
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:58,140
too loud on their phone this these mild irritations is fantastic

228
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:04,320
place to practice okay this is an irritation

229
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:11,059
and it I'm going to just allow this irritation to be here as best I can

230
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:17,960
r a f feel in the body

231
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:25,740
to the somatic experience of this often frustration anger sadness

232
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:31,260
loneliness all these things there's a lot of stories associated with them and

233
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:38,279
there's a lot of like we might say baggage associated with them my kind of and it's easy to do we of

234
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:44,580
course it is kind of get lost in the conceptual worlds or we kind of like generalize

235
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:51,200
like this is terrible and it's always going to be terrible and I'm always going to feel like this

236
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,580
and the best way to interrupt that to kind of cut the

237
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:02,940
stream or cut the cord or I don't know what the expression is stop the Train on

238
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:08,640
the tracks is to feel it in the body there's

239
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,860
frustration and it feels like this maybe my foot is tapping or maybe there's my

240
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:20,778
shoulders are going up towards my ears because I just want it to be different dang it

241
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:28,260
there's sadness and it feels like this of this real heaviness in the shoulders and the

242
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:33,419
maybe this knot in the stomach or the lump in the throat

243
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:39,299
for all of us it's different we don't all have a physical

244
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:44,899
association with these emotions aren't always the same

245
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:50,820
sometimes we're not even aware of what the bodily experience is

246
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:56,039
physiologists tell us that there are physical experiences that accompany

247
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:03,120
emotions so this is part of mindfulness practice is just to tune in and to be able to

248
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:09,120
experience them and it's a way to maybe stop the swirling

249
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:15,919
that's associated with difficulties and to just feel them in the body

250
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:24,500
and there's this way that by bringing them into the body that interrupts the flow

251
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:31,740
and by interrupting the flow you know the train of thoughts or the swirling that might happen there's a way

252
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:37,620
in which we kind of like keep the experience we might even say in check

253
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:44,159
so it's not continuing to snowball into getting something bigger and bigger

254
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:51,960
and Tom Jeff right he writes that getting to know the emotion including

255
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,840
the bodily experience is a like trying to know the currents of a

256
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,860
river like that this emotions do have this you know this momentum

257
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:10,200
and so even though like the surface may seem Placid and calm

258
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:16,679
of this emotion when we start to feel it in the body and

259
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:22,559
then we can flicker interrupting the the flow that happens

260
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:29,520
in the mind then we start to notice oh for a river we don't know how strong the

261
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:36,360
bottom currents are until we try to Dam it and then we kind of bring the awareness

262
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:41,640
to the body have like want to interrupt the flow of

263
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:47,520
the emotion then we really start to see oh there is a real strong momentum and

264
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:53,340
there my all of a sudden all this rationalization might start to arise

265
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:58,860
so bring it into the body not only interrupts the flow but it might also

266
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:06,020
make it more clear like what are some of the ways in which we

267
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:11,760
on some of the underlying maybe experiences that are supporting this

268
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,260
emotion for example

269
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:24,179
so RAF recognize allow feel in the body

270
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:30,360
tea to tease apart The Experience we're having the

271
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:35,940
difficult to experience from the reaction to the difficult experience we

272
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:42,299
might be filled with anger and then we don't want to think of ourselves as an angry person so we have aversion to the

273
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:48,539
anger and this aversion in some ways is getting all tangled up with the anger and it's kind of like

274
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:55,380
fueling the anger this is so common

275
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:02,460
so common in my role as a retreat teacher often when practitioners come in

276
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:08,460
they're sharing how things are going in their practice whether on Retreats you know they're seeing new things they're

277
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:14,580
understanding themselves better their mind and their bodies are getting settled

278
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:21,299
but often they don't see it's not so easy to see like okay there's the aversion we can

279
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:28,140
see that but often we don't see the second beat the aversion to the aversion

280
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:35,820
or the third beat the aversion to the aversion to the aversion so is there a way that we can tease

281
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:40,860
apart and often it's aversion to whatever we

282
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:48,179
are feeling and this aversion is a way of Tangled that kind of um fuels and allows the whatever it is

283
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:55,158
to happen whatever difficulty emotion we're experiencing to continue

284
00:30:55,799 --> 00:31:02,100
often what we don't see too the way that we might actually like the

285
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:09,419
difficulty in some kind of way that's certainly not clear to us at the beginning but

286
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:14,480
we might notice that there's something about feeling

287
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:21,899
enraged feeling angry that we kind of like makes it feel powerful and

288
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:27,240
makes us feel like we have a purpose and we have this gives us license to say and

289
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:34,380
do whatever we want because we're angry we're not noticing now what it how

290
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:41,960
taxiness is and what a toll it takes not on us but on those people around us

291
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:47,399
so we're not noticing the aversion and we're not noticing the way in which we

292
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:55,980
might like it or there might be a way in which we're feeling like really uh greedy want more I need more I need more

293
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:02,640
and but there might be the way in which we actually feel attracted to not only

294
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,399
the object of whatever we're lusting after wanting greedy for

295
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:14,700
but there's this way in which we feel attracted to the feeling of really

296
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:19,980
wanting something because it distracts us from something

297
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:26,279
else or again it gives us a purpose or gives us a direction I need this okay I

298
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:32,520
just have to get this and we're not noticing how

299
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:39,840
this constricts our lives there isn't Freedom there when we just feel compelled to go after something

300
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:47,100
or the same way with anxiety maybe we of course you know nobody's

301
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:52,559
going to say they want anxiety but maybe there's a part of us that believes that

302
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:57,960
okay if I just worry enough I can make this problem go away maybe

303
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,600
this is like underneath we don't it's not clearly in our minds but

304
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:10,919
we might lose to get rid of this belief that worry isn't helpful because

305
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:17,880
we don't know what is helpful we don't want this uncomfortableness to

306
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:23,820
be there so

307
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:30,899
to work with some of these difficulties raft recognize allow feel in the body

308
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:37,260
and T support the experience from our reaction to the experience

309
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:42,539
I'm offering these in this order because it makes a nice acronym

310
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:49,200
doesn't mean we have to do this in this order we start Where We Are

311
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:55,019
maybe we've already recognized and we're just allowing or

312
00:33:55,019 --> 00:34:02,399
maybe we're just filling a lot of aversion and we just are teasing apart like oh yeah this is a version and I

313
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:07,159
have a version to this aversion or whatever it might be

314
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:13,740
but there is a way in which we can take these poison fruit

315
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:22,158
and turn them into medicine I'm not saying this is easy

316
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:29,280
I'm not saying this is fast I'm not saying this is a linear path

317
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:35,240
do step one two three and you'll be finished

318
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:40,800
but I think you wouldn't trust these teachings too if I were to say oh just

319
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:49,740
do this and everything will be fine easy peasy right I think we know this

320
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:54,780
from life that undo habits

321
00:34:54,780 --> 00:35:02,520
to undo some lifelong beliefs to undo what societal Society pressures

322
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:08,160
us to do not easy not fast

323
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:15,780
but it's possible it's possible and maybe it's not as

324
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,040
difficult as you think

325
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:26,060
maybe it just starts with a mindfulness practice

326
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,800
just being aware of what our experience is

327
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:39,599
starts there start Where We Are and I can start with that simple that

328
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:45,900
simple so I think I'll open it up to some

329
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:53,960
questions or comments if everybody has something that they'd like to say or

330
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:16,800
hi Diana I

331
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:25,280
really appreciate you talked about the raft again I heard several times

332
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:31,320
but every time I heard it is there different

333
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:36,900
reaction I have today is so clear

334
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:44,540
that everything makes sense but before I get to the last one

335
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:51,359
I want to tease apart but a lot of time

336
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:58,440
like you said the version the version of the Virgin the third aversion

337
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:05,339
it's like really fast slip and slope it's just few happened at

338
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:10,680
all at once so when look at that

339
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:16,500
usually I'm just it looks so solid it's just one thing

340
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:24,180
you know I I don't know what would be the skill to tease it apart

341
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:31,020
for example um this is probably not a good example but

342
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:37,500
one thing I'm struggling with is after the retreat

343
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:44,400
I realized my life had so much leakage of the time

344
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:51,180
you know so much leakage yeah it just suddenly the time is gone

345
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:56,280
but because of doing things mindlessly

346
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:02,280
then I thought well there's a fine line

347
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,380
do I treat my life as a project of improvement

348
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:13,800
or I really have a purpose I want to have a

349
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:22,160
dedicate most of the time as much as I can something I think it is

350
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:29,520
towards my life you know there's a fine line there

351
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:36,960
so so to tease it apart

352
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,838
again I don't know how to tease that apart

353
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:50,640
so you don't know how to tease apart so there's a fine line between your life as a it says you're leaking

354
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:56,820
time and that the uh it's a self-improvement project right that kind

355
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:02,579
of idea and it wasn't quite clear to me what the other part was

356
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:09,119
other part is whenever I have ideal situation like in the retreat

357
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:15,119
see my life is so clear you know I know what I want to do

358
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:22,800
I know what I shouldn't do in my daily life what I don't want to

359
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,740
waste time on I see that when I come back home

360
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:37,079
I would fall back to that then I don't want to represent myself

361
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:43,500
to harshly because I still have to live I see

362
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:49,020
yeah so while on Retreat you have some clarity and some inspiration and

363
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:54,359
motivation and then when you come back after you've been off a retreat for a while

364
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:59,820
then like what what happened how can I keep this clarity

365
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:05,240
yeah right this is a great question

366
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:21,960
so you were talking you said about teasing apart so to tease apart

367
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:30,300
I didn't I'm sure I understood to tease apart the what was hap your the leakage of time or

368
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:35,960
and and your wish for to be

369
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:40,579
using your time to as a support for practice

370
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:49,500
I would say you're going to teasing part anytime we're teasing apart

371
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:56,280
if it feels like oh wait this is too complicated I don't know I'm getting I can't figure this out I don't understand

372
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:02,579
then we could just say oh frustration it feels like this

373
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:09,119
instead of having to tease it apart we just say oh we could recognize and allow

374
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:16,800
frustration or recognize and allow disappointment recognize and allow confusion or

375
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,640
something like this and then there you are right in the practice again

376
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:31,079
and of course you know life outside of retreat isn't the same

377
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:37,980
as on Retreat right we want to we want to have some of the same benefits or yeah yeah

378
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:42,619
so helpful yeah thank you Lydia thank you

379
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:50,400
just wanted to share a joke I'm used to rain yeah for dealing with

380
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:56,400
the five hindrances yeah I'm not is it raft or is it rained and then I thought maybe it could just

381
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:02,240
be rafting rafting rafting

382
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:09,480

387
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,980
nice thank you

388
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:49,200
thank you hi thank you for the talk

389
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:56,220
um so I like the idea of raft and I've in

390
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:03,780
cultivating my my own mindfulness practice I do a lot of sort of inner exploration and things related to Raft which is

391
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:11,760
helpful um I also recognize the sort of therapeutic value of like

392
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:19,440
venting at times or sharing and I kind of heard elements of that in like the types

393
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,480
of people who tell everyone about the poison tree like maybe I'm not gonna

394
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,359
turn it into medicine but I'm gonna tell everybody about it to keep them safe and

395
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:36,960
I just recently I've had a hard time I've I've like felt this desire to sort of like

396
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:43,200
not quite shout my problems from a rooftop but you know sort of share or

397
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:49,140
like put them outward and not explore inward as much on my own but I also know

398
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:54,960
that there's like a there's like a healthy balance like Sangha is important and and support

399
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,359
and so just any words or ideas on sort of balancing this

400
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:06,540
inward light and then outward yeah yeah Dynamic here are some ideas and I

401
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:12,300
appreciate that you said that uh Sangha is important and sometimes we do connect kind of like with our shared

402
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:18,000
vulnerabilities right if we said like here's some difficulty that I have and it allows us to connect with others and

403
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,599
allows for some intimacy there's there's some release so yes and there's some release also

404
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:31,260
right and maybe others have you know some even just being recognized by others can be really supportive

405
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:38,420
but I think the Buddhist teachings are pointing to that just uh

406
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:45,780
allowing or let's say there's a recognition that we have habits of mind

407
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:53,220
and that if we feed habits of mine they're just always going to stay so there's value also in interrupting them

408
00:44:53,220 --> 00:45:00,540
as we can so the Buddhist teachings would be opposite then of some go into

409
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:06,480
like there's some therapeutic uh modalities that suggest going into a

410
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:13,140
room and like hit pillows or something like this they're saying oh actually you're just increasing the amount of

411
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:18,900
Rage or whatever it is is happening so and that's not connecting with another

412
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:24,300
person that's just venting you know or something like that so they would make a

413
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:30,300
a distinction is this helpful yeah um and so when you say habit of mind

414
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:37,920
that that some people may have this habit of Mind of this desire to share their problems that's what I understood

415
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:43,740
or no I was thinking about a habit of Mind of like being angry and so if we're

416
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:49,380
just always expressing the anger her then we're just fueling The Habit to be

417
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:54,839
angry it's just easier and easier to be angry if we're always expressing it and

418
00:45:54,839 --> 00:46:02,220
that's but sharing it with somebody else or you know connecting with somebody else about this is not it that would be

419
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:09,240
um not that's different you're talking about the anger you're not being angry

420
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:16,339
towards somebody yeah right yeah thank you thank you

421
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:23,280
okay so we're at the top of the hour so thank you thank you for your kind

422
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,140
attention and for your practice

423
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:37,020

424
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:40,579
