1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:07,680
oh okay all right formally started

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,599
so hi welcome to happy hour

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,480
lovely to be with you after two weeks of being away and on retreat and practicing

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,359
and and um yeah i'm i'm happy my heart is at peace i missed

5
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:34,880
you i was glad to be gone and i'm glad to be back so so for today's practice

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:41,520
um so many themes so many things i've been sitting in and thinking oh this is what

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,800
i can bring to happy hour this so so instead of overloading us with various practices

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:54,879
i want to offer actually something that is inspired from from the the holiday

9
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:01,600
that's celebrated today in the us if you're in the u.s today is memorial day a day of

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,720
honoring remembering those who have dedicated their efforts

11
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:15,520
their lives and for for

12
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,600
for us in this way so so to make it more personal i wanted to invite us to actually

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,439
consider doing this method stepping into another dimension we usually do it with people

14
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,560
who are alive here and there sometimes we we do meta

15
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:40,640
with those who have passed away and canonically canonically uh

16
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,600
practice of meta uh it is said that it is best not to do it with people who have

17
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,000
passed away for two reasons and i'll tell you and then i'll tell you why we're going to kind of change away

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
from that so canonically it can bring up grief if if it's very fresh if if the

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,600
challenge is very new so if one is new to the practice to avoid

20
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,440
someone who's passed away the second reason canotically one stays away from

21
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:21,840
someone who's deceased passed away is because the practice of meta loving kindness is

22
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,959
also a concentration practice where the mind can get very still and can get

23
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:33,360
into absorption what's called states of absorption stillness and it is said that if your

24
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,519
object of love is someone who's deceased the mind doesn't get absorbed can still

25
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,800
have a lot of love and really a lot of cultivation happens

26
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:52,400
but that aspect of absorption with jhanas will not happen so

27
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,360
classically in in for the you know for those who are interested in the visual maga and you know the abidama

28
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,760
those teachings that's why it is that avoid people someone who's passed away however

29
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:13,040
um someone who's been on our lives who we're indebted to we feel love for and there

30
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,959
isn't much grief there's just a sense of love there's a sense of love

31
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,959
so so the invitation if that is available to you and if not then choose someone who's alive for you who you feel

32
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,319
indebted for but this being memorial day we're going to step into our memory

33
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:36,480
we're going to step into another dimension of goodness another demand another

34
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:43,920
dimension which is again when we what i mean by that is when we do meta usually like may you be

35
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,200
healthy may you be well it's the sense of here and now this

36
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:56,159
physical being where has entry into a dimension of oh just sharing love sharing love as goodness

37
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:02,640
as gratitude as generosity as appreciation so this that's what i mean by this other

38
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:09,599
dimension it's not so much physical it's just a gift of generosity gift of the heart

39
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,439
and who knows maybe who feel in this dimension there it's bi-directional it's not just one

40
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:21,040
directional of giving love but one of our receiving love

41
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:27,199
being loved from the beyonds so exploring spoil it's all about a

42
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:35,040
cultivation of good will love and and seeing the

43
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,600
finding or meeting discovering aspects of

44
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:49,840
our heart are experienced that maybe we're not familiar with yet

45
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,960
and it looks like my camera just failed okay let's try that again

46
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,960
let's unhook and re-hook so seems like after two weeks of being away

47
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:08,880
there's some technical glitches okay let's try that again here we go oh well all good so

48
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,919
tell you what let's start our practice while i figure out this this problem so let's get into our

49
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:22,880
meditation posture there we go let's get into our meditation posture

50
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:32,320
ah and landing landing landing into our bodies

51
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,879
landing in this moment

52
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:53,840
landing into our hearts

53
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,840
landing into a breath

54
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:35,520
letting go letting go of words of thoughts landing into

55
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,840
silence

56
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:16,080
allowing the rhythm of the breath

57
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:23,199
flowing flowing on its own flowing in and out on its own

58
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,520
letting the flow the rhythm of the breath

59
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:45,840
be calming soothing

60
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,560
nothing to do nowhere to go

61
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,160
but just to sit and be breathed

62
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,840
for a few minutes

63
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,920
so

64
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:05,839
the in-breath the outer lower abdomen

65
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:17,120
as if the whole body is being breathed and with each breath

66
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:25,120
getting calmer settling settling more deeply settling

67
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:33,839
[Music] landing

68
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,279
melting arriving the thoughts

69
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,839
sadly

70
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:16,480
and if you find the mind is wandering getting agitated it's okay it's all

71
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:25,200
right come here sweetie it's okay

72
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,639
come here land sit with me

73
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,720
let yourself be breathed let yourself have gentleness and kindness with

74
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:53,839
your mind befriending your mind and heart

75
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:21,839
you're training and gentleness with yourself

76
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:18,959
now if your heart would like to stay would like to stay with

77
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:31,839
just breathing with gentleness that's okay

78
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:45,279
and if you like

79
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:53,600
to invite someone ever so gently ever so gently as if

80
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:00,160
you're inviting them into your space of solitude and peace

81
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:07,760
inviting their memory their presence ever so gently not pumping out

82
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:16,720
a doubles but just a gentle invitation to this person who served you

83
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,880
cared for you maybe loved you

84
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,600
or maybe it was of some benefit to you as a benefactor in some

85
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,839
way

86
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:45,120
maybe they're no longer in your lives or maybe they still are see what works best for you maybe a

87
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,600
teacher maybe a teacher you've never met

88
00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:08,079
be really inspired by by their writing their words their talks

89
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:14,079
ever so gently inviting this being

90
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:23,839
into your heart space

91
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:31,680
it could also be a pet i forgot to say whoever feels like

92
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,519
their benefactor to you

93
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,959
and in this heart space

94
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,839
just sitting with them with appreciation

95
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:06,798
with every breath silently you're sitting with them actually just every breath

96
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:13,678
worthlessly as you breathe it feels like every breath communicates

97
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,839
your appreciation

98
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:27,360
perhaps feeling every breath entering and exiting the middle of your heart your heart

99
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:47,840
center connecting connecting with your heart

100
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,720
let your body be soft and relaxed

101
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,559
and each breath just simply communicates

102
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,840
appreciation

103
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:32,240
gratitude generosity of heart however it feels

104
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,640
right

105
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:57,840
maybe love is what feels appropriate in this space

106
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,919
you

107
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,840
so

108
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,840
r

109
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,840
do

110
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:47,440
if the being you have chosen is still alive and

111
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,879
stay in the space

112
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:01,440
but if they have passed away if you wish you're welcome to try the

113
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:13,840
next invitation try it on precise

114
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:22,240
now just as they are they've been invited they're an image

115
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:29,200
in the space of your mind your heart your heart mind

116
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:36,559
let yourself let there be an image of you

117
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:46,880
maybe a younger version of you that enters the space space of heart

118
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
mind

119
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:20,320
and could the present you have a sense of appreciation

120
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:27,679
for both this being you've chosen the object of your meta your

121
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:33,600
appreciation your love

122
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:41,600
as well as this younger version of yourself who's relating to them

123
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,720
to see how metta wants to express itself

124
00:23:52,880 --> 00:24:05,840
in this space with these beings

125
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
do

126
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,919
you

127
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,919
and now can there be a sense of

128
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:39,840
receiving appreciation for you from this being that you are today

129
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,158
for your intentions for you cultivating goodness

130
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:58,240
by the being [Music] by your benefactor and by a younger

131
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:07,840
version of you

132
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:22,000
if you find criticism coming up as if you don't deserve it

133
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:32,399
you don't have to get in your own way these are just thoughts of criticism don't believe

134
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:40,720
them your mind can turn arrows into flowers

135
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:50,559
just as buddha's mind did the night of his enlightenment

136
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:59,840
arrows thrown by mara were transformed into flowers because

137
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:17,840
his mind and loving kindness

138
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:20,240
and can there be a sense of meta being given being received and clear who's giving

139
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:37,840
who's receiving is being in the field of meta all around all three of you

140
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:57,600
and if you find that other benefactors show up in the space

141
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,240
it's okay

142
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:11,840
to give them appreciation love and to receive

143
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:25,840
and if not they don't show up that's okay too

144
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:04,320
and for the last moment dropping this idea in

145
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:11,920
dropping in the idea that this met us love

146
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,440
it's not about you it's not about you at all

147
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,760
how good you're at it how hard it is how much your mind is wandering it's not about you at all

148
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:30,640
it's an act of service to just offer it up to just

149
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:45,838
offer it up offer your heart up

150
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:13,839
notice if something lets go something is released with this offering

151
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,839
c

152
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:30,160
may we all find peace and joy

153
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:37,838
in offering our hearts

154

164
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:23,440
i'll share with you that towards the end as i was practicing seemed like a lot of diseased

165
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:29,599
diseased benefactors were showing up they just wanted to come and share their love and be loved it

166
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:35,200
just became a party so i wondered if that would that happened for anyone too

167
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:42,880
so so violet please

168
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:50,320
hi um i had a question about receiving appreciation um

169
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:58,560
yeah when you did the switch from like receive just receiving from the other people um

170
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:04,640
so i was looking at a teacher from high school and then my high school self and then there were like the three

171
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,839
of us in the room and then i was perspective shifting to me being my high school self looking at my

172
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:15,520
older self and then this um male teachers and it was like this mom dad figure so

173
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:21,839
sweet yeah it was really really touching yeah yeah it was really nice but and

174
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:27,839
then it's like um yeah

175
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:35,200
it's hard yeah it's hard to receive and it's hard to feel like um

176
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:40,960
like when there's like love on offer and somehow it's like our hearts like aren't big enough for it or not like

177
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:47,680
quite able to be totally soothed by it like that feeling of like oh there's this love coming at me but it's not

178
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:56,000
quite enough to like soothe me or comfort me or like that feeling of never being enough um does that go away

179
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,040
yeah good question yeah let's let's uh thanks for bringing that because that is

180
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:07,920
so so common violet what you're talking about is not uncommon at all which is why i usually bring in

181
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,440
something about when i offer ask for the switch and say hey if there's criticism or

182
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:19,359
like i don't deserve this that because what you're talking about is so so common and they're sometimes

183
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:24,880
different things that kind of get in the way so if it's okay let's let's hang on

184
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:32,079
hang around for a moment and see in this case what what is the conception conceptual

185
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:38,160
uh way of conceiving that oh it's never enough or it's not enough there's something there

186
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:44,800
so so coming back to this beautiful beautiful image practice that you brought up that

187
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:51,520
the younger version of yourself was giving you metta is that the or described to me that

188
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:57,520
who's um i so i was looking from the perspective of the younger self so i was

189
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:05,920
17 receiving meta from 26 year old violet and this teacher uh-huh yeah oh okay so the 17 year old

190
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:12,240
was receiving yeah yeah okay and it was the 17 year old was saying that that's not enough that's that's just is

191
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:17,680
that it was like or was it 26 year old i mean from either

192
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:23,760
perspective it would be from either yeah it would be either i see okay okay so so the so from either perspective and

193
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:30,319
then the sense is not landing because it's not enough to soothe or i don't deserve it or

194
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:36,800
or what is this thought that running around that's coming up kind of um it's

195
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,920
like i guess it just feels fleeting or like maybe i am feeling it but it feels

196
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:48,640
fleeting maybe that's what it is like it doesn't feel stable or reliable

197
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:55,200
okay okay okay so so in what you're describing i'll invite

198
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:00,560
i invite you to be bring a little bit of investigation there

199
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:05,920
to see because it might be touching but it might be kind of like pushed away or something that's

200
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:11,520
happening in that moment when it's coming that is kind and see what what is

201
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:18,160
happening on the receiving side bring a little bit of investigation there and it'll become more clear to you

202
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:24,480
what the feeling conceptualization is that is not letting it really land and be seeped

203
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,880
in whereas it feels fleeting there's something happening there that the mind is quite seeing mind is curious about but

204
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:36,319
hasn't quite is not stable enough to see do you see what i'm pointing to

205
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:44,160
like what is making it sort of just bounce off exactly exactly be curious about it next time

206
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:50,240
and you're welcome to send me email if you like and can follow up does that sound okay for

207
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:56,319
now as an investigation yeah something to be seen there thank you violence it's lovely and

208
00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:02,880

228
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:26,960
tears doesn't don't sound like grief to me they sound like joy is separation there's a tenderness

00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:14,160
so dear all let's uh turn given that time is flying let's turn

236
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:21,119
our attention to practicing for a brief period in small groups together

237
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:27,359
okay everyone welcome back the rooms are closed so we have about a minute for

238
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:39,839
any um reflections might have come up from the groups please don't be shy

239
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:48,390
ariana oops didn't mean to hit leave room that happened [Laughter]

240
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:53,680
[Music] any reflections any any other insights

241
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,240
that came up either oh jeff please

242
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:04,559
oh hey everybody happy memorial day um i just wanted my insights i'll share was

243
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:09,920
that sometimes relationships end it's like just the natural course of life is relationships

244
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:17,040
sometimes end and rather than having it be this bitter angry experience of blame and it's your

245
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:24,079
fault no it's your fault there's a way in which it can just be like observing the ending of a relationship

246
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:29,760
with love and with acceptance but it's really really hard to do it

247
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:36,079
that way it's much more common to end it with anger and pointing fingers and stuff so

248
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:42,160
that's what i learned today oh beautiful beautiful i am so touched up that's

249
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:47,520
that's such a beautiful insight in in in the way of refraining

250
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:52,880
that you know of course and and maybe one thought is each relationship

251
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:59,359
is a gift and maybe it's an impermanent gift for a period of time and just really focusing

252
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:04,800
on the gift that it is for that time that it is and and with meta and love and

253
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:10,720
appreciation so focusing on that because we have a choice on what we focus on

254
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:18,240
so thank you for bringing that in that's a beautiful note to end on so thank you all for your practice thank

255
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:25,440
you for coming to happy hour cultivating your heart your mind for the benefit of all beings may all
