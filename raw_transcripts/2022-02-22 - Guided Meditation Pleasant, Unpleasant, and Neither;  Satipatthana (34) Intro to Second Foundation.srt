1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:09,519
so good morning everyone and welcome to uh

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,520
zero two zero zero two two two two zero two two

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,640
that's truly a tuesday and happy to be back here and i had a

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,480
nice visit with my father so um

5
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:37,520
to jump in we're beginning with the topic of feelings feeling tones

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:45,440
and the to be very simple about it the

7
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:52,640
idea the theory in buddhism is that all experiences have three tonalities three feeling

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,520
tones they are either they are pleasant or they're unpleasant or they're neither

9
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,960
pleasant or unpleasant and one of the reasons this is significant

10
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:12,159
is that one of the primary ways in which the mind gets activated to be for and against things to move

11
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,680
towards things and move away from things is whether they're pleasant or unpleasant

12
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,240
and exactly our relationship to what is neither pleasant or unpleasant is variable

13
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:31,920
and and so if we uh bring attention to the pleasant unpleasant neither

14
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,680
unpleasant or unpleasant it gives us a um and if everything has this quality everything has

15
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,040
characterized in some way by this tonality that we can

16
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,320
if we notice that we notice we have a big handle big perspective and noticing

17
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:55,360
on how we react so in this meditation as we're sitting here

18
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,680
and if you would um

19
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,800
maybe notice as you're exposed you do your regular meditation practice mindfulness practice

20
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,879
whether the experience is pleasant or unpleasant or neither those two

21
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:22,000
but more importantly notice if there's even the slightest little movement for or against or moving

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,720
towards or moving away from just that very simple

23
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,560
what is the response in our system our somatic our psychological psychic

24
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,480
psychological system and can you notice this ever so slight or very great

25
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,400
movement away from or towards away from the unpleasant towards the pleasant

26
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:53,200
or being in favor for the pleasant oh yes that's good and being i have an unfavorable reaction

27
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,680
to the unpleasant oh no not that again or something and as i said it can be very subtle it

28
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,680
can be just a slight shift in the you know texture or the

29
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,480
or the size or the strength of the awareness and it could could it could shut down in

30
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:19,519
one side and kind of open up in the other or it could be quite strong the whole body can move or the mind can get spin

31
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:28,239
out into kind of kinds of thoughts and reaction one way or the other so let's begin with that and

32
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,680
then i'll talk more about it so taking a comfortable

33
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,879
alert posture and gently closing the eyes

34
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,239
and then scan through your body to see

35
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:56,080
there are probably pleasant and unpleasant sensations in your body as you sit here

36
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,080
and scan through your body and just calmly recognize the pleasants and the

37
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,560
unpleasant ones and as you do do you notice any

38
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:16,799
simple movement for for and against

39
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,919
wanting and not wanting moving towards moving away

40
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,800
what is the response to being aware of pleasant and unpleasant

41
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,520
scanning around your body for the pleasant unpleasant and just not lingering any one place for long just

42
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,918
like an inventory

43
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,240
and then bringing your attention to your breathing

44
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:15,199
taking some long slow breaths and if possible breathe in a pleasant

45
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:22,000
way so long slow gentle deep breath in

46
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,360
and a long exhale where you relax and let go

47
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:59,759
and letting your breathing return to normal and continue to and exhale

48
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:06,800
maybe breathing it breathing in normally but ever so slightly exhaling longer

49
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:14,160
than normal and in the exhale letting go relaxing the face the shoulders the belly

50
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,800
anywhere in the body

51
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:09,919
and then letting your breathing return to normal completely and tuning in now to the simple experience

52
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:15,440
of breathing and noticing are there parts of the

53
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:21,440
breathing that are more pleasant maybe some that are unpleasant

54
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:31,720
and are you kind of equanimous either way or is there in fact some very simple

55
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:39,680
being for or against wanting or not wanting

56
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:50,000
moving towards or moving away with what is pleasant and unpleasant and

57
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,000
in the experience of breathing

58
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,800
and if other things in your experience come into awareness

59
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:11,600
besides the breathing be mindful of whether it's a pleasant or

60
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,920
an unpleasant or neither pleasant or unpleasant experience

61
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:26,240
and also see if you can notice any if there are any ways in which you are

62
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:33,720
responding reacting to the pleasant or unpleasantness of it

63
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,320
rather than somehow subtly getting involved in the preferences and wanting

64
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,920
and not wanting of pleasant and unpleasant

65
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:22,320
see if you can abide live in the knowing that this is happening just

66
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,680
to see and recognize it's like this

67
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,839
there is pleasant and there's wanting there's unpleasant and there is not

68
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,839
wanting

69
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,839
being aware of your reactions to pleasant and unpleasant

70
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,320
and if you're aware of them clearly enough

71
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:05,918
you'll see that you are not your reactions they're simply reactions responses

72
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:13,600
desires and aversions being for against

73
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:23,199
but not you when you rest in awareness of it all

74
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,960
just knowing as if awareness is larger

75
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,159
more peaceful than any reaction you have

76
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:26,400
and then in the last minutes before the ending whatever seems pleasant

77
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:32,240
comfortable in your meditation if there is such a thing

78
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:38,799
breathe with that and let the mind settle into that

79
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:45,520
supported by what is comfortable or pleasant in settling further into the present

80
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:53,158
moment thinking quieting down

81
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:08,799
and then as we come to the end of the sitting considering that

82
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:15,440
our lives will always contain degrees of pleasant and degrees of

83
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:23,039
unpleasantness comfort and discomfort ease and unease

84
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:27,840
it's part and parcel of the human life

85
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,440
and it's possible to be free it's possible to be peaceful

86
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,120
it's possible to in knowing

87
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:45,919
pleasant and unpleasant knowing our reactions

88
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:52,679
it's possible to feel peaceful safe happy

89
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,799
our happiness does not need to depend on things being pleasant or unpleasant

90
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:07,080
happiness belongs to something deeper in us

91
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:18,880
something that's related to our capacity for simple awareness

92
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,520
being present here in a full full way

93
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,200
and so as we come to the end of the sitting maybe we wish that people

94
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:37,200
find their way with the pleasant and unpleasant challenges of this life

95
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,200
and find a freedom and a happiness and a peacefulness

96
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:52,080
that's not so dependent on whether there's pleasant or unpleasantness

97
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:05,760
may we dwell with awareness that's independent not dependent

98
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:12,880
unpleasant and unpleasant and wish that for others so that all

99
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,480
beings may find a sustainable happiness

100
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:26,159
a sustainable safety peace and freedom

101
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:31,760
may all beings be happy and may our

102
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:37,520
careful attention to this aspect of the mindfulness

103
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:44,720
pleasant and unpleasant be in the service the welfare and happiness of all beings

104
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,200
including ourselves

105
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:03,680
[Music]

106
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:21,200
so good morning everyone and i appreciated uh comments about

107
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,480
paul farmer and his unfortunate passing and

108
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:32,559
i was i'm very thinking about him today and yesterday i was thinking i'm happy that we

109
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:38,480
as a community raised that over 30 thousand dollars last summer

110
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,679
for his organization to end their work in in haiti

111
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,480
and uh glad we could do it and he was still alive and

112
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:57,679
so um may his work continue and may our work caring for others continue as well

113
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:04,159
inspired by him so the

114
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:12,000
topic now for the second foundation of mindfulness is a quite a profound topic

115
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:19,440
and the simple explanation of what it is um does it kind of doesn't uh

116
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,880
clearly indicate how profound it is but there's a way there's a building on

117
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,919
or continuing a kind of theme that you find in the teachings of the buddha

118
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:36,000
around the idea of omniscience there were people who wanted spiritual leaders to be

119
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,600
omniscient back in the time of the buddha and there were apparently some spiritual teachers who claimed to

120
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:49,679
certain kind of omniscience and the buddha was one who didn't so much

121
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:56,480
push things away or deny things he would accept them and then redefine them in his own terms

122
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:06,639
so he he didn't say it exactly the way i'm saying it but i'm bill building on how he says that um

123
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:12,399
that he is omniscient and all of us can be omniscient in a

124
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:17,440
particular way we can know something about everything

125
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:24,159
and that's something is we can know the feeling tone of every experience we have

126
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:30,159
and it no matter what the experience is it's um it's either pleasant

127
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:35,840
or or unpleasant or neither pleasant or unpleasant

128
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:42,799
so there's no you know in terms of the hedonic tone those are the three options

129
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:48,399
there might be many other features of our experience besides the hedonic tone

130
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:54,159
but that tonality has those three characteristics and

131
00:31:54,159 --> 00:32:01,440
and so you know something but everything if you know its tone its feeling tone

132
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:07,600
and to get a handle and to recognize feeling tone as it arises in all kinds it can be situation can be

133
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:13,039
very complicated and and then you realize oh this is a very

134
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:19,200
unpleasant situation it's just unpleasant and that recognizing the unpleasantness

135
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,919
of it gives mindfulness a place to land or to settle or to open so that the mind is not jumping around

136
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:33,679
or confused or chasing after trying to understand it or analyze it or you know just track what's going on

137
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:41,279
and allow something to settle uh same thing with something that's pleasant oh this is really pleasant

138
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:46,559
and and i no wonder that i'm leaning forward so much

139
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:53,519
and so uh to be able to um and then to be able to recognize

140
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:59,279
the reactions we have with pleasant and unpleasant is tremendously useful

141
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:05,440
it turns out the very high percentage of human reactivity of wanting and not wanting

142
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:13,360
is not based on the sophisticated analysis of the situation but rather and the very simple almost amoeba-like

143
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,559
idea of going towards what's pleasant and away from what's unpleasant

144
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:24,799
and if we could watch that movement for and against and see it clearly before we live in it

145
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:31,440
or pushed around by it um there's a lot of freedom that can be found and more than freedom there can be a lot

146
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,760
of deep understanding about ourselves like opens a window a door to a deeper deeper

147
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:44,799
understanding of ourselves and this is what this second foundation is about this my in my understanding my

148
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:51,679
interpretation is that um there's a transition here in the second

149
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:58,000
foundation from attention to the body

150
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,640
to the attention to the mind and the mind being something the cheetah being something deep inside

151
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:11,118
there's a movement to what's a little bit more peripheral to what's deeper inside in the first

152
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:17,200
foundation where the breathing the postures the activities of which the body does

153
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,560
and then there's this use of the imagination or use of reflection to

154
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:29,679
consider the parts of the body and to consider the elements of the body and consider what it's like for the body

155
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:36,000
to be there without any sensations at all and then um and now

156
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,440
we come we're kind of a rebirth in the second foundation where

157
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,878
following the corpse meditation that we did last week i think there can be a heightened

158
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:53,839
sensitivity heightened interest now in the sensations that are evidence that we're alive

159
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:59,760
and so there's a heightened kind of this is some this is you know you know this is some something to appreciate and

160
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:06,160
value and and as we go into the

161
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:12,160
the feeling tones we're actually beginning to get into the deeper functioning of

162
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:18,000
the mind deeper qualities of the mind and uh we'll see in a day or two that

163
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,400
this very tren this very um foundation of feeling tone

164
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:30,400
makes a distinction between that which is of the flesh that which is

165
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:37,119
kind of surface and that which is uh dharmic that the dharmic feelings the

166
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:42,240
deeper deeper mind what's going on in a deeper way and this transition from what's more

167
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:48,400
surface sensual feelings to what's more non-sensual or

168
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,160
deeper in the mind deeper in our kind of inner life is a phenomenal transition that happens

169
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:59,200
in this second foundation but at first we want to just understand

170
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:04,640
a little bit the these uh these three tones pleasant unpleasant

171
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:10,720
and neutral the word for pla for pleasant is sukkah

172
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,079
s s-u-k-h-a and um and unpleasant is dukkha

173
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:21,920
often we translate that as suffering and d-u-k-k-h-a

174
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,920
the most literal meaning of dukkha is pain and sukkah is happiness

175
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:35,599
and and then by by application it becomes because it is a such a broad range of feeling tones

176
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:41,119
rather than making it pain and happiness or pain and pleasure it's pleasant and

177
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:47,760
unpleasant to capture the subtlety but you have to remember it also applies to the most intense versions of

178
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:55,040
those and at first the the focus is much more on

179
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:00,880
sensual pleasant and unpleasantness that's why sensuality uh you i guess you can have pleasure

180
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,560
um but where the difference is between pleasant and pleasure probably has a lot to do

181
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:13,280
with how much we lean into it how much we get caught in it and involved in it

182
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:20,640
and there's less involvement with the pleasant and unpleasant but pleasant and unpleasant is

183
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:26,320
is understood in buddhism to be a quality of the mind and

184
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:33,200
it's not just purely physical and this was a confusion i had in my early years of studying buddhism i thought pleasant

185
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:39,520
unpleasant was purely a physical reaction to things that had nothing to do with

186
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:46,079
um my evaluation of it but if i like read deeper in the suttas

187
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:52,240
it's actually a little more complicated and it's not just we're not innocent bystanders of pleasant and unpleasant

188
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:57,359
there can be a subtle leaning into it or formation or prioritization of it or

189
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:02,880
preference going on in the very idea of pleasant and unpleasant

190
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:09,040
and um that is not completely only a physical phenomena

191
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:15,359
the mind participates in the formation of pleasant and unpleasant and so this points to how we're now

192
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:22,480
beginning to dip our toe into the deeper well of our inner life or our life that that the feeling tone

193
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,640
is not just physical and mechanical it involves uh a a

194
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:34,560
mutuality a reaction a resp a mental process as well as well are

195
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:40,880
touched as we feel pleasant and unpleasant we don't have to understand all how this

196
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:47,839
works but but we want to be able to start appreciating that pleasant unpleasant

197
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:53,520
comes off the tongue quite easily as is something that seems hedonistic or seems

198
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:59,680
distant from the full sophisticated life we live or the full

199
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:06,400
range of happiness and unhappiness that we might experience but to begin

200
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,680
keeping it that simple and beginning to recognize how often and how much we're

201
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:18,560
reacting to pleasant and unpleasant sometimes react reacting to what is neither pleasant or unpleasant

202
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:23,680
we begin finding we have more choice to not react

203
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:29,119
or or to step back in a broader awareness where the

204
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,720
awareness is not the reaction the awareness just knows the reaction and this

205
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:42,960
develops and strengthens mindfulness a lot and this is kind of the direction we're going to in sati patana we're going to

206
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:49,440
cultiva we're moving the direction of cultivating an awareness that can observe

207
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:56,400
the experience or can be wide enough to hold the experience and so pleasant unpleasant liking and

208
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,839
not liking wanting and not wanting can all be just seen

209
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:07,440
through awareness through mindfulness unknown no and and it makes a world of difference to

210
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:14,960
see it and to know it so um the um

211
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:23,040
and finally i'll say that uh and i suspect that the way i'm teaching it today maybe you don't get a sense of

212
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,800
um its full value for the buddha there were

213
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,400
this vedana with a holly word for feeling tone um

214
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,599
v-e-d-a-n-a is um one of the

215
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:46,079
uh he points to this as being one of the most important pivot points for our experience

216
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:52,560
it's kind of like there's a funnel uh an hourglass and and the neck

217
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:59,280
is where the feeling tones are everything goes through that neck and um there's all these different

218
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,640
things that go through but everything has to go through the neck of feeling tones before it uh

219
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:10,240
it fans out again in the hourglass and um so he buddha pointed to feeling

220
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:17,040
tone to having this central foundational role for mindfulness practice for getting a

221
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:22,720
handle or experience and becoming free and he pointed to it

222
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:30,160
he pointed to this as an alter alternative to getting wrapped up in philosophical enterprises

223
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:37,040
of his times philosophies interpretation speculation about metaphysics and spirituality he

224
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:43,760
was pointing to direct experience and in particular he pointed to this feeling tone as being so important to

225
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,680
help us become free to understand what's going on in a deeper way

226
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:56,160
and and then finally the the structure of the sativitana suta

227
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:03,200
is feeling tone is the uh is the seventh exercise

228
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:10,400
so there's a six before and six afterwards and so feeling tones right in the middle is to pivot and

229
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:16,319
we'll see as next few days this pivot that goes on as we get deeper into the feeling tone

230
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:21,039
of our experience so um

231
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:29,200
so here we go second foundation of mindfulness and and i hope that

232
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:35,119
you'll appreciate how wonderfully significant it is to bring mindfulness to this part of our life

233
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,279
thank you
