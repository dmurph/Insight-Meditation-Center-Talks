1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:07,020
you know good Day greetings to this

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,860
beginning of the week Monday and

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,740
and as uh to begin on this topic of the theme

4
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:29,119
Stephen just saying good day to you and greeting you is a form of communication

5
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:35,760
and humans have the ability of communicating with each other but we also have the ability to

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,899
communicate to ourselves and to some degree whenever we're thinking we are

7
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:49,620
communicating to ourselves there's some kind of communication going on we're telling us ourselves a memory or

8
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:56,160
planning of an event or anticipating something or fantasizing

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,379
and to think of thinking whether we think in words or in

10
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:07,979
images as a form of communication and then to consider

11
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:16,140
um how it's being communicated what's the choice that we are maybe unconsciously making

12
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:23,159
for that act of communication are we choosing a form of communication

13
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,200
that is enjoyable that is the way we

14
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:36,360
speak to ourselves in meditation the way that we think the way that we create images and relate to them in our minds

15
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:43,920
and is there some choice to in how we think and how we engage in

16
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,439
this inner communication so that the communication is done in a

17
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:57,380
way that feels supportive feels Pleasant it's calming or settling

18
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:05,460
and to begin today with that using that choice often in meditation the emphasis is On

19
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:12,959
Letting Go of thoughts and thoughts get in the way and just kind of stay with breathing or some object of meditation

20
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,300
stay with a quiet awareness but to begin this meditation

21
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,879
with a few moments here looking at your thinking

22
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:29,180
so to assume a meditation posture

23
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,060
and to take a few moments to find that comfortable find a comfortable

24
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:46,459
posture a calming posture

25
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:58,440
posture that's not being shaped by whatever way art

26
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,940
desires are driven

27
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:12,300
posture that might support the settling of desires quieting

28
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:20,840
and then to close your eyes or lower their gaze

29
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:37,260
and to take a few long slow deep breaths

30
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,060
relaxing on the exhale

31
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:11,000
and letting your breathing return to normal and for a few moments

32
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:20,000
as you breathe as you exhale relax in your body

33
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:17,040
and then maybe continuing gently with your breathing as a grounding as a

34
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:23,759
reference point to come away come become aware of

35
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:32,479
how you're thinking the kind of inner Communications

36
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:42,720
and to the grid which you have some choice about how you think

37
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,919
can you think in a more pleasant way a calmer way

38
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:56,418
maybe think more gently or peacefully

39
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,000
you're welcome to think whatever you're thinking

40
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,680
but to do so in a calm or

41
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,800
Gentle Way

42
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,479
perhaps thinking slower

43
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,979
perhaps whatever way you're relating to this exercise

44
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:53,600
maybe relax that

45
00:06:55,259 --> 00:07:01,380
relax any tension or straining or the resistance there might

46
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,620
be

47
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:17,120
engage upon your thinking calmly kindly

48
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,160
and to be tracking how you're thinking

49
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:04,500
and letting it become calmer and slower does require some degree of mindfulness

50
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,340
of awareness

51
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,160
and as you're attending to your thinking

52
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:38,779
in what time are your thoughts concerned with

53
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:44,060
are you concerned with the past the future

54
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,540
the Timeless time of fantasy

55
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,680
in what place are they concerned with are they concerned whether some place or

56
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:20,600
something happened in the past place where something will happen in the future

57
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:35,600
to recognize when you're thinking is not about Here and Now

58
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:41,060
this place at this time

59
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:50,040
and now to be against that or have a problem with it but be aware all this thinking is about

60
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:56,040
another time another place it's not about Here and Now

61
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,779
just to see that clearly

62
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:38,700
and then gently calmly see if you can switch your thoughts

63
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:46,079
do thoughts about Here and Now gentle calm thoughts of recognition

64
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:53,959
thoughts of instructions for yourself in being present in your meditation

65
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:07,140
it is a form of communication to have your thoughts help you recognize

66
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,760
What's Happening Here and Now

67
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,420
to let your thoughts provide you with very simple

68
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:24,380
instructions to do this very thing that we're doing

69
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,540
and then Center yourself on your breathing if you'd like

70
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:11,000
or Center yourself on your embodied feeling of

71
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,480
being in your body

72
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:37,160
but if you start thinking take a good look

73
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:44,700
if the thoughts are about this time and place what's happening now for you

74
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:52,040
or about something else and if it's something else

75
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:59,180
change the channel to the channel that's about Here and Now

76
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:02,839
instructing yourself

77
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:12,440
Here and Now to be involved in your meditation

78
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:24,840
meditation is a Time for thinking only about the present

79
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:30,020
and only about the experience that's here and now

80
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,519
and not judging it or making plans around it

81
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:44,400
simple thoughts of recognition in simple thoughts of

82
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:51,980
that encourages you to be present lots of instructions

83
00:18:52,919 --> 00:19:01,760
here with this breath this inhale here with this exhale

84
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:39,539
foreign

85
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:37,580
and then as we come to the end of this meditation

86
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:48,059
if thinking is a form of communication what thoughts would you like to

87
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:51,860
communicate out into the world

88
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:06,559
and if it is your heart that wants to communicate your care Your Love

89
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:16,880
what thoughts would you like to have sent out into the world

90
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,020
if your thoughts can touch the hearts of others

91
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:33,200
with what thoughts would you touch them

92
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:54,200
perhaps to end now with an aspirational thoughts

93
00:26:54,539 --> 00:27:01,700
who well wishing wishing others well

94
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:09,620
may all beings be happy

95
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:15,799
may all beings be safe

96
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,880
may all beings be peaceful

97
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,860
may all beings be free

98
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:42,919
and may it be that through our thoughts our words and our Deeds

99
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:48,440
that we find ways

100
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,700
to contribute to this possibility

101
00:27:53,640 --> 00:28:00,600
so it's not just wishes good wishes upon which we act into the

102
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:06,500
world may all beings be happy

103
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:23,559
[Music]

104
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,900
thank you

105
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:29,640
so hello on this Monday as we begin a new

106
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:35,279
five-part series and the topic for this week is

107
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:44,100
conventionally or normally would be called uh why speech right speech

108
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:51,980
and a few things introductory words about this one is that um

109
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:58,500
that um in the time of the Buddha the ways people communicated with each

110
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,899
other was a only through speech maybe through gesture as well they're bought

111
00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:10,020
but there was no writing to speak of there was no certainly no other forms of

112
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:17,159
communication no no telephones no email

113
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:24,299
and so speech was you know the center of the focus for how to communicate wisely

114
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:29,399
I suspect that if the Buddha was alive today he would call this wise

115
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:36,179
communication rather than why speech because his teachings apply also to what

116
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:42,659
you know would apply to all the ways in which we communicate to each other and now we have so many different ways

117
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:49,620
that are more than just speech email for example is uh is an important example of

118
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:56,039
how to learn how to communicate wisely and um

119
00:30:56,039 --> 00:31:04,200
and overall this year that of 2023 the orientation around these 7

120
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:11,159
A.M 7 30 the teachings is support for working

121
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:16,260
with the difficulties and challenges of life maybe all of Buddhism is that so it

122
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:24,179
doesn't need to be said but uh that's kind of one of the focus is and so learning how to communicate

123
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:30,779
and conflict communicate when things are challenging is really a crucial a skill

124
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:36,360
to learn to be in Conflict B and challenges in a useful way in a

125
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:44,159
productive way in a way that causes less harm the way to communicate so we don't make

126
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:50,700
a situation worse ideally we make the situation better and just that is a I think a powerful

127
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:57,659
principle the simple principle of or instructions don't make it worse whatever is

128
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:03,120
happening don't make it worse and um

129
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:09,240
so communication to communicate in a way that doesn't make it worse makes it

130
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:16,980
better communicate in the ways that the communication is effective that we take care of ourselves we take

131
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:25,020
care of what needs to be done but we do it in ways that um that lead to long-term benefit

132
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:31,679
not excessively focused on just the results of now but uh but looking at what are we

133
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:38,760
creating for in the long term for the relationship of their people if we if we say something harsh and

134
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:46,580
strong and know and angrily to people we might have an immediate effect maybe the effect that we want but in the long term

135
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:52,919
we've now kind of diminished the strength of that relationship we have to administer the trust the sense of safety

136
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:59,700
that people have or the interest people have to be with us and so to find a way to communicate so

137
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:07,860
that we're creating long-term uh connections long-term well-being and the ones that help develop healthy

138
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:14,760
relationships as opposed to pulling back from that or severing healthy relationships or creating unhealthy

139
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:20,220
relationships so um the Buddha had a number of

140
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:25,980
principles or advice for wise communication wise speech

141
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:32,580
and um and there's some places where he has five and so we'll do those five over

142
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:40,860
today this week and um these are um this uh for speech to be timely to be

143
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:46,559
spoken at the right time speech which is truthful

144
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:53,940
speech which is uh Pleasant or soothing or um for people calming

145
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:58,980
uh uh Speech which is um

146
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:05,940
beneficial and speech which is kind

147
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:11,820
with a mind of loving kindness so timely speech so one of the questions

148
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:16,919
and all these are questions we can use to ask ourselves when we're about to

149
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:25,398
speak is it Timely is it true is it uh being spoken in a way that's

150
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:32,040
Pleasant for people and settling for people is it beneficial to say what I'm going

151
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:37,260
to say and is it uh kind what I'm going to say so these are five different

152
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:44,099
things we can ask ourselves wondering should I speak right now and and um or how can I speak so it's this

153
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:49,440
way so the first one is a timely this is the right time

154
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,919
this is hugely important because especially when there's conflict and challenges that

155
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:01,520
um different people have different needs and and conflict some people need

156
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,599
to have time to process and be quiet and be by themselves for a while before

157
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:14,640
they're ready to be in conversation about a conflict some people need to kind of address it right away and and to

158
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:20,820
let it stay in their mind and fester is difficult for them and in order to find out what's going on they need to be in

159
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:27,300
conversation so these if the if there's this range of how people are can mean

160
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:35,060
that we have to be very careful to understand is what's the right time for this conversation is the person ready

161
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:41,720
for it is the circumstances of life such that now is the time

162
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:47,640
that the person is ready to talk about this sometimes when we talk about something

163
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:54,839
when we want to talk about it it actually makes the situation worse and people are not ready maybe they're going

164
00:35:54,839 --> 00:36:02,460
through some other difficulty and they can't add one more to their difficulty or maybe they're um in a kind of a lousy

165
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:09,359
mood and to try to approach them with some important difficult topic when their mood is just lousy when they're

166
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:15,180
tired or upset or something else that it's not going to go very well

167
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:21,480
so is it so you have to we have to assess the situation that people we want to talk to and assess ourselves it's the

168
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,820
right time for me to do this conversation am I ready am I in a good

169
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:32,220
mood am I in a way that I'm most likely the best of whom who I am can come

170
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:37,740
forward for this communication and um and so for example maybe if

171
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:45,119
you're hungry if it's going to be a difficult conversation make sure you you drink and eat first and maybe that will

172
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:51,300
just put you in a whole different state of mind that you're actually able to be more patient or more accepting or even

173
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:57,540
more intelligent in the conversation you have so this question is it the right time is

174
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:04,079
I think a very helpful question and um to uh

175
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:10,020
um is it the right time for you is it the right time for the other person is the right time for the situation to have

176
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:16,079
this conversation and um and I find that in certain kind of things that uh I would like to talk

177
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:22,260
to with to people about some difficulty we have that sometimes I'll wait until I feel

178
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:30,480
the person's open to the conversation and sometimes I've waited weeks or months for this to happen uh and and uh

179
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,660
and and productively so sometimes the person opens the door

180
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:41,520
themselves for the topic and then it's much easier to step in people are less defensive

181
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:46,980
but to bring it up bring something up that's difficult immediately as soon as there's a challenge

182
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:54,000
sometimes it's really good it's clear and clean and sometimes it's not helpful

183
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,240
because a person will be resistant defensive they'll shut down

184
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:08,099
then they were not ready to hear something and so and so to kind of consider

185
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:14,339
it's a little bit hard to consider when some people what they want to say there's a lot of impulse a lot of

186
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:20,099
impatience a lot of like this has to happen now feeling and sometimes it does

187
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:27,540
and so yeah then you should you need to do it perhaps but to have a feeling this needs to be taken care of now

188
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:34,619
and maybe it should ideally be taken care of now but when you realize the person's not ready the person can't deal

189
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:40,079
with us now I can I can insist on my way but it's not going to go well

190
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:45,780
and I've done that I've had conversations with people right away and it just got worse because the person

191
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:52,800
wasn't ready and sometimes even waiting a day or waiting an hour waiting five minutes is

192
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,859
enough to kind of be ready so to

193
00:38:57,859 --> 00:39:03,839
to ask the question of what you want us about what you want to speak about is

194
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:11,760
this the right time to speak and is there a better time is it what's the most useful time to

195
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:18,420
have this conversation and um and there's a lot of criteria that

196
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:25,320
you want to kind of look into about what's the right time is the person ready is the person in a good mood for

197
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:30,960
it is a person going to be receptive are you going to are you going to be able to speak

198
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:36,660
clearly have you understood this situation well enough and considered what's going on so that you can come for

199
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:42,720
the clearest understanding that Claire's articulation of what you want to say and what you need to say

200
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:49,200
and um do you need to calm down a little bit do you need to kind of change your mood and

201
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:56,540
come back in a way that's better and one suggestion I have is that um generally there's a kind of useful

202
00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:01,859
guideline is that if you're angry this

203
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:08,160
is not to have not the time to have an in-depth conversation about something with other people

204
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:14,220
and if you can learn to find a way to settle the anger to even just going for

205
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:21,839
a walk around the block and coming back or meditating for 10 minutes or waiting to the next day then and then address

206
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:27,180
the issue this is not supposed to be avoiding avoiding issues when you ask

207
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:32,700
guys it's the right time and you said decide I'll wait that is to be able to

208
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:39,180
have the conversations be productive and useful and and supportive for everyone

209
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:45,599
so um so asking the question in your communication is it Timely

210
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,660
the email you're writing is this the right time to write this email

211
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:56,579
the I've written the emails in a hurry when I felt impatient and then I had to

212
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:03,240
I didn't communicate well and then I had to spend a lot of time cleaning up explaining doing something

213
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:09,900
and um and so sometimes I've written emails and not sent them sometimes I've

214
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:15,960
just bookmarked the email and say I'm going to reply to this sometime when I don't feel impatient or don't feel

215
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:24,480
rushed this needs a different kind of care and um so is it the right time to write

216
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:31,980
an email and um and does this require more consideration

217
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:39,300
than a quick reply what's the wise way to find what where what's the wise reply the supportive we

218
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:46,800
reply so uh communication we communicate all the time if nothing

219
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:54,900
else to ourselves and um and even there how do we communicate to ourselves are we

220
00:41:54,900 --> 00:42:01,320
thinking about things which are timely in a timely way the right time for it

221
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:09,119
is there something that's more timely to be concerned with and be focused on just that questions I think a wonderful

222
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:17,579
question that opens doors opens possibilities can kind of change the the mindstream in

223
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:23,700
which we're flowing when that mindstream maybe is not very useful for us and helpful for the world

224
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:28,800
so why is communication why speech

225
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,079
and Begins by asking the question is what I'm going to say the right is this

226
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:42,260
the right time for what I'm going to say so thank you very much and um
