1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,679
so a warm hello from imc

2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:15,519
in redwood city and uh appreciate

3
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:23,199
how far spread and how close in this youtube community is and

4
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,960
that we've gathered together here and i like to think of as in a wide circle

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,680
sitting together to meditate thank you one of the

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:44,480
for me one of the surprising aspects of buddhist meditation was how much it involved the body

7
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,840
and so much that i think sometimes that mindfulness the

8
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,320
word sati translated into english as mindfulness maybe should have been translated as body fullness

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:03,840
because it plays such a central role in attention awareness sensing feeling

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,960
and um but one of the surprising things is how much

11
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,200
the focus is not on the bot the corporal body not the body that will be left when

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,479
you're a corpse but rather the animate body

13
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:26,720
the body that is is animated

14
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,439
with uh certainly with life with but more than that it's animated also

15
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:40,640
with the um the functioning of the mind

16
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,439
and this body-mind thing in buddhism are not so separate sometimes we consider them to be kind of working together

17
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:53,360
inseparably and so much of our the way in which we experience our body

18
00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:00,159
is mediated with with how the state the quality the activities of the mind

19
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,479
and that as we dip deeper into the body there's a reciprocal relationship between the body

20
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,000
and the mind the mind and the body and so as the mind changes so does our

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,840
experience of the body the animate body the experience body

22
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,360
the way that we experience the body it's not the same thing as the corporal body

23
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,920
experience is mediated partly through our perceptions our orientations our states of mind we

24
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,920
have and it's remarkable how the body shifts and changes as we become more embodied

25
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,920
more present and and the mind becomes more healthy more

26
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,200
settled more at ease and anyway so this was a huge surprise

27
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:55,040
for me in my practice and i'm hoping that uh for many of you it is or has been or will be

28
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,680
a um a similar kind of delight and surprise and of a profound nature

29
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:09,680
to appreciate the body in a deep way the experienced body the animate body

30
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:16,800
so one of the ways to that this reciprocal relationship works between the mind and the body

31
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,640
is that when the body is relaxed

32
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:29,840
it has a huge impact on the mind the more tense the body the more it supports the tension in the

33
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,720
mind the more relaxed the body is the more it supports the mental tension to soften

34
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,440
and relax so um so today the focus will be relaxing the

35
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,400
body so taking a

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
posture being careful with your posture

37
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,599
kind of align adjust your posture so that it's most

38
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:10,720
balanced and open and you're sitting upright most upright

39
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:20,880
so that when it relaxes the body doesn't collapse or slump

40
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,600
so that when it relaxes um it um

41
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,360
it kind of is relaxing into a support

42
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,240
and aliveness

43
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:45,280
so then begin by lowering your gaze and relaxing your eyes

44
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,240
and gently closing your eyes

45
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:02,400
and when i take deep breaths at the beginning of the meditation i imagine that

46
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:10,639
the movement of the inhale begins deep inside and expands outward like a big massage

47
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:19,360
stretching moving expanding the torso chest so taking a deep deep breath

48
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:28,400
and as you relax exhale relaxing into the body

49
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,120
deep deep

50
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,720
breathing and then relax

51
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:50,960
and letting your breathing return to normal and on the exhale

52
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,000
progressively relax the body from the bottom up

53
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,840
so maybe just exhale to soften any tension or holding in your

54
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,960
legs around the knees

55
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,160
the thighs

56
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:35,720
as you exhale to relax the whole area around your hips your hip joints

57
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,280
where your bottom connects with your cushion

58
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,840
the floor relax

59
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,720
on the exhale relaxing the belly

60
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,720
letting the belly soften as you exhale

61
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,560
maybe as it softens it settles down

62
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:34,240
into the lower torso to create some more stability

63
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:43,160
a ground a floor for the upper torso to rest on

64
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:55,199
and then relaxing the upper torso the chest rib cage back and forth forward and

65
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,199
behind

66
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,599
and then the exhale relaxing the shoulders

67
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:39,640
allowing the shoulders to give into the gentle pull of gravity

68
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:00,519
relaxing the arms the hands the fingers

69
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:20,800
and relaxing the muscles of the face softening around the mouth

70
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,279
sometimes helped by gently very slightly

71
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:33,880
opening your lips the middle of the lips apart a little bit

72
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,040
at least so the lips aren't pressing against each other

73
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,560
softening the jaws

74
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,920
and softening around the eyes

75
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:14,880
letting the eyes rest in the sockets and if it's more restful

76
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:22,959
even with your eyes closed let any gaze looking that the eyes are trying to do

77
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:32,120
be it gentle looking backwards down into the body so the eyes aren't reaching out

78
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,880
and softening the forehead

79
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,800
and then if there's any tension or pressure in the mind

80
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:07,839
in the brain area or anywhere else you associate with the mind

81
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,519
let the mind relax soften

82
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,309
[Music]

83
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:05,240
and then through the soft attention settle your awareness on your breathing

84
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,240
feeling the inhales and the exhales

85
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:35,839
and on the inhale feel your body in whatever way

86
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,480
it shows itself

87
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,240
and on the exhale relax your body

88
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,720
in whatever places there can be release

89
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,839
breathing in breathing out

90
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:14,120
feeling the body relaxing the body

91
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:35,679
and as we approach the end of this sitting perhaps now you can do another round of

92
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:43,120
relaxation of the body as you exhale to relax

93
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,158
deep at the core

94
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,158
the core of the body

95
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:01,039
the way that you might be held in check or closed or

96
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:08,480
held back just for the last minutes to relax that

97
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,840
to relax again around the face deep in the mind

98
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:42,480
and as we come to the end of the sitting to bring to mind a saying

99
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:49,440
that in times of crisis one person who stays calm

100
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,799
can keep everyone come

101
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,000
i don't know if it's always true but it's a wonderful principle

102
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:08,398
and may it be that as we go out into the world today the next 24 hours

103
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:13,840
that may be our gift is to

104
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:22,159
keep our body relaxed a calm body a calm presence

105
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:31,520
people carry so much tension chronic tension

106
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,799
and some of that tension

107
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:42,279
is a response to being around other tense people

108
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:52,399
if we can turn that around and find a way to be relaxed

109
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:58,720
and let that be the gift so other people can relax

110
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:05,039
can feel at ease you can let go of some other tension and

111
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,039
anxiety

112
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:18,799
you might see what ways being relaxed in body

113
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,799
is beneficial for the people around you

114
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:35,679
being relaxed and being relaxed maybe it's easier to be

115
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:42,559
have our hearts concerned be the welfare and happiness of others

116
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:49,440
maybe we live this day caring for others

117
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,679
so they can be happier safer

118
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:04,799
more peaceful and more free may all beings everywhere be happy

119
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,640
peaceful and free

120
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:34,520
thank you

121
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,720
so this day this week the focus is on

122
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,720
that part of the mindfulness instruction that has to do with mindfulness of the body

123
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,480
of course the mindfulness of the body practice begins is

124
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:47,679
with mindfulness or breathing the focus for last week the breathing is

125
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:53,760
is a completely embodied part of our experience and now it's it kind of

126
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:59,600
begins opening and helping open us to the rest of the body

127
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:05,039
the simplest instructions for mindfulness that we teach here at imc

128
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:12,720
is that when you know to use the breathing as the basis as the home base

129
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,720
for meditation if as a default just if you are wondering where to

130
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,919
have your attention have your attention with your breathing so just just a default just automatic you know think

131
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,200
about it but if something else becomes more compelling

132
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:35,440
there used to be the teaching when something else becomes becomes predominant

133
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:42,480
then then the idea is to you can two things you

134
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,919
can either let go of the breathing entirely focusing on it and bring your full attention

135
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:54,159
to this if the if it's in your this other thing that's predominant so for now it's going

136
00:32:54,159 --> 00:33:00,399
to be the body so if something becomes more predominant in the body then

137
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:05,600
we practice mindfulness of the body mindfulness of that place

138
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:11,760
if someone and the other option is to stay with the

139
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:18,240
breathing but in a sense maybe through the imagination slightly is to imagine you're breathing through

140
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:25,120
or with the strong sensations in your body sooner and later the body will speak up

141
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,720
with strong sensations for beginners in meditation taking a meditation posture is quickly

142
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,760
uncomfortable and slowly over time

143
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:43,919
the body adjusts and stretches and opens and gets stronger so that there's some ease in this yogic posture of meditation

144
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:50,559
and it's really a well worth to work through that time but you don't don't need to

145
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:57,679
strain yourself meditating you don't to force yourself to stay with discomfort if some discomfort becomes too strong

146
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:03,440
then change your posture you know you don't have to if it feels like you're getting stressed by the

147
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:09,519
meditation itself then don't stay with uncomfortable things

148
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:15,200
and um but there's also this turning towards what's there in the body

149
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,960
and today's the kind of topic is relaxation

150
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,079
to relax the body in a deep way so one one

151
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:32,800
early time where i started learning the value of relaxation was when i was a zen student

152
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:39,118
and there are times that my knees hurt a lot from sitting we saddled we meditated a lot and we

153
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:44,398
weren't in zen you weren't really supposed to move while you're meditating during meditation so if you're

154
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:50,960
uncomfortable you have to kind of bear it and so um i noticed some point

155
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,320
that around the knee pain there would be subtle micro tensions in

156
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,760
the muscles around it like resistance of maybe kind of expert was an expression of resistance

157
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,839
to the pain and that contract around it but that tightness actually made the pain worse

158
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:13,599
and if i relax those micro tensions the pain got better got less

159
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:20,400
and it was just enough there was a difference from being overwhelmed to managing fine with it but i had to be

160
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:27,680
very attentive because if i didn't pay attention then the reactivity i had would creep in

161
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:33,040
kind of kind of unknowingly and um and then the muscles would be

162
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:39,760
tight again so i learned to kind of stay there and feel feel that since the the

163
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:46,880
the sensations there the tightness and relax them relax them they

164
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:54,800
i learned also that i had sometimes subtle tension in my fingers and they looked ever so slightly pulled

165
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:01,680
in and it was an expression of some kind of uh feeling of like i had to work hard here

166
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:07,599
i had to engage now in doing this meditation thing and so i learned to recognize that subtle

167
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:14,320
tension in the fingers and relax it and keep it relaxed and that had a reciprocal relationship or in

168
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:21,760
relationship to that attitude i had to work hard here and as i relaxed the fingers that attitude would soften

169
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,800
unknowingly the attitude would return and the fingers would get tense again

170
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:33,520
and uh and so i learned to do a regular part of the check-in as i meditated was to make sure my fingers were relaxed and

171
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,960
it was something that was relatively easy to do for me um it was a micro relaxation it

172
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,400
wasn't a big deal so microattention same thing with the belly

173
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,599
in the early years of meditation practice i had a lot of tension in my belly my belly was always

174
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:55,599
tightened up and held in and i didn't make it a big project but probably

175
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:00,960
two or three times in the course of meditation beginning in the middle near the end or something

176
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,720
i would relax the belly and from it often times in the beginning it would just tighten right up again

177
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:13,680
and i didn't make much to do with it i just kind of periodically relaxed but over time over the months of doing

178
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:20,240
this the belly learned what it was like to be relaxed and as the belly became more familiar with

179
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:26,800
it and more at home in it i could feel you know it would became more of a regular place easier to be

180
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:32,960
there in a relaxed belly but also the anxiety

181
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:38,000
that seemed to be the genesis of that stomach tension began to loosen again to

182
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,520
recognize it i hadn't recognized it until i started kind of hanging out with the belly and

183
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:50,560
feeling the tension there so as you do mindfulness of the body

184
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:57,040
it's helpful to keep an eye out for where the tension is where the holding patterns are the tightness

185
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:03,680
and and not to make it a big project or very be very ambitious about the relaxation

186
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:09,200
but it is helpful to relax so as many of you know you know i teach here

187
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:15,520
on this these 7 a.m meditations to relax at the beginning always to relax at the

188
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:21,599
beginning but as the meditation goes along it's useful to kind of check in

189
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:28,320
is there some tension there any attention crept in uh in some of my longest retreats that i

190
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,440
met sat where i sat in very deep states of meditation i developed a

191
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,520
practice of i would sit for sometimes for a few hours at a time and i would pull myself out of the

192
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:46,320
meditation uh you know with my mind i would still look like i was meditating but i would kind of pull out of the

193
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:52,079
concentrated state and and look around for a few seconds

194
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:59,200
to see um and any tension crept in and if there was then i would relax

195
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:06,079
that tension and often the relaxation had to do with something in the upper head that was connected to um trying a

196
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:12,400
little bit too hard to be focused a little too hard to concentrate and to be a little contraction there so i'd relax

197
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,520
and with the relaxation the consciousness softened and then i would dip back into medit

198
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:22,640
into the in the deep place of meditation i found it so useful to always kind of

199
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:29,599
come out and check and some people as they get concentrated to get tension in their face and

200
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:35,119
and come out of the concentrated state relaxed relax the tension and then

201
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:40,400
and then see if you can get concentrated without that tension building up

202
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,760
um some people find that in meditation even if they don't try to do a lot of

203
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,800
relaxation actively that just meditation is relaxing uh

204
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,480
the genesis of a lot of tension it has to do with the

205
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:05,599
the tense way we think and the tense things we think about and as in meditation that the thinking

206
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:11,040
quiets down that source of tension begins to

207
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:16,640
lessen and become weaker and weaker and so some people find just simply staying with the breath

208
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:24,240
focusing on the breath letting their attention kind of ride the breath be with their breath

209
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:29,920
then there's not so much attention available to all these thinking that are stress producing

210
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,520
and so just that then people find themselves relaxing sometimes

211
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,560
progressively and sometimes they realize after the fact boy am i relaxed

212
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:46,720
without trying so it's important also not to try too much to relax

213
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:52,960
there are times when i try to relax my body and i made it a project and you know i couldn't quite do it i

214
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,480
could do a little bit and i'd try some more do a little bit and just kept me busy in meditation

215
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,920
and and then i i wouldn't try to relax

216
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,520
and i would just stay focused and be with my breathing and get constipated breathing and lo and behold that part of

217
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:16,240
my body relaxed um so you we don't always want to do kind of frontal assault on our attention

218
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:22,720
sometimes we have to just accept it and and allow it to be there and just do the practice and

219
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,680
trust that it will relax on its own

220
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:34,400
the um and then finally an interesting thing to

221
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,920
do with relaxation of the body if you feel there's tension somewhere in the body

222
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:47,680
that doesn't want to relax don't worry about it but sometimes it's very interesting to relax around it

223
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:53,280
relax the attitude towards it relax the and this outer layer

224
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,640
of reactivity perhaps around like my knee pain i tighten up around it

225
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:06,240
so you know if the shoulders are very tense so the belly is tense and it can't relax don't worry about it

226
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:12,560
but maybe it's possible to relax something a little bit a wider circle in the body

227
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,720
just around it there might be a softening that can happen

228
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:25,280
and so today's theme is relaxation

229
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:31,760
and relaxation is just uh i think of it as kind of like the entry-level

230
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:37,760
uh variation empty level kind of taste of

231
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:43,359
of the deep letting go that in buddhism is called liberation and

232
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:49,599
it partakes relaxation shares some of the goodness and some of the qualities of

233
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:55,359
deep deep relaxation freedom liberation that comes and so we're kind of getting a hang of

234
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:00,880
it and feel for it the body gets a sense and it helps prepare the ground for

235
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:07,680
deeper and deeper letting go and relaxation as meditation proceeds

236
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,319
so thank you for today and uh

237
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:19,599
you might spend the next 24 hours um familiarizing yourself

238
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:24,720
with the tensions in your body the times and places and ways in which you

239
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:30,560
tighten up and it might be just a fascinating to see how much it goes on

240
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:36,640
and then but also are there simple ways you can relax that what happens if you stay

241
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:42,400
and don't allow relaxed or don't allow the tensions to build how does your how does that affect your

242
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:51,078
day so thank you very much
