1
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:18,000
good morning good morning or maybe it's afternoon where you are or

2
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,120
even evening wherever you are sending a warm warm

3
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,339
welcome so

4
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:34,980
some of you may be wondering wait this isn't Gil yes so for those of you who don't know

5
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:40,940
me I'm Diana Clark I'm sitting in for a girl this morning

6
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:48,060
so I'm going to be continuing with uh the series on the Brahma vejaras

7
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:53,940
and specifically on compassion and today we're going to practice with

8
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:59,220
and talk a little bit about cultivating compassion

9
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:04,279
I'll say for me that this is one of the most I don't know it's a beautiful

10
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:10,560
aspect of Buddhist practice that sometimes doesn't get the

11
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:19,079
I don't know what the word is the respect the recognition that maybe it needs this whole idea

12
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:25,800
that we can cultivate heart qualities we don't have to leave

13
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:33,480
it up to chance or we don't have to leave it up to getting all the right uh

14
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,300
all the right conditions in place

15
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,940
but instead this is something that we can make it more likely

16
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:52,560
that we will respond to our life with some warm-heartedness and some warmth

17
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,440
and then of course our lives just unfold differently if we

18
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:04,100
show up with some warmth openness

19
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:10,040
so that's a little bit of the journey we'll take together today

20
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,899
so to begin this loving kindness I'm sorry

21
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:22,640
to begin practice this morning

22
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:32,519
well just Begin by establishing ourselves and settling into a meditation posture that

23
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,720
feels comfortable

24
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:45,779
so a posture that has some alertness and some uprightness

25
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:50,600
the brightness either literally or figuratively

26
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:58,279
maybe it's best for your body if you're not sitting upright

27
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:05,779
but maybe there's a way in which there could be a sense of uprightness or

28
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:13,320
energetic sense that's not rigid

29
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:20,399
but instead allowing a quality of relaxation or

30
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:26,899
softness into this into the posture

31
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,899
settling into the body

32
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:50,600
with a sense of balance

33
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:02,000
with with this kind of the dignity of the balance

34
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:07,879
with wakefulness and

35
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,200
softness relaxation

36
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:28,940
and a sense of openness or spaciousness

37
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,779
if that's possible available

38
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:58,160
and taking a moment to feel into a simple Sensations

39
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:08,160
maybe the back side connecting with the chair

40
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,180
or cushion

41
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:19,160
keeping it simple

42
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:32,339
what does it actually feel like right now

43
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:35,660
to be sitting here

44
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:58,079
maybe tuning into sensations of contact of the feet

45
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,240
and the legs touching the floor

46
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,879
the chair whatever it might be cushion mat

47
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,519
feeling grounded feeling connected

48
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:56,899
maybe bringing some attention to the hands how do they feel right now

49
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,980
tuning into those Sensations

50
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:20,160
might notice what the hands are touching it's soft or rough

51
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,900
and a really simple way

52
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,299
just noticing

53
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:55,919
and noticing the sensations maybe like inside the hands or the

54
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,440
sensations of having hands

55
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:08,340
maybe there's tingling maybe there's pressure

56
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,659
whatever it might be

57
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:31,919
tuning in the sensations in the hands in a really simple way

58
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:38,419
no need to strain or strive

59
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:42,500
it's keeping it easy relaxed

60
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:03,059
and then bringing that same quality of attention

61
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:06,679
to the sensations of breathing

62
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:16,799
feeling the movement in the chest or abdomen or maybe the

63
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,039
nose

64
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:51,440
feeling the Rhythm of breathing

65
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:18,080
it's natural that the mind will get lost in thought

66
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,059
we just very simply gently Begin Again

67
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:27,860
with the sensations of breathing

68
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:18,679
when we find ourselves lost in thought we don't have to make it a problem

69
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:25,620
let me just with some warmth gentleness

70
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:30,960
we we could use the language receive the

71
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,980
sensations of the breath just opening to that

72
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:47,480
feeling the expansion and contraction the stretching pulling

73
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:16,559
and then we can do some loving kindness now that

74
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:22,700
we have certain foundation with

75
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:29,480
connected to the body to the sensations of the body the present moment

76
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:39,360
with all these Brahma vihara practices start where it's easy

77
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,799
start where it's easy

78
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:50,240
so bring to mind a lovable being

79
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:59,400
someone for a home it's natural easy uncomplicated to feel

80
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:05,220
warmth care Goodwill towards this

81
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,880
being

82
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:19,700
some people use their imaginations for kittens puppies babies

83
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,799
I can't help but smile when I say these

84
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:31,260
or maybe there's someone in your life that

85
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:39,260
you just like the heart sings in some kind of way when you bring them to mind

86
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:51,299
or maybe it's not someone that you know so well but someone who is

87
00:23:51,299 --> 00:24:00,840
a big impact on your life that you feel very appreciative coach a mentor a teacher a leader

88
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,440
friend

89
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:15,480
bringing the lovable being to mind and

90
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:22,380
connecting with your warmth your

91
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:31,158
care kindness meta love

92
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:38,240
for this person for this being

93
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:06,539
some people find it helpful to connect by connecting

94
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:13,880
with the image using the imagination the image of The Lovable being

95
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:31,559
some people find it helpful to

96
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:36,140
Place some attention in the heart area

97
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:43,260
allowing that to soften and open and

98
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,260
radiate

99
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:28,260
some people find it helpful to use phrases

100
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:33,900
to help connect with a sense of warmth and

101
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,440
care

102
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:50,299
you can use phrases like may you be safe

103
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:01,340
may you be happy

104
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:18,740
may you be healthy

105
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:30,860
may you live with ease

106
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:25,020
connecting with the lovable being with love

107
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:31,860
with Goodwill warmth benevolence

108
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:36,019
respect care

109
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:41,840
and then to do some compassion practice

110
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:50,240
can recognize that all beings have difficulties

111
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:56,159
whether it's disappointments

112
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:05,120
in their lives some physical pain discomfort

113
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,299
or loss

114
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:16,100
all kinds of laws

115
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:24,840
so we can imagine The Lovable being having some difficulties

116
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:31,260
maybe not the most tragic or difficult again we start where

117
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,679
it's easy

118
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:46,340
and to connect with the tenderness the care

119
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:55,020
like arises when we imagine consider remember

120
00:31:55,020 --> 00:32:03,419
the difficulties The Lovable being is experiencing or has experienced

121
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:10,158
again there's no need to go to the most difficult the most troubling

122
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:27,299
and can we connect with that with both The Lovable being and with a

123
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:31,340
sense of they're having dukkha

124
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,559
stress comfort

125
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:46,620
and tuning into becoming sensitive to

126
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:53,720
the tenderness that arises

127
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:20,960
again some people find it helpful to connect with the image

128
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:27,019
using the mind's eye so to speak

129
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:33,539
and that helps create the conditions for the tenderness

130
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:39,799
in the heart that's already there to come forth

131
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:52,799
some people find it helpful to tune into the bodily experience of this

132
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:58,799
tenderness towards the lovable being who's having

133
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:07,580
difficulties the feeling in the Heart Center Maybe

134
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:24,560
and some people find it helpful to say phrases

135
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:33,559
to help them connect with this compassion

136
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,940
we might say something like

137
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:49,398
may you be free from suffering

138
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,660
may you know peace

139
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:11,960
may you be free from suffering

140
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,820
may you know peace

141
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:11,000
we do compassion practice

142
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:20,660
it's a way to tenderize the heart in some kind of way

143
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:29,720
so that we can show up for ourselves and show up for others

144
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:36,079
with openness and warmth and care

145
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:45,000
which turns out to be transformative

146
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,220
both for ourselves and for others that we meet

147
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,400
so may our practicing compassion together this morning

148
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:10,440
today be for the benefit of all beings

149
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,040
everywhere

150
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:27,900
[Music]

151
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:46,020
so I wanted to talk a little bit about um cultivating compassion as I said at

152
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:51,240
the very beginning of the guided meditation for me from it feels like such a

153
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:56,339
remarkable thing that we don't have to

154
00:40:56,339 --> 00:41:04,079
be satisfied with our factory setting so to speak with uh the way that we our

155
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:10,619
heart opens or has room for or meets difficulties but instead we can

156
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:15,900
cultivate we can practice we can develop compassion

157
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:23,460
it's a remarkable thing I think sometimes we underestimate the transformation that

158
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:30,680
is possible with some practice and certainly the Buddha recognized this

159
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:37,740
with mindfulness practice with all these practices right with concentration practices they fold path

160
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:42,560
and certainly with the Brahma vihara practices

161
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:50,579
they do make a difference and they can be transformational in the same way

162
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:56,040
that all other things that we learn can be can have an influence on us and that is

163
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:01,440
drop by drop into the water jug is drop

164
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,480
by drop into The Jug is how it's How the water drug is filled or something like

165
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,760
that so each moment in which we spend time

166
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:18,359
cultivating has an effect even though we might not see it

167
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:25,980
at that time and certainly during meditation just because we're creating the conditions

168
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:31,079
in which Compassion or indeed loving kindness any Brahma vahara

169
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:36,359
might arise doesn't mean that it is going to arise

170
00:42:36,359 --> 00:42:40,579
we're just putting the conditions in place

171
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:48,480
it's often the impact or the effects

172
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:55,320
of uh Brahma vahara practice isn't felt or seen on the cushion like during the

173
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:03,180
meditation but it shows up in our daily life as a way that slowly our default

174
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:09,799
reaction the difficulties or different um

175
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:18,380
situations that we find ourselves in just starts to be one more and more of warmth and care

176
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:24,780
so I just want to offer this that even though in the meditation practice is

177
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:31,140
certainly contrived um but it's a purposeful way in which we

178
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:38,359
can develop loving kindness and compassion any of the Brahma vahuras

179
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:43,859
does and even though it might feel like well I don't nothing's really happening

180
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:50,400
during this meditation period don't think that this isn't having an

181
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:57,599
effect that it isn't you know creating the conditions for changes

182
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:03,119
certainly that's been the case for me I'll just share that uh since doing some

183
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:08,640
regular um Brahma vahara practice loving kindness and compassion

184
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:13,920
Equanimity and sympathetic Joy I've noticed that

185
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:20,280
I've I'm more often saying warm-hearted or funny things to

186
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:27,300
myself when I notice that I'm making mistakes or where I'm forget something or

187
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:35,460
whereas before there used to be like a tone of little bit of disappointment or even some meanness

188
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:40,859
now there's some tenderness in this little inner voice when it speaks to myself

189
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:47,540
oh Toyota it's okay it's quite something

190
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:55,800
so I'm Gail earlier this week talked about compassion he or yesterday specifically he spoke about it having

191
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:01,560
different elements it is a contact with suffering

192
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:06,780
caring about this suffering and being motivated to do something about the

193
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:12,180
suffering so these different elements all come

194
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:18,599
together and you know different strengths different you know of course at

195
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:25,140
different times there's different emphases but I appreciate something very much that uh

196
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:32,460
Jill Shepard a really great Dharma teacher has said that she said that meta

197
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:41,780
I'm sorry that uh compassion is the love child of meta and Duca that is

198
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:49,140
compassion is what arises what is born out of when this warm-heartedness meets

199
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:56,540
difficulty sort of someone else having difficulties or ourselves having difficulties so I like this idea of

200
00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:03,260
karuna compassion being the love child of meta and dukha

201
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:12,420
so I wanted to read just a short little excerpt from the sutas that talks about

202
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:19,260
the expressing um compassion and and one way that the Buddha described it

203
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:27,839
showing up in the world and it's an excerpt and then Buddha says

204
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:34,140
there are some who have given up and then there's this long list of

205
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:41,900
Maybe things that aren't so helpful so this long list includes covetousness ill will

206
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:49,859
irritability hostility offensiveness contempt jealousy stinginess deviousness

207
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:55,500
deceit unhelpful desires and wrong view it's really long list

208
00:46:55,500 --> 00:47:01,800
so there are some who have given these up and the Buddha continues and when they have given these up they are

209
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:07,859
practicing the way that is proper for someone who is a practitioner who's a

210
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:13,260
follower of his and then he goes on and he says And when

211
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:20,880
they see themselves cleansed or abandoned these uh these unskillful

212
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,460
qualities these unwholesome qualities gladness Springs up

213
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:35,940
there's a certain amount of gladness like oh I don't have all those qualities anymore and then when gladness arises then Joy

214
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:41,940
arises I know when Joy arises Tranquility arises

215
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:48,359
and then when Tranquility arises happiness arises and then when happiness arises

216
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:54,660
concentration arises and then with concentration then the

217
00:47:54,660 --> 00:48:02,040
person goes can does loving kindness practice and they meditate spreading a Heart full

218
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:07,920
of love to One Direction and to the second and to the third and

219
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:15,599
to the fourth Direction we might say this to the east to the South to the west to the north

220
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:22,020
and in the same way above below across everywhere and all around

221
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:30,300
they spread a Heart full of love to the whole whole world abundant expansive Limitless free of

222
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:36,180
enmity and ill will I'll just say briefly some of you may

223
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:42,060
recognize that little sequence of getting rid of things that are

224
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:47,640
and wholesome are unhelpful and then it goes into gladness Joy Tranquility

225
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:52,920
happiness and concentration might recognize this as what um Gill was

226
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:59,099
calling Dharma samadhi or samadhi Dharma at Dharma Samara I think and he did a

227
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:04,800
number of 7 A.M talks on this so kind of like connecting that to this Brahma

228
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:10,680
vahara practice but then this teaching goes on from the

229
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:16,140
Buddha so after having some concentration and then spreading loving

230
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:23,339
kindness and then the teaching goes on to say and they meditate spreading a Heart full

231
00:49:23,339 --> 00:49:29,160
of compassion in One Direction second Direction third

232
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:34,500
Direction the fourth Direction and in its exact same way that was it

233
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:39,780
said about loving kindness then it goes to compassion

234
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:46,260
so we can maybe like translate this kind of like operationalize it if you will

235
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:52,020
we can think about it as first to let go of what gets in the way

236
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:57,060
of as part of the way to cultivate is to as

237
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:04,079
best we can so some ways that things that might get

238
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:13,260
in the way of cultivating and practicing with compassion is having fear that we might be too overwhelmed when we

239
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:18,540
meet the suffering remember that loving the compassion is

240
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:23,579
when loving kindness this warmth meets difficulties

241
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:30,119
then there's the this compassion this tenderness that just naturally arises

242
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:36,300
but it's of course we might have some hesitation we might have some

243
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:43,980
reluctance initially to kind of like really meet the suffering after all we're hardwired to avoid it to

244
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:50,520
meet difficulties so it's natural and sometimes it's appropriate maybe it's not time for us to touch into

245
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:57,359
the suffering of a lovable being or of our own or maybe we're just don't quite have the steadiness to meet the

246
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:02,880
suffering of others so part of the way we can practice with

247
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:09,720
this is to cultivate some mindfulness and some clear seeing

248
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:16,500
so that we can first recognize whether our hesitation is just a knee-jerk reaction towards

249
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:21,540
fear and or to recognize it's just a natural

250
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:28,500
hesitation as well as some mindfulness some stability of mind and being present for

251
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:33,599
what's happening can help us to become familiar with our

252
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:41,099
own suffering because often what happens when we meet the suffering of others is the

253
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:47,099
unfinished business of our own hearts to use an expression that Jack kornfill

254
00:51:47,099 --> 00:51:52,140
uses the indigenous business of our hearts gets activated when we meet the

255
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:57,660
suffering of others so maybe it's worthwhile to spend some

256
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:03,300
time working with our own suffering that to increase our capacity as well as to

257
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:09,000
gain some familiarity when is our little bit of hesitation of meeting the suffering

258
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,460
when is it just a natural reaction or when is it some real wisdom say now is

259
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:20,880
not the time so we can spend some time with um

260
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:26,880
mindfulness practice and maybe getting some stability of mind like we did in

261
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:34,260
the guided meditation and like in the suit uh if we use this word uh concentrations Mari can also be

262
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:41,700
translated as collectedness or some non-distraction or sense of wholeness or

263
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:47,240
integrity in some ways it might be like

264
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:52,920
putting in place a keel in the sailboat that is you know that big long piece

265
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:59,940
that's at the bottom of the sailboat that helps prevent it from getting tipped over when it hits maybe the winds

266
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:06,119
of some suffering this is one way to how we can begin our

267
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:12,780
practice and to work with some of the difficulties we might have and then we might like warm the heart

268
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:19,619
maybe we might imagine putting on having some kindling

269
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:24,720
um and lighting the kindling maybe even sometimes it's paper things

270
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:31,140
that can catch a flame quickly and easily so we do some loving kindness practice

271
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:38,520
again starting where it's easy and allowing the heart to feel warm

272
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:46,140
and maybe the the coziness of sitting in front of some crackling

273
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:50,900
flames in a nice way in a really nice way

274
00:53:51,359 --> 00:54:00,020
and then we can imagine some difficulties but the lovable being is having

275
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:07,859
and then allowing that warmth that is already there to be transformed into some tenderness and some care

276
00:54:07,859 --> 00:54:13,079
and some able to connect with the suffering to care about it and to have a

277
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:19,920
willingness to do something about the the suffering and recognizing that at the moment we're

278
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:27,680
sitting in meditation doesn't mean we're going to get up from our meditation and go fix things

279
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:34,339
to recognize that sincere wish for the suffering to end

280
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:42,720
and we can do this as I said in the guided meditation just using our imagination and tuning

281
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:48,599
into the connection that we are having with a lovable being and a lovable being

282
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:54,300
that's having difficulties and just radiate compassion

283
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:59,760
that's what's in the suit does and then a later adaptation is to

284
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:05,339
include the phrases which is very common today and I often

285
00:55:05,339 --> 00:55:12,420
am using phrases sometimes I'm just doing radiating maybe it's a can play and experiment

286
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:17,640
with different ways and phrases that um

287
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:25,020
might be helpful to use is may you be free from suffering

288
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:31,319
may you know peace and you might have your own versions of

289
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:38,400
that so some way in which we can

290
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,500
practice compassion cultivate it develop it

291
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:50,579
by purposefully bringing it into our meditation practice which will help us meet it or bring

292
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:57,680
compassion when we meet difficulties in the world either in ourselves or others

293
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:02,480
so I'm wishing you

294
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:09,440
freedom from suffering freedom from difficulties

295
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:15,720
but if you find that they do arise may you have some

296
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:22,700
warmth and tenderness and care for yourself compassion for yourself

297
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:30,680
and may our Care Connection compassion for ourselves and for others

298
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:37,319
May that benefit all beings or beings everywhere

299
00:56:37,319 --> 00:56:39,980
thank you
