1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:10,960
there okay great so a warm warm welcome to you all to happy

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:18,480
hour lovely to be with you to feel your presence in cyberspace

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,359
in this moment in time and the theme for our practice today um

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:31,320
i'd like to invite us to to explore

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:41,760
the sense of interest investigation curiosity for resistance

6
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,800
so something very specific i'm pointing to let me let me unpack that so

7
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,840
so this practice i want to invite us to explore and

8
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,879
pay close attention it's not about thinking about the past

9
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:10,159
or the future or circumstances in life it's not a lot of thinking it's not a thinking practice

10
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,080
what it is it's about what is arising in this moment

11
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,680
right here right now in our bodies in our

12
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,720
hearts in the emotional space in the experiential space it's not so much

13
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:35,040
spinning out and thinking about things but what what is felt what is

14
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:42,400
what is known what is known and then

15
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:49,920
noticing if there isn't resistance if there is a pushing away of reality how

16
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,360
it presents itself right now and

17
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:02,560
there could be some say unpleasantness in the body unpleasantness in the emotional space and the mind

18
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,640
um in the thought space too but again present present moment let it be felt in

19
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:16,879
the body and then being curious being really gently lovingly curious

20
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,640
about that resistance about that pushing away

21
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,160
this curiosity is not about pushing away the pushing away it's not

22
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,680
about adding aversion to aversion which gives it more power

23
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,879
and it doesn't solve anything but it's about

24
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,239
releasing or one might say healing healing these

25
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,800
nooks and crannies and edges of our hearts and minds that often hide

26
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,480
often hide because we just push it away we resist it we don't want it to be this way and then we

27
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,519
fall into thinking habitual pattern problem solving okay how do i do this

28
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,760
how do i shift and change my life my relationships my this my that ah

29
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:18,959
it becomes you became to become tight but to actually feel into

30
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,519
what is what is the edge here what is the edge here and can we even if we don't

31
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,760
like it even we don't like how things are right now can we release into it

32
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,840
with curiosity with love with interest with care and care and

33
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:46,640
interest are synonymous to love and meta sense of being undefended the sense of being open to

34
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,720
what is arising in the experiential field

35
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,480
and letting letting it teach us letting it teach us

36
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,720
what needs to be what needs to be known in this moment and it take this practice

37
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,920
takes patience it's not okay i have an insight i just let go into it okay i

38
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,959
know exactly what to do but it it takes patience it actually trains

39
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,840
us in patience in non-reactivity

40
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,720
i'll say that again it trains us in the value of patience and kanti

41
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,800
and non-reactivity kante this beautiful board

42
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,400
patience in the ten perfections ten parameters in buddhism sense of patience

43
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,960
with an opening to an and um it's not resigning it's not giving in

44
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,479
it's not giving up but there's a sense of aliveness there's an aliveness of

45
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,520
curiosity aliveness of interest for right here

46
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:12,320
right now which is which becomes the leading edge of our growth the leading edge the

47
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,000
the inside producing edge of where we haven't been before in our

48
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,120
psyche in our minds in our hearts in our humanity just being patient

49
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,600
because if we get to difficulty and or and we go into habitual patterns of resistance we don't like you like how do

50
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,199
we fix we're doing the same thing over and over and over again like this karmic knot

51
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,800
that maybe we have and we keep just tightening it further and further

52
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,198
but having gentle loving curiosity

53
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,600
releasing into it and being patient lovingly for ourselves for what is arising

54
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:00,320
and this can be transformative can be transformative can be the way

55
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:10,560
the way into loving what is loving what is opening the door into further

56
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:18,720
being fully being perhaps becoming maybe i'll use that becoming yourselves more fully

57
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,479
so maybe what i'm teaching or what i've just taught seems conceptual seems

58
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:30,560
complicated uh i hope it isn't because i'm giving very specific and clear

59
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,479
instructions and i do see some of you taking notes which is great because this is a step-by-step

60
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:42,479
direction so [Music]

61
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:49,120
so if it seems so heady don't worry about it i'll lead us into a guided meditation for us to explore

62
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:56,240
but one thing to remember just to simplify one thing to remember

63
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,639
ah whatever arises in this moment not future not past not thinking if there's

64
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,880
a story let go of the story right away come back let go of the story come back to the

65
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,800
feeling in the heart in the mind and gently explore gently open to with

66
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,319
curiosity don't have to think about it's not thinking but just being with

67
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,639
what happens if you if you just sit with it sit with what is arising

68
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,479
let it teach you whatever it needs to teach you maybe the lesson takes

69
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:39,039
days or weeks but but is worth staying with all right

70
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:46,240
let's let's give it a try so so let's practice together

71
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,319
so i'd like to invite you to land in your

72
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,280
body in this moment

73
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,120
ah here here

74
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:21,440
letting go letting go of whatever has come before

75
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,280
letting go of even thinking about

76
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:33,680
what tonight's theme is about just let go arriving here

77
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,640

78
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,079
the simplicity of this body breathing

79
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,839
just breathing in breathing out

80
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:17,120
let the breath be nourishing in the body connecting you to your feet

81
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,519
and the earth

82
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:46,839
the breath moving through [Music] the lower abdomen

83
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,760
letting go letting go if thoughts arise

84
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:33,320
thanking them for coming and saying not now gently ever so gently

85
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:41,839
ah landing landing in this body with this breath refuge

86
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,480
taking refuge

87
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,600
just this breath this body

88
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:22,800
let awareness connect with the in-breath with the entirety of the in-breath

89
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,200
the entirety of the out-breath

90
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,360
in your sit bones to ground you

91
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:54,640
now spending a few minutes feeling your sit bones your bottom on the cushion

92
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,680

93
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:09,240
in breath opera

94
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,680
let the breath be calming soothing

95
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,399
and can each breath in breath and out breath

96
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,279
be comforting

97
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,959
as if you were breathing in kindness

98
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,600

and let each out breath breathing out kindness

110
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,678
breathing out good well

111
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:30,240
around you all around you into the space around you

112
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:38,000
so that with each breath your body your mind your heart

113
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,159
is permeated with

114
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:50,320
goodwill and with each out breath breathe out all around you

115
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:57,280
and don't try too hard don't try to control just

116
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:05,600
let it let it be happening it's already happening each every single one of us

117
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,679
as goodness inside us trust it trust

118
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:19,440
this goodness that receives care from the universe and breathes about

119
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,360
and breath and out breath

120
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:17,440
that whatever difficulty is arising perhaps in the body or in the mind right now

121
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,440
let it be infused with the breath with kindness

122
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:32,200
relaxing releasing with each breath with each out breath

123
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:06,480
and now you can stay with the breath breathing in breathing out

124
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:13,200
meta into the body the heart the mind

125
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,120
maybe that's what is needed today

126
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:25,799
maybe that's all that is needed right now and if so trust it

127
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:32,000
continue to be nourished and healed in this way

128
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,600
to benefit yourself and all others

129
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:51,440
and if you like to take on the suggestions

130
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,759
you're welcome to and yet let them be from

131
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:04,640
your body following them with your heart not with your head

132
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:14,080
these invitations are not to think about but to explore in your lived experience

133
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,919
so feeling your breath in your body

134
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,720
your abdomen and your heart center and your feet

135
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,520
and your hands and your shoulders

136
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,519
feeling embodied

137
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:49,480
invite your heart to open up to relax into

138
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:57,280
whatever is arising right now in this moment in the body

139
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,200
there is an emotion a body sensation

140
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,720
a feeling if it's a story let it go

141
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,840
if it's the story let it go come back to the body

142
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,039
open up to the felt sense in the body

143
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:45,640
see if there can be some gentle kind curiosity

144
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:58,120
interest not resisting whatever is here even if it's challenging or difficult

145
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:14,480
at the sense of grandmotherly mind tell me everything child remember tell

146
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,200
me everything

147
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,760
your heart your mind opening

148
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:32,960
this challenge in the body the heart in the mind not the story not the story

149
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,760
but to be known as a felt sense

150
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,880
without resistance

151
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:57,159
just breathe and be patient

152
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,000
making more space in your heart

153
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:18,480
maybe it's a headache let it be just as it is not to fix it

154
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:25,840
push it away just breathe with it

155
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,440
gently opening up

156
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,640
it's a very subtle interest

157
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,320
interest synonymous with love

158
00:26:52,200 --> 00:27:00,360
expansively hold whatever is happening give it space

159
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,320
fashioning a new pattern a new way of being

160
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:33,960
new way of being with what may be challenging

161
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:07,679
just breathe be breathed be with what is arising

162
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,278
without an agenda

163
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:50,520
this sense of open curiosity gentle

164
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:59,279
allowing being with the synonymous with meta

165
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:06,080
with care in the deepest sense

166
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:14,640
not pushing away fixing but really

167
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,640
deeply making space

168
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,320
with a huge breath for what is

169
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,720
and you don't have to get answers

170
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,720
simply with humility sit with interest

171
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,960
and care

172
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:52,519
and for the last minutes of this practice period

173
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:59,840
letting there be a radical acceptance of whatever rose or did not arise

174
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,559
in this practice period

175
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:20,480
opening the doors of your heart as if embracing a big hug

176
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,760
thank you for sitting thank you for showing up

177
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,520
for yourself hugging yourself with your own care with your own meta

178
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:37,358
regardless of what happened or did not happen you showed up you did your best

179
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:46,000
let this be a moment of radical acceptance and care

180
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,878
patience interest

181
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,358
love

182
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,760
and may or cultivation of care interest

183
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:10,320
care for ourselves and for others

184
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:16,160
the way we can sit for our own challenges we can offer to others not

185
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:23,279
trying to fix make it go away

186
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:31,920
because we are uncomfortable with our own suffering but to make space with care

187
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,599
curiosity and patience may our cultivation

188
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:43,520
be of service to all beings everywhere including ourselves

189
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:49,640
may all beings be happy may all beings be free

190
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,440
thank you all thank you for your practice

191
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,838
so invitations to be

192
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:21,040
to let go of the story to open up with curiosity interest

193
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:27,760
patience and radical acceptance of what arises in the heart

194
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:34,480
and in the body to fashion a new way of being with what arises

195
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:41,599
so we have time and space for reflection or two you

196
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:47,520
can raise your zoom hand you can also type in chat if it's typed

197
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,880
to me privately i will only read your

198
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,880
reflection not your name it's typed to everyone i'll read your name also

199
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:05,119
any aha moments any questions about this practice maybe

200
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:10,400
something opened up for you that was unexpected

201
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:21,560
or maybe it was challenging or maybe you were not clear as to what to do

202
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,400
one reflection privately to me absolutely beautiful

203
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:36,960
i'm delighted to hear that and if you are moved to share what came up for you for the benefit of

204
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:42,560
the sangha i invite you but don't feel compelled you can type it

205
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,839
in chat privately if you like

206
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:04,720
maybe we're all very quiet right now so tell you what if there aren't any reflections right now jerry i'll make

207
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:10,240
space please jerry um

208
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:17,200
thanks i guess i was finding it

209
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,960
i was trying to understand what was different from what i would normally do

210
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,240
in terms of i did try to follow your directions so i was happy when you said oh well

211
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:34,079
let's go and try to do some meditation

212
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:41,359
and so i was just trying to understand what was to be different in this meditation

213
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:48,160
from others so perhaps i'm a bit simple here but i just didn't get what was the

214
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,280
difference ah well maybe this is what you usually do i

215
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:59,920
don't know what it is you usually do jerry so i can't answer that question i wish i could be in your mind and i could

216
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:07,920
read your mind would be fun if i were a mind reader but i don't know so it's for you to discover

217
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:14,079
my dear okay thanks how's that zen answer

218
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,560
you it's true thanks jerry

219
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:29,119
um a couple of reflections i'll read them and then we'll go into groups

220
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:35,440
let's see here uh one person says the best i was able to do is to bring my attention back to the

221
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,480
breath there was so much shatter in my mind no problem just bringing the

222
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:46,720
tension back to the breath is is beautiful practice especially

223
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:53,280
appropriate if there's a lot of chatter just called it no this is chattery buddha this is busy mind buddha

224
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,560
it's okay no no judgment uh another person says so awesome not to

225
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:04,160
be with inner critic meta and loving kindness to you ah to you as well

226
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:10,400
another reflection aligns closely with where i've been trying to go beautiful

227
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:17,440
another reflection i've enjoyed this practice tried standing

228
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:23,520
quietly which kept me alert and in my body great beautiful i'm glad that you tried to

229
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:29,040
stand up take care of your body your sleepiness very skillful to do

230
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:35,280
that keep yourself alert and in the body beautiful thank you for all those practice reports

231
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:42,240
so appreciate them one after another great so dear ones um

232
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:49,200
let's turn to uh practicing in community

233
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:55,599
and and the um reflection the invitation

234
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:01,200
as always is to first take care of yourselves take care

235
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:07,280
of each other with kindness um in the breakout groups

236
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:13,200
um maybe going in reverse alphabetical order and um

237
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:18,640
and the prompt tonight is um with this practice is there something

238
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:23,920
that you perhaps explore that seemed different for you opened up or maybe not

239
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,280
it was similar or maybe you don't know could just be the question of i don't know

240
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:35,359
and and what particularly about the steps that we went through if anything

241
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:43,200
was new to you or is this what you usually do aligns with what do you do what is what which of those steps is

242
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:49,680
really um lights you up is really how you've discovered is really uh

243
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:55,839
opening for you is it the letting go of the stories is it the putting with curiosity staying in your

244
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:01,839
body could be all of them but maybe being clear about one helps you be

245
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:07,040
witnessed by others each person can offer a nugget could be

246
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:13,839
i don't know it could be the silence i pass right now the next person will offer a nugget the next person offer a

247
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:20,000
nugget and we'll go round and round a few times make sure everybody has a chance to

248
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:28,640
share and and uh um yeah and be witnessed so please take care of

249
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:34,000
each other take care of yourselves and it's going to take me another minute to

250
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,440
to finish creating these rooms please be patient

251
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:45,838
with me and um

252
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:54,079
i'm taking a long breath here we go

253
00:42:54,079 --> 00:43:01,200

254
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:08,440

256
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:13,920
all right so the rooms are all closed everybody is back and we've got just about a couple of

257
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,960
minutes um for any reflections what might have come

258
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:24,760
up in the rooms any aha moments

259
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,960
questions

260
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:41,440
mary so

261
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:48,960
a question um i experienced a lot of physical agitation and mental agitation

262
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:57,040
and um you know emotions that just felt like they were overtaking me and my body it wasn't a

263
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:02,400
decision my body i'm in a swivel chair and my body just turned

264
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:07,760
and then i settled back down and it it was more doable and i guess my

265
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:15,520
question is is that skillful or unskillful and should i stay with

266
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:21,119
what feels like terror yeah yeah thank you for sharing that

267
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:26,319
mary and and listening to let me reflect back to you what i heard because i think the

268
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:32,400
answer is already there so so you said that when

269
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:39,200
just you're being assailed and it was with let's say mara with your assail with all these thoughts like the

270
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:46,240
trickster mara the in buddhism is the trickster with all these thoughts and and then your body so it wasn't so much

271
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:52,079
what i heard you say wasn't the decision like okay mary no it's turn it's like your body just like okay this is what

272
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:58,160
we're doing now mary i'm gonna take you for a ride like oh different perspective

273
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:03,520
right that's what i heard you say mary it was definitely the body there you go

274
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:10,799
so trust the wisdom of the body and there's a lot of wisdom in in in this shift it's it's like you know

275
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:18,079
when you're in a funk the best medicine is go for a walk like get out go for a walk

276
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:23,440
right you're let your body take you for a walk and you walk around like oh yeah different

277
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:30,079
perspective so the wisdom of bodies like all right darling turn around like okay different perspective so beautiful
