the breakout room so at this time I changed the settings so unmuting on

17
00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:01,560

24
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:48,720
um in honor of election day in the US um I wanted to invite us to practice

25
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,200
the fourth of the Brahma viharas the fourth of the Heavenly abodes the first

26
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,480
one being meta second one meta or loving kindness friendliness second one being

27

compassion passion third one being um vicarious Joy the fourth one being

28
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:13,159
equinity so it's a good time to practice Equanimity which is really related uh

29
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:21,000
closely related to good willll Clos to related related to compassion um and allow allows us

30
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,319
invites us to have a sense of presence and stability and peace even when things

31
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:35,959
are not stable or peaceful or whatever they might be um

32
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:41,879
so with the level of anxiety that that folks are reporting in the media and the

33
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:48,400
News no matter which side you're on it's practicing equinity kindness and

34
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:57,319
compassion for yourself and for everyone else who's in the same boat so it's great opportunity to practice so so with

35
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:03,720
that like to invite us to to settle arrive in our posture if you need

36
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:10,959
to move and shift

37
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:19,280
finding finding center of your gravity your

38
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:27,320
base your wide base so if you need to roll your

39
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,840
shoulders back a bit to open your chest it's a good idea so that you can sit

40
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:40,800
tall like a mountain sense of

41
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:53,320
integrity and feeling how your sit bones can have a sense of stability or

42
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,400
posture take a moment to really stabilize your

43
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:05,840
posture feel sitting in a chair can you really make sure that your feet

44
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,280
are solidly planted on the earth with a wide

45
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:21,520
stance that your chest is open your shoulders are wide you're not

46
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:28,160
collapsed there's a sense of Integrity

47
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,800
dignity to the brightness of how you're sitting in this

48
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:47,680
moment and as teacher Steven LaVine used to teach used to say strong back strong

49
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,960
torso back and soft belly

50
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:15,400
strong back soft belly

51
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:46,520
and can our belly the whole front of our body can it be soft can our heart be

52
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:57,039
soft while our back or sit bones are

53
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,680
strong stance of our

54
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:09,680

into what this means for you in your posture

56
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,520
and allowing awareness to

57
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,159

81
00:14:50,440 --> 00:15:00,040
favorite whether or not I may understand it things are unfolding

82
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:07,839
according to a lawful nature the law of causes and

83
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:29,000
conditions or may I be at peace

84
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:40,399
with the comings and goings of things with the impermanent arising and

85
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:50,880
passing unfolding of events

86
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,839

acknowledge that there are many causes and conditions unfolding

93

may my heart be at peace with things that cannot

94
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,799
change and remember being at peace does not mean

95
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,480
resignation may I have peace

96
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,159
may all beings be at

97
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760

112
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:41,279

people's Humanities we all want to be happy you might agree

117
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:21,520
disagree but can we wish Each Other Well hatred never ceases through

118
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:29,240
hatred but by Love Alone does it end this is an ancient and eternal love

119
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:36,000
as said the Buddha can we share our goodwi for our fellow humans

120

everywhere all human beings all [Music]

123
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:01,799
animals all sensient beings may they be free including

124
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:28,120
ourselves thank you everyone thank you for your practice

125
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:37,600
and the invitations tonight in the practice were very simple at first we

126
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:43,320
begun with settling in the body really stabilizing the body that

127
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:50,799
can go very very far whenever you feel find yourself overwhelmed notice what is the posture

128
00:28:50,799 --> 00:29:00,880
of your body is it a collapsed body is a distressed body can you open your chest can you plant your feet just a sense of

129
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,240
a posture of integrity and dignity sitting upright planting your feet

130
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,399
stably on the earth and I brought in this this way of

131
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:17,720
teaching from Steven LaVine the late teacher who talked about strong back and

132
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:24,159
soft belly strong back a sign of this The Stance of

133
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,760
stability and soft belly soft heart is sense of kindness compassion for

134
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,799
ourselves and others meta

135
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,919
kindness and then I invited us after taking some time to to stabilize with

136
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:46,159
the breath in breath out breath

137
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:52,279
stabilizing silently to drop in any of the equinity phrases that might work for

138
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:58,840
us at this time may I accept the comings and goings of things the unfolding of

139
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:05,880
things according to a lawful nature and what does lawful nature mean it's the law of causes and conditions because of

140
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:14,720
this this AR this arises because of that that arises so many causes and conditions leading to something to what

141
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:24,399
what arises in in our world um as um as a famous physicist has said

142
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:30,799
I'm trying to remember his name now it's I'm blanking on it but this statement is the quote is if you want to to make an

143
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:37,559
apple pie you have to create the whole universe first so everything depending on everything else

144
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:43,039
really and another statement of equinity is whether or not I understand that

145
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:50,360
things are according are unfolding according to a lawful nature whether or not I like it whether or not I like it

146
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:55,840
or not whether or not I understand it or not so this a statement of yeah things

147
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:02,639
are like this right now things are like this right now and and um acceptance is

148
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:09,440
not the same as giving up acceptance

149
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,720
means you accept that things are like this right now things causes and

150
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:21,039
conditions have led to what is arising so you're accepting the reality of the

151
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:29,240
situation not fighting the reality of how things right now are it doesn't

152
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:35,120
equate with resignation those two are very different

153
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:42,360
anyway and then I invited a lot of Silence maybe 10 or more minutes of

154
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:49,080
silence at the end for us to just settle as is supportive for us

155
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:56,960
um so so now we do have an opportunity if you like to join one

156
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:03,200
another to check in with our practice and I want to invite us to avoid any

157
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:09,399
political conversation because it's important for everyone no matter what their their opinions their beliefs are

158
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:15,360
to feel safe to feel comfortable and the invitation is really about our practice

159
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:23,399
what supports your equinity what supports equinity and please don't get into you know thinking and opinions but

160
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:31,559
maybe what supports my equinity is embodiment if I really come to this moment and and breathe deeply or or come

161
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:37,440
to a sense of compassion for myself or others come in humanity so stay with

162
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:45,720

211
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:27,960
tonight when you said your feet firmly on the ground that anchored me

212
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:34,319
I felt okay I'm on my I'm on planet Earth there's no asteroid at the moment

213
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:40,640
hitting the Earth and I feel my feet firmly on the ground it was a great way

to Anchor and stay in equinity thank you beautiful thank you

so much for sharing this this is so great oh it gladdens my heart to no end

216
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:58,400
that this seemingly simple but profound shift

217
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:05,480
was was experienced by you oh yeah feeling my feet on the ground it seems oh it's so simple yeah whatever but yeah

218
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:10,599
it's it's profound thank you jar really appreciate your reflection that's

219
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:18,119
great oh and I forgot to uh change chat because you're also uh invited to to

220
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:23,599
post your Reflections or questions in chat either publicly to everyone or just

221
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:29,200
privately to me in which case I won't read your name there's one question sent

222
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:34,280
to me privately question that I wonder if you could address my question from

223
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:41,839
yesterday how to give meta to a parent when constantly being hurt by a parent distancing is my go-to but still it

224
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:52,079
doesn't work yeah yeah um yeah it's it's hard it's painful so

225
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:57,359
in that situation it could be a parent could be anyone else but in particular with a parent you

226
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:04,319
can um you know um you can create some space

227
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:10,880
but but not take them you know with a friend perhaps leave them and and not

228
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:20,559
have them in your heart which actually reminds me of this beautiful teaching by um Sylvia borin who says um um don't

229
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:27,920
take don't take anyone out of your heart even if you might leave them out of your life so question sure if that might work

230
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:33,160
with a parent but anyway so um the invitation in that case is start with

231
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:40,119
compassion self-compassion for yourself of course and let your heart be uh full

232
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:46,720
let your heart be full with self-compassion for yourself and and you

233
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:52,839
may need to reduce contact or or um

234
00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:58,200
really support yourself so you're you don't get hurt and see try to see if you

235
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:05,200
can this is actually this is what can open your heart to compassion and meta for them to see their goodness because

236
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:12,960
our mind focuses on what's bad what's difficult the ways that they don't see us the way they hurt us but see the good

237
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,319
in them see how they have helped you and supported you or love you in their own

238
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:24,359
way um or maybe see their good qualities because not everybody I mean a human

239
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:29,440
being is not filled with is not uh we're all mixed bags that's what I'm trying to

240
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:37,000
say we're all in mixed bags so try to see the good in them and when we see the good in another that can open our

241
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,240
heart to um yeah to kindness when we

242
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:49,640
allow ourselves to see the good in another being and of course it doesn't mean that you completely open yourselves

243
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:55,480
or open yourself to being hurt you can still protect yourself in ways that are

244
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:02,520
wise but don't let your heart be completely closed it's not good for you it's not good for the other person I

245
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:08,359
it's a nuanced answer so I hope again this is recorded you can listen to it

246
00:49:08,359 --> 00:49:14,599
later again I made a lot of different points um you are welcome the person who asked the question says thank you you

247
00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:22,440
are very welcome okay I see arbara and Fred your hand is up

248
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:30,119
please by thank you Nikki uh I I was struck in our group by how the many

249
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:35,720
things we identified as being helpful in

250
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:42,920
approaching equinity uh how they're all free you know that uh no license require

251
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:48,599
no special training no tools don't need to go any place uh you know getting good

252
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:54,079
sleep exercise reaching out to people we love you know uh practicing with the

253
00:49:54,079 --> 00:50:02,000
intention of equinity are all things that are within our in our grasp for most of us most of

254
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,359
the time and um I don't know that just strikes me as

255
00:50:08,359 --> 00:50:13,559
being you know really different from a lot of American life where

256
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:19,440
there's you know presumably so much equip equipment and other things needed

257
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:26,880
to proceed in whatever you want to do in life and no here it is just the array is there at our fingertips

258
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:32,040
thank you thank you Fred well said well

259
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:40,160
said yes well said thank you so much indeed yeah and I was touched also by

260
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:45,799
what you said highlighting the intention really it starts with the

261
00:50:45,799 --> 00:50:51,760
intention um for for equinity for wisdom

262
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:57,839
for awareness for um presence yeah the

263
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:04,119
intention beautiful thank you for for those

264
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:10,799

271
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:56,839
all Diana I see your hand uh can you hear me yeah yeah okay

272
00:51:56,839 --> 00:52:04,079
uh one thing just struck me uh in your phrase in the phrases offered that this

273
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:09,599
time really stayed some um and it was

274
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:15,440
about I had the image of an old time situation where we're sitting around the

275
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:23,400
table and somebody's offering a prayer at a meal and and and your words were

276
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:33,040
were to the effect may we you know put down our opinions and seeing others with seeing

277
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:40,640
the others humanity and everyone wants to be happy and that person I'm I'm thinking of this

278
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:47,520
because I have people in my family where we have such we're just so different

279
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:55,200
I'll just leave it at that in our views and um it it really struck me that I

280
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:00,520
that I think this is something I can do I can I can finally

281
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:08,079
see and S our practice here another's humanity and and I know that he and they

282
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:14,480
want to be happy I know that they're human beings and seeing the good person's a wonderful father a wonderful

283
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:20,160
this this is I can see these but just putting down the

284
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:28,599
opinions what uh that's a big deal but it maybe not be such big deal um after

285
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:36,000
all so I could hear that even another 10,000 times and it it really opens up

286
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:44,319
opened me up so thank you thank you Diana well said well said and and as I

287
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:50,160
was leading and and planting these Reflections again and again for the I

288
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:57,599
don't know nth time millionth time again my heart opens even more and more we have to remind ourselves oh always of

289
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:03,520
these Reflections um so that they become the

290
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:10,000
they become the inclination of our minds as the Buddha says they might just

291
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:18,000
drop at a particular time when heart and mind are ready and um wow it just wow

292
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:24,400
you as if we hear it for the first time and even if we've heard it again and again keep reminding ourselves keep

293
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:29,440
reminding ourselves of of the Humanity that everybody wants to be happy and

294
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:34,960
again not condoning um harm hurt but but also

295
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:40,079
seeing people's humanity and that essentially we're we all want to be

296
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:47,520
happy even if different values are more important to us um maybe this is a good

297
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:53,000
time for me to bring um this reference that I've shared some time before which

298
00:54:53,000 --> 00:55:00,640
is a um research uh and book book by Jonathan hate the um

299
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:07,640
psychologist and researcher Professor I forget which university but but um he's

300
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:15,200
done very interesting work about um in about finding common grounds and

301
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:22,880
and when people disagree it's it's often about them prioritizing different values

302
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:32,200
so maybe one person um prior prioritizes loyalty more and another person values

303
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:38,440
Innovation more I don't know I'm just pulling these values out of a hat and it's not that one value is bad and the

304
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:44,640
other value is is good it's just different people have different values and and he's also done a lot of research

305
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:49,880
on say political disagreements and different people have different values

306
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:59,039
um that are more important to them in their ranking and and so it can really help find um um more compassion

307
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:04,720
understanding meta Common Ground not bad or good people different values so I do

308
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:15,839
refer you to uh look up Jonathan hate h AI d t h a DT Jonathan hates work and

309
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:21,319
one of his books is one of his very early books is called uh the happiness

310
00:56:21,319 --> 00:56:26,640
hypothesis and he has one chapter dedicated to it but dedicated to the but

311
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:31,280
he's done a lot more work since then I believe

312
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:40,319
