1
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:06,960
hey so getting started together I want to say that I appreciate

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,639
the um community that uh forms in the little

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,840
chat I um I do see that I don't see it while I'm teaching really because it's

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:25,000
too much but I do um check it out as we're coming in and I was appreciate the

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,400
warmth and friendliness and that many of you know each other and if any of you are new to today you're completely

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:40,280
welcome into our little online chat community so this week we are connecting

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,600
with various wholesome qualities as a support for our meditation so bringing

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:53,600
them in at the beginning and then allowing them to kind of just flavor their practice that we do and I hope

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,120
you'll see over the course of the week that this is a skillful thing to do and you're free to do it in whatever way

10
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:07,280
works for you if you find it valuable so the quality for today is

11
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,600
generosity such as sharing our care in the chat with each

12
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:21,799
other and let's settle in now for sitting so finding a posture that's

13
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:26,119
comfortable giving your body some

14
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,600
care maybe you're sitting maybe you're lying

15
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,280
down or something else and just allowing the attention to

16
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,600
come

17
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,000
inward feeling how the body is from the

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,960
inside not an idea or what you think it would look like in the mirror but what

19
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,280
it feels like to be in this body right now

20
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:08,438
whether it's comfortable or not however much energy there

21
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:16,480
is and just settling into to that

22
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:25,239
softening maybe taking a couple of long slow deep breaths

23
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:34,080
in and on the exhale letting the body settled into its

24
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,599
posture perhaps finding as you settle out the obvious tensions there's an

25
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:45,959
internal strength or energy that you can touch

26
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:54,200
into I find the body kind of naturally wants to be upright

27
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,799
perhaps feeling that contact points where you're sitting your weight is

28
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:18,280
resting on something and feeling those pressure points and softening into them

29
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,640
allowing yourself to be supported

30
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,480
giving your weight over to what you're sitting

31
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,319
on connecting in with the simple feelings of

32
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:02,079
breathing in and out so that we have kind of

33
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:08,720
a simple rhythmic connection to the

34
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,959
present natural breath

35
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:41,240
and in this sitting we'll again begin with a a simple use of the mental aspect of

36
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,600
the mind to deliberately bring in a

37
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,919
memory of a time when you did an act

38
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:58,039
that I'm going to call clean generosity so it means it was simple and

39
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:03,800
direct and easy nothing complex that you had to arrange

40
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:09,759
or debate about whether you were doing just something that was so easy

41
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,919
like as simple as holding the door for someone or

42
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:20,800
um petting a dog that looked like it wanted

43
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:27,840
petting handing somebody uh the change that they couldn't find in their wallet

44
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,199
at the checkout and saying here I've got

45
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:41,319
that something really simple like that and just take into the body what it

46
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:50,840
feels like to recall that moment allowing it to register

47
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:08,840
breathing with it maybe allowing it to get distributed through the cells the

48
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:16,599
way the breath does and not to be grandiose or put a

49
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:21,599
self into it it was just staying with the

50
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:34,919
feeling and then switch to recall a time when you received

51
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:40,759
someone else's generosity again in a really simple

52
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:45,440
way maybe it wasn't even somebody that you

53
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:52,800
knew how does it feel in the body to recall that

54
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,520
situation so really taking that in also

55
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,080
then letting go of this mental activity

56
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:34,599
of bringing up memories and coming back into the fully into the

57
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:40,440
present moment feeling the body sitting the

58
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:48,240
breath and maybe really tuning in to the energetic side of the

59
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,280
body flow of Life Force in the

60
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:04,240
body and then also including the emotional side the

61
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,039
heart allowing those to

62
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:21,159
integrate it's fine if in the present moment we have some difficult emotions

63
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:27,440
or pain in the body that's all part of the

64
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,839
field Maybe will remember that feeling of simple generosity and just allow

65
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,399
those to be

66
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,800
there and then gently relaxing even further in just taking

67
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,959
up the

68
00:08:54,519 --> 00:09:00,800
mindfulness the flow of occurrences in the body in

69
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:09,160
minded perhaps with a focus like the breath perhaps more open

70
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,399
awareness just letting that flow

71
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
on

72
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
e

73
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

74
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

75
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,279
e e

76
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:27,800
can there be a sense in our way of meeting

77
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:35,680
experience of generosity of giving the wholesome

78
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:44,800
States our full attention or appreciation sometimes we skip over our

79
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:52,800
wholesomeness and for the UNH wholesome more giving them space to be

80
00:12:52,800 --> 00:13:01,120
there but not get further entrenched let's say

81
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:08,360
so having a sense of how to guide ourselves with the normal flow of

82
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:16,000
recurrences such that the Mind stays fresh and free and on

83
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:24,040
track we can bring in the other qualities we've worked with like

84
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,920
clarity about what is helpful and what is not

85
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:38,279
and then having a very open and yet clear attitude about how to

86
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:44,040
be with whatever is arising for

87
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:57,199
us like a good guide for

88
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
ourselves

89
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

90
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

91
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

92
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

93
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

94
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

95
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

96
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

97
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

98
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

99
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

100
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

101
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,640
e e

102
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:31,240
a deeper aspect of generosity really just a deepening and

103
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:40,000
a spreading of it is Letting Go it's the same movement of

104
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,729
mind that gives and that lets [Music]

105
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:53,559
go so allowing the mind to continually

106
00:21:53,559 --> 00:22:01,640
release what is arising generously taking it in seeing

107
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:09,840
it and then letting it go to turn to the next

108
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,799
thing resting in the sense of Letting Go

109
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,840
that allows experience to keep flowing

110
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

111
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

112
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

113
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

114
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

115
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,278
e e

116
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:06,120
one of the fruits of meditation practice is to begin to meet

117
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:13,480
experience with a generosity of spirit generosity of heart if you

118
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:19,799
prefer and that can begin internally with

119
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:27,159
the willingness to greet and be with whatever

120
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:32,240
arises it's not all Pleasant it's not all

121
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:38,799
wholesome but to have a generosity of spirit okay this is

122
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:45,640
here and then further to appreciate and really let register what is wholesome

123
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:54,159
what is beautiful because there's a lot of that too starting to become able to tolerate

124
00:27:54,159 --> 00:28:03,320
the fullness of experience the fullness of this being human and for some it's a big process to

125
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:12,120
release the resistance the holding the oh I don't know about that kind of

126
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:19,200
feeling I think it's quite ongoing for us to keep opening that

127
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:27,120
way and it then can spill outward and start to come into our life in certain

128
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,880
ways meeting other people with a generosity of

129
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:41,240
heart seeing them as the complex beings that they are having seen our own

130
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:49,600
complexity and so affording them some flexibility in our

131
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:55,320
response some generosity and Imagining the possibilities for

132
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:03,518
them some willingness to release or reactivity that might come

133
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:10,720
up so less often meeting the world with a sense of grasping or

134
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:19,320
fear or resistance or attack or dulling out Turning

135
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:27,039
Away more and more having the width and breadth of heart that we can

136
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:32,320
meet what is arising in some

137
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:38,559
way and find a skillful approach to it there isn't just

138
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:46,200
one so we'll each find our way but this generosity of heart and

139
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:54,840
spirit can be felt by others and it even if they don't know what it is quite

140
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:02,720
consciously it's a feeling that's brought and it tends to bring out the possibilities for

141
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:10,720
others so the world needs this kind of energy and it can't be faked but the

142
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:17,480
degree to which our practice cultivates it we can become aware of it and let it

143
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:27,600
express so may there be just a sliver more of the generosity part as you go

144
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,720
out into into the world today

145
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:08,880
so we'll continue on with these 10 uh

146
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:15,960
attributes or epithets of the Buddha's mind which we'll talk about nine of them

147
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:23,159
in detail and we've seen up to now uh that the Buddha's mind was free of all

148
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:28,720
defilements and he was able to manifest that in his behavior and way way of

149
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:36,840
meeting life and then furthermore he turned that liberated mind toward seeing

150
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:42,840
clearly How the Universe operates how it is for people with their minds and

151
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:49,240
bodies and Karma and life and death he he was willing to take in the whole

152
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:54,840
picture the beautiful The Not So Beautiful uh he saw and understood all

153
00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:01,320
of that and was not couldn't be thrown off by any of that so these are captured

154
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:06,840
in these epithets we've talked about so far AR

155
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:13,480
S V Charo sug and Loca

156
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,559
Vu and that could be the end of the story you know he had complete knowledge

157
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:25,240
inner and outer and those two aren't so separate for a Buddha um but it isn't

158
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:31,440
the end of the story actually because the Buddha chose to act and specifically

159
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:38,760
he chose to teach so the two attributes or epithets for today are about the

160
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:45,919
Buddha's skill in teaching he was a great teacher and we are all the

161
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:52,240
beneficiaries of that still learning his teachings to this

162
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,960
day so remember that we're meant to you know reflect on these qualities and turn

163
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,320
them over in our mind and when we

164
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:09,679
consider this great teaching of the Buddha we can be uplifted and inspired

165
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:18,679
by that we might also see that some of how we train and teach ourselves is

166
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:24,120
there we've learned something from the teachings about how to guide ourselves

167
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:32,480
skillfully I mean nobody's there with you on the cushion and kind of my voice comes in sometimes but um you know it's

168
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,679
you and your mind so you know how are we training and teaching ourselves

169
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:43,039
throughout the day guiding ourselves and then third um reflecting

170
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:48,559
on the Buddha's teaching qualities can can prompt us to consider our qualities

171
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:57,120
as students also so these are some of the things I want to bring in today as we talk about the the two attributes

172
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:07,480
that relate to to teaching so the first is a longish one it's ano porad

173
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:14,240
sarti and sarti is a trainer it's literally was the name of a profession

174
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:22,800
like an elephant trainer or a horse trainer you know back in the Buddhist time and anuo means unexcelled there's

175
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:31,158
no one better and Puris sadama is an interesting word um pora means person

176
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:39,560
and then uh dhama has to do with taming it's not to be confused with dhma d h m

177
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:46,839
m a that's the Dharma this is dhma d m ma a it's a different word and it has to

178
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:55,000
do with taming so porad is usually translated as persons To Be Tamed so the

179
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:02,400
full phrase um is usually trans ated as unexcelled trainer of persons To Be

180
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,800
Tamed so the Buddha teaches those who are

181
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:14,640
trainable it's interesting right um so I find myself when I reflect on this so

182
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:20,760
the Buddha is the unexcelled trainer of persons To Be Tamed first of all we have

183
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:26,400
to um admit that there are parts of us that would probably do well to Be

184
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:33,119
Tamed and um so we can think about how okay this is the the side of the Buddha

185
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,960
that can meet what is unskillful or UNH wholesome in the world and find a way to

186
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,000
kind of put that more on track you know to train it to train it up so that it's

187
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,800
not wandering around and causing problems so one question for us is are

188
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:57,240
we willing to Be Tamed or trained and there's some some room for humility uh

189
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:03,000
it's important to admit that we really are under the sway of greed hatred and

190
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,920
delusion sometimes we go too far and see ourselves as only possessing those qualities but sometimes we also have an

191
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:16,079
idea that we you know that we don't in some way I actually had to kind of

192
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:22,079
explicitly admit early in my practice that I wanted to be trained it's not

193
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:27,319
that I thought I was perfect but somehow the admission mattered like I remember a

194
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:35,119
moment where I decided you know what I really I want to submit myself for training here maybe like in 12 step or

195
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,480
something you have to have that moment where you say yeah this is a problem uh

196
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:46,800
this mind could use a little training you know and we're you know why

197
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,920
is it that sometimes we don't you know why is it that we need to make this admission kind of

198
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:57,040
conscious we're not free because we have ignorance in the mind that's kind of the

199
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,319
root problem and in English the word ignorance suggests something kind of passive like

200
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:09,920
we we just don't know something um but in Buddhism AA is actually an active

201
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:16,040
Turning Away something in our mind doesn't want to see and so we look away

202
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:21,560
and that's actually why it takes effort to train our mind you know why our mind keeps wanting to go back it doesn't

203
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:26,839
really there's a part of it that doesn't really want to wake up um so working

204
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:32,640
with that is part of you know like working with training an animal and

205
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:41,240
maybe it's not only our own effort you know our willful effort so I see this quality

206
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:47,280
of the Buddha also as a practice where we offer ourselves up for training it's

207
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:55,760
not a task for me to do but more like an offering up yeah to the Buddha um yes I

208
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:02,000
I submit myself for training I will follow these instructions because I know that my mind

209
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,119
will benefit from that so that's one side of the teaching then we get to kind

210
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:13,400
of the inspirational side which is uh the term is

211
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:20,520
SATA Manus okay and sat is a teacher satar is

212
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:27,720
the root word and DEA manusana means of deavas and humans gods and humans so the

213
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:34,920
Buddha is the teacher of gods and humans so this is I think um similar to

214
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:40,839
the training but you know the trainer part is like he's kind of you know working with an

215
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:46,560
animal um that need you know that needs to be guided to some kind of good

216
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,599
behavior but then there's the the teaching part the actual imparting of

217
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:57,079
Knowledge and Skills the supporting of what is wholesome in us we're not just

218
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:02,640
like an animal being trained actually we have the capacity to understand the

219
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:09,119
process to learn the principles of the Dharma to be touched in the Heart by the

220
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,839
teachings of the Dharma it's not quite the same way a dog is touched by our

221
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:21,200
training right it's a there's a more elevated side of the Buddhist teaching

222
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:27,520
also so um for us then there can be the inspirational side the practical

223
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:33,240
question are we being intelligent students are we using all of our

224
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:39,000
beautiful amazing capabilities of mind and heart to bring the Dharma into our

225
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,000
lives and let it flower do we listen to the Dharma do we ask questions so that

226
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:52,640
we can understand you know the dog doesn't ask questions about why it's being trained a certain way this or that

227
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:58,920
you know but we're meant to participate and bring in our understanding our engagement or

228
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:04,680
enthusiasm and then put that into practice and use it to to feed um

229
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:09,960
practice I think that's why it's said specifically gods and humans those are

230
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:16,440
in the Buddhist cosmology those are the higher Minds higher forms of mind um

231
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:24,160
ones that can really understand and uh participate in their training so a SAT a

232
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:30,520
teacher more than a trainer is someone who empowers us who grows the good in us

233
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:36,599
for our own benefit so that eventually we can become our own teacher we have

234
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:42,720
the capability gods and humans have the capability to also take on qualities of

235
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:49,760
being teachers and it's said at the first stage of Awakening um in this practice

236
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:55,720
that we become what's called independent in the Dharma so we become able to walk

237
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:02,319
the path ourselves stand our own two feet if you would so

238
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:10,200
that's really a beautiful thing um as a student uh we have a choice about how we

239
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:16,880
navigate how we uh have relationships with teachers and I would suggest that

240
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:24,359
we look for teachers who want us to be strong be smart be beneficial in the

241
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:29,400
world teachers who want us to discover our own inner

242
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:35,560
wealth and teachers who have the qualities that the Buddha named in those

243
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:43,560
who teach the Dharma actually a few months ago gild did one of these five day series on the qualities of a teacher

244
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:49,640
the ud suta there are five of them um at least in one of these lists so I'll just

245
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:54,760
review them briefly but it might be interesting to look back on that week so

246
00:41:54,760 --> 00:42:02,440
a teacher should teach uh step by step in a progressive understanding so that you can move toward greater and greater

247
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:09,480
good greater and greater wholesomeness a teacher should speak uh giving reasons understand helping you

248
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:15,240
understand what you're doing and why a teacher should teach with care

249
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:21,760
with love with concern with tenderness um not with cruelty and so

250
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:27,920
forth and beating you into shape but with care and kindness

251
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:34,079
teachers are teaching not for profit but for the intrinsic goodness of the Dharma

252
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:40,599
wanting to share it with people and also not teaching in a way that aises

253
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:46,000
themselves and disparages others so even if they have a distinct teaching style

254
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,040
they simply teach that as the embodiment of how they teach without claiming that

255
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:57,760
others aren't doing it right or so forth so

256
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:04,680
teaching being a student and finding a teacher finding qualities of the teacher

257
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:10,960
within ourselves this too is part of the awakened mind and The Awakening mind

258
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:19,040
that we have so one upshot maybe of reflecting in this way is to have gratitude for our

259
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:25,000
great Fortune of having encountered the teachings and also amazement maybe at

260
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,680
the Buddha's generosity and compass passion to teach and also to the long

261
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:38,440
line of practitioners and other teachers who have kept this Dharma alive over the

262
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:44,240
centuries so that it comes to us and we can still learn and benefit from it

263
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:51,240
everyone here has seen the benefit of the Dharma in some way and thank goodness that we that it was taught and

264
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:58,559
that we heard it and that we had the opportunity and that we're even having the opportunity to practice it

265
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:07,119
so the amazing teaching of the Buddha is still echoing today 2600 years later and

266
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:16,720
we can embody that through being a sincere and engaged student of our own

267
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:21,839
Humanity letting that flower forth and become most of what we can

268
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:30,319
be so thank you for that for doing that in your own unique special way and for this

269
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:36,520
chance to be together today and tomorrow there's even yet more about the

270
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:40,760
Buddha take care
